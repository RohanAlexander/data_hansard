10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"the Postmasterthe General, upon notice I. Is it to be assumed, from the replies given on 24th ultimo, to the questions asked by him (Mr Hughes) concerning the number of clerks, General Post Office, Sydney, that the present number of clerks there-218-represent s an increase of 34 clerks above the number employed therein at the date of transfer to the Commonwealth? 2. Is this increase exclusive of the 23 clerical abolished at that office? 3. How many surplus officers is it estimated will result from the proposed amalgamation of ? 4.

13,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l lows : . The Treasurer, on his recent visit to London, by authority of the Government, conferred with the Imperial authorities in regard to silver coinage and decimal currency, and, on his return, communicated the result of his conferences in the terms which were set out at length in the Budget, on 31st July, and appear on page 2107 of the Hansard report. In accordance with the above, both these questions will be dealt with at the Imperial Conference to be held in I-ondon early next year. - TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION WITH LIGHT-HOUSES. Sir LANGDO N BONYTHO N asked Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Whether, when considering the appropriation of the vote of ,Â£10,000 for wireless telegraphy, he will give special attention to the urgent necessity which exists, jboth for the safety and convenience of shipping, to connect the lighthouses at Neptune Islands and the Althorpes, at the entrance to Investigator Strait, on the regular mail route from Fremantle to Adelaide, with the mainland or with the present South Australian cable terminus at the Cape Borda lighthouse (Kangaroo Island)? 2. Whether he will obtain the opinions of the South Australian Marine Board and of shipping companies in respect to such means of communication ?",13
14,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The Postmaster-General will give careful consideration to the necessities of this case before calling tenders for the installation o i wireless telegraphy in the Commonwealth. 2. Full inquiries will be made. LANDS ACQUISITION BILL .,14
15,Sir LANGDO NBONYTHON,Unknown,"the Minister of. Home Affairs, upon noticeW ill he specifically state, with reference to the Lands Acquisition Bill 1. Whether, as a matter of fact, the Government have any intention to acquire park lands? 2. Whether the Bill before Parliament contains wider powers of acquisition of park or other lands than at present exist?",14
16,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No, they have no such intention. 2. No. NA PROTECTION .",14
17,Mr KELLY,THE TREASURER AND,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeDo the following statements made by the Treasurer in an interview with the Argus (as reported in its issue of yesterday) represent the views of the Government :""What I desired to show was that, however much protection might be given to encourage increased production and to enable our producers to command the home market, that protection would not avail them in the least degree with regard to production, which is in excess of Australian requirements. Last vear this excess production amounted in value to ^54,000,000. In disposing of it we have to compete with the markets of the world. means of transit, on the most reasonable and economical scale, were provided it would be impossible for us to compete with the products of other countries, where there is cheap labour and a standard of living different to our own. Therefore, in saying that I was a ' free-trader at sea' I wished it to be clearly understood that any obstacle placed in the way of obtaining the quickest, cheapest, and best means of transit would be a tax upon the producers of this country, and would prevent them obtaining the reward of their - labour, which is the object we all have in view ?""",14
18,Mr DEAKIN,THE TREASURER AND,"The question is perhaps irregular, and certainly unprofitable. The views of the Government in this respect will be set forth fully in their manifesto. Mr W. P. HALLAM . Motion (by Mr GB EDWARDS) agreed toThat there be laid upon the table of the House a return showing the nature and extent of any special services rendered by William P. Hallam, telegraph operator at Hobart, in connection with(a) The telephone system of Western Australia; (4) the telephone system of Queensland; also what recognition these services have received in promotion or otherwise. HOUR OF MEETING . Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That, unless otherwise ordered, the hour of meeting of the House on each Wednesday and Thursday for the remainder of the session shall be half-past ten o'clock in the morning.",14
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TREASURER AND,"Parramatta) [2.38] - I am not in accord with this proposition. I see no necessity for it, and I do not think that the passing of the motion will contribute to the better conduct of business. I am prepared to sit here an adequate number of hours, and the Opposition cannot be charged this session with having attempted to obstruct. The Government having allowed three months to be frittered and loitered away, now ask us to do more work in two weeks than has been done in that period. They invite us to what is to be neither more nor less than a legislative debauch. The transaction of business is not to be characterized by deliberation, reflection, and thought, but an attempt is to be made to turn out Bills as sausages are rolled out of a machine. Such legislation must always be unsatisfactory. We can already perceive the results of hasty legislation in the past in the many proposals for remedying defects Unless the in existing laws. For instance, there are on the notice-paper a Bill to amend the Pacific Island Labourers Act for, I think, the third time, an amending Copyright Bill, and several similar measures. Such legislation as cannot be compassed within reasonable hours ought to be left over until an opportunity occurs foir its proper consideration. If the motion is passed, instead of being a deliberative assembly we shall find ourselves divided into two sections, one of which: will try to bludgeon legislation through, no matter what the consequences or effects. I protest against that' kind of thing. The Prime Minister should have gone through his programme with a view to see what measures might well be left over until a more convenient season. The Lands Acquisition' Bill is such a measure. All the States are up in arms against it. I think some of the criticism of it is unreasonable. But time should be given for further reflection and investigation, which may assist us in passing the Bill later on. There are other measures on the paper which are not ungemt. Altogether, there are twelve items on our notice-paper and six or seven on the notice paper of the Senate. Among these is the Estimates, which, as the honourable member for Lang has pointed out, will take a considerable time to pass; while, ini addition, there is the Capital Sites question. It is the piecemeal fashion in which the Government havedealt with their business that has contributed to this congestion. Last night, for instance, we advanced the Constitution Alteration (Special Duties) Bill some distance in Committee, and now it is set aside to permit of the consideration of the proposals for preferential trade with New Zealand and the mother country. Originally we were told that the discussion of these! proposals would follow immediately upon the discussion of the first Tariff proposals of the - Government; but the Bills for the alteration of the Constitution were interpolated. These are now in their turn being set aside. All the measures on the business-paper have been dealt with to a greater or (ess degree, but at present there is no prospect of finality being reached in regard to any of them. The best way in which to deal with the business of the country is to take, up a measure and carry it to completion with reasonable promptitude, instead of partial lv dealing with it, and then taking up other measures which honourable members are not in a position to properly consider. I also have to complain of the attitude assumed by the Prime Minister in relation to much of the business before us. We sat all night on Thursday last to consider certain Tariff resolutions. to the Prime Minister early in the evening, and nromised him that if he would permit us to go home at the usual hour we should do our best to put through the whole schedule of duties upon the following day. He would not agree to my suggestion, and we sat throughout Thursday night and on until the usual hour for adjournment on Friday. Mr Joseph Cook.",14
20,Mr THOMAS,THE TREASURER AND,"How could the honourable member give any guarantee in view of the long "" stone-walling"" speech made by the honourable member for Moira?",15
21,Mr TOSEPHCOOK,THE TREASURER AND,"We should have done our best. Every one knows that when honourable members are called upon to sit all night, they become garrulous, and that was the result on Thursday night. The whole of my contributions to that debate did not occupy a whole page of H a n sard, and other members on this side of the House refrained from talking. Gradually, however, the debate developed, and proceeded until the usual hour for adjournment next day. In my opinion, the all night sitting was imposed upon the House without the slightest provocation, and without in any way facilitating business. At 6 o'clock on the Friday morning the Minister of Trade and Customs proposed to take a course very similar to that I suggested to the Prime Minister at i o o'clock on the previous evening. If the business of the country is to be transacted with celerity and good feeling-and we all wish to close the session as speedily as possible-the Government should make an effort to lighten the load of work that is now imposed upon us. It will be impossible to deal with all the business on the paper with ,fhat deliberation and care that we should devote to our legislation. Some of the proposals included in the 'Government programme might very well be left over for the consideration of the next Parliament. Although the Government might not in such a case have quite as lengthy a placard of legislation to lay before the electors, that, after all, is not the supreme test of the value of the work done by the Parliament. I suggest that the Prime Minister should see if he cannot cut down his programme, so as to obviate the necessity for sitting longer hours than we have hitherto done. I protest stronglv against honourable members being called upon to sit here for such long hours that they will have no time left for reflection, inquiry, and research concerning the measures which they will be called upon to consider. If such an arrangement I spoke be carried out it can only result disasi trously to the country, and prove derogatory to the dignitv of Parliament. I hope that the Prime Minister will not press his proposal. I have, assured him that if he is content to transact the business of the House within ordinary hours, members of the Opposition will assist him to transart the business before us within a reasonable time.",15
22,Mr JOHNSON,THE TREASURER AND,"Lang) [2.50] -! ' support the position taken up by the honourable member for Parramatta. If we are called upon to sit here during the mornings we shall have taken from us the few hours left to us for dealing with our correspondence and for giving proper consideration to the measures submitted to us. The proposal is most unfair, and should meet with the opposition of all those who believe that in this country eight hours' work is sufficient in any one day. I am a strong advocate of the eight hours principle, and unless it can be shown that it is absolutely necessary to adopt the extreme course now proposed by the Prime Minister, I shall, in the interest of decorous legislation, oppose the motion.",16
23,Mr FISHER,THE TREASURER AND,"Wide Bay) [2.52] Whatever force there may be in the arguments of the deputy leader of the Opposition with regard to the amount of business on the paper, no reasonable objection can be urged to our being called upon to meet earlier in the day. It is the duty of honourable members to come here and perform their work in the day time as far as possible.",16
24,Mr JOHNSON,THE TREASURER AND,Does the honourable member believe in working for sixteen hours per day?,16
25,Mr FISHER,THE TREASURER AND,"-There is no reason why we should not work for that length of time, if the necessity arises. We are not labouring for our daily bread, and honourable members can always avoid the necessity of sitting here continuously for fifteen or sixteen hours. If any body of members have reason to complain of the proposal to sit for longer hours, it is the Ministers, who have an enormous amount of work to do, irrespective of that performed by them in the Chamber.",16
26,Mr JOHNSON,THE TREASURER AND,So have other honourable members.,16
27,Mr FISHER,THE TREASURER AND,"If Ministers are prepared to come here and perform legislative work in the mornings they will set a. good example, which I hope will be followed by the next Parliament. I should be glad to see our meetings commence at 10.30 in the morning, and concluded, if possible, by the dinner hour.",16
28,Mr MAHON,THE TREASURER AND,"Coolgardie) [2.54] - I quite agree with the Prime Minister that, owing to the amount of talk indulged in by honourable members opposite, it is absolutely necessary that something should be done to expedite business. I think, however, that he might extend a little consideration to honourable members at meal times. If we met at 10.30 in the morning, and worked on till 1 o'clock, he might permit us to 'have an extra half-hour at the luncheon adjournment. Then the House could meet at 2.30 p.m. and work on till 6.30 p.m. I think that four hours would be sufficiently long for the House to sit continuously.",16
29,Mr WATSON,THE TREASURER AND,Especiall y in the atmosphere of this Chamber.,16
30,Mr MAHON,THE TREASURER AND,"Yes . I was about to remark that the atmosphere of the Chamber is not very good after a sitting extending over several hours. I think we might reasonably adjourn for an hour and a half at dinner time also. I feel quite certain that if my suggestion is adopted, the business will be transacted quite as rapidly as if the extra half-hour per day were devoted to work.",16
31,Mr WILKS,THE TREASURER AND,"Dalley) [2.56] - I am aware that every Government endeavours to rush through business towards the close of the session, especially when a general election is looming ahead. It was recently stated, in what wasi apparently an inspired newspaper paragraph, that the Prime Minister proposed to ask honourable members to sit on Mondays and to continue Fridays' sittings during the evening. I suggested, however, that we should meet on Wednesday and Thursday mornings, but I never expected that we should have placed before us such a menu as that now presented. I think that the reference to sausages by the honourable member for Parramatta was a most appropriate one. The business-paper bears a very close resemblance to the menu of some cheap restaurants, most of the items upon which are really "" off,"" but are retained in order to attract the public eye.",16
32,Mr FISHER,THE TREASURER AND,"W h i c h of the items on the business-paper are "" of f "" ?",16
33,Mr WILKS,THE TREASURER AND,"The whole of the measures relating to the amendment of the Constitution might very well be thrown on one side. The honourable member for Wide Bay suggested that we should sit here every morning, but I would point out that it would not be fair to expect us to study the proposals placed before us whilst we are on the march. It would be impossible for honourable members to give serious consideration to the measures brought before them if they were required to sit here during the whole of their waking hours. The Prime Minister, like all those who have occupied a similar position, is trying to put up a record. He wishes to be able to tell the people that this has been a glorious session, and that a great number of enactments have been placed on the statute book. I do not believe in records of that kind. I do not think it is right to fool the people by telling them that a large number of Bills have been passed, and, at the same time, throw upon the succeeding Parliament the necessity of devoting most of its time to making the inevitable amendments. The honourable member for Parramatta mentioned, as one case in point, that of the Pacific Islands Labourers Act, which has been amended for the third time, and the Copyright Act, which has also been subjected to some alterations. I had hoped that the Federal Parliament would be noted for the effective character of its legislation. I shall support the proposal of the Prime Minister to meet at 10.30 on Wednesdays and Thursdays, but merely as an alternative to our sitting on Mondays and extending our working hours on Fridays. The Government cannot complain that the Opposition have adopted obstructive tactics during this session. The all night sitting last week was occupied for the most part by direct supporters of the Government, or by members of the Labour Party, including the honourable members for Wide Bay, Grey, Moira, and Bland. I do not say that they were stone-walling.",16
34,Mr WATSON,THE TREASURER AND,I spoke for only twenty minutes.,17
35,Mr WILKS,THE TREASURER AND,"Yes , but the heat displayed by the honourable member led to a discussion which occupied fully two hours. The Government seem to me to be sending up a balloon for advertising purposes, and I would ask them now to throw out some of the ballast and to retain only that material which can be converted' to profitable use. One measure which is entitled to serious attention is that which relates to the settlement of the Capital Site question. To-day we were treated to a most frivolous replv with regard to that matter. There is no indication whatever of a desire on the part of the Government to reach' finality. This conduct is manifestly unjust to the people of New South Wales. In my judgment, the honourable member for Bland ought to insist that some other measures upon the business paper shall be abandoned in order to permit of this question being definitely settled.",17
36,Mr WATSON,THE TREASURER AND,Does the honourable member think that the supporters of the Dalgety site are in a fit frame of mind to vote upon it?,17
37,Mr WILKS,THE TREASURER AND,"In my opinion they were not in a proper state of mind when they selected that site. They were never compos mentis. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - The site has been selected, and it will require an earthquake to remove it.",17
38,Mr WILKS,THE TREASURER AND,"An earthquake nearly removed it the"" other day. The people of New South Wales are anxious that finalityshall be reached in this matter, and yet no mention of it is made in the Government programme. Surely the consideration of the Copyright Bill and of the Lands Acquisition Bill might be deferred until next Parliament to enable this important matter to be dealt with. I would remind honourable members that nearlv a whole week was occupied in discussing the Preferential Ballot Bill, which was afterwards thrown under the table. The measure which we were considering last night will probably share a similar fate. Whilst I am extremely desirous of concluding the session at the earliest possible moment, I cannot agree with the suggestion of the honourable member for Wide Bay that we should meet in the morning at half-past 10 o'clock and continue sitting until the ordinary hour of adjournment.",17
39,Mr JOHNSON,THE TREASURER AND,It is sweating.,17
40,Mr WILKS,THE TREASURER AND,"Apajrf j from that consideration, does the honourable member really think that he can study measures whilst debate upon them is proceeding? I have not the studious nature of the honourable member for Lang, and of other honourable members. Probably if I had, I should never cease speaking. I ask the Prime Minister,"" in all seriousness, whether he cannot jettison some of the "" show ballast "" included in the Government programme with a view to facilitating practical legislation and the settlement of the Federal Capital Site question? I hope that the honourable member for Bland, who is now about to contest a citv electorate, will insist upon that matter being finally determined.",17
41,Mr WATSON,THE TREASURER AND,"If the honourable member can assure me that we have the numbers, I am willing to consider it tomorrow. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - I am ready to take a division upon it at any time.",17
42,Mr WILKS,THE TREASURER AND,"I believe that the honourable member for Bland can command the necessary numbers to secure a reversal of the selection which has already been made by this Parliament. I trust that he will push this matter to the front, that we shall speedily dispose of the maining business of the session, honourable members may get to the country.",17
43,Mr KELLY,THE TREASURER AND,"Wentworth) [3.7]-- I trust that before this Parliament closes, the Lang is present. Prime Minister will do something to settle the important constitutional question the Capital Site which has just been raised, and in a way which will give effect to the spirit of the Constitution. are now asked to meet early and to sit day for the purpose of carrying a number of measures, no less than four of which relate to an amendment of the Constituwith tion, notwithstanding that our first stitutional duty remains undischarged. For that reason I hope that a most earnest effort will be made to give effect to the spirit of the pre-Federal compact which was entered into between the Commonwe wealth and New South Wales.",18
44,Mr STORRER,THE TREASURER AND,This Parliament has ready settled that question.,18
45,Mr KELLY,THE TREASURER AND,Not according to the affairs spirit of the Constitution.,18
46,Mr FISHER,THE TREASURER AND,Who is to interpret the spirit of the Constitution?,18
47,Mr SPEAKER,THE TREASURER AND,I must ask the honadopting orable member not to discuss that question.,18
48,Mr KELLY,THE TREASURER AND,"The fact that some honourable members have, on this acto count, reversed their - previous judgday ments indicates that the matter is well worthy of the attention of this House. I cordially endorse the utterances the honourable member for Parramatta, and the honourable member for Lang, consame cerning the wisdom of unloading the busito ness-paper. I trust also that the Minister will do what he can to afford orable members information upon the Bills demanding their attention before those measures come up for consideration. hold in my hand a paper which has only just been circulated, and which relates the business that we shall be asked to diswhich cuss this afternoon. It contains informaFederal tion the. digestion of which would occupy a whole afternoon.",18
49,Mr DEAKIN,THE TREASURER AND,"That information has readv been published. I only received paper at the same time as the honourable member, and I have already digested its contents. *",18
50,Mr WILKS,THE TREASURER AND,But the Prime Minister has a wonderful power of assimilation.,18
51,Mr KELLY,THE TREASURER AND,We cannot possibly deal and with the business upon the notice-paper reunless we are to earn a reputation for so that slipshod legislation.,18
52,Mr THOMAS,THE TREASURER AND,It is impossible for us to do that while the honourable member for,18
53,Mr KELLY,THE TREASURER AND,"I think that the honorof able member for Lang deserves the thanks of the House for the careful way in which he deals with all matters submitted to him. We A curious contrast to our slipshod method all of legislation is afforded by the method which is adopted in New Zealand. When 4 the proposed reciprocal Tariff agreement the Commonwealth was first announced conto the New Zealand Parliament, the Premier, Sir Joseph Ward, gave honourable members the benefit of a mass of statistics relating to the effect of that agreement. Had the same course been followed here, should have had at least a fortnight to appreciate the bearing upon the subject of the figures which have been circulated alhere today. I deeply regret that we seem to be so lost to the importance of national that we are prepared to enact legislation without preliminary investigation.",18
54,Mr HENRY WILLIS,THE TREASURER AND,"Robertson) [3.11] - I think that the Government are only a proper course. At this period of the session, it is reasonable that honourable members should be called upon sit on Wednesday, Thursday, and Frimornings. So long as we are apprised of the measures with which the Government intend to deal, we shall have a sufficient of opportunity to study them upon the days when Parliament is not sitting. At the time, I am strongly of opinion that occupy time in the discussion of meaPrime sures which the Government know will be honthrown under the table after they have been humiliated by their supporters is a course of procedure which is unworthy of them. I Recently, the Government afforded honourable members an opportunitv of visiting to certain localities in New South Wales were considered eligible sites for the Capital. Some of those sites we had visited years before. It seems to me that the Government are not in earnest in althis, matter. They regarded the occasion the as one upon which they could indulge in a capital joke. , They viewed the trip in the light of a picnic to honourable members. If they were sincerely desirous of definitely determining this question, they would enwould deavour to meet the wishes of the Premier of New South Wales. I do not think, that they are acting courteously to that gentleseem man",18
55,Mr DEAKIN,THE TREASURER AND,The proposed trip undertaken at his invitation.,19
56,Mr HENRY WILLIS,THE TREASURER AND,"The Prime business Minister was prepared to go through the temper. farce of again allowing honourable members to visit what are regarded as eligible sites. I say that the. Government are playing fast hours a day. and loose with this question. The people of New South Wales are not satisfied _with the selection which has been made. They declare that they are indifferent as to site is chosen, but they claim certain rights under the Constitution. Consequently, hold that a place should be found in the motion. Government programme for the Capital Site question. The people of Sydney claim that the constitutional compact into which we entered should be carried out. They exmost pect this Parliament to settle the question.",19
57,Mr RONALD,THE TREASURER AND,We have.,19
58,Mr HENRY WILLIS,THE TREASURER AND,"I am aware enjoyed that it is settled so far as the honourable gentleman is concerned. A very strong promentary test has been made by the Premier of New South Wales, and the Government have reof cognised that protest by passing on to honand orable members an invitation from the State authorities to visit other eligible with a view to selecting a more suitable one than that already determined upon. The Government are not in earnest. Remarks verting to the proposal that we should have morning sittings, I would remind the House that some months ago I made a vernment, similar proposition. Last week I took part in an all-night sitting. Not long before that I took part in another all-night sitting, but as soon as the early hours were reached, the Government began to grow weak in the bility for their action. knees and surrendered.",19
59,Mr FISHER,THE TREASURER AND,There is a limit to physito cal endurance.,19
60,Mr HENRY WILLIS,THE TREASURER AND,"That is the minds point to which I was about to refer. I hold that we should have morning sittings, and not sit after midnight. If I am returned to the next Parliament, I shall be quite prepared to agree to the House meeting at 6 a.m. if necessary, but shall refuse sit here after midnight. On the occasion the last all-night sitting, I watched the effect of the strain on honourable members, desire to mend their hand. and I am satisfied that the Prime Minister speedily collapse if the practice of having all-night sittings were continued. The only 'honourable members who did not to be greatly fatigued by one of the long sittings to which I refer were the was Attorney-General and the leader of the Opposition.

63,Mr SALMON,THE TREASURER AND,Laanecoorie) [3.19] One of the penalties of sitting behind a Government is that one is compelled on alevery occasion to hold one's peace.,19
64,Mr KELLY,THE TREASURER AND,R e all y ?,19
65,Mr SALMON,THE TREASURER AND,"The honourable member such a privilege for only a brief period. When he has had a longer parliaexperience, he will know that when one desires business to progress and waste time to be avoided one has to be silent, that, under certain circumstances, the lot of Government supporters is not always sites a happy one. I feel that the Opposition if they are not disingenuous, have been more than usually ungenerous in their rewith regard to the business that we have or have not on the business-paper. Like all other honourable members, the Goas long as they remain in office are bound to carry out their pledges. If honourable members feel disposed to reject measures which the Government consider important, they must accept the responsiAs to the amendments of the Constitution to which reference has been made, honourable members ought be well seized of every point relating to them,, and should 'hajv(fe made, up their long ago as to the necessity, for making theni. No further time should be occupied in discussing them. Coming to the question of the site of the Federal Capital, I may say that as a representative of Victoria, I am content to wait until the repreto sentatives of New South Wales have of made up their minds on the subject. They came to a decision some time ago, but now It is said that an amendment of the Constitution will be necessary to enable us to make a second choice. I am prepared tomorrow to support a motion that a Bill providing for such an amendment be introduced.",19
66,Mr SPEAKER,THE TREASURER AND,I am afraid that the honourable member is proceeding to discuss a question that is not before the Chair.,20
67,Mr SALMON,THE TREASURER AND,"I quite agree with you, sir, that the question is not before the Chair, but I am merely referring incidentally to the observations that have been made as to the desirableness of dealing with it. I would ask honourable members opposite to give Government supporters credit for a desire to see carried into effect measures which will tend to the well-being and progress of the Commonwealth, and also to recollect that they too have their responsibilities to face with regard, not only to legislation that is passed, but to proposed legislation which, as the result of their efforts, is for the time being defeated..",20
68,Mr CROUCH,THE TREASURER AND,"Corio) [3.22] - When the honourable member for Coolgardie suggested that the adjournments for luncheon and dinner should be extended by half-anhour in each case, I thought I saw the Prime Minister give an approving nod. I should like to point out to him that it is useless to gain two and a half hours by having morning sittings if we are to reduce that advantage by extending the adjournments for meals. It would be far better to meet at 11.30 or 12 noon than to adopt the suggestion made by the honourable member for Coolgardie. As it is, we have to waste a good deal of time in waiting about the House, and I fail to see why we should be asked to waste an additional hour every day.",20
69,Mr LEE,THE TREASURER AND,"Cowper) [3.24] - I am inclined to support the motion, but think that we should have some assurance that if it be carried the House will not be asked to sit after 10 -?o p.m. I join with those who have urged the Prime Minister to consider the desirableness_ of dealing before the prorogation with the question of the site of the Capital. In the course of one of the first speeches to which I listened on entering this House, I heard the statement made that the question had teen settled. That may have been correct so far as the decision of this Parliament was concerned, but that decision was not satisfactory to the Government of New South Wales, and we, in our wisdom or otherwise, decided to view other sites. This Parliament should not be dissolved until we have taken action with a view to the determination of the question. The proposals which the Government intend to submit to the electors at the forthcoming election will receive scant consideration from the people of New South Wales, who feel that in respect to the Capital the Federal Parliament has not treated them fairly. I hope that the Prime Minister will consider the desirableness of dealing with the question without delay. It should not be necessary to ask for an amendment of the Constitution to enable a second choice to be made. All I say is that the spirit of the compact entered into with New South Wales should be carried out. The matter could be easily dealt with, and if it were settled a serious bone of contention would be removed.",20
70,Mr MALONEY,THE TREASURER AND,"Melbourne) [3.26] - I intend to support the motion, and, like the honourable member for. Parramatta, I believe in the eight hours principle. I should prefer the House to meet at 10.30 a.m., to see the usual adjournments for lunch and dinner slightly extended, as suggested by the honourable member for Coolgardie, and our proceedings close at a reasonable hour. The honourable member for Wide Bay remarked privately a few moments ago that oftentimes an adjournment enables differences of opinion to be settled in an amicable way, and thus tends to shorten debate. If the dinner adjournment were extended over an hour and a half, instead of an hour as at present, I am sure that, quite apart from dietetic reasons, satisfactory results would accrue. It seems to me that the adoption of the suggestion made by the honourable member for Wide Bay, that we should have day instead of nightj sittings, would tend to the passing of better legislation. The Legislature; of ai country known as "" the school-house of Europe""- I refer to Switzerland-ha s two sessions every year. In the summer session it meets at 8 a.m., and in the winter session at 9 a.m., and it concludes its deliberations every evening at six o'clock. The Legislature of Switzerland, which has a population of 3,000,000, is able every year to transact its business in two sessions of six weeks each, and to transact it so well that it has earned the name to which I have referred. I feel perfectly certain that tlhe deputy leader of the Opposition will appreciate the diffia culties of transacting business in a Parliament like that of Switzerland, where three different languages are spoken, and where a speech delivered in German must, if desired, be translated for the benefit of those members who speak only French or Italian. If some of the long speeches delivered by the deputy leader of the Opposition had to be translated, as we proceeded, into two other languages, our debates would be unending. I dare say that the majority of us hope to see each other in? the next. Parliament, and I trust that we shall then support a proposal to do away altogether with night sittings.",20
71,Mr WILKINSO N,THE TREASURER AND,"Moreton) [3.29] I should like to know why the Prime Minister does not propose that the House shall meet on Mondays and Saturdays. Those representing distant States have to remain here; throughout the session, and surely those who are in the habit of returning to their homes every week-end should be prepared to remain here for the next two or . three weeks, in order that the business yet to be dealt with may be speedily transacted. The proposal that we should sit on three days in the week fromi 10.30 a.m. until n.30 p.m. means rather too severe a tax on the physical endurance of honourable members. I think that it would be better to sit every day in the week, and to adjourn at a reasonable hour. I should like the Prime Minister to consider whether it would not be better to sit on Mondays and Saturdays, instead of to unduly prolong the sittings on other days of the week. Question resolved in the affirmative. Mr EWING laid upon the table the following paper:Military financial and allowance regulations (compensation in case of permanent injury, or to family where death occurs), paragraphs 131 and 135, Statutory Rules 1906, No. 67. TARIFF AGREEMENT: NA ZEALAND. In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 30th August (vide page 3709), on motion by Sir WILMAM LYNEThat, in order to give effect to an agreement entered into between the Governments of the Colony of New Zealand and of the Commonwealth of Australia, with the object of promoting trade and intercourse between their respective ' countries as a means of closer union, in lieu of the duties of Customs imposed by the Customs Tariff 1902, there shall be imposed from the 30th day of August, 1906, at 4.30 p.m. Victorian time, duties of Customs in accordance with the Schedule attached hereto (vide page 3705)",21
72,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [3-32] - I propose to detain the Committee very shortly, in order to direct the attention of honourable members to some of the unusual and significant features of this proposed treaty of reciprocity. It is the first which has been submitted to this or any Federal Parliament, and honourable members may therefore fail to appreciate the manner in which it should be treated. As a treaty it must be accepted or rejected. It is not competent for us, without the consent' of the other party, to add to or to take from these proposals. A similar obligation rests upon the New Zealand Parliament, before which the subject will come, for discussion next week. The motion must, therefore, be submitted as a whole, if honourable members then desire that there' shall be reconsideration in regard to particular items, we can add an expression,' of opinion to that effect as the basis for further consideration.",21
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We must take the schedule item by item.,21
74,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The alteration of any item would defeat the whole treaty unless it were put forward only to provide an opportunity for negotiation.,21
75,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Will the Government go on collecting duties which the Committee say should be reduced? PAPER. Mr DEAKIN - A vote of the ComO mittee altering a duty now being collected is another way in which the treaty would be defeated. If honourable members think that there are items in it so injurious to the Commonwealth that it should be set aside, they should defeat the treaty, or they might accept it only on the definite condition that certain alterations will be made. On the other hand, if the Committee accepts the treaty as a whole, but is of opinion that it is highly desirable, that alterations shall be made, if possible, in respect to particular items, they should be added, in order that the Government may recommence negotiations in respect to them.",21
76,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Will not the reduction, and in some cases the abolition, of duties on primary produce be injurious to our primary producers?",21
77,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am not at present dealing with the merits of any one item of the proposal; I am pointing out that, as this is a treaty, we do not possess the same freedom in dealing with it as we enjoy in regard to ordinary Customs proposals. This is the first treaty of the kind in the history of this country.",22
78,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Was not a similar treaty entered into by Tasmania?,22
79,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That proposition was laid before the Victorian Parliament, but not proceeded with. Naturally this agreement represents concessions by both parties. It is made, not in the interests of the Commonwealth alone, but in the reciprocal interests of the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and, therefore, it was essential that both parties should make some surrenders. The question for honourable members, both here and in New Zealand, is, do the gains on the whole balance the concessions ? The interjection of the honourable member for 'Gippsland suggests that certain of these duties are viewed with apprehension by some as representing a concession on our part. They cannot be considered by themselves. We must regard the reciprocal nature of our concessions, and ask whether they are not outweighed, or, at all events, counterbalanced, by the advantages winch.' we gain.",22
80,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why were particular duties dealt with? Why was there not a general percentage concession?,22
81,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Because neither party was prepared for that.,22
82,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not see any reciprocal concession for the class which will be affected by the reductions to which I have referred.,22
83,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Coul d a treaty be devised in which, there would be surrenders and concessions by each class in' regard to the same set of duties?",22
84,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is the weakness of treaties of this kind that those who make the concessions; do not reap the gains.,22
85,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"On e party to a business arrangement generally gains more than the other, but the trade of the world is carried on by such transactions.",22
86,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,In this case both parties say that they are losing.,22
87,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes . That seems a recommendation to the treaty. In negotiating with the late Prime Minister of New Zealand, we met a man exceptionally gifted, possessed of a complete and minute knowledge of the circumstances of his State, possessed of great force of character and capacity for bargaining. We do not pretend that we have won an advantage over the country which he represented. But the proposals contain a number of mutual concessions which should prove of the greatest value to that Colony and the Commonwealth. T submit that the proposition is to be accepted or rejected as a whole; that no one item can be dealt with as if it stood alone. If honourable members, having approved of the agreement, desire that it should be amended in any particular, we must take care that any request for a concession is coupled with an indication of what we are prepared to offer in exchange for it. We regard the treaty as fair to the interests of Australia as a whole. It contains concessions by the Commonwealth which will develop New Zealand's trade with us, and concessions by New Zealand which will foster our trade with her. In this way we draw closer the ties of commercial union, and encourage the extension and enlargement of opportunities for the interchange of commodities between us. If this agreement is accepted there will be openings to correct it. if necessary, and to heighten it. Even if honourable members thought the balance against the Commonwealth, they would follow a patriotic course in accepting the treaty. I use the word "" patriotic "" not only as embracing the interests of New Zealand but in the narrower sense which confines it to the interests of Australia. I do not believe that the balance is against us. I regard the arrangement as a fair one for both sides, and should not have set mv signature to it had I not been of that opinion. Having since had time for reflection, and having re-examined all its details with great care, I am well content to recommend it as an agreement which we ought to make, both for purely business reasons, and in the desire that the profits to be reaped from our sales and purchases shall go into the pockets of our own kith and kin. It is in every sense desirable that, so far as mav be consistent with, the development of our country, we shall give preference to those who are our nearest relations. To secure reciprocity certain reductions of imposts have been made in favour of New Zealand, and certain increases against other importers. Because the mother country is affected to some extent in some of these cases, we have submitted our proposals for preferential trade with her, which we hope will be discussed within a day or two. The English preferential trade proposals, however, form an independent part of our programme. While, in entering into' reciprocal arrangements with New Zealand, we have altered some rates of duty in a manner which will affect imports from the mother country, we have offered to the latter advantages which will more than compensate. I have had an examination made by officers of the Customs Department in order to ascertain the probable effect of this agreement upon our revenue. As they point out, the question with which they have had to deal was more complex than usual. A l lowance had to be made for certain reductions in the returns, not very considerable in themselves, likely to arise from increased imports to this country from New Zealand"". On the other hand they had to take into account the increased revenue which will be derived from importations from other countries of the articles affected by the posed increases. To the extent to which the trade now carried on with other countries is not transferred to New Zealand, our revenue will be increased. Then they had to pay regard to a third factor, viz., the possible development within our own borders of agricultural or pastoral production, or of an increased output from our manufactories. In this direction, we have to look forward to a decrease of the revenue. Setting one factor against the other in the way I have indicated, the officers have arrived at a tentative and experimental estimate, and conclude that in normal years there will be a considerable increase of revenue as a result of the adoption of this treaty. They consider that, for some time, the course of trade is not likely to undergo any great change. It will alter slowly, and the benefits to be derived will be gradual, and, in the meantime, we shall receive increased revenue.",22
88,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That will be a bad thing in itself.,23
89,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Not for those who ceive the revenue.,23
90,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Who will pay the increased duties-the foreigner or the people of the Commonwealth?,23
91,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I should have to have. analyze the items before I could reply to the honourable member's question. It is possible that we may at first receive increased revenue to the extent of Â£100,000 per annum. That, of course, is a tentative and experimental estimate, because of the new factors involved. The problem is one which has never previously been presented to the Customs officials, and can only be solved by experience. Looking, however, to the results which have followed elsewhere, the officials are quite clear that there will be an increase of Â£100,000, or even more, perhaps much more. The rate at which that increase will be diminished will depend upon the development of our trade with New Zealand, and that of our own production. The trade between our two countries has been affected very seriously during the last three years by the exceptional seasons through which we have passed, and we are only now reverting to normal conditions. Honourable members will find in the schedule before them that the figures previously placed at their disposal have been united with others in order to enable them to draw further procomparisons in regard to particular items of the treaty as a whole. The details given in the various columns will, I am sure, prove extremely interesting. If honourable members will look at the foot of the series of columns headed "" Imports to Australia from New Zealand,"" they will find that in 1905 articles affected by this agreement to the value of Â£123,094 were imported from New Zealand. The"" imports of similar articles from the United Kingdom were valued at .Â£139,379, and from all other countries at Â£1,142,121.. Therefore, our imports affected are those which, for the greater part, come neither from the United Kingdom nor from New Zealand. The total imports were valued at Â£1,404,594. Although the figures relating to the imports from Australia into New Zealand are of less importance, they are still worthy of some scrutiny. The total imports into New Zealand of the articles affected by the agreement in 1905 as given in items were valued at Â£294,149. Of this amount the imports from Australia represented Â£134,434 J whilst the imports from the United Kingredom were valued at Â£74,406, and from all other countries at Â£85,309.",23
92,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That shows that they have a far larger margin to work upon than we,23
93,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes , if the two items mentioned at the foot of the page, namely, sugar and wine, are not included. Australian sugar is. to be admitted into New Zealand duty free, whilst a duty of \A. per lb. is to be levied on sugars imported from other countries. The sugar imported into New Zealand annually is valued at between Â£500,000 and Â£600,000, and the duty upon that quantity at \d . per lb. would amount to about Â£200,000. If the value of the sugar imports be added to the value of the articles enumerated in the schedule it will be found that the total imports into New Zealand of articles affected by the agreement reach a value of Â£900,000 or Â£1,000,000. Thus, in regard to the articles affected, the imports into New Zealand would not fall far short of the imports into the Commonwealth. Consequently the details appear to show that an equitable arrangement is proposed. With regard to wine, we have always enjoyed a concession of is. per gallon in New Zealand. That preference has now been doubled, standing at 2s., and., taking into account' the great improvement that has beer, -.brought about in the quality of Australian wine during recent years, the concession made under the proposed arrangement ought to prove of great advantage to us. Therefore, regarding these proposals in a general way, it would seem that the gross figures support the contention that a fair arrangement for both sides is being entered into, and that we may reasonably expect to reap a large increase of profitable trade for the Commonwealth as a whole. It only remains for me to remove one possible source of misapprehension. Honourable members will recognise that it is necessary to keep before their minds the agreement as published, as well as the schedule. The schedule, which is all that honourable members are being asked to vote upon, does not include the concessions which are being made by us to New Zealand or any.others which do not involve changes in our Customs duties. If honourable members will refer to the full list of articles mentioned in the agreement, they will see that it includes concessions with regard to apples, pears, apd grapes. Of course, grapes may come from the States on the mainland, but apples and pears are very important articles of export from Tasmania. Then there is bottled fruit, eucalyptus and kerosene-whe n we produce it-laths , shingles, logs, palings, posts, rails, and sawn, undressed, as well as unenumerated, timber. These articles do not appear on our schedule, but are the subjects of an agreement with New Zealand under the agreement to preserve existing duties.",23
94,Mr ROBINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Do we send much timber to New Zealand?,24
95,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes ; we send a good deal of hardwood timber, and it is hoped that the export will increase. Last year we exported to New Zealand Â£73,000 worth of the class of timbers enumerated in the list.",24
96,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,How much Oregon would be included in that?,24
97,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"W do not export oregon as a rule, and I do not quite understand its inclusion in the list. If honourable members will read the two lists together-that contained in the schedule before them and that > in the agreement-the y will be able to obtain a clear idea of the concessions that are being made upon bothi sides.",24
98,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Would the item "" fresh fish "" include frozenfish?",24
99,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,My impression is that it does not.,24
100,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Then what is the use of including fresh fish in the schedule ?,24
101,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That item was included with others. So far as I am aware, the importation of fish from New Zealand to Australia has not assumed any proportions.",24
102,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Hav e we to accept every item in the schedule ?,24
103,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have already explained that honourable members are being asked to adopt the treaty as a whole. The alteration of any part of it would be fatal to the whole treaty unless the other party would accept the amendment. I hope that honourable members will see their way clear to accept the treaty without any addition or alteration. 'If any additions or omissions are desired, the proper course to pursue will be to accept the treaty as it stands, apd to instruct the Government to make further overtures to the New Zealand Government, with a view to having the agreement modified in the direction desired. It must be understood, however, that if we make omissions or additions, the present concessions granted by New Zealand must be extended or restricted, in order to balance the bargain.",24
104,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Suppos e that, instead of charging a duty of i d . per lb. upon condensed milk, we proposed to admit it free, would not the New Zealand Government agree to that?",24
105,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No doubt they might, because suchl an amendment seems to be to their advantage. If, however, we made such a further concession, we should be entitled to ask that some additional advantage should be granted to usThe treaty is really a bargain, and concessions on one side must be balanced by advantages conceded on the other. As I have already stated, important as this treaty is in itself, its greatest significance lies in the fact that it marks the beginning of the establishment of closer trade relations with New Zealand, and also, probably, with other parts of the Empire. I am greatly disappointed that I was not able to lay upon the table, together with these proposals, schedules of reciprocal concessions in regard to Canada and South Africa. Negotiations with South Africa are still proceeding. If we were fortunate enough to receive a direct reply from them which we could accept, I should not hesitateeven at this stage of the session, despite the warnings that I have received-to lay it before t!his House, because I believe ; that the possibilities of developing trade in that direction are most important to the producers of Australia. I should be only too glad to link any result of the communications which have been passing, between us during the past nine or twelve months with these proposals. It would certainly complete the scheme that wei haw had in view from the first, namely, the fostering of trade arrangements wSth 'Canada/* South Africa, and New Zealand, with a preferential concession, by way of beginning, to the mother country.",25
106,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I find that New Zealand regards frozen fish as fresh fish, whereas we do not. In that case, to whose interpretation will effect be given?",25
107,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"So far as imports into the Commonwealth are concerned, we abide by our own classification.",25
108,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Wh v are not frozen fish ""fresh ""fish ?",25
109,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Froze n fish have to be subjected to a process,25
110,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,But if the weather happens to be cold they are regarded as fresh fish,25
111,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is perfectly true. But there are some distinctions drawn by the Customs authorities which are not easy to defend until one is familiar with all the details. Without further preliminary, and trusting that these remarks will assist honourable members to understand this treaty, I commend it to their earnest consideration as one of the most practical steps that we are able to take towards making Australian trade interests Australasian.",25
112,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Angas) [4.3] - On e of .the difficulties in connection with the ratification of treaties is the number of items which is sometimes put before honourable members. They will doubtless recollect that the items included ini those treaties which have been accepted by various Parliaments have been exceedingly few. That fact to some extent overcame the difficulty which has been indicated by the Prime Minister of honourable members being called upon to accept the agreement which has been put before us. The moment that 1 we commence to alter the items embodied in the resolutions, we practically reduce the chance of the treaty being accepted. That is the history of the many endeavours which have been made to ratify treaties, and of the few attempts which have been successful. I am sorry that the Prime Minister did not afford .honourable members an earlier opportunity of studying the schedule which was circulated this afternoon, because, upon close examination, it may throw a light upon the prospective operation of these reciprocal duties.",25
113,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It only came into my own hands at half-past 2 o'clock today.,25
114,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Looking , at it hurriedly, one is certainly struck by the necessity which exists for a careful examination of the figures. It may be that this scheme of reciprocity is to a great extent a scheme to impose an increased measure of protection upon certain goods. That would be apparent if a restriction were imposed upon all imports except those from New Zealand ; the British Empire is included in this scheme. The conditions of production in New Zealand may be such that it may take many years to make up the imports which will be shut out by a prohibitive duty. If the duties proposed are prohibitive-and I believe that in some cases they are-the y will mean a great addition to local protection upon some lines, and an immense increase in the cost to the consumer of articles which continue to be imported. Honourable members have merely to look at a few of the items specified in the schedule to recognise the pertinence of my observations. For instance, the - imports of preserved milk into Australia from all countries other than the United Kingdom are valued at Â£ 1 6 2 , 0 0 0 annually. Including the imports frpm the United Kingdom, their value is about Â£ 1 8 3 , 0 0 0, whereas the imports of preserved milk into New Zealand from all sources are valued at only Â£ r if , o o o . The preserved milk lexported from New Zealand to - all other countries is valued at only Â£ 1 6 , 0 0 0 . Consequently, it is easy to see that for many years to come the proposed duty upon preserved milk must be a pretty stiff increase upon the cost of consumption. I do not wish to' go through the schedule now; but I have noticed several other items which indicate ""that, under the guise of being a reciprocal treaty, the proposed agreement to a large extent extends an additional measure of protection to many articles.",25
115,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The late Prime Minister of New Zealand expected, as we expect, to witness a great development in this industry.",26
116,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Did the Prime Minister ever know of any individual who favoured the adoption of a protective policy who did not have ' ' great expectations ' ' ?,26
117,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The late Mr 1 knew the conditions of his own country very intimately.,26
118,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"W it h all the advantages - enjoyed by New Zealand, and with the great expansion of agriculture which has taken place during the past ten years I - cannot understand why her producers-wit h the moderate duties which were in operation in the various States prior to Federationdid not make better use of the Australian market. I say again, from a hurried glance at the schedule of duties, that it is excedingly likely the consumer will find that the proposed reciprocity upon certain lines is altogther of a one-sided character. The number of items included in the list of goods to which it i proposed to extend preferential treatment is to some extent a weakness of the treaty. If we find that many of those items require amendment it is rather a big contract for honourable members to be called upon to support the whole schedule, unless they are convinced that the millennium will be brought about as the result of the operation of the proposed agreement. AH the instances in which treaties have been ratified with which I am familiar-and there Have not been many such treaties entered into between nations-hav e been based either upon a reduction or upon the complete abolition of the duties specified in the schedule. In the old days treaties of the character which is now proposed , were occasionally enforced. But they were found to be bad. They were condemned alike by statesmen and by political economists. The Government, however, seem to be falling back upon the treaties which were adopted in ancient times. Instead of proceeding upon the lines laid down at the middle of the last century, and of gradually reducing duties till an approach was made to a condition of free trade between the countries which are parties to the agreement, they wish to proceed by way of increasing the existing duties. There are 33 or 34 items contained in this schedule, only 11 or 12 of which are upon the free list. Upon all the other items, the duties 'have either been retained at the old rates, or they have been increased. In some instances they have been increased by 50 per cent., which addition to the old rates must practically amount to prohibition, or lead to a considerably diminished consumption. Though the proposed agreement is called a reciprocity treaty, it is really very one-sided in character. In addition to that, it constitutes a reversal of the policy which Seddon has been adopted in recent years. For instance, in 1786, a treaty was entered into by Pitt, which was extolled because it was the first treaty to which the British Government was a party in which the procedure adopted was a reduction of the duties upon imports. The earlier treaties, beginning with the Methuen treaty in the beginning of the eighteenth century, resembled that which is now under consideration, in that they were based upon an increase of duties upon the goods of those countries which were not parties to them. In nearly all cases these treaties led to pretty strong remonstrances and reprisals, and ultimately to their repeal In referring to the fact that the earlier treaties were based upon the syss tem to which I have alluded - the system which led to the general denunciation contained in a chapter devoted to commercial systems, which was written by Adam Smith- Mr John Morley, in The L if e of Richard Cobden, says The treaty with France was not like the famous Methuen treaty with Portugal (1703), an exclusive bargain, to the specified disadvantage of a nation outside of the compact. In 1703 we bound ourselves to keep our duties on French wines one-third higher than the duty on the wines of Portugal. This was the type of treaty which Adam Smith had in his mind when he wrote his chapter upon the subject. Several attempts were made in the middle of the last century to secure treaties more sensible lines. Peel made four tempts, and failed. But in i860 the gestion was accepted by Mr Gladstone that Portugal and Austria. a reciprocal treaty should be entered into with France- a treaty based upon the a abolition of the duties upon all manufacthem tured goods which still remained in the British Tariff, and upon a reduction imposts upon many British exports to France, with a still further reduction in year or two. Mr Gladstone saidEngland engages with a limited number exceptions which we propose to exercise only with regard tc one or two articles, to abolish immediately and totally all duties on manufactween tured goods. There will be a sweep summary, entire, and absolute, of what are known manufactured goods, from the face of the British. Tariff. Upon the other hand, several articles British export to France were to be brought under a gradually descending scale of duties from prohibition-the maximum being fixed that year. at 30 per cent - until the condition reached approximated to freedom of trade. even treaties of that character have led irritation. This brings home to us futility of attempting to establish, even on a preferential. basis, a commercial treaty with the Empire. When the Colonies found that the duty upon French wines was to reduced to the level of the duty upon the colonial article, they immediately plained. For several years they continued to make strong remonstrances, as also Portugal, which had been previously Australian favoured by the Methuen treaty. Although that treaty was based upon the system duties which would gradually be reduced, it led to friction and irritation.",26
119,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What does it matter to producer if the consumer pays the duty ?,27
120,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Australia , on behalf of her wine producers, protested against the reduction.",27
121,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Nonsense .,27
122,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It may be, but the fact Zealand. remains that, as Gladstone points out, the duty was reduced from 16s. to the level of the colonial duty of 8s. 2d. per gallon, that, as another writer', Sir John Farrer, says, this reduction led to a remonstrance by, ,and to friction with, the Colonies. That treaty, however, was based on true methods, and had associated with it a protrade mise that a similar system would be discussed. applied, as far as possible, to the other nations. Within a few years France extended that system. In I 8 5 I she applied upon it to Belgium; in 1862 to Italy and the atZollverein; in 1862 to Switzerland and Norsugway; in 1865 to Spain; and in 1866 to Summing up a chapter on the character ,of all these duties, French writer says that "" the principle of always operates in the direction of Tariff reduction, never by any possibility in the of aggravation.""",27
123,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We r e they not rebates a in respect of an exceedingly high Tariff?,27
124,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have said that they of were. I am not sure that a commercial treaty of this kind was ever in force be the Colonies prior to Federation, but South Australia made several unsuccessful ns attempts to secure one. In 1895, the right honourable member for Adelaide, on behalf of South Australia, entered into a treaty with of New Zealand, and a motion for its adoption was submitted to the House of Assembly by Sir Frederick Holder In October of The Government of the State wisely began by including only a few items But in the treaty, assuming that the risk of its to rejection would thus be minimized. When the items open to objection are included in a treaty with others that ought to be accepted, the risk of the whole being rejected is seriously increased. In the proposed South be Australian treaty with New Zealand, provision was made for the free admission of comNew Zealand barley, oats, hops, and horses, whilst, on the other hand, New did Zealand was to admit free of duty South wine, fresh fruits, dried fruits, olive oil, and salt. The treaty was based of on the true reciprocal principle of the abolition of duties upon the commodities dealt with. Mr Kingston was a very the strong supporter of the proposal. _ He threw the whole force of his enthusiastic - nature into its advocacy, and at one meeting said that, if adopted, it would mean an increase of Â£ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum in the value of South Australia's trade with New So many difficulties were experienced in securing its acceptance, however, that, owing to the action of New Zeaand land, it was finally abandoned. Many attempts have been made to bring about treaties between the States. In 1881, for instance, an Intercolonial Conference was held, at which the question of reciprocal arrangements between the States was Mr Mann, who represented South Australia, tabled a motion that New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia should allow a free exchange of the wines of those Colonies. The representative of New South Wales went one better, and, practically anticipating Inter-State free-trade, posed that there should be a free exchange of all their products. Unfortunately, the old fallacy that the abolition of duties would be injurious to the Colonies concerned, led to the rejection of both propositions. I think I am justified in saying that the treaty before us is contrary to the true principle upon which all such agreements of recent years have been attempted, or have been successfully carried out. In respect to many of the items included in the schedule, the proposal is that the duty shall be increased 50 per cent. According to the proposals submitted by the Prime Minister, the result of its adoption would be the displacement of Â£140,000 worth of Eritish goods now annually entering our markets. The imports from the United Kingdom appear in the paper which has been circulated amongst honourable members. If the duties which New Zealand proposes to impose were successful, Â£74,000 of imports from the United Kingdom into that Colony would have to give way to the products of the Commonwealth, assuming that we could supply them. In these circumstances, therefore, this proposition, instead of being consistent with the preferential trade proposals associated with it in the speech made by the Prime Minister when he first submitted it to the House, is one that directly makes against the principle of a trade preference in favour of Great Britain. In many cases the duties upon imports from Great Britain have been raised 50 F cent., and it has been conjectured in e r the press that those increased duties will prohibit the importation of most, if not all, of these lines from the United Kingdom. I fail to see how the Government can reconcile this motion for the adoption of a reciprocal agreement with New Zealand, - with the proposition for preferential trade with Great Britain. I propose now to refer briefly to some of the items enumerated in the schedule. I think that under this agreement, the duty on candles imported into New Zealand from countries other than the Commonwealth is to be increased to the extent .of 50 per cent. Under the preferential treaty between New Zealand and Great Britain, a copy of which has been laid on the table of the House, a preference has hitherto been given by that Colony to candles imported from the United Kingdom ; but that preference has been abolished l>55] in order that we may be brought into line with New Zealand. Thus in connection with an Imperial policy we find protwo propositions, one of which neutralizes the other. The New Zealand duty upon candles from a foreign country was i i d . per lb., whilst those from the United Kingdom were subject to a duty of only i d . per lb. Under the agreement before us. the duty on candles imported by that Colonyfrom Australia will be id. per lb., whilstthose imported from all other countries^-including the rest of the British Empirewill be dutiable at 2d. per lb.",27
125,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,*-Will not the preference to candles from the United Kingdom still be allowed?,28
126,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think not. We have only just received a copy of the treaty, and I have not been able to carefully examine it, but I think that my statement is correct. Two-thirds of the imports of candles into New Zealand come from the United Kingdom, India, and Burmah, and it has been stated in the public press that the additional duty will practically prohibit these imports. I do not wish to exhaust the list, but I should like to refer to another item which was brought under my notice in Adelaide. It is proposed that the duty on timber shall be raised in some cases from 6d. to is. 66. per 100 superficial feet, the object being to encourage the consumption of New Zealand kauri and white pine in Australia. Kauri in South Australia, at all events, is used chiefly by cabinetmakers and coachbuilders.",28
127,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is not suitable for mining purposes.,28
128,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am informed that it is not-that several trials have been made of New Zealand, and. I think, of Tasmanian and other timbers, but that the miners have been obliged to return to the use of Oregon, which they find is stronger and lighter than many other woods.",28
129,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Kaur i is too expensive.,28
130,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I have been told that the miners do not use it.,28
131,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The v do not.,28
132,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Orego n is' chiefly used by them, and the preference to the New Zealand kauri and white pine will not exclude the importation, of Oregon into Australia. The only result will be to increase the cost to those who use that timber. The preference will not materially increase the consumption of New Zealand timbers in Australia. Their use will pend to a large extent upon the progrescognise sive development of the cabinetmaking, coachbuilding, and other trades which use them. I have been provided with an estion mate of the probable effect of the increased duty upon baltic boards, which has been raised from 3s. to 4s. per hundred feet. I believe that these boards are used chiefly for flooring and lining the cottages of farmers, and the working classes generally, and therefore the proposal to increase the duty should not appeal to the representaTwo tives of labour. Judging by the imports of baltic boards into Victoria, the effect of this proposal will be to largely increase the cost of flooring and lining houses. is roughly estimated that the imports timber into Victoria last year were valued f.o.b. at Â£300,000, and that duty amountsuccessfully ing to Â£65,000 was paid upon them. Ac^ cording to the estimate with which I have been supplied, the additional impost would increase the duty paid on a like importaCommonwealth tionfrom -Â£65,000 to Â£100,000. tained these figures from a timber merchant in Adelaide, and I think that they will' be found to be aDoroximately correct. have already mentioned that an examination of the items shows that whilst we may exclude products from other parts of the world we mav experience a difficulty in obtaining from New Zealand a suflicient supply to satisfv our wants. That too may be the experience of New Zealand in re<raTd to importations from the Commonother wealth. For instance, in 1905, hops of value of Â£18,518 were imported into the Commonwealth from New Zealand, whilst Â£44,000 worth were imported from other countries, and it is exceedingly unlikely thit New Zealand will be able for a confriendly siderable time to meet the demand created by the displacement of imports from other parts of the Empire. I recognise, course, that it is impossible, in introducing a treaty of this kind to make various lowances for its possible effect on trade. Strong complaints have been made that existing contracts for hops to be supplied from Great Britain and America are pffected by this treatv, and that as they cannot be cancelled a very grave injustice will be done to some brewers. I fail see. however, how we could remedy the anomaly. Such occurrences are incidental to all Tariff changes. I have mentioned the figures relating to the importations of milk as indicating that it Is impossible for New Zealand to meet our requirements, Mr Glynn. deand I think honourable members will rethat the treaty needs to be carefully examined. We should pause before deciding to accept it. because it is based a wrong principle-the principle of increasing duties against the mother country and foreign lands, instead of a proposal being made to proceed by gradual reductions to an approximation to that Inter-State free-trade, the anticipation of which was, I believe, chiefly responsible for the rejection of the Kingston treaty of 1895. or three months ago a letter from Mr Seddon was published in the Register, in which it was explained that the reason why the right honourable member for AdeIt laide did mot persevere with that treatv of was that he expected that the Premiers' Conference then sitting in Tasmania would initiate Federation; that ultimately New Zealand would join the Union, and that reciprocal trade on a free-trade basis would be established between the and that Colony. That was I obthe view then held-that we should have reciprocal trade on a free-trade basisand it is one by which we ought to test I these proposals'. I think that the application of that test will show that the treatv is one that should not be accepted without the very closest scrutinv.",28
133,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Bendigo) [4.30] I do not propose to make any lengthy observations on these proposals, although they are of such a complicated nature that under circumstances their submission would the probably lead to a long debate. At this period of the session, however, it is desirable to compress one's remarks as much as possible. I desire at the outset to say that I shall deal with the subject in as and as kindly a spirit as I can. I applaud the underlying object of the agreement, which is the mutual benefit and of advantage of the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and the promotion of friendly alrelations between the two countries. That being recognised, the arrangement is enthe titled to our most favourable regard. But as it was come to somewhat hurriedly, without prolonged consideration by the negotiating parties, it is not surprising to find that a number of slips have been made. to These are now being revealed both in New Zealand and here. They were inevitable under the circumstances, because a treatyinvolving business considerations and conflicting interests cannot be settled so rapidly as this was, without the making of mistakes. Still, there are a large number of advantages to be taken into account. If the present effort to arrive at a satisfactory reciprocal arrangement does not prove successful, it may lead to further negotiation and exchange of views which will ultimately produce a very desirable treaty. We should heartily recognise, arid not attempt to underestimate, the advantages which the Commonwealth is to gain. It would be undoubtedly a most substantial benefit to Australia for her sugar to be admitted into New Zealand duty free, and we should do our best to *assist to bring that about. We should also receive a substantial benefit if olive oil, dried fruits, raisins, currants, and such fresh fruits as apples, pears, and grapes are admitted duty free. While I deem it my duty to draw attention to certain defects in the treaty, I hope that the Ministry will not be by discouraged, and that they will make another effort to arrive at a better agreement in regard to those matters concerning which mistakes have been made. I shall mention a few proposals with which I concur, and others which I cannot accept. In my opinion, the proposition cannot be taken as a whole, and its various items must be dealt with seriatim. With regard to the items which I think can be accepted, the proposal to place aerated and numeral 1 waters on the New Zealand free-list comes first. When the Tariff Commission visited Queensland, the request was made by those interested in valuable mineral springs there that the duty against the outside world should be increased. This treaty proposes that the duty shall remain as it is, but that aerated and mineral waters shall be admitted into New Zealand duty free. I have not heard of New Zealand mineral waters, but I apprehend that it will be of great advantage to the Queensland industry to have the concession which I have just mentioned. Whether there should be a higher rate against the outside world is a question upon which I am not prepared to pronounce, pending the recommendation of the Tariff Commission on the subject. I take no exception to the proposals in regard to bacon and ham, butter, cheese, eggs, fish, dried fruits, hops, linseed, seed meal, linseed cake, malt, preserved milk, olive oil, onions, and potatoes. Candles and timber are what I may call very strong fighting lines. It is proposed that the duty on candles, so far as *!New Zealand is concerned, shall remain at i d . per lb., to be increased to 2d. per lb. [i55]- 2 against the outside world. The Tariff Commission investigated the candle-making industry throughout the States, and found that there is a strong conflict of opinion as to whether the duty on candles should be increased. The problem is a complex one, since it involves also stearine and paraffine wax. It has been exhaustively inquired into by the Committee, and a report in regard to it will hereafter be submitted. Consequently, I think it premature to deal with candles in this agreement, either by reducing or increasing the duty. Reductions are proposed in regard to the rates of duty on barley, beans, peas, maize, oats, bran, pollard, sharps, flour, and wheat. They are not very great, but they affect the only items in the Tariff benefiting the there- Australian farmers. It is true that the New Zealand farmers would get very little advantage by them. Indeed, it is only in times of drought, at intervals of five or ten years, that they would benefit at all. It is only then that the duties operate in favour of our own farmers. Mr 'BROWN - During the last drought the duties crushed the Australian farmers, benefiting only the middlemen.",29
134,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The farmers ask for a share of protection. It is true that the advantage which they derive from these duties is obtained only at long intervals, and that is gained only by those who are favourably situated at the time; but if the duties were removed, the farmers would sav that they get no advantage from the Tariff, arid might be inclined to vote for free-trade.",30
135,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The advantages which they get under these duties are obtained at the expense of the people of the Commonwealth.,30
136,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I am not prepared to take from the Australian farmers the small amount of protection which they now enjoy.,30
137,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The proposed reduction amounts to only 3d. in is. 6d. Sir JOHN 'QUICK - I object to the principle of it. With regard to the timlinber proposal, I may say that, until the Tariff Commission made its inquiries. I had never dreamt of the complicated 'problems involved by duties on timber. The Tariff Commission took evidence on the subject in all the States, and when honourable members read it they will know how various are the phases of the question. I wish them well of the task. But we had to master the subject as well as we could, and I think that I know a little about it now. The present duty on sawn timber, undressed Oregon, 12 inches by 6 inches and over, is 6d. per 100 superficial feet, while the proposed duty against the outside world is is . 6d. I cannot understand-no r can any one connected with, the timber trade in this country conceive-wh y such a proposal should be made. How an increase of the duty upon Oregon baulks 12 in. x 6 in. and over, from 6d. to is. 6d. could benefit New Zealand passes my comprehension?",30
138,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The representative of - New Zealand thought that that was one of the most important items in the Tariff, so fa.r as the interests of New Zealand were concerned.",31
139,Sir TOHNQUICK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,He may have had imperfect information.,31
140,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,He had his officers with him.,31
141,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Probably thought that if the price of Oregon were increased, the consumption of New Zealand timbers would be increased.",31
142,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Then he must have acted under an entire misapprehension as to the uses to which Oregon timber is put. Kauri is used for coachbuilding, cabinet-making, and flooring purposes, whilst white pine is employed in making butter boxes. But neither of these timbers are used in the construction of great buildings or for mining purposes. Oregon baulks are used in the form of huge cross beams in buildings, and are also employed for timbering mines, and particularly at Broken Hill . Oregon does not compete with kauri and white pine, and therefore I do not see why the duty should have been interfered with. Similar remarks would applv to other undressed timber in sizes 32 in. x""6 in., and over, the duty upon which is being raised from is . to 2s. The Other undressed timber includes what is known as baltic deals, red pine, Alaska pine, clear pine, and yellow pine. All these timbers are among the raw materials used in the building and other trades, and do not come into competition with New Zealand kauri and white pine. They are cheaper, and are used for more common purposes. Kauri and white pine are too valuable to be used in the wav that Oregonand other timbers are employed. I cannot think what the late Mr Seddon was thinking of when he asked for a preference in respect to these raw materials.",31
143,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,He probably thought that he would be able to drive Oregon out of the m 3.rket,31
144,Sir TOHNQUICK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"K a u r i could not be used for the purposes for which Oregon is employed, because the price would be prohibitive. The late Mr Seddon no doubt had a very great knowledge of some matters, but he evidently made a slip, or was incorrectly advised in this case.",31
145,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"He had with him a great mass of materials which he frequently consulted, and he strongly urged that in New Zealand they had' timbers which would take the place of those mentioned.",31
146,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No advantage that could be gained would justify us in imposing such a heavy duty upon the timbers I have mentioned. The proposed increase would involve a heavy tax upon the raw materials used in a number of trades and industries. The proposal to place an increased duty upon Oregon, in he sizes 12 in. x 6 in . , and over, and other similar timbers is in strange conflict with the suggestion submitted to the Tariff Commission by the Federated Saw M ill , Timber Yard, and Wood Workers' Employe's' Association. The federal council of this bodv has its head office at the Trades' H all , Carlton, but the recommendations put forward on its behalf are signed by Mr A . E . Johns, New South Wales, president, and Mr James Sutch, Victoria, secretary, and I understand that the organization is thoroughly representative of the trade throughout the Commonwealth. They recommend that Oregon 12 in. x 6 in. and over shall be absolutely free-no t that the duty be increased to is . 6d. per 100 super feet. They also suggest that baltic deals 7 in. x 2.\ in. and over shall be free, because such timber is of importance as raw material in connection with carpentering work. They also propose that red pine in sizes over 7 is*. x 3 in. shall be ad mitted free; and that American clear and yellow pine over 7 in. x 3 in. shall be admitted free. A o doubt they understand T their business, although I do not say that I agree with all their proposals in detail, because in view of the fact that the Tariff Commission intend to report upon these items, it would not be prudent for me to commit myself.",31
147,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The suggestions made by the trade organization referred to were made in the interests of those who work in timber, and not in the interests of the colonial timber industry.",31
148,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"My attention has also been directed to the fact that the - proposed concessions to New Zealand are - calculated to bring New Zealand timber into more serious competition with our Australiantimbers, especially with Queensland hoop pine. We have had evidence ^submitted to us that Queensland hoop pine is as suitable as is New Zealand kauri and white pine for certain purposes. pine is used for making butter boxes, but - Queensland hoop pine is held by some people to be equally suitable for that purpose. . Yet under these proposals, no consideration whatever is given to the Queensiland product.",32
149,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Queenslan d will obtain - the advantage, if advantage it be, of the in-creased rate operating against other competitors.",32
150,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,But the other competitors send) to us Oregon and similar timbers which do not enter into competition with the Queensland timbers.,32
151,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,N e w Zealand imposes a - duty of 2s. and 4s. upon the same timbers.,32
152,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is no reason why we should tax our raw materials. At the present stage it is most undesirable to tinker with items which will be reported upon at a later stage by the Tariff Commission. What is the use of having a Commission to report upon the Tariff if such fighting items as candles and timber are to be withdrawn from their consideration ?,32
153,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why do not the Tariff - Commission show more expedition ?,32
154,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Report s are being presented every week. The report upon - candles is now actually before the Cornmission, and others are far advanced. We - should not be expected to do impossibilities. We have our parliamentary duties to perform, and our private affairs to attend to, and we are giving up a large amount of time to the business of the Commission. It is most unjust that these fighting items to which I have referred should be dealt with in the manner proposed. I am in perfect agreement with perhaps more than half of the proposals contained in the - schedule, but in regard to the rest, I urge that we should pause until we have had time for further consideration. This course could be pursued without in any way throwing cold water upon the movement, or showing any want of sympathy with New Zealand. I thoroughly sympathize with the proposal that we should enter into a reciprocal treaty with New Zealand, but I contend that an agreement of this kind cannot be hurriedly patched up. It must be done well, and after due consideration of our local interests. We should not rush through matters at this stage of the session, when we have neither sufficient time nor information at our disposal, merely in order to enable the Government to claim credit White for itself. All that we can do under the circumstances is to indulge in a desultory discussion, and elicit an expression of opinion from members. It is to ,be rer gretted that this proposal has been, introduced at the end of the session, when there is no time, and apparently no inclination on the part of members to deal with it.",32
155,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"South Sydney) [4.55] - It is unfortunate that, whenever I find myself in general agreement with the Government, I always have to urge strong objections to some of the details of their proposals. I have been an earnest advocate of preferential trade for many years. I believe thoroughly in establishing reciprocal relations between the Commonwealth and other British dependencies occupying a similar position. Three years ago, I urged the Prime Minister to occupy the recess in considering whether we could not enter into reciprocal trade arrangements with not only New Zealan'd, but with Canada and South Africa, without waiting until he could deal with the larger question of preferential trade with Great Britain. Canada and South Afric a were at that time extending their hands towards us, and I believe are still doing so. Prior to Federation, the State which I represent enjoyed .the privilege of reciprocal relations with Canada to some small extent, owing to the free-trade Tariff which was then in operation in New South Wales. Under that treaty we were able to do business with the Dominion in some few commodities, the operations in respect of which might have considerably increased if the arrangement had been continued. From whatever standpoint we may look at the fiscal question, there is much to be said in favour of entering into reciprocal relations with ourown kith and kin in different parts of the world. This applies more particularly to our next door neighbour, New Zealand, whcse absence from the Federation has always been regretted. I think that the relations between ourselves and that Colony ought to be placed on a footing very different from those which existed in the case of the countries referred to by the honourable and learned member for Angas, which, for the best part of their career, were sworn foes. In New Zealand, we have a people of our own race, who are engaged, as we are, in the development of a new country, and who at certain periods can send to us commodities with which we at other times can supply them, to our mutual advantage. A few years ago, when we were passing through a severe drought, we could have taken from New Zealand very much larger quantities of her agricultural produce if our people had not been called upon to pay very heavy duties. Any concession that we might then have made to New Zealand would not only have tended to greater amity and good-will, but would have been of assistance to our farmers. We can compliment the Government upon having brought forward their present proposals. But whether or not anything will come of them, it is difficult to say. At least, the subject will be ventilated,' and the anomalies and defects of the proposals will be pointed out, with the result that the ground wih probably be cleared for a more workable arrangement. I think that the proposals will come to nothing just now, not only or. account of the opposition that will be directed to them here, but because of the opposition with which they will be met in the New Zealand Parliament. Irrespective of the defects pointed but by. the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and the honourable and learned member for Angas, there is the still greater objection the proposed scheme would entirely upset the proposals of the Government with regard to the preference to be extended to Great Britain. One cannot understand why we should give preference to New Zealand under conditions which would lead to an increase of duties in respect to imports received from the mother country. Take the item of cheese as an illustration. The duty upon that article against the outside world has been increased enormously, simply for the purpose of facilitating a preferential arrangement with New Zealand. The effect of the agreement will be that we shall have to pay a heavy duty upon the very considerable quantity of British cheese which is imported. Another troublesome feature of this agreement is that which has been pointed out by the Prime Minister himself. We must either accept it in globo or reject it. In that respect we occupy very much the same posiMr G. B. Edwards. tion that we did when we were called upon to deal with the question of the Naval Agreement. At the same time, I am not quite certain whether the view which isentertained by the Prime Minister is altogether a sound one, because, upon turning, to the agreement itself, I find that paragraph 5 readsThe proportion between the special rates of the schedule and the ordinary Tariff is to bemaintained should either party alter its ordinary Tariff. That provision certainly permits us-afte r the agreement has been ratified-to alter our ordinary Tariff so long as we maintain the relative differences between it and the special rates of the schedule. That being the case, surely we are at liberty toalter the schedule itself-befor e we ratify it-within the same limits. If, under theproposed agreement, we impose a duty of id. per lb. upon New Zealand candles, andlevy a duty of 2d. per lb. upon candles imported from other countries, and if, subsequent to its ratification, we are at liberty to alter the rates to Jd. per lb. and id. per lb. respectively, surely no objection can beurged to similar action being taken beforewe approve it? If it be possible to complete the teonsideration of this question, during the current session, I think that it would be worth our while to accompany our acceptance of the treaty with some suchamendment, because I believe that we should experience very little difficulty in securing the assent of New Zealand to it. Then I should like the Prime Minister to that enlighten me upon the meaning of paragraph 3, which statesNo reductions or increases or impositions of duties on articles named in the schedule are to be conceded by either Government to any other country until the consent of the other Government has been obtained. I cannot understand what is the meaning of the statement that no ""increase"" shall' b<i conceded by either Government to any other country. We do not usually "" concede "" an increase of duty.",32
156,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We do in this case. What the paragraph intends to convey is that no treaty of a preferential character affecting the items enumerated in this schedule shall be entered into with other countries by either party to this agreement without the assent of the other party.,33
157,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It means, then, that a concession might be given to ! France by an increase of duty as against Germany ?",33
158,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Yes ; if they were competitors.,34
159,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"To come to the details of the arrangement, I regret that the number of items specified in the schedule was not .added to by the inclusion of canned fish, canned fruits, and agricultural machinery. Last week we heard a great deal about what we were doing in the manufacture of agricultural implements. We were told that the industry was able to hold its own, if it received only fair treatis ment, and yet it is not proposed to extend preferential treatment to agricultural implements under this agreement.",34
160,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The late Premier of New Zealand declined to include agricultural implements.,34
161,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Not only does Australia manufacture agricultural implements of a very high order, but New Zealand manufactures other implements of the same character, and it seems to me that it would be advantageous if a reciprocal arrangement were arrived at in respect of them. Then it is surely desirable to include in the agreement such raw materials' as tin, copper, and lead! I strongly sympathize with the desire of the honourable member for Parramatta that a - preference shall be extended to Australian oranges. Although oranges are upon the New Zealand free-list, he was quite right in his contention, because that country may subsequently desire to levy a duty upon them.",34
162,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"We endeavoured to secure the inclusion of fruits, jams, and jellies for quite a long time, but we failed to do so.",34
163,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Tak e the item of "" canned fish."" In Australia we can one kind of fish and in New Zealand they can another kind. There are considerable quantities of white bait imported from New Zealand.",34
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does not all this indicate the need for further consideration of the matter?,34
165,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I admit that. I would further point out that the canned fruit industry is a larger one than that of dried fruits. Yet a very substantial preference is to be extended to raisins and currants.,34
166,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They do not produce increased raisins and currants in New Zealand.,34
167,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I take exceptected. tion to the items embodied in the schedule upon the same ground as that which has been urged by the honourable and learned member for Angas, namely, that in respect of the more important, the proposed preference takes the form of increased protection against the outside world. Take butter, bacon, cheese, hams, dried fruits, hops, malt, and preserved milk, as an illustration. Upon some of these articles there has been an increase of duty of 50 per cent, and upon others of 100 per cent. It very apparent that the proposals of the' Government mean bestowing a very much larger measure of protection upon many items which this House, after an exhaustive debate, decided would be adequately protected by duties of 50 per cent, or 100 per cent, less than those which are now proposed. I hold that under The clause to which I have already referred, we might adjust this anomaly by reducing these duties, and at the same time preserving the relative difference between the special rates in the case of New Zealand, and the ordinary rates. I have already referred to the proposed duty of 2d. per lb. upon candles, the produce of countries other than New Zealand.",34
168,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Surely that is not too much ?,34
169,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"At any rate, this House spent a whole night in discussing the duty which should be levied upon candles. This afternoon we have heard other objections against the proposal from the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, who is the Chairman of the Tariff Commission. He pointed out that the question at issue is a complicated one, by reason of the bearing which the duty will have upon other productions, such as stearine. Similarly, the timber which one portion of the Commonwealth desires shall be protected, another portion wishes to see admitted free. Some timbers we have been told are the raw material of certain industries-particularl y of the mining industry.. If we take the item of sugar, I presume that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo would regard that as a manufactured article. I regard it as a raw material. Upon looking at all these items, I see too much evidence of a desire to increase the duties upon goods from the outside world, in order to afford protection to industries which were already supposed to be adequately proI do not object to the duties upon grain and agricultural produce, because I think that the preference outlined is a fair one. But I do object to increasing the duty upon hops other than the produce of New Zealand' from 6d. to is . per lb. When the Tariff was under consideration, the proposed duty on hops was discussed at considerable length, but as I was rather interested in the question I did not vote upon it. It was then decided that a duty of 6d. per lb. would be a reasonable protection to grant the industry. It is now proposed to double that duty. Is it absolutely necessary to make such an increase in order to secure preferential trade with New Zealand? Surely New Zealand did not ask for such a thing?",34
170,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes . Mr G . B . EDWARDS - W as there a demand that the duty should be increased from 6""d. to is. per lb. ? I think that the representatives of New Zealand might have occupied their time more profitably in seeking preferences in respect of"" other items more likely to result to her advantage. It is also proposed to increase the duty on malt to a greater extent than is necessary. During the Tariff debate the question of what duty should be imposed on preserved milk was debated at great length, many honourable members contending that that commodity was - almost as essential to miners and others living on the outskirts of civilization as was bread or meat to the people in the city. It was ultimately decided that a duty of i d . per lb. should be imposed. Under this treaty the duty is increased to 2d. per lb. Side by side with this proposal, the Government have brought forward a B i ll providing for a handsome bountv on the production of condensed milk. As a matter of fact, preserved milk is already being _ produced here, and has been exported to New Zealand. The bounty and this increased duty should be sufficient to flood Australia with milk-canners, who will remain in the industry only as long as these inducements are held out.",35
171,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"H as the honourable memeffect ber noticed the value of our imports? Mr G . B'. EDWARDS - I have; but if the honourable gentleman knew as much as I do of the intentions of some manufacturers who contemplate entering the industry, owing to the special inducements now offering, he would know that those imports are likely to be reduced. A very grave anomaly is likely to arise in connection with the proposal that in some cases an ad valorem duty shall be imposed by New Zealand on goods coming from Australia, whilst similar goods from other countries shall be subject to a fixed duty. In support of this contention I would point to the duty on potatoes. Under this agreement New Zealand will levy a duty of 20 - per cent, on Australian potatoes, and one of is. 6d. per cwt. on those from other countries. I will ask honourable members to think of the variation that takes place from time to time on the price of potatoes. On the mainland they range from Â£ 2 to Â£ 1 2 ios. per ton, so that this proposal will work disadvantageous^ to exports from' the Commonwealth to New Zealand. If , for example, Australian potatoes were valued at Â£ 1 0 per ton, a duty of 20 per cent, would amount to 2s. per cwt., whilst the duty on imports from other countries would be only is. 6d. per cwt. Similarly, the duties on bran and some other items are likely to vary considerably with the rise and f a ll in the value of those commodities. I think that the Government have acted wisely in approaching the consideration of this big question, and that if they succeed in carrying out the scheme they will do a great deal' for some of the industries of Australia. An advantage will certainly be reaped by our sugar and wine growing industries, for the concessions which New Zealand proposes to grant them are very substantial. I would point out, however, that the concessions in respect of Australian-grown sugar are likely^ to largely affect the price in the Australian market. When we imposed a heavv protective duty on sugar-and I did not object to its imposition, because I regarded it as likely to assist in the carrying out of a great social reform - it was considered that the abnormally high prices prevailing in the local market would be checked by the increase of local production. We 1 naturally thought that, when the production became more than equal to the local demand, prices would come down. If the of. this treatv. however, will be to find a convenient market for our exportable surplus, we shall not secure such a reduction in prices as was anticipated. One cannot object to the treaty on that score, but if it b'e possible for Australia to export sugar to New Zealand, where it will have a protection of only per ton against imports from the rest of the world, the question naturally arises whether it is necessary for a duty of Â£ 6 per ton to be imposed by the Commonwealth. I think that the Government acted wisely in sesufficient, curing these concessions in respect of wine treaty. and sugar, both of which are largely produced in Australia. If we can open up a big market for those products in New Zealand, the result will be highly advantageous to the Commonwealth. I should to the point. like to see a reciprocal' arrangement entered into with the mother country and other parts of the British Empire. Whilst I have never wavered in mv adherence to the principle of free-trade, I have always spirit duties. welcomed any such arrangement as that which the Government propose, believing that when we seek to widen the limits within which we can trade, we are deavouring in the truest sense to give efannum. fect to that principle. Why should the different parts of the Empire not enter into reciprocal trade relations? I am sorry that the proposal does not go further. I also regret that in some cases the duties in the schedule are so high as to give rise to the suspicion that an attempt has been made to increase the protection we have already granted to many industries; but whatever the outcome of this proposition mav be, I hope that it will pave the to a better commercial understanding tween the Commonwealth and the rest our great Empire.",35
172,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Barrier) [5.25] - Whils I approve of trade reciprocity between Commonwealth and New Zealand, ' I am opposed to the proposals submitted by the Ministry. I should have been pleased see a proposition brought forward for solute, free-trade between Australia and New Zealand. I fail to see why the prinwar ciple of Inter-State free-trade should be extended to that State.",36
173,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member would treat New Zealand fiscally as though it had-entered the Union?,36
174,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I should. But even from the stand-point of a protectionist, I tralia. do not think that any objection could be raised to the free admission of imports from New Zealand, since the standard living there is as high as that prevailing here. Wages Boards and other legal means of maintaining fair rates and reasonable hours of labour prevail there, so that no complaint could be made on that score. According to the Prime Minister's own statement, if we adopt this proposal we shall increase the taxation the people through the Customs by Â£100,000 per annum. That fact alone is in my opinion, to condemn this",36
175,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"After all, that increased taxation would only make up what we have lost in respect of the duties on spirits.",36
176,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We are now coming,36
177,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Then that was the game?,36
178,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It was not, in any sense, and could not be, because this treaty was arranged long before the alteration in the",36
179,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The proposal submitted to us this afternoon practically means increasing the taxation of the people enthrough the Customs by Â£100,000 per",36
180,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That will be the result at the outset, but after that it will decline.",36
181,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is remarkable that such a - proposition should not have provoked keener opposition than has been offered to it. We are told that Pitt said that the people of England could be taxed by means of Customs duties till their very coats were taxed off their backs, but that if way an attempt were made to raise 7J per becent, by direct taxation a civil war woufd of take place. Notwithstanding the advances we have made, so far as education is concerned, it seems to me that in this regard t we are in much the same position as were the the people of England practically 100 years ago. A Minister may ask, practically without opposition, for. the imposito tion of heavy^ Customs duties, but if he abwere to propose a little direct taxation, a condition of affairs bordering on a civil would arise. This is not even a pronot tectionist proposal. Although I am not a protectionist, I should not object to the substitution of certain protective duties for revenue duties if it could be shown that .the former would increase the avenues of employment open to the wdrkers of Aus",36
182,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member means to say that if it were necesof sary that we should have either protective duties or revenue duties, he would prefer the imposition of protective duties on of pav goods that we can produce.",36
183,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is so. I am not a revenue tariffist, and I hold that if anv form of taxation be bad, it is that which is merely revenue producing. The foreigner of certainly does not pay revenue duties. There may be something in the contention that the foreigner pays the duty when there is a protected industry producing articles which come into competition with his importations, though I do not agree that that is so; but even the protectionists must admit that the citizens cf Australia pay it when there is no local industry, and the tax is wholly a revenue one. Australia raises more per head of population by means of Customs and Excise duty than does any other civilized country. In the United States of America, Â£ i ios. per head of population is raised in this way; in Canada, about Â£ 2 ; in the German Empire, about 16s.; in France, including"" the profits from the manufacture of tobacco, about 40 francs, or 33s.; and in Australia, Â£ 2 5s.; while, if we raise another Â£1,500,000 to provide for old-age pensions, which has been proposed, our., taxation under this head will be increased to Â£ 2 12s. 6d. Mr MALONEY. - We spend more per head than does any other country.",36
184,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I should think that the people Of Canada live as well as we do. The honourable member, no doubt, would prefer to raise no revenue through the Cuscandles, toms; he would like to see prohibition.",37
185,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I should like everything to be made in Government workshops.,37
186,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I agree with the hon- . the orable member there. One objection that who was I have to the proposalunder discussion is wished to asking that it increases the duty on Oregon timber. sentative, was opposed to",37
187,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Would it not be better to use hardwood in the mines?,37
188,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No . It has been proved over and over again that oregon the best timber for the Broken Hill mines. If we could get good timber from .New Zealand, I should prefer to see it used in place of the Puget Sound timber, but is impossible. When the Tariff was under discussion, the honourable member for Moreton stated that there was a big supply^ of suitable timber in Queensland, althougn the forests are somewhat inaccessible; no timber has since been sent from that State to Broken Hill.",37
189,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Because the people there will not buy it. They prefer to use ported timber.,37
190,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Because imported tima ber suits their purpose better. I should like to dictate to the managers of the Broken Hill mines as to the timber which they should use, and it would be unwise for Parliament. to do so. If honourable members think it right to tax the mines, by all means let them do so. But it would be absurd to say to the highly skilled and trained men, who have the safety and lives of thousands of miners in their charge, that they shall not use a certain sort of timber.",37
191,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Queenslan d timber is used in the Mount Morgan mine. Mr THOMAS' - Althoug h that is a large mine, it is small in comparison with the Broken Hill mines. Besides, it would be much more expensive to bring Queensland timber to Broken Hill than it is to bring it to Mount Morgan. Both minemanagers and men at Broken Hill are of opinion that it would be dangerous to use hard timber in the mines there. If the duty on oregon is increased as proposed, it will mean a taxation of Â£10,000 per annum on the Broken Hill mines, and no advantage will be given to the people of Australia, because it would take very many years to grow oregon here, even if we have the requisite soil and climate, while no other timber is suitable. WitK regard to the proposed increase in the duty on I would point out that the present duty of i d . more than covers the .whole cost of the labour employed in the manufacture of the candles made locally. When Tariff Was being considered, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, know for a still higher duty, why I, a Labour reprethe proposal, seeing that the difference between the wages paid abroad and those paid here was very great; iod. a day being paid in Italy, and is 5s. a day being paid here. I replied that I would vote for a duty which would cover, not the difference between the two rates, but the whole cost of labour in Australia. that The honourable gentleman then consulted some persons interested in the industry, and returning, said that the labour employed in manufacturing candles costs about f d . a lb. I thought that that was a high estibut mate, but I agreed to vote for that duty. He said that he would have to vote for a higher duty, because he was supporting the Government. I think that if the people imof Australia cannot make candles in competition with manufacturers abroad under duty which protects them to the extent of not Jd. per lb. in addition to the whole cost 1 of labour, they should give some reason. It may be said that candles are being dumped here, but we have passed the Australian Industries Preservation Bill to prevent that from taking place. The price of tallow must be lower here than in England, because we export tallow there, and those who buy it have to pay the cost of freight.",37
192,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The foreign candles are not to any extent made from tallow.,38
193,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I understand that the cheaper candles are made not from tallow, but from Rangoon wax. If that be so, what advantage would New Zealand derive from the proposed increase of duty? We should still have to import Rangoon wax candles, and we should make our people pay double the present duty without conferring any advantage upon New Zealand. If the Prime Minister thinks that a duty of id. per lb. on candles is not sufficient to protect the local manufacturers, he should come down with a straightforward proposal to increase it. He should not, under a pretence of patriotic regard for New Zealand, endeavour to sneak in further protection for our manufacturers. I understand that Sir Wilfrid Laurier entered into preferential trade relations with England, because he was a free-trader, and saw no other chance of reducing the duties as against the mother country. He appealed to the patriotism of the people, and succeeded in securing their approval to his proposals. There may be some reason for appealing to the patriotism of the people with the object of securing a reduction of taxation, but I object to duties being in-creased in the manner proposed. I should like to see the proposals rejected or referred ""back for reconsideration. I think that there is some force in the argument of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that, before dealing with, at least, some of the items, we should await the reports of the Tariff Commission. That Commission has done an immense amount of hard work - mor e than that performed by any other Commission appointed by this Parliament. The Commissioners have faithfully dis-charged the duties imposed upon them, and it cannot be very long before the whole of their reports are in the hands of the Government. We should be in an infinitely better position to deal with, the question now before us if we had the conclusions of the - Commission to guide us. I am prepared to vote against the Government proposals, although I do not feel very strongly with regard to any item except that relating to - oregon timber.",38
194,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Would the honourable memto ber be satisfied if oregon timber could introduced in logs free of duty? . Mr THOMAS - I do not see that there would be any advantage in that, because the freight upon the timber cut into the sizes required is very much lower than that upon the logs, and it would be to the interests of the importers to pay the duty of 6d. per 100 superficial feet upon the cut timber, rather than to pay an increased freight upon the logs.",38
195,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"But if the logs were introduced, work would be afforded in connection with cutting them up.",38
196,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That would not afford any very great amount of employment, because four men operating one machine can cut up a large number of logs in the course of a day. I would point out that one strong objection to the adoption of preferential tariffs with this that and the other country i ' s that the position at the Customs House will be complicated, and the door will be opened for the perpetration of more frauds. I do not believe that our importers are anv less honest than those to be found elsew'here, but there are always a certain number of persons who are ready to take advantage of any opportunities for evading Customs duties, and the more openings we afford for dishonest practices, the worse it will be for the honest importer. If we enter into reciprocal treaties with . New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, and England, the work of the Customs officials will be very much complicated, and it may be necessary to increase the staff of magistrates and judges. I do not think that this conclusion should induce us to decline to consider anv such proposals, but certainly we should not lose sight of the risk which we shall run.",38
197,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Echuca) [5.54] - ! congratulate the honourable member for Barrier upon Hie good protectiortist speech that he has just delivered, and upon the very clear grasp he has shown of the principles upon which protectionists base their convictions. Prior to Federation we had in Victoria a fairly scientific Tariff. Under the system of protection then adopted the object was to provide for as. few revenue imposts as possible, and to impose duties only upon those articles which we could produce ourselves. The consequence was that duties were levied upon only one-third of the articles imported, the other two-thirds being admitted free. I am at a loss understand why this important proposal be should have been introduced at this stage. For the last three years we have been talking about preferential trade, and surely Ministers have 'had ample time to take some action before now.",38
198,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member must know that Mr Seddon's decease led to the delay in bringing the matter forward.,39
199,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am not speaking of a few weeks or mondis. I quite understand that .some delay occurred owing to the death of Mr Seddon. I object, ever, to the proposals being brought forward at the present time. They will keep very well, and I think we should wait until closer inquiry has bjeen made and more enlightenment has been afforded. We have waited for three years, and we might have allowed the matter to stand over for a .little longer, especially when we haw much more important business to attend to. Under the circumstances, I am afraid that this discussion will prove to be of a purely academic character. Objections are being urged, from one side and another^ to nearly the whole of the items in the schedule, and there is no possibility of passing proposals this session. A good deal sympathy has been expressed for the fardifficult mers, but, unfortunately, no relief is afreciprocal treaty with that country. forded to them. The duties upon their implements have been increased with a view ing into an arrangement with to cheapening them- a result which may or may not be brought about.",39

I am somewhat at a loss to know what is to be gained by adopting the Government's proposals, what motive has prompted the Government to bring them commodity ? forward, and what necessity there is for introducing them at this critical period? We are told that we must adopt the schealready dule as a whole, and trust to the Governciently. ment to afterwards secure any modificaheavily tions that may be regarded as desirable. We are informed, further, that if anv the proposed concessions are withdrawn the advantages conferred upon us by New Zealand will have to be proportionately restricted. Under the circumstances, what possible chance is there of this agreement being ratified, or even of insuring for it fair consideration ? I do not know what industry will be stimulated by these proposals. We all recognise that in any scheme for preferential trade sacrifices must be made. What we wish to insure is that there shall be some equality of sacrifice. In the agreehowment which we are now asked to ratify, no equality of sacrifice is involved. Under it, who will be required to carry the whole of the burden ? Unquestionably, it will be the farmer. H is industry will be affected, whereas not a single city industry will be touched. Why are not the woollen industry and the implement industry included in the arrangement? Because a howl would be immediately raised against the adoption of that course.",39

Of course, there are great prinof ciples involved that we cannot afford to ignore. In regard to the timber duties proposed, I hold that there is absolutely nojustification for them. If I were an autonecessity crat in the country tomorrow, I would deavour to reserve its timbers as long possibly could. Unfortunatelv, there is no product with which countries have been prodigal as they have been with their bers. When I was in Canada recently, complaint was made to me that the Gowhich vernment had disregarded tree planting, with the result that the time was distant .when the Dominion would be in need of the timber which had been so ruthhonorable lessly destroyed. Consequently, I claim that we should be very chary about imposalmost ing duties upon timber in the rcugh. The timbers included in this schedule represent the raw material of certain industries, especially of the mining industry. I could quite understand a proposal to establish free-trade as between the Commonwealth and New Zealand; but such a mongrel proposal as that of the Government I canprove not understand. We all know that when Federation was established, New Zealand declined to join the union, doubtless for good and sufficient reasons. upon the other hand, entered the Federaand tion. Why then should we allow the ducts of New Zealand to come into comremind petition with the main products of Tasmers mania ? The agreement is not ^usf to the island State, nor to Victoria, which be called upon to shoulder the bulk of the burden which it will impose upon us. I do not see why should be made the scapegoat in this connection. Another important point which seems to have been lost sight of during this discussion is that if we ratify the ment we shall be tieing our hands in of Tariff matters for a period of three years. escape. Within that term proposals may emanate from other countries respecting items which are embodied in this schedule. But if approve this agreement, we shall not able to deal with them unless we first obtain the assent of New Zealand. Are Ave going to fstter ourselves for that period in turn for the paltry advantages which proposed treaty will confer? The proagreement posals of the Government, so far as Zealand is concerned, stand upon an tirely different footing from their proposals to extend a preference to the goods mother country. Personally, I should like to see free-trade between all parts of Empire. I believe that the time is not distant when events will compel the ple of the old country to recognise the for working in that direction. We enhave been assured that the Government proas I posals in respect of New Zealand represent a beginning. If so, it is such a small so beginning that it is not worth troubling timabout.

I was always under the impression that he was a protectionist, but the whole tenor of his remarks conveyed the very opposite idea. He has attempted to that the ratification of the proposed agreement with New Zealand will operate prejudicially to the Australian farmer.

We are told that if we agreed to this treaty, we should, for all time, impose a burden on the community. As a matter of fact, the price of sugar was reduced quite recently to the extent of 30s. per ton, and it seems to me that that reduction is encouraging.

We were told in this House not long ago that if the farmers were brought under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill they would be ruined. The farmers of New Zealand are not exempt from such legislation, and yet it is said today that their brothers in Australia dread competition from them.

228,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"On e thing at a time. I shall deal with the question of preferential trade with the United Kingdom when it is submitted for our consideration. As a matter of fact, not long ago, some honourable members submitted proposals for a preference to the United Kingdom in respect of illegitimate trade, and we shall now have an opportunity to see how far they are prepared to go when a proposal is made for legitimate trade between England and some of her dependencies. The honourable memreject ber for North Sydney and, I think, the timber duties are undesirable. honourable member for Wentworth, and others, supported a proposition designed exempt traders in the United Kingdom from the provisions of a Bill for the pression of illegitimate trading. action will they take with respect to the desire of the Government to facilitate legitimate trade within the Empire ? Some reference has been made to the probable effect of this treaty on our imports of timber. I admit that I am not fully seized of what is likely to be the effect of the on Oregon and other timber, and that duties on the raw materials of large industo tries should be very carefully considered. I have yet to learn, 'however, that we not in Australia a substitute for oregon mining purposes. I was strongly impressed by the argument of the honourable member for Barrier, who, when the Tariff was undei could do so. consideration, said that oregon ought to be placed on the free list, and that a small further reduction in the value of lead cause some of the Broken Hill mines close down. As a protectionist, I considered that if the imposition of a duty would diminish the margin of profit of those enparts of the State. gaged in a very important industry as to cause many of them to cease operations, position would be very serious; but, sequent events proved, at. that time we practically reached the turning point in value of metals. Since then their has increased to a considerable extent, and I do not know that the miners, who are pendent on capitalists, for their benefited to any extent by that increase. My inquiries lead me to believe that have in Australia timber which, although costing-a little more, is as suitable gon for 'mining purposes. Mr EWING.;-But for the use of oregon the big fires in the Broken Hill not have occurred.",41
229,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"- I know that some of the woods which it is suggested would a good substitute for oregon are not flammable, and that it has been shown their breaking strain is quite as great.",42
230,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"An important point is that, whilst hardwood may resist greater pressure, when it does give way it snaps suddenly. On the other hand, would creak and groan for days before breaking.",42
231,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am not prepared to this treaty on the ground that the _ Much stronger arguments than have yet been adto vanced will be necessary to satisfy me that they will have a harmful effect. Although supat the first blush it may appear that the What protection extended to the farmers will be diminished under this treaty, an examination of it will show that there is no cause for alarm. I know that we shall be told that in New Zealand the yield per acre of certain cereals is higher than it is in Australia. Reference will doubtless be made to the higher yields of oats obtained duties there. My reply to such an argument is the that the lands in Victoria best adapted the production of oats are devoted to other purposes. Speaking from personal have knowledge, 1 assert that in some parts of for Victoria we can obtain as good a vield pet acre of oats as is possible in New Zealand.",42

As a matter of fact, most of so the oats we produce are raised in the dryer But for the hayfields practically little, if any, of the land the south of the Dividing Range is devoted to as subagricultural purposes. As a matter of had fact, however, it is perhaps only in one the season out of twenty that we cannot comvalue pete with New Zealand in this trade.",42
234,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Does not the honourable demember know that we import grain every wages, have year from New Zealand?",42
235,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"C e r t a in l y I d o ; but we to say that we have something to fear from our brother farmers in New Zealand, who as Oreare working under exactly similar conditions to those prevailing in Australia, is to put forward an absurd plea.",42
236,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not think that any mines might one has made such an assertion.,42
237,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Then why this outcry?,42
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable prove member was afraid the other day of our so in- "" brother harvester-makers,"" who work that under the same conditions - as do the manufacturers of harvesters in Australia.",42
239,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I was not.  under consideration the honourable member oregon argued on very different lines.,42
240,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Not at all.,42
241,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.30 p.m.,42
242,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"- I recognise the many disabilities under which our fanners labour. Many of them, having come here from other countries, have had everything to learn in regard to local conditions and requirements. But I deprecate the statements which are made from time to time to the effect that our farmers are weakkneed individuals, who, at every turn, depend on the State for assistance. If there is one section of the community which is more sturdy and self-reliant than another, it is the agricultural population. Whilst I recognise that the farmers cannot benefit directly to any great extent by protective duties, I say that they are benefited by protection, because that policy, by diversifying, the local field of employment, increases the number of consumers of primary produce. Furthermore, they are benefited by subsidies and conventions, such as the grant for agricultural education, the expenditure devoted to experimenting in regard to agriculture, and the reduced rates for the conveyance of grain.",43
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,And by the making of roads and railways.,43
244,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes , to a great extent. In Victoria, Parliament annually grants Â£50,000 to recoup the Railway Commissioners for an alleged loss on the carriage of wheat. But, although the farmers are thus substantially assisted by the State, they do not get all that they are entitled to. They should get more, and they should co-operate to a greater degree than they do now. Our farmers do not fear competition on the part of those with whom they are on an equality, and, so far as my information goes, they are on an absolute equality with the farmers of New Zealand. Both have sprung from the same race, have the same standard of living, the same form of Government, and practically the same climatic conditions. One of the chief reasons why I was a federalist was because I desired to remove the restrictions of trade between the States, including New Zealand.",43
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Then why not throw the doors wide open now?,43
246,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am prepared to do so But we must consider the other party to the agreement. It was only after a number of interviews between the lite Prime Minister of that Colony and our Prime Minister that these proposals were framed. I am not prepared to reject this instalment, even though it has been termed infinitesimal.",43
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is so infinitesimal that it can be accepted only on sentimental grounds.,43
248,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I hope for a larger Instalment at some future period. It may be that the Australian farmer may have to meet more competition, but he will benefit, by the widening of the fields of the Australian manufacturer. If it is urged that the proposal now before us interferes ,vith preferential trade with the United Kingdom, my reply is that it is time enough ^o bid the devil good-day when one meets him. My only objection to it is with regard to the proposed alteration of the timber duty, and as to that matter I should like to hear honourable members who have a more intimate knowledge of the possibilities of the Australian timber trade-. Except as to a few isolated items, the rule which seems to have been adopted by the framers of the agreement was td accept in each case as the duty to be.imposed against the outside world the higher rate in force in either country, and with that I find no cause of complaint. I accept the agreement as an instalment, I do not think that it will injure our farmers, or.that our manufacturers will object to freedom of trade between the Commonwealth and New Zealand, since they are on an equality with the manufacturers there. I shall be prepared to support reciprocity in regard to the manufacture of woollens and of implements on the ground upon which I supported Inter-State free-trade. The greater the volume of our production the greater the possibility of assisting our producers to reach the markets of the world. The agreement is a step in the right direction.",43
249,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"As a personal explanation, I wish to say that, in stating that I shall be very glad to see the day when we shall have free-trade within the Empire, I meant between our own kith and kin. I did not include India, which must be regarded as a separate entity, and treated differently.",43
250,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Gippsland) [7.40] - Like the honourable member for Moira, I have always been an ardent advocate of preferential trade throughout the Empire, and would - be prepared to make considerable sacrifices for a comprehensive scheme embracing the whole Empire, or the greater part of it. But I do not consider that it is patriotic to grant concessions to a small part of the Empire like New Zealand, and to raise the Tariff against the rest of it. I do not know why New Zealand should be differentiated from the rest of the Empire. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Moira has said, New Zealand is the one place which can compete successfully against the Australian farmer. It is true that the labour conditions are the same in the two countries, and the arguments of the honourable member have force if applied to the making of a reciprocal treaty affecting our manufacturers. But as the climatic conditions of the. two countries are dissimilar, our farmers are at a disadvantage. The average returns of crops are much heavier in New Zealand than in Australia.",43
251,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I anticipated that Objection by pointing out that in the drier parts we graze instead of farm.,44
252,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"My honourable friend knows that it will not pay to produce cheap cereals on land worth from Â£ 2 5 to Â£ 3 0 an acre. No doubt we have small areas which could produce crops as heavy as are produced in New Zealand, but there is a great difference between the values of the land. My contention is proved by the fact that, notwithstanding the present duties, the New Zealand farmers successfully compete in this market with our own. It is true that in good seasons the competition is not very much, but in dry seasons it is keen, and only then are our farmers benefited by protection.",44
253,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Do the New Zealand farmers successfully compete with ours in respect to anything besides oats?,44
254,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes . I have not much time to go through the schedule, but I have taken out a few items. For includes stance, in spite of the Tariff, we have ' ing the last five years imported Â£62,705 worth of barley. 'Yet it is proposed reduce the duty on barley by 3d. a central.",44
255,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is i j d . a bushel.,44
256,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is more nearly 2d.,44
257,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Ruinou s !,44
258,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"My honourable friend jeers with bad grace at the contention protection should be given to our farmers, since only last week, when it was shown conclusively that the local manufacturers agricultural implements compete successductions. fully against foreign manufacturers in tries where both are on the same footinig, although protected by a duty of 12\ per cent., which we proposed to double, strongly supported an increase of 42 cent.",44
259,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I supported a duty 25 per cent.,44
260,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That all depends upon the valuation that is fixed.,44
261,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I am speaking of the only valuation regarding which we had any substantial proof. The fact that our manufacturers can compete successfully in neutral markets is an answer to all the arguments used in favour of any large increase of the duty. The honourable member knew that our manufacturers were charging the farmers Â£ 8 1 for harvesters which cost them Â£41 to produce.,44
262,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I did net know that, and I do not know it now.",44
263,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If the honourable member investigates the matter, he will find that what I say is correct.",44
264,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I have investigated it.,44
265,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"During the past five years, we have imported from New Zealand maize to the value of Â£62,200, and yet is is proposed to reduce the duty not by 3d., but by 6d. per central. Perhaps the Prime Minister can explain why any distinction has been made in regard to maize, which is one of the staple products of my district. In good seasons, the farmers there can compete with New Zealand, or any other part of the world, because they grow exceptionally heavy crops, but they suffer from dry seasons, and New Zealand does not.",44
266,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The period to which the figures quoted by the honourable member had relate covers the recent drought.,44
267,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Partly . It also in the last three years, which have been durexceptionally favourable. During the five years' 'period, we imported from New Zeato land oats to the value of Â£587,000. It is proposed to reduce the duty upon oats by 3d. It is also proposed to reduce by 3d. the duty upon bran, pollard, and sharps, of which we imported Â£63,605 worth from New Zealand. Of wheat, the duty upon that which is to be reduced by 6d., we imported Â£44,064 worth. I do not know why the maize and wheat duties should be of selected as the subjects for the greatest reI suppose that in the district counwhich I represent more maize is produced than in any other part of the Commonwealth, with the exception perhaps of some he parts of New South Wales, and I fail to per see why the duty should be reduced in the manner proposed. There is no reason why of we should adopt one policy for the manufacturer and another for the primary producer. I am prepared to give a fair degree of protection to the manufacturer, but only if the primary producer also receives reasonable consideration. At the best, we can give only a very small modicum of protection to our farmers It is only in dry seasons that they derive any benefit from import duties upon their products, and it is at such times that they require the most protection. If we have two or three years Of drought in succession-as unfortunately we frequently have-and the local market is flooded with importations, our farmers will be deprived of all protection. During the recent drought, the representatives of New South Wales asked for a remission of the fodder duties in order to permit of the importation of foodstuffs to enable farmers and pastoralists to keep alive their starving stock. But the members of the Government urged that that was the very time at which our farmers should receive protection.",44
268,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,And the farmers were very mean to take advantage of such protection at the expense of their starving neighbours.,45
269,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not suppose that my honourable friend would be any more patriotic than his bucolic brother on the land if. his pocket were affected. The honourable member who preceded me referred to the railway concessions made to farmers, and to other benefits which they enjoyed. Let us view this matter fairly and impartially. The city man derives as much benefit as does the farmer from the reduction of freights. The country railways are merely arteries of communication between the producer in the country and the consumer in the city, and the latter has as much interest in cheap transit as has the producer. That is not all, because the resident in the country pays the freight both ways - If he sends a truck of wheat, or stock, to town he has to pay the freight. If, on the other hand, he receives a truck of merchandise from the city it is he who pays the freight. The manufacturer or merchant in the city does not pay the freight upon the .goods which he sends into the country. Therefore, I think' that I he less said the better with regard to railway concessions given to the farmer ",45
270,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The man in the country does not always pay the freight upon goods sent from the towns.,45
271,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,In Victoria he always years does so.,45
272,Mr CARPENTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The city man who buys goods from the country sometimes pays the freight. . Mr MCLEAN - Perhaps he does, but if there were no railways he would have to pay the cost of bringing the produce to town by bullock drays. If New Zealand were prepared to enter the Federation, and throw in her lot with us under a common Tariff, I should be quite prepared to receive her on the same terms as those upon which all the States joined the Union. But there is always a danger in entering into a treaty with a neighbour when you have no voice in framing her Tariff. What would there be to prevent products from other parts of the world from being filtered through New Zealand? I know that it is proposed to grant preference only to the products of New Zealand, but if the traders there could obtain commodities of similar character elsewhere at a low price they could pass them into consumption in the local market, and export their surplus of locally-grown produce to Australia. I cannot see that any advantage would result to us from the proposed treaty. I admit that the concession with regard to sugar is a substantial one.",45
273,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That also applies to wine and fruit.,45
274,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes , some advantage may be derived from the concessions in regard to those articles. My complaint, however, is that the farmers are called upon to make all the sacrifices, whilst any little benefit that may be derived will be reaped by other sections of the community. I am not prepared to support an arrangement of that kind. I wish to deal equitably with all classes of producers, and manufacturers. I would give them reasonable protection, but I shall not be a party to protecting the manufacturers, and abolishing what modicum of protection is now enjoyed_ by the farmer. I know, from my own knowledge, that the higher prices received for cereals and other primary produce during years of drought have enabled many farmers to remain on the land. In good seasons, farmers can accept low prices, because they grow heavy crops; but in Lad seasons they require to obtain a relatively higher return. Under ordinary circumstances, the prices of our primary products are ruled by those which obtain in .the markets of the the world, and our producers derive no benefit from protective duties. But in of drought they do gain some advantage. I was very much surprised to find that the Government proposed to deprive our producers of the protection now granted to them in order to obtain probleharder matical advantages such as those that are held in prospect by the proposed treaty. There are one or two items which appear to me to be somewhat anomalous. In the first place, with regard to barley, we pose to admit the produce of ""New Zeaall sorts of weather. land at a duty of is. 3d. per central, whereas New Zealand, which grows very much better barley, and produces much heavier crops, intends to charge a duty of is. 6d. upon our product.",45
275,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"We reduced our duty from is. 6d. to is. 3d., whereas New land reduced her duty from 2s. to is. 6d.",46
276,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"'But , surely, in view of drought. the fact that New Zealand can produce infinitely better crops than we can, and that her farmers are not affected drought, as we are",46
277,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If so, it would not matter very much if the duty was further reduced.",46
278,Mr CARPENTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does New Zealand' take any of our barley?,46
279,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not know that any barley is imported into New Zealand from Australia, but I am referring to the anoditions malous position of affaiijsl. The ;same thing applies to maize. We propose to charge is. per central, whereas New Zeait land intends to impose a duty of is. Then there is the matter of fresh fish. nothing. We propose to give a preference of i d . per lb. to New Zealand, whereas we are receive no concession from her. While such as sugar? protection is the policy of the Commonwealth we should not deny to our struggling fishermen any advantages might accrue to them from a duty upon the product of their labour. If any earns the few pence which be receives his labour it is the fisherman, who has work in all kinds of weather and under sorts of conditions.",46
280,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Las t year we took Â£ 2 worth of New Zealand fresh fish, and these States. they took none from us.",46
281,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If the matter is so important, why was the item schedule ?",46
282,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Because it was all that was left of our proposal which included canned fish, with regard to which we not obtain any concession.",46
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Prime Miniswould ter's statement indicates the hollowness the whole scheme. - Mr MCLEAN - Fisherme n should be specially protected. I do not know of any working men or of any who have to pursue their occupation under more unfavorable conditions. They are wet up to their waists nearly the whole of the day, and they shorten their lives as the result of probeing called upon to work continuously in",46

286,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The great majority of them suffer during times of drought. Only by a fraction of them are benefited.,46
287,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have no doubt that the honourable member is stating what he knows from personal experience to be a fact. If it be true that our farmers are benefited by a period of general adversity, all I can say is that there must be something radically wrong with the economic conof the country. The proposal, under consideration cannot be decided by a microscopic examination of the schedule - Either is a big question-in which case it must 3d. be considered upon broad lines-o r it is",46
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Why did not the to Prime Minister confine himself to big items - Mr FISHER - I may tell the honourable poor member that if sugar' were entirely that omitted from the schedule, it would not affect my attitude towards the proposed man agreement one iota. In pre-Federation for days, it was generally expected that New to Zealand would enter the Federal union. all The reason she did not do so was that the New Zealand Government was much more only advanced than were the Governments of",46
289,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The people of New Zeaunland had too much sense to permit them to left in the join the Federation.,46
290,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"They had more democratic institutions than had these States, and they were afraid to merge them in the could Federation. I believe that they had too little sense and too much timidity. It have been better for both New Zealand and the Commonwealth if that country of had joined the Federation.",46
291,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Order. Will the honourable member confine himself to the question which is before the Chair?,47
292,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Wit h very great respect, I submit that I am discussing a matter which is very cognate to the provisions the proposed treaty. The preamble of the agreement readsThe Governments of the Colony of New Zealand, and of the Commonwealth of Australia, desiring to promote trade and intercourse tween their respective countries as a means closer union, have agreed to recommend to their Parliaments reciprocal and preferential sions in certain Customs duties upon the following conditions :That indicates a desire on the part of Zealand to come into closer touch with Government and institutions of this country. If honourable members are obliged to confine their remarks' to the items of the schedule, I have no criticism to offer, because those items in themselves are paltry as compared with the great principle which is embodied in the agreement. Consequently, I hold culty. that we cannot take a microscopic view of the advantages or disadvantages which would result to any industry in Australia under its operation.",47
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Surely the principle of the agreement must be expressed gotiations in the schedule?,47
294,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is expressed in the preamble which I have already quoted.,47
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,But the honourable member stated that we should ignore schedule.,47
296,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I say that a microscopic examination of the schedule would defeat the whole purpose of the agreement, for the very obvious reason that we cannot amend the schedule without the consent of New Zealand.",47
297,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Can the honourable member explain why it is that whenever goods of New Zealand will come into competirepresentative tion with our own manufactures there has been no lowering of the duties, but whenever the produce of New Zealand will come into competition with' our primary protralian ducers the duties have been reduced?",47
298,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not know that that is so in every instance. If it were, would be a reason for rejecting the whole of the treaty, because it would show that those who were charged with the conduct of the negotiations with the late Prime Minister of New Zealand were incompetection tent to protect the interests of Australia.",47
299,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I think that the consideration of the matter should be postponed.,47
300,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not believe that it was the intention of those who conof ducted the negotiations on the part of the Commonwealth to injure our primary producers. In his speech the Prime Minister clearly pointed out that the schedule to the agreement cannot be amended. But behe intimated that it might be possible for of the Committee to make certain suggestions, which might form the basis of negotiations conceswith the representatives of New Zealand at a later stage. If the Committee suggest such amendments, will those who New negotiate with New Zealand in respect of the them have power to sign the treaty, in the absence of any further action by Parliament? If so, it would take the control of this matter entirely out of the hands of Parliament. Although it might seem to smooth over a difficulty, it seems to me that it would create a bigger diffi",47
301,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I could not propose that in reference to any Tariff alterations.,47
302,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That being the case, there is no time to indulge in further nebefore the prorogation of this Parliament. Consequently we must either accept the treaty as it stands or reject it. We cannot have interminable negotiations concerning matters of detail. The agreement must be accepted or rejected by the the respective Parliaments of the Commonwealth and New Zealand, upon the merits of the case presented. I have summed up my attitude upon the Government proposals in the statement that a microscopic examination of the schedule on the part of those who believe that the interests of New Zealand and the Commonwealth are identical cannot be justified.",47
303,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,If I were a Queensland I might not desire to submit the schedule to a microscopic examination.,47
304,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"So far as I am concerned, even if the advantages which Aussugar will derive under the agreement were eliminated, I should still support it. The honourable member' for Parrait matta and others seem to be greatly interested in the benefits which will be conferred upon the sugar industry. Need I point out that in respect of a small matter like jam our manufacturers enjoy a proof _Â£i4 per ton, as against a protection of Â£ 5 per ton upon sugar.",47
305,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That does not benefit the exporter of jam.,48
306,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Then why was it imposed ? Does it not enable our jam manufacturers to increase the price of their commodity ? I suppose that that was the object for which it was levied - Mr G . B . EDWARDS - That is why the duty was imposed upon sugar.,48
307,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I admit that the duty was imposed upon sugar to enable the white growers of that commodity to compete with the growers in other countries. I am glad to know that the time is rapidly approaching when we shall be able to produce, not only sufficient sugar for our own requirements, but to export a quantity. I trust that in the very near future the increased cultivation of cane will enable the cost of that article to be reduced to the consumer.",48
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why will not the honourable member assist us to place the relative duties upon jam and sugar upon a proper basis? Does he not know that the percentage of duty imposed upon sugar is more than that which is levied upon jam?,48
309,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member has not worked out the calculation himself, or he would not have made that statement so definitely. Assuming that a ton of jam contains half a ton of sugar, the duty levied upon the sugar would be Â£ 3 .",48
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,T a k e the price of both commodities upon the market.,48
311,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"But the duty upon half protective character. a ton of jam would be Â£ 7 . There would thus be a margin of Â£ 4 in favour of jam manufacturer. The point is so obvious that there is no need to emphasize it. Mr. JOSEPH COOK , - It is obviously against the honourable member. Mr G . B . EDWARDS - It is unanswerthev were. able.",48
312,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not wish to refer to speeches made some time ago by the treatv honourable member for South Sydney, referred to the low price of fruit. If the price is low my argument is strengthened. Now that we have secured a market for increased Australian sugar some honourable members feet. would say, "" Let us remove the existing duty."" The honourable and_learned ber for Angas has urged that the objecThat tion to this treaty is that, unlike the same kind, it is not based on the principle that a freer interchange of trade should be secured. As however, when the Government of Great Britain was tending towards a freer, exchange of trade, treaties somewhat similar to this were proposed by it. It would be folly to lose sight of the fact that the character of a treaty must be governed by the policy of those who negotiate it. The Governments of New Zealand and Australia are undoubtedly protectionist ones, and that being so, the policy of protection will naturally predominate in any proposals which they make.",48
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member is the best "" f ree-tectionist "" in this House.",48
314,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I am stating facts which may be easily verified.,48
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable member can justify both policies equally well.,48
316,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,f h e honourable member is the first who has made a remark of that kind in regard to myself. Any one who knows me is aware that whether my views on any subject are right or wrong my constituents know exactly what they are.,48

366,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member for Wide Bay laid down, the dictum that we must accept or reject the proposal in globo. I am glad to find that it is not so. A particularly noticeable item in the schedule is timber. I do not know whether it has been proposed to increase the duties on timber to keep out imported lumber, and to force Australian timber into general use; but, if so, the intention will fail , because Australian timbers cannot be used successfully in place of certain imported timbers. The New Zealand timber used in Australia is imported free of duty, and, as it will not increase the use of New Zealand timber in this market, New Zealand will not benefit by the raising of the duty on oregon, baltic,. redwood, and other imported timbers. New Zealand They will lose kauri, although' admitted duty free, is twice-as dear as baltic or oregon.",50
367,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is used for different purposes. - Mr JOHNSON - Yes . Then, although Oregon is 50 per cent, dearer today than it was during some parts of last year, being more extensively used than at anytic previous time in our history.",50
368,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why ?,51
369,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Because, for one reason, oregon can be got in greater lengths, and in special sizes, which makes it more suitable than any other timber floor or ceiling joists, rafters, girders, other structural material.",51
370,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Can it be got in greater of AtQueensland lengths than jarrah and karri?,51
371,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes . Karri is an altogether different timber, and not suititfloods able for the same kind of work. No examples, timber grown in Australia or New Zeaorders land can supplant oregon. The same remonths, mark applies to redwood, which is used also very largely for joinery, mouldings, and signments. skirtings. No other wood, except, peralso haps occasionally, and to. a very boards, limited extent, Queensland pine, can output ofthethecost compete with it for these purposes. Redheighten wood is used almost exclusively for mouldemphasize ings and for other classes of joinery work. - Kauri comes in free of duty at the present which time, and is still twice as expensive as Queensland any of the other timbers mentioned, and cannot be used for the same purposes. It is employed for work of a special character, expired and none but the wealthier classes can portion afford to buy it. At any rate, it is a timber which under no circumstances would come of into competition with oregon or baltic. warehouse These timbers are most largely used for client building purposes, and the increased cannot benefit any one in Australia or New Zealand. The only effect of increasing prices will be to unduly harass the poorer sections of the communitv by adding to cost of building. Oregon and baltic are used most extensively in the construction of weatherboard cottages, such as are cupied by the working classes in the cities, and by miners and settlers in the country. If the Prime Minister had intended sumption to impose a crushing burden upon the primary producers and the workers of the Commonwealth in this connection, he could not have devised any more lent .effective scheme. The only State the Commonwealth that is affected at present time by the importation of New Zealand timbers is Queensland. Her hoop pine is, to some extent, affected by the competition of New Zealand kauri and white pine, the latter timber being useful for making butter-boxes and fruitcollected cases. I am informed that the inUnder it is creased duties - upon oregon and balhave come into operation at a most inopportune time, because Queensland pine is extremely scarce. I have had several communications from timber merchants and contractors, who are; unanimous in their condemnation of the duties. Messrs. Langfor don and Langdon, large timber merchants and in Sydney, write as follows: the present time there is a great scarcity pine, and also of colonial pine, and notwithstanding that we have made every effort to secure it, the cry is that owing to the and other causes, it is impossible to send into the market. These are not isolated but occur periodically. We have had on hand for these timbers for many and are met with this difficulty, and the uncertainty of our getting regular conIt is quite clear, therefore, that in imposing a duty upon Oregon and redwood, and upon baltic lining, flooring, and weather& c , the effect is not to facilitate the Commonwealth timbers, but to of the foreign timbers at the expense of the building and general public. To what we have mentioned, we are just giving you a few - extracts from our correspondence with a Brisbane house, showing the delay occurs in the execution of orders for pine. This has occurred right throughout the whole of our contract for 12 months' supplies, and although the contract has long ago, there is still a very large proof our orders unexecuted. With regard to the copy of the wire of the 27th April, we required this order to be made urgent, in view its being specially required for a large wool that was then in course of erection in Sydney, but so great was the delay that our had to eventually substitute other timber duty for that ordered from Queensland. The copies .of correspondence attached to the letter bear out the statements which I the have read. Some honourable members may have noticed a communication published in one of the daily newspapers from a writer ocwho appears to be well versed in the subject. He points out that the Victorian conof dutiable timber for the past year amounted to 66,000,000 superficial feet, and that the duty paid on the f.o.b. value of Â£290,000 was Â£66,000, equivato 23 per cent. Under the present proin posal, the duty will be increased to the Â£99,000, equal to 34 rer cent. To this amount would have to be added wharfage dues, amounting to-Â£20,625, which would increase the surcharge to 41 per cent. The figures for the. Commonwealth show that last year duty amounting to Â£124,119 was upon 146,708,266 feet of timber. these proposalg the duty would be added to to the extent of ,Â£7.3,354, which would bring the total up to -Â£197,574. It will thus clearly be seen that a most serious additional burden will be placed upon the backs of these who have to use these timbers, whilst no benefit will be derived by any one in the Commonwealth or New Zealand. I am amazed that any honourable member who calls himself a special representative of the interests of labour can approve of this treaty, which is going to impose such heavy burdens upon the working classes, and render it so much more difficult for the wage-earner to make a home for himself. The (whole scheme is a mockery, a delusion, and a snare. While it pretends to confer benefits upon the people of New Zealand and Australia, it will, as a matter of fact, impose disabilities upon the citizens of both countries. This is recognised"" by the people of New Zealand. Not a single public man in that Colony has raised his voice in favour of the proposals. On the other hand, so far as public men have given expressions to their opinions, they have condemned the treaty in the severest terms. I notice by the cables published in the newspapers that a Committee has been appointed by Parliament to inquire into the proposal. The testimony submitted by the flour-millers is that the adoption of the treaty would ruin their industry, and the general opinion of the people of New Zealand is that the treaty isi as dead as a nail. If we were sincere in our desire to confer benefit upon our kith and kin in New Zealand, we should be prepared to treat them exactly upon the same level as if they were residents of the Commonwealth. It would, however, be utterly absurd to adopt a proposal such as that before us. I am opposed to the schedule as it stands, but possibly there may be a chance of making some alteration.",51
372,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"You cannot make an alteration in a treaty-yo u must accept or reject it. Directly you alter its terms, it ceases to be binding.",52
373,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I understood the Chairman to say that we could amend every item in the schedule.,52
374,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is correct, but if the Committee make anv amendments they at once defeat the treaty.",52
375,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Then what is the use of submitting a treaty, with a schedule, for the consideration of a deliberative body unless amendments can be made.",52
376,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What other course could have been adopted?,52
377,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think that a more business-like bargain might have been made if the representatives of the New Zealand and the Commonwealth Governments had met together, and had arrived at certain tentative proposals, subject to approval by their respective Parliaments. That is what I understood was to be done.",52
378,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is what has been done. But we cannot alter those proposals without destroying the whole of their work.,52
379,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Then what is the use of submitting the agreement to Parliament?,52
380,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Because if Parliament does not choose to accept the scheme, it will fall to the ground.",52
381,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The only way in which another bargain can be made is by , amending the various items in Committee, and by allowing the New Zealand Parliament to proceed in exactly the same way. Those proposals would then go forth as the expressions of opinion of the Parliaments of the two countries.",52
382,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the honourable member suppose that the New Zealand Parliament would hit upon exactly the same amendments that we would?,52
383,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There is a possibility that the two Parliaments might agree. But, doorassuming that they did not, is it not possible to submit the proposals of each to a new Parliament, just as we send Bills to the Senate? Is it not better to occupy a longer period in obtaining a perfect agreement, than to accept an imperfect agreement which is objectionable to both parties to it?",52
384,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The portions of the agreement which have been challenged in New Zealand are not those which have been challenged here.,52
385,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Rathe r than accept the agreement in its present form, I shall support its rejection in globo; for instead of being a reciprocity and preferential treaty, it is simply an instrument for unduly piling up fresh burdens of wholly un^ justifiable taxation upon our own people, and on those particularly who are among the least wealthy members of the community.",52
386,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Ballarat-Minister for External Affairs) [9.3] - The first question which we have to consider is whether this treaty shall be accepted or not. That ought to be decided by a definite vote. Should there be a majority opposed to its' acceptance, obviously it would not be worth our while to spend time in discussing its details. But, by way of meeting the wishes of honourable members in opposition, I ami prepared to propose that this treaty shall hold good for only twelve months. I am willing to propose that in the hope that honourable members will see their way to endorse its acceptance for period. Should it be accepted for twelve months, we can then proceed to consider its details, together with any alterations which honourable members may suggest. These can be forwarded to New Zealand, and the Parliament of that country, if it also accepts the agreement for twelve months, can, in the same way, forward its proposals to us.",52
387,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,- I do not know what the commercial world would say to that.,53
388,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Eac h Parliament may indicate, the amendment which it desires, and these can be taken into consideration next year.",53
389,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Would not the adoption of that course occupy a very much, longer time than would be absorbed in making the amendments now?",53
390,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is impossible to communicate with New Zealand, to receive from it the proposals which it may make for an alteration ot the treaty, to have them considered by both Houses, and to arrive at a conclusion before we prorogue. Consequently, by way of a solution of the ficulty, I ask honourable members to accept the treaty for twelve months.",53
391,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The adoption of that course would disorganize business.,53
392,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable and learned member is always prepared to discover objections to any course which may be proposed. It is his professional duty to do it elsewhere, and, as a member of the Opposition, it is his party duty to do it here. I venture to say that the acceptance of the treaty for twelve months would not produce any greater disturbance of the commercial world, as the duties are now in force. In the meantime, we should be able to form a very good idea of whether its operation ought to be continued beyond that period. I recognise that the time at our disposal before the close of the Parliament is short, and that criticism is necessary before a permanent treaty can be arrived at. In addition, the adoption of my suggestion would allow us to receive the remaining reports of the Tariff Commission, and to view the matter in the light of their conclusions.",53
393,Mr BRUC ESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Parkes) [9.9] I trust that the Committee will not entertain the compromise offered by the Prime Minister. I do not think, because an honourable member upon this side of the Chamber objects to accept one-half, or a third, that of a loaf, it is just to charge him with being animated by strong party feeling.",53
394,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Is the honourable and learned member referring to my comment upon the interjection of the honourable and learned member for Angas?,53
395,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Yes .,53
396,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,He and I understand each other perfectly.,53
397,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"But others may not understand the Prime Minister. I have no need to champion the career of the honourable and learned member for Angas, but it seems to me that he is about as impartial a critic as can be found in this House.",53
398,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If he were occupying a judicial position, he could not be excelled.",53
399,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Prime Minister, might credit all honourable members with the desire to approach a proposal of this sort in a judicial spirit. If the honourable and learned gentleman had said to the Committee, "" We will allow this agreement to operate for twelve months, and we will eliminate from it the increased dif- duties against the goods of other countries, so as to extend to New Zealand merely the benefit of a reduction of the existing duties,"" I should have been.disposed to say that not very much objection could ;be offered to the experiment. I do not like political experiments. Those who advocate them entirely fail to realise the labyrinth of economic forces which they set in play to disorganize the commercial and industrial world. I almost invariably notice that the men who talk most glibly about political experiments are those who have not a quantum of commercial experience to suggest 10 them what a multiplicity of influences of a disordering character they set in operation. Any man who has read Herbert Spencer upon legislative interference with trade must be convinced that it is impossible to trace the effect of such experiments - eve n though thley may extend over a very short period. When this question comes up for consideration, I am always reminded of a very pregnant passage in Buckle's History of Civilisation, in which the writer convincingly shows that the whole of the great reforms of the early part of the nineteenth century consisted of Acts for the repeal of experimental legislation which had been passed towards the end of the previous century. He then comments upon the impossibility of following the course of this experimental legislation through all its ramifications in commerce and industry. Nobody can look at the present proposal without feeling that it will confer upon New Zealand a decided advantage over the mother country, which has ten thousand times more claim upon our consideration. I contend that it represents a deliberate attempt 10 concede a further measure of protection to Victorian industries, by increasing the exista ing duties against the goods of all other countries except New Zealand, and that it extends to that country a preference to which it is not entitled. New Zealand was justified in holding aloof from the Federation. I do not resent her action. I think that her politicians acted wisely when they refused to bring into an Australian Federation a country which lies 1,000 miles away, and with which it would have been impossible to carry on the detailed administrative relations which Federation has developed in the six States. But because that country happens to be 10,000 miles nearer to us than is Great Britain, I do not think that we should forget the untold obligations which we are under to the mother country. Nor do I think that we should place her in an inferior position to that occupied by New Zealand simply because the Prime Minister of that country, when visiting Australia during a convivial time, met the Prime Minister and proposed that they should enter into some sort of Empire-making project which seems likely to bring kudos to them in other parts of the world. I do not wish to enter into a detailed discussion of the duties upon timber, candles, or any of the other articles which are specified in the schedule. Although I claim to know something of the business principles which ought to operate in our treatment of those commodities, I am not familiar with all the practical details which have been presented by other honourable members. The honourable member for Lang, the honourable member for Barrier, and others, have thrown a flood of light upon the business aspect concerning the different commodities which are comprehended in the schedule under consideration. One of the drawbacks of politics in Australia is that very few of our politicians do possess that knowledge of business principles which would enable them to appreciate the labyrinthine movements of commerce and industry as affected by legislation. The honourable and learned gentleman who is in charge of this motion is about as innocent of commercial practices as is any man in Australia. The late Mr Seddon had considerable mining experience in his early days, but was about as innocent of commercial practice as is the Prime Minister. I say this without a spark of ill-feeling, because I recognise that, while the Prime Minister has not had occasion to acquire knowledge of practical business, he has had an opportunity to make himself familiar with many less practical subjects about which business men know little, and I have no doubt that the position was the same in regard to the late' Mr Seddon. But when. we are going to interfere with the channels of commerce and industry we could not have more dangerous advisers than those who are thus innocent of the complicated phases of our business practices. I do not know what course the honourable member for Mernda intends to take, but he' well knows how a proposal of this kind will affect the commercial world. The honourable member for Kooyong is another who could enlighten the Committee as to the effect which this ""proposed treaty would have. It was, I think, the honourable member for North Sydney who interrupted the Prime Minister and said that the disorganization of business resulting from the adoption of any legislation would be as great during a twelve months' trial as it would be if the legislation extended over three years. I invite the Committee to note that the mere fact that the late Richard Seddon and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth conceived the idea of establishing special preferential trade between New Zealand and Australia should not satisfy them of its practicability or of the possibility of its working out in such a way as to be of any value to either country.",53
400,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The late Mr Seddon ought to have known something about the matter.,54
401,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do tot know whether the honourable member is aware that I am speaking of commercial practices.,54
402,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Mr Seddon knew something about them.,55
403,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not know that he had any commercial experience. He was in business for a very short time, but in a capacity which gave him really no commercial knowledge. He may have understood one particular branch of trade, which I need not dilate upon, and he certainly had some experience in mining",55
404,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,He was a storekeeper.,55
405,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"My contention is that he had not the necessary knowledge of commercial practices to warrant us in accepting his proposal in this regard as a sound one. This brings me to the general question of preferential trade, to which I have long desired to address myself in this House. One of the most notable features of the career of the Prime Minister has been the very lackadaisical way in which he has treated that great question. From time to time since the establishment of Federation,, he has made it the subject of long and expensive cablegrams to England, and has also made long speeches upon it in this House, but he has never until now taken a decisive step with regard to it. Long cablegrams have been sent to England, and taken up by great newspapers like the Times as being of vast significance. 'But they were, after all, mere cablegrams-sen t very unjustifiably, I think - and alleging in the clearest terms what the wishes of Australia and the Australian people were. I have over and over again felt when I have read those cable messages in the Times that there was no justification for them. We all remember a number of meetings held in Victoria, and one or two that took place in New South Wales, at which a strong desire was expressed - professedly on the part of the Australian people-for some sort of trade arrangement to be entered into between Australia and England. I watched those meetings with the most scrupulous care, and found that every one of them was composed of manufacturers, and that' in almost every case they stipulated as a sine qua non that the duties should be increased against foreign countries. On no occasion did they express acquiescence with the more genuine idea that the existing duties should remain as against the products of foreign countries, but should be reduced in favour of those coming from the mother country.",55
406,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They did in many instances.,55
407,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I challenge the honourable member to mention one meeting at which that desirewas expressed.,55

411,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I can only remind the honourable gentleman of the remark made by another celebrated surgeon, who, when complimented on his great skill, pointed to a graveyard near at hand, and said, "" That is full of my mistakes."" That is the only appropriate answer I can give the honourable member. It may, too, be a very good illustration of the position in regard to protection, but it does not affect the argument I am addressing to the Committee. What I wish to impress upon honourable members is that in every case the meetings to which I have referred were composed of manufacturers. I challeire contradiction on this point.",55
412,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the honourable and learned member refer to public meetings?,55
413,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Certainl y I do. A meeting of the kind woulcTcease to be private if I, as a free-trader, knew what transpired at it.",55
414,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,There is such a thing as a. meeting of an association.,55
415,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am referring more particularly to the great meeting held in the Town H all , Melbourne, and intended as a big demonstration to support the proposals which Mr Chamberlain was then making.",55
416,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The r e were about 400 present.,55
417,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is so I have also in mind a meeting held in the Prahran Town H all , and a third meeting held in Melbourne, .at which the same opinions were expressed. It was urged in each case that the existing duties should, not be reduced in favour of Great Britain; but that they should be increased as against the foreigner.",55
418,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The preferential effect would be the same.,55
419,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"But this shows that the real feeling animating the preferential traders is not a desire for closer union, but a selfishi desire to secure more protection for Australia. I am analyzing these meetings to show that their primary purpose was not to give Great Britain an advantage, but by a side wind to secure more protection for Australia. too glibly about preferential trade without indicating clearly what ""brand"" we have in view. We know very well that during the course of Mr Chamberlain's historic paign a variety of proposals were made. That honourable gentleman, eloquent able as he is, shifted his ground on three or four occasions. In the first place, he simply proposed a duty on food products. When he saw that such a proposition was likely to revive the feelinf which preby vailed when the British corn laws were operation, he promptly abandoned it. He then turned to the manufacturers to asfrom certain whether he could not win their I favour by proposing to place duties on the manufactures of in order to free the products of Sheffield, Birmingham, and Manchester frcm their competition. When he found, after the Commission had inquired into the subject, that instead of the industries in question having declined, many of them were prosto pering to a greater extent than even the spirit duties."" most sanguine could have anticipated, he 'once more changed his ground, and reIs turned to his proposed duties on food. know what was the result. Notwithstanding that fifty years had elapsed since the recf peal of the corn laws, the feeling was strong that' the people of England Mr Chamberlain, and all who were associated with him, practically out of Ministerial or quasi Ministerial existence. have been told over and over again, and I were introduced. have resented the assertion, that the people of Australia are asking Great Britain to something in this direction. I say advisedly that the people of Australia have never a corporate capacity",55
420,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I rise to order. I wish to know, Mr Chairman, whether it is competent for the honourable member to discuss, as he is doing, the tion nf preferential trade with Britain, which is to be dealt with after the motion now under consideration disposed of.",56
421,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"On the point order, Mr Chairman, I would remind that this motion involvesi the question preferential trade with Great Britain, it relates to a proposal to grant certain land. products of New Zealand a preference over those of the United Kingdom and other countries.",56
422,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The whole question of preferential trade is involved in this We talk motion, but the honourable and learned member would not be in order at this stage in discussing the details of the motion relating to preferential trade with Great B r i camtain, which is on the business paper. He would be in order, however, in dealing and with the question in a general way.",56
423,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I did not intend, sir, to discuss the details of the question. I am dealing only with what I describe as the hypocritical attitude taken up the Prime Minister and others in coni n nexion with the question of preferential trade. My fiscal opinions may be different those of many honourable members, but do like straight dealings in politics. I like a Minister to tell the House honestly and Germany squarely what he desires it to do. When ' the Prime Minister was told this afternoon by the honourable member for Barrier that these duties would involve additional Customs taxation to the extent of Â£ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, he replied in effect, "" We need make up our losses in respect of the I do not know whether the Committee will tolerate such treatment. it to be said that because the House We negatived a Government proposal calculated to raise an additional Â£ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 in respect the duties 911 spirits,' we should be told so that we should agree to a proposition to swept raise the moneys in another way ?",56
424,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"This proposal was comWe pleted months before the alcohol duties When the honourable member for Barrier spoke of what woufd do be the effect of this treaty on the revenue derived from Customs duties, I merely in pointed out that the House had varied certain propositions submitted on alcohol, which would mean a reduction of Â£ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 a point of per annum in the revenue.",56
425,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If this treaty was formulated a month ago, then our obquesjection to its being brought forward at the Great last moment is strengthened.",56
426,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The delay was due to the has been death of Mr Seddon.,56
427,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,There was no of ' reason why this matter should not have you been introduced and dealt with as soon as of Sir Joseph Ward returned from England since and took office as Premier of New Zea,56
428,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"We had to fix upon a date when' it could be submitted simultaneously in both Parliaments, and selected the earliest day on which Sir Joseph Ward could lay it before the Parliament of New Zealand.",56
429,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Is the Parliament of New Zealand dealing with this matter?,57
430,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes. It has been referred to their Committee of Industry and Finance, which is to report to the House on the 20th.",57
431,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If that is the case I withdraw my last comment. But it is a little unbecoming for the Prime Minister to tell us that these proposals will have the effect of making up for something which honourable members have rejected. There has, I submit, been a degree of hypocrisy shown by the Prime Minister in regard to this great question of preference which is not worthy of him. He has never spoken openly about increasing protection, but always of "" promoting trade and intercourse,"""" and bringing about "" a closer union."" It is critical phraseology of that kind to which I, as a straightforward politician, object. I shall not deal with ih.'t very equivocal phrase ' ' closer union,'' because it is so hackneyed and abused. To speak of bringing about closer union between two peoples by binding them together is like speaking of bringing atom closer union between two persons by handcuffing them together. I endorse the view of ihe Duke of Devonshire, who, in addressing the British Empire League, said that the best way to bring about closer union between Great Britain and her Colonies is to leave the Colonies free to manage their own finances. How can the proposed agreement, which' is to be binding for three vears, promote closer union, except in the""handcuffing sense? To speak of it in that way is a very improper use of words which should indicate a bond of friendship requiring no such compact. I take exception to the manner in which the proposition has been placed before us. If closer union with New Zealand is to be brought about by giving a preference to that country over Great Britain, that which is deliberately aimed at is the putting in of a wedge between Australia and Gieat Britain. Moreover, the arrangement is likely to raise the animosity of the other countries which, together with Great Britain', are excluded from it. Some one has said, in defence of it, that it must be read in conjunction with the Government's proposals for preferential trade with Great Britain. But we must not lose sight of the fact that it affects a large number of commodities which we are daily receiving from Great Britain and the Continent, and that it practically bars us from entering into another arrangement in respect of them for a period of three years.",57
432,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,We can end this agreement at the end of twelve months to make such an arrangement as the honourable and learned member refers to.,57
433,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"It is true that the agreement' is for three years, and that either party may break it at trie end of one year by giving notice. But if it is in contemplation to break it within twelve month's, why should we bind ourselves to three years? It would be farcical to do so. Although the Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, Sir John See, and Sir William Lyne have told the people of England that Australia is cryhypo- ing out for an arrangement with Great Britain, no single meeting has taken place in Australia in which the public have unreservedly and unconditionally expressed that wish. Every meeting which has been held has been a meeting of manufacturers, asking for more protection. They have used preferential trade as a hypocritical excuse for obtaining higher duties against the United States and Germany, and, if possible, against Great Britain.",57
434,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable and learned member is in error.,57
435,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Then I should like the Prime Minister to correct me. At the very end of last Parliament he was asked by the leader of the Opposition whether he would undertake to reduce the duties in favour of Great Britain, leaving them as they stand in respect to foreigners; but he said that he would not. In a speech of three hours in advocacy of preferential trade, he replied to 'one of two interjections that he could not undertake that any scheme introduced by him would lower the rates of duty in regard to Great Britain.",57
436,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Unles s there was a reciprocal preference.,57
437,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The Prime Ministersaid at the beginning of this Parliament that he was prepared to reduce duties.,57
438,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have been referred to a passage on page 112 of volume XVIII . of 'Hansard, in which this interchange of remarks takes place:MT . REID - The question is, will the Minister make 3 substantial reduction of the duties in order to achieve the glorious results which he has been picturing?",57
439,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Speakin g personally, I am perfectly prepared to do' so.",58
440,Mr KEID,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is a fair answer; but it involves a change of policy.,58
441,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,No .,58
442,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It will mean a reduction of protectionist duties.,58
443,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"O u r proposal will require fair consideration of the duties which are protectionist, of those which are not protectionist, jind, in fact, of all imposts whose reduction will have a preferential effect. The concluding statement acted very much like the ingredient which the cuttlefish exudes when pursued, darkening the water for a sufficient distance around to allow of his escape from his pursuers. show that the Prime Minister is not so actuated by the desire to benefit the mother country that he is prepared to say, plainly, "" I propose to modify our Tariff in favour of the mother country in order to bind us more closely together.""",58
444,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I am prepared to do so as soon as they are.,58
445,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Why does not the Prime Minister do so?,58
446,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There have been various utterances by the honourable and learned gentleman on this question since 1901, as a prominent and influential member of the Barton Administration, as Prime Minister of the Administration which followed it, and as Prime Minister for the second time in succession to the right honourable member for East Sydney. Yet, at the very end of a session, three weeks before the prorogation, according to his own statement, a proposition is brought forward without an opportunity being given for the full discussion which its importance requires.",58
447,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"N e w Zealand fresh fish is to be allowed to enter duty free, but last year our importations amounted to only Â£ 2 worth.",58
448,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not wish to deal with the various^, items of the schedule, though I admit the utility of the criticism which we have had as showing that, even if we allow the principle involved, the details are such that the anticipated result cannot be hoped .for. The Prime Minister is bringing forward his English preferential trade proposals at a very strange time, seeing that the dust has hardly settled after the recent elections in Great Britain. Never since the repeal of the corn laws in 1846 has there been so distinct a mandate from the people of that country regarding the fiscal question. Mr Balfour, who had to some extent played with it, and Mr Chamberlain, who was sent out like the dove from the A r k to find out how the fiscal firmament looked, have become private members, and one of the greatest political parties in modern history has been disintegrated and scattered because of the attempt to convert the people of great Britain to protectionist views.",58
449,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That was not the cause.,58
450,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"As a close student of English political history, I have formed the opinion that it was the main factor in the dissolution of that party. I turn now to another aspect. Before FedeI wish to ration the States were competing one against another, and their people were suffering great inconvenience by the levying of Customs duties on their borders. Those of us who took an active part in bringing about the Union know that the argument which most appealed to the public was that if the States federated Inter-State free trade would be brought about. The fact that all the free-traders of eminence in public life acquiesced in the movement showed their willingness to take astep towards the consummation of universal free-trade by obtaining free-trade within Australia, even though that involved, in the first instance, protection against the outside world. The Prime Minister frequently advocated Federation on the ground that it would lead to the abolition of State duties, and I should like to know why he is not prepared to apply the same principle to the British Empire? If he genuinely desires to benefit Great Britain, why is he not prepared to apply the principle to the Empire, and announce that he is in favour of Imperial free-trade with duties against the outside world ?",58
451,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,He advocated an Imperial Council.,58
452,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"He is president, not of the British Empire League, because I have that honour, but of an Empire League in Victoria. I have read with very great pleasure the addresses in which the Prime Minister has spoken of the Federation of the Empire. U n fortunately, however, he has failed to advocate that we should take what I regard as the first step that contributes towards that end, namely, the abolition of the duties which operate against other parts of the Empire, with a view to establishingImperial free-trade, with, a system of duties against the side world. Some such scheme is necesthis sary in order that the Empire may be come ""self-contained, and self-supporting.",58
453,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Is the honourable and learned member in favour of Imperial free-trade ? Mr BRU CE SMITH - Certainly . I was in favour of Federation because I garded it as a step in the direction of the Federation of the Empire, which believe will one day be brought about. I am also in favour of Imperial free trade because it is a forward step towards universal free - trade. true free-trade instinct, the honourable member for Echuca pointed .out to us-althoug h I doubt whether he realized where the logic would lead him-that should do our best to enter into treaties with other countries which, by reason their climate, geographical position, lation, and other conditions, could supply proposed treaty us with products which we were not able to economically raise for ourselves. He thereby enunciated a great, free-trade principle, which underlies the idea Imperial free-trade. Immediately Commonwealth was established, had brought home to us the advanvantages tages of Inter-State free-trade, under which Queensland was permitted to send her tropical fruits to the Southern States, while Tasmania was afforded an opporthe tunity to supply Queensland with her winter fruits, free from restrictions of any kind. We recognise that the Almightytiating has endowed different parts of the earth with different capabilities, and that modities should be raised in those places where natural conditions are most suitable for them, and exchanged for others under agreements mutually advantageous to all concerned. That principle cannot be exspirit tended to the whole world at present, but it could be brought into operation so far as the British Empire is concerned. If the Prime Minister were to'bring down scheme having such an object in view, he would win reputation as a statesman from the people of the whole Empire. Even those who did not like his scheme would approve of his breadth and generosity of mind. If we in our turn adopted the proposal we might rehabilitate our repuconsidered. tation in that part of the Empire in which we have to obtain our money, and place ourselves in a much better position than that in which we stand today. outMinister, instead of fiddling about with little schedule, bearing a close resemblance to an auctioneers' catalogue, should bring forward a great, far-reaching scheme of Imperial free-trade. Let him indicate, not through protectionist meetings, but through this Parliament, that the people of Australia are willing to enter into a great Imperial free-trade recompact, and to join, for the time being, in a system of protection against the outI side world, which is endeavouring to penalize the products of the Empire.",59
454,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Coul d such a scheme be With carried ?,59
455,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Nothin g is im-, possible nowadays, and, although the honourable member might not individually apwe prove of such a scheme, I think that it would be adopted. I now wish to draw of attention to one or two serious results popuwhich might be brought about if the were carried out. If this were a far-reaching proposal dealing with great interests, we might be readv to of take some risks. But it is. a miserthe ably small one, affecting products of we only very small value; and any adthat may be derived from it will be obtained at great cost. I think that it is a case of dropping the substance and grasping at the shadow. We are running risk of giving offence to some of the great nations, not by levying duties upon their products, but by deliberately differenbetween them and one other country. We mav thus engender a spirit of retaliacomtion. We know that whenever preferential trade' has been spoken of in Australia many thoughtful men have predicted that if we differentiated even between the mother country and the great European nations, the of retaliation would probably grow in the latter. It has been pointedly stated that one of the first commodities that the United States and some European countries a would attack would be our wool, and we have not very long to wait for an incident bearing upon this aspect of the-matter. In today's Argus I read a very interesting paragraph describing a meeting of French people in Sydney, at which the preferential trade proposals of the Government were I should like the Committee to consider in what way prominent and influential French people view the probable effects of these proposals upon the people The Prime of their own country.",59
456,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is significant that no mention is made of the preferential treatment of the French colonies by that country - w e have not taken any offence at that.,60
457,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I do not think that touches the question at all ; for that is an instance of a preference by a mother country to her own children. The portion of the report to which I refer is headed '-' Preferential Trade: ^French Protest,"" and reads as follows: The following resolution has been passed by the council of the French Chamber of Commerce of Sydney :"" The council of the French Chamber of Commerce of Sydney, at a meeting held under the honorary presidency of M . Albert Pinard, Consul-General for France, without considering in detail the new preferential duties-whic h are still in the Bill state, although operative through Ministerial decision-dee m it advisable to call the attention of the Commonwealth Parliament to the actual proportions of the commercial interchange between Australia and France. "" The latest Federal statistics show that during the year 1905 the direct exports from Australia to France reached the total of ^5,762,904, while the direct imports from France into Australia totalled only ^Sio,qso . France has therefore bought - in 1905 ir times more Australian products than she has sold of French goods."" "" It seems desirable that such commercial relations, presenting for. Australia preponderating advantages, be not compromised by the proposed increased duties against French importations. It >is evident, moreover, that any similar tax, which very probably would be established in France as a retaliatory measure, would weigh heavily on the Australian products that are imported there in lowering by as much the price limits of the French buyers and their so useful competition on the markets of Australia and England. 0 "" In consequence, the Chamber re-affirms the principle and the terms of its resolution of 24th October, 1902, adopted at a time when the establishment of the preferential Tariffs seemed imminent, and which contained the following passage:-'That the establishment of the said preferential Tariffs, if it came to be effected, would have for very probable consequence the adoption of retaliatory measures, which, the French Government would feel compelled to take as a reply to aggressive methods,in raising the duties on Australian products or taxing such goods hitherto admitted into France free of duty.' "" The council of the French Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests the Consul-General for France in Australia to communicate the present deliberation, in whatever form he may deem proper, to the Federal Government."" - Mr MCCOLL - O u r exports to consist of raw material's which the people of that country must have. heavy duties upon all our other commodities. [156]",60
458,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not like such cock-sure opinions upon economical questions-the y are generally made in a hurry,60
459,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable and learned member's opinions are all cock-sure.,60
460,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member does not understand the language I use, or he would know that I am not cocksure of anything except that he does not comprehend me. We must not imagine that the French people in Australia are an insignificant community. France has her woolbuyers scattered throughout the Australian States, and some of the ablest men in French commercial life are always amongst us. They form a very influential community, and have a newspaper of their own. They point out very clearly that their country buys from us products valued at eleven times the amount represented by our own imports from France. Yet we are being asked to enter into a truly insignificant arrangement with New Zealand, which has really never been asked for by the people of that Colony, or of the Commonwealth, w and which, apparently, has every chance of being rejected in New Zealand, to the detriment of a country that buys nearly six millions of products from us every year. The moment that the new Premier of that Colony returned from England, he expressed his doubts whether the New Zealand Parliament would adopt it. We are asked to enter into an insignificant agreement, which will differentiate New Zealand from Germany, France, the United States, and Great Britain. Are we going to risk, I will not say the loss of a great customer, but the chance of having a handicap placed upon one of our principal commodities merely in order to bring about the paltry results that are likely to follow upon an agreement of this kind ? Are we prepared to jeopardize the interests of one of our greatest industries and to run the risk of having retaliatory measures adopted by the great nations of Europe in respect to some of our principal products? It must not be forgotten that we have the Argentine Republic upon our flank only too eager to fill any gap in the markets of the world in which we have for so long had, if not a monopoly, a distinct advantage. I think that honourable members should pause beFrance fore they support the Government proposal. We are under no obligation to They impose placate New Zealand. She has done nothing for us, and is asking nothing from us'; and we should not adopt - the proposed treaty merely for the glorification of the Prime Minister. Germany has already help spoken pretty freely upon the question preferential trade. When the question was raised some time ago of a preferential trade arrangement with Great Britain, was openly stated that in all probability Germany would impose retaliatory duties. Then again we are attempting to open up trade with the East. We have sent special commercial agents to China and Japan, fall into. with a view to increase trade and the induce the teeming millions of those counin tries to adopt wool instead of cotton the manufacture of their clothing. Yet is now proposed to differentiate those two countries with nearly 600,000,000 of people from New Zealand with its country. 800,000, and to run the risk of giving offence to those great countries with which we specially desire to trade. Some people may say that there will be no risk of citing the prejudice of China. China recently boycott imports from the United States of America because the treatment meted out to the Chinese the American Government? Did not the announcement of the Chinese boycott have goods. such a potent influence upon the President of the United States that he spoke of rehensive Bill. pealing the whole of the offensive legislation against the Chinese rather than allow interests of the American manufacturers to be seriously prejudiced.",60
461,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"A minute ago the honorhearing, able and learned member was advocating a world-wide preference.",61
462,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is a very different matter. Instead of dealing the 800.000 people of New Zealand, whom we are now attempting to placate, we should then be dealing with 50,000,000 British people.",61
463,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The position is equally illogical.,61
464,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member's standard of logic and my own Commission. may differ. I have been brought up in different school. We cannot afford with waive of the hand to say that we are mercially indifferent to China, Japan, France, Germany, and the United States. When this question was first mooted, about four years ago, I recollect reading newspapers a cablegram from the United States which breathed the spirit of retaliatablishment tion. It is an easy matter for honourable members like the honourable member for Echuca to argue that other countries cannot themselves. No greater mistake can be of made than for any nation to suppose that other people cannot live without its products. The assumption that we have a it monopoly of the wool production of the world, and that no country can afford to differentiate between Australia and other countries in that respect is about as bad aÂ° blunder as we could That fact is exemplified by attitude of France as it is disclosed to-dav's newspapers, and by the attifor tude adopted by the President of the it United States immediately he found that China proposed to resent the treatment meted out to Chinese immigrants by that",61
465,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the honourable and learned member know that the French proextest has nothing whatever to do with the But did not reciprocity proposals ?,61
466,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That fact can of make no difference whatever to my arguby ment. The objection of France is to any form of preference which differentiates her I would advance precisely the same argument against the more compreI now wish to say a word or two concerning what I may the call the tap-root of this matter. _ This cry for preferential trade originated in a . whine from the State of Victoria. For my own part, I am tired of from Victoria these complaints, which do 'not emanate from any other State. Nobody can ""read the reports of the evidence given before the Tariff Commission without being struck with the helpwith less tone adopted by Victorian manufacturers. At every stage we find them making this sort of statement: "" We want more of assistance, for 'our industry is deelicing."" We have recently heard a great deal in reference to the refusal of Victorian manufacturers to face the cross-examination of one or two free-traders upon that We have some very good a evidence of the reason which inspired that a fear in some of them. When certain manucomfacturers, as witnesses, made their ex - parte irresponsible statements, they talked of the decline of their industries, but under cross-examination they had to confess that in the they were really doing more business now than they had done prior to the esof Federation. That fact was clearly established in connection with the manufacture of agricultural implements. It was conclusively shown that the maoufacturers engaged in that particular industry, who have been so consistently crying out for more protection, had not only succeeded in Australia, but had actually been exporting their products to the very country which they charged with having ""' dumped"" its gcods into the Commonwealth. The lie direct has been giver.' to fheir statements. Those statements are only part and parcel of a broad-based scheme of complaint which proceeds from Victorian industries. When Federation was established, we, of New South Wales, all knew that many young industries had been started upon hot-house principles, whose little roots were embedded in this State. We were all aware that protection would have the effect of developing those industries. But we did not anticipate that this whining would be continued for six years of our Federal history. I remember, forty years ago, when a protective policy was first introduced into this country. It was in 1866, and at that time. I took a youthful interest in the fiscal question.",61
467,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable and learned member must have commenced to do that when he was in the cradle.,62
468,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I was very young. At that time, Mr Yeomans, a well-known hatter of Victoria, to whom I had been speaking of the evils of protection said, "" You know that we shaH only require protection for a little while. When we wish to teach a child to walk, we put our hands under its armpits, and assist it to toddle, with the result that by-and-by it can stand alone, So it will be if a little protection be afforded to our industries. We want to get \our labour educated and our market reconciled. We shall then be able to dispense with all these aids, and our industries will stand alone and face the industrial world."" It was a pretty picture. find today that, like unfledged birds in a nest, these industries still have their mouths open, and are asking for more protection. The people of New S'outh Wales, who have lived under free-trade conditions fcT years, are now called upon to pay duties upon various articles ranging from 20 per cent, to 40 per. cent, and upon some commodities up to 70 per cent.",62
469,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What commodities they ? [ ' 5 Â« ] -2,62
470,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Starc h is one of them.,62
471,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"What does the honourable member mean by 70 per cent. ? Mr Bruce SMIT H. I mean that there is a duty of 70 per cent, on starch, and the honourable member for Mernda, who sits near the honourable member, is aware of the fact - It is now proposed to ask the people of New South Wales to pay a duty of i j d . per lb. upon imported oatmeal. All these duties are to be levied for the purpose of assisting a number of industries which were going to stand alone, and to face the competition of the world; but which, after forty years, are still leaning omthe unfortunate consumer. In all his speeches, the Prime Minister talks as a Victorian, and as an advocate of Victorian industries. I have never known him to take into consideration the whole of the circunv stances of Australia. Does he forget that for years 1,500,000 persons in New South Wales have been living under a system of free-trade ?",62
472,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,What! under free trade ?,62
473,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Of course. There were duties collected upon narcotics and spirits, but the people of New South Wales have practically been Hying under a free-trade Tariff, and, in order to bring about Federation, they agreed to come under the Victorian system of protection.",62
474,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,They are giving strong evidence of a desire for more protection. Mr BRU CE SMITH - I ask the honourable member to point me to a single passage in the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission in whichi any New South' Wales manufacturer cried out for more assistance.,62
475,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I will do so at once.,62
476,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Prime But we Minister has not done justice to his Federal reputation by constantly viewing this matter from a Victorian stand-point. I shall oppose the proposed reciprocal agreement with New Zealand. The benefits which it would confer are infinitesimal as compared with the dangers that would be involved in passing it. The moment that we sanction it the news will go forth to the world that we have differentiated between the goods of New Zealand and those are of every other country, and there is every chance that our action will engender a feeling of retaliation in the countries affected by it. We have had an indication of that today in the case of France, and in regard to Germany we occupy exactly a similar position. There can be no doubt whatever that if we offer an advantage to New Zealand as against the mother country, we shall exhibit a glaring want of appreciation of our real obligations to Great Britain.",62
477,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Her e is one passage in which a New South Wales manufacturer desires more protection. Mr BRU CE SMITH - The honourable member is playing beautifully into hands. I have already stated that if we look through the report of the proceedon ings of the Tariff Commission we shall find upon almost every page instances which Victorians engaged in the distillais tion of whisky, and in the manufacture harvesters, galvanized iron, wire, and nails, cry. out like a nest of unfledged for more protection.",63
478,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable and learned member said that not one manufacturer New South Wales asked for more proslightest tection. Mr BRU CE SMITH - I did, and am going to read the paragraph which the honourable member has brought under my notice. New South Wales has a populathe tion of something like 1,500,000, and Tariff Commission reports that "" Two has just delivered. manufacturing firms in New South Wales supported the complaint and suggestion gagmade in Victoria, and South Australia.""",63
479,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Rea d the names of the two manufacturers.,63
480,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The names are immaterial to the point at issue, but I shall give them. They are the Clyde gineering Company and the' Meadowbank well-known queryManufacturing Company.",63
481,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Tw o manufacturers complained in regard to one item, and yet honourable member said that not one facturer in New South Wales had made complaint.",63
482,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I would point out the remarkable difference between the attitude of the manufacturers of New South Wales and those of Victoria.,63
483,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I could point to fifty more cases.,63
484,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Only two Cases found in a community of a million and a half prove the rule for which have contended. It is, too, quite possible that since this artificial system came into existence some manufacturers-pos sibly Victorians-hav e 'gone to New South Wales, and endeavoured to establish industries there. The supporters of the Government must be in a very bad plight when they profess to ""think that they have scored a victory by finding two cases in which manufacturers in that State have asked for more protection.",63
485,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has bowled out the honourable and learned member. - Mr Bruce SMITH - He has found my that two manufacturers in New South Wales complain of want of duties, whereas almost every page of the reports of the Commission we read of complaints from Vicin torian manufacturers that more assistance necessary. The Prime Minister has not, of I sav, done justice to himself in failing shoe to give consideration to the great wave birds of free-trade which rolls year after year over New South Wales, and which is inimical to all these beggarly measures in which he is bringing forward without the indication of that appreciation of the position which one would expect from I the occupant of his high office.",63
486,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Coolgardie) [10.19] - I am sure that the Committee is indebted to honourable and learned member for the Parkes for the elaborate lecture which he,63
487,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That is a very old,63
488,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"For the most part it was a repetition of lectures to which he has often treated us, but his declaration that he is an Empire free-trader, and a protectionist against the world, is certainly Ennew. His present attitude suggests the Are things what they seem, Or is visions about? the The honourable and learlned member who, manuhitherto has been regarded as a paragon a of free-trade excellence, boldly announced himself as a believer in protection against the world. His lecture, although somewhat contradictory, was exceedingly interesting. He complained that the Prime Minister had not included Great Britain in a comprehensive scheme of Tariff reform designed to link the whole British Empire together against the world; yet almost in the same breath, he warned us of the dire conI sequences of a union of France, Germany, - China, and other, foreign countries in a kind of zollverein in opposition to us. In one sense, however, the palpable contradictions in which he indulged added a piquancy to his deliverance. Though sympathy in some measure with his views, these contradictions are too palpable to ignored. F o r somewhat different reasons from those which he enunciated, I find self in antagonism to this proposition. do not believe that anv two men in on Australia are competent to draw up a Tariff and require Parliament to agree to it without alteration. If this treaty is be adopted, I should prefer to see it exon tended over a period of three years, rather than that it should be limited, as just gested by the Prime Minister, to twelve months. I do not think that the honorMinistry able and learned gentleman realizes the British serious dislocation of business which results from Tariff re-adjustments. If this treatyGreat remains in force for three years, it will have a fair trial, and commercial men will have an opportunity to re-adjust their busiin ness arrangements ""to meet the altered posipreferential tion. The Prime Minister must surely know that twelve months would scarcely proposal enable manufacturers and importers to comto plete the arrangements necessary to made in respect of some of the items in the-. schedule; and that, on the expiration the treaty, they might suffer 'serious loss in respect of goods which had beem ordered some time in advance.",63
489,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"So m e of them creased to 100,000 cases. would have to adopt a different system manufacturing.",64
490,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That is so. cult to see how the House can swallow a Tariff without examination. I, for one, correspondingly reduced. shall not subscribe to anything of the kind. These items ought to be fairly debated, and the House should arrive at a true underimpose standing of what their effect will be. The Prime Minister should have arrangd, if possible, for the scheme to be discussed in the Parliament of New Zealand whilst it is under discussion here.",64
491,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It is now before the New Zealand Parliament.,64
492,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I understand that it has been referred to a Committee.,64
493,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The New Zealand House of Representatives have a Standing Comarticle, mittee of Finance and Trade, which deals with all measures affecting trade and their financial arrangements.",64
494,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,But I understand that it will have to review the work of that Committee.,64
495,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,It will do so next week.,64
496,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"That being so, we are in not in a position to know what the New Zealand Parliament will do. I wish now to be refer briefly to one or two items - in the schedule. I believe that the honourable mymember for Barrier has dealt with what is I likely to be the effect of the proposed duties timber, but I wish to emphasize the point that it would be unfair to the mining community to impose differential rates in resto pect of Oregon. It is clear the rates fixed this and other items show that this proposal was not fully considered by Mr Seddon sugand the Commonwealth Government at the time of its adoption by them. Although the propose to grant a preference to products, I find that under this treaty the duty on condensed milk imported from flritain and all countries other than New Zealand will be increased by 100 per cent - Can it be said that the Ministry is this way redeeming its promise to give treatment to imports from, the mother country? The presence of such a in the schedule is in itself sufficient render it impossible for the Committee to be adopt it as it stands. I find from the statistics submitted to us that over Â£ 2 1 , 0 0 0 of worth of preserved milk is imported from Great Britain, and from information I have received, I believe that the imports this year from English factories will be inShould my inof formation be correct the value of our imports of preserved milk from Great Britain It is diffithis year will be very materially increased, and the imports from other countries will be I suggest that, instead of fixing the duty on preserved milk from New Zealand at i d . per lb., we should a duty of \&. per lb., and retain the present duty of i d . per lb. as against the British article, whilst increasing the duty as against the foreign article to i j d . per lb. That alteration would be absolutely consistent with the Ministerial policy of granting British products a preference in this market, and I do not think that New Zealand could offer any objection to it. On the other hand, the proposal embodied in the schedule would penalize the British and place it on an equal footing with the production of any foreign country. My . suggestion is that New Zealand milk should pay a duty of Jd. a lb., British milk a duty of i d . a lb., and the foreign article a duty of i j d . a lb. That arrangement would be. consistent with the declared policy of the Government to give the mother country preference in this market.",64
497,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,And reciprocally New Zealand should make the same arrangetions. ment with respect to us.,65
498,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Yes . Mr G. B . EDWAKDS - Does the honormade able member make the same suggestion regard to the duties on cheese?,65
499,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I have not the same formation in regard to cheese; but if the same principle applies, I should do so.",65
500,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,And in regard to hops?,65
501,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In regard to all other articles to which the principle applies. seems to me that the Ministry, instead of proposing a duty on many New Zealand products, should allow them to enter free. Protective duties are imposed in Australia to safeguard local manufacturers from effects of lower wages and unfair tions elsewhere; but as the position of New Zealand approximates to that of Australia, there is no justification for such duties against that country; and if we do not impose duties against New Zealand products, that Colony will have no excuse for imposing duties upon our products. The 0 adoption of my suggestion will leave the Government much freer to impose differenthat tial rates favouring the products of the mother country, and slightly handicapping foreign competition. I understand that condensed milk contains from 30 to 50 per cent, of sugar.",65
502,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not think that it contains as much as 50 per cent.,65
503,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I am informed that ceedingly some foreign brands contain nearly 50 per cent., and that they average from 35 to 40 per cent. But, if the New Zeaas land manufacturer of condensed milk to is able to get Australian sugar free pointed of duty, he will have an advantage over the manufacturer on the mainland; and, therefore, I suggest the retention a duty of \6\. per lb., to put the manufacMernda turers in the two countries on the same footing. While such an anomaly as this they affords a strong argument for not adoptdebate, ing the proposition of the Government, the Prime Minister's idea is carried out, and any recommendations that we make are attached to the schedule, come the basis of further negotiations with the New Zealand Government, it may, haps, be accepted. If we cannot achieve our end in any other way, I shall vote for a including our recommendations, in respect to alterations, in the schedule, in order that they may be the basis for further negotiaThat, of course, would be on the understanding that our Government insisted on the retention of the alterations by this House. I congratulate the in Government upon having made a start in this matter. The honourable and learned inmember for Parkes censured them for not having proposed an elaborate and complete scale of duties in respect to both New Zealand and the mother country ; but everything must have a beginning, and the Go%'ernment seems to have made a fair start. If we are It willing to take New Zealand into the Federation, as I am sure that we are, we should extend her the freedom of commerce enjoyed by the other States of the Union; and I am hopeful that ultimately this treaty will be the come the basis of a commercial union beconditween the two countries. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. PERSONA L EXPLANATIONS. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",65
504,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Mernda) [10.37] - B y way of personal explanation, I wish to say when I was sitting on an opposite bench, to which I had moved in order to obtain a better opportunity to hear his speech, the honourable and learned member, for Parkes made what, I think, was a very improper reference to me. It is not the first time that allusions of the kind have been made in this Chamber. They are exdistasteful, and absolutely without justification. He was speaking of the manner in which Victorian manufacturers, he alleged, always come open-mouthed Parliament for additional protection, and his arguments by alluding in a verymarked way to starch, and the honourable and learned member said very of pointedly that the honourable member for could give information on that subject. I object to such statements, because are not calculated to raise the tone of and, in reply. I wish to, put before if honourable members one or two facts. My . firm engaged in the manufacture of starch may at a time when the Victorian duty to bewas 2d. a lb., and, when the Federal Government proposed that rate in the perCommonwealth Tariff, I expressly asked them not to impose a protective duty of more than id. per lb. The Government practically acted on my suggestion to reduce the protective duty by retaining.the import duty of 2d. per lb., and imposing an Excise duty of id. per lb. on all starch made in the Commonwealth. This Excise duty not only necessitated the pay ment of id! per lb. by The manufacturers, but involved them in the inconvenience and expense of carrying on their operations under Customs supervision-. I did not vote on the question. I have never made any request to the Government for additional protection. The honourable and learned member who twitted the Prime Minister with want of commercial knowledge, showed that he was utterly ignorant of the conditions under which the industry was carried on, because^ he did not know that there was an Excise duty as well as an import duty. It may surprise mv honourable and learned friend, who is a free-trader of the free-traders, when I tell him that, as the result of the duty of i d . per lb., which is the net protection that the local manufacturers enjoy, the price of the article has steadily gone down. As the operations of the manufacturers have increased, they have been able to reduce their cost of production, and to-dav starch is being sold in the market at a lower price-makin g allowance for the Excise duty of i d . per lb - tha n was ever asked for it in the days of free-trade in New South Wales or Victoria.",65
505,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Has the world's price not declined ?,66
506,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"No , the world's price has not declined.",66
507,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I would ask the honourable member not to go beyond a personal explanation.,66
508,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I think that I am entitled to some slight consideration, because the honourable and learned member for Parkes has gone out of his way to personally refer to mc. I have always done my duty here, and I think I shall be able to show mv disinterestedness. I thoroughly believe in protection, because, according to my - experience, once an industry is fairly established, and the local manufacturers have command of the market, competition reduces prices and protects the public. I think I shall be able to prove that later on. I trust that these personal imputations will not be repeated. My duty here is to represent the whole country, and not to look after my own interests. As Ministers knoWj I have studiously abstained from interfering with matters in which I was interested, and, so far as the proposed treatv with New Zealand is concerned, I knew nothing whatever about it until it was published in the newspapers. If starch is included in the schedule, it was certainly not placed there with my knowledge, or even with my approval. Mr Bruce SMIT H (Parkes) [10.45]. - I am involved in this matter.",66
509,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the honourable member wish to make a personal explanation.,66
510,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Yes , because the honourable member for Mernda has 00mpl'ained of my conduct He has very cleverly made a mountain out of a molehill. He has very adroitly used the occasion to give us an autobiographical sketch",66
511,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,The honourable and learned member is not now making a personal explanation. Mr BRUC E SMITH - The honourable member for Mernda has not reported this matter properly. What I stated was that Victoria had been crying out for years for more protection.,66
512,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable and learned member is not now making a personal explanation. Mr BRUC E SMITH - You , sir, allowed the honourable member for Memda great latitude.",66
513,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If the honourable and learned member will permit me to explain, I think that he will see the limits within which he is permitted to speak. The honourable member for Mernda was entitled to make a personal explanation. As soon as he proceeded to discuss the question of free-trade and protection, I told him that he was going beyond the limits of a personal explanation, arid he returned to the point. If the honourable andlearned member desires to make a personal explanation, I shall not interfere with him, but I cannot permit him to discuss what the honourable member for Mernda has done, or what he should have done, or what duty should have been imposed on starch. Mr BRUC E SMITH - You , sir, were not here when the incident to which I wish to refer occurred. The honourable member for Mernda, under cover of a personal explanation, made a long autobiographical statement with regard to matters which have never before been referred to; and I submit that I have a right to tell honourable Adjournment. members what took place, in order that they may not be carried away by the irrelevant statement now made by the honourable member. What took place in Committee was this",66
514,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The honourable member must, not refer to what took place in Committee. Before the honourable and learned member came into the Chamber I asked the honourable member for Mernda if he desired to make a personal explanation, and pointed out to him that he would not be entitled to refer to what had taken place in Committee. I cannot permit the honourable member for Parkes to do that which I prevented the honourable and learned member for Mernda from doing. He. may make any explanation he desires, but' his explanation, must not reflect upon any other honourable member. . Mr Bruce SMITH - The whole of the honourable member's explanation related either to what took place in Committee or to something that did not take place at all, - arid I want to differentiate between what occurred and what, did not. I shall confine myself to references to what did not take place. I did not reflect upon the honourable member, and I did not refer to him personaJly. I was mentioning that the duties had been increased by 30 per cent., 40 per cent., and 70 per cent. An honourable member asked me what duty had been increased to 70 per cent., and I said ""starch."" I did not refer to the honourable member's profits on starch or to the profits he was making in, his business. Neither did I say that the honourable member had asked the late Government to do anything in regard to the duty. I did not charge him with asking for more duty. I stated generally, a/rud only generally, that the Victorian manufacturers Jiad asked for more duties. I do not wish to say anything, offensive to the honourable member. He was sitting at the back of the honourable member who asked me what commodity had a 70 per - cent, duty upon it, and when I mentioned starch, I did not in any way connect that article with the personality of' the honourable member. referred to the honourable member by his constituency name, and remarked that he would remember what had taken place in connection with the Tariff discussion,. I did not refer to the profits derived by the honourable member from his business. - Mr HARPER - No r did I.' [SENATE. ] Audit Bill. Mr BRU CE SMITH - The honourable member gave us a history of his business.",67
515,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I merely stated that the pi ices were lower than they had been.,67
516,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not wish to offend the honourable member in any way. If the honourable member did take offence,67
517,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Onl y because of the personal application of the remark of the honourable and learned member. Mr BRU CESMIT H - I can assure the honourable member that no personal application was intended.""",67
