2,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Trade will be absent from question time today and for the remainder of the week. He is travelling to China for the finalisation of the Australia-China free trade agreement feasibility study. In his absence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will, in his normally eloquent fashion, answer questions on his behalf. NA Economy: Fiscal Policy",17
3,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, given the government's record tax take$100 billion more than in 1996-and today's reports of a $10 billion surplus this year, why has the government, after nine long years, failed to invest in skills and incentives in the tax system-more than nine long years of failure now pushing up interest rates for Australian families?",17
4,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that entirely surprising and completely unpredictable question. Mr Speaker, can I say through you to the Leader of the Opposition that it is no surprise that the tax take this year should be higher than it was in 1996, because obviously we have more people; they are paid higher wages; and they pay more tax. That is the first remark I would make. The second observation I would make is that I reject entirely the proposition that this government has not invested in skills. That is an issue that will be developed further, no doubt, as question time unfolds. Finally, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that he is the last person in this chamber to give anybody else lectures on fiscal rectitude. Economy: Fiscal Policy",17
5,Mr RICHARDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to a claim that the government is irresponsibly spending $66 billion but has refused to spend $1 billion on skills training? What is the government's response to this claim?,17
6,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say to the member for Kingston that, as a result of some very careful research in my office, we have come across a claim being made by the opposition that we are irresponsibly spending $66 billion. After I had this drawn to my attention, I decided to do a little bit of research as to how you would arrive at $66 billion. It throws up some very interesting issues. Of course I assume that when an opposition says that a government is irresponsibly spending $66 billion it is against the expenditure of that $66 billion. I assume that is a reasonable proposition for that whole $66 billion. I assume that, if Labor had won the election, the Labor Party would have rescinded all of those commitments because they were irresponsible. So I decided to go through it, and I found that $21 billion of that $66 billion was increased assistance for Australian families. In other words, a third of the $66 billion represents the increased assistance for Australian families that was announced in the last budget. It also includes those very real supplements of $600 each. I know the Labor Party argued they did not exist. But I now have to tell them they do exist and the Australian families who received them demonstrated last October that they thought they existed. But let us go on. There is $14.7 billion personal income tax cuts. If I remember correctly, the Labor Party allowed those to go through in the Senate. There is $2.1 billion of investment in Australian aged care facilities. Is Labor saying that we should rip $2.1 billion out of aged care facilities? There is $3.3 billion of extra funding to strengthen Medicare-and in the words of my colleague the Minister for Health and Ageingdemonstrating that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. But the list goes on: a $400 million enhancement to the private health insurance rebate; $2.4 billion of funds going to AusLink; $2 billion of investment in science and innovation; $2.5 billion has gone into defence and national security-presumably this great defence buff who now leads the opposition would want us to rip $2.5 billion out of defence and national security; $1 billion worth of tax relief provided to mature age workers; and a further $1 billion of tax relief for small business.",17
7,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
8,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, a billion dollars help for small business. We are going to rip that out of small business! Listen to this. Can you believe this is something else they are opposed to: $900 million of assistance to pensioners and self-funded retirees to help with their utility payments. How mean can you possibly get! But it gets worse. There is no group in the community for which there ought to be more regard and respect than the carers of Australia. That $66 billion involves $500 million of help for Australia's carers. It also includes $2.5 billion in superannuation incentives and $1.6 billion to the Australian water fund. But, relevant to this discussion, here is the most interesting component of all: it also includes $1 billion for vocational cation and training. Yet only two days ago, in here in Canberra on 6 March, these were the very words of the Leader of the Opposition: They'll spend $66 billion on getting themselves re-elected but they'll not spend $1 billion on getting young Australians skilled. In other words, not only has he been caught out in the absurdity of attacking spending on things that he voted for but included in that $66 billion is in fact a $1 billion investment in the very thing he said was excluded from the $66 billion. I have said it before, and I will say it again, that the man who sits opposite me is a prime example of somebody who tries to walk both sides of the street. On this occasion he has well and truly been exposed for the humbug he is on expenditure. Economy: Interest Rates",18
9,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All of that in one budget; all before an election. Thanks for the confirmation. My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the claim by the Prime Minister yesterday that he did not really mean in the election campaign that interest rates would not rise. Does the Prime Minister recall his comment made at the 2004 coalition campaign launch: Just a tiny upward movement in interest rates more than devours a few dollars of taxation relief or additional family benefits. Given last week's interest rate rise devours up to $50 of a family's monthly budget, why did the Prime Minister break his word on interest rates?",18
10,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I haven't. ANZAC Cove,18
11,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the Minister for Foreign Affairs inform the House of actions taken by the government to address concerns about roadeduworks being undertaken at ANZAC Cove?,18
12,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I think all members of the House now know that this year is the 90th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings and that there is going to be a particular cus on the ANZAC Day ceremonies at Gallipoli. There have been some media reports-I think in the Daily Telegraph and possibly on one of the commercial stationsabout the rebuilding of an existing road around ANZAC Cove. This road is being rebuilt for safety reasons. There is no question that the road does require some urgent reinforcing, and the Turkish authorities are endeavouring to complete the road in time for the 90th anniversary commemorations. On seeing the media reports I instructed our Ambassador to Turkey, Jean Dunn, to raise with the Turkish government the issues that had been raised in the media reports cause, obviously for all of us, the site is of enormous historical and emotional importance and it would be of very great concern to us if the remains of fallen soldiers were being disturbed and dirt was being dumped onto the beach at ANZAC Cove. During the course of the discussions yesterday, the Turkters ish authorities told our ambassador that archaeological work had been carried out prior to the roadworks commencing and that no remains have been unearthed during the roadworks. They also assured us that if any remains were unearthed they would immediately instruct that the reconstruction of the road be stopped. We appreciate that very much. I must say I very much appreciate the sensitivity with which the Turkish authorities responded to our representations. It is true that the contractors have put some earth onto the beach at ANZAC Cove. The Turkish government is instructing the contractors to move that earth from the beach so the beach can be restored to its proper condition. In conclusion, I think all members of the House would appreciate the job that the Turkish authorities have done in protecting ANZAC Cove and the surrounding national park and the enormous efforts they make to make the ANZAC Day ceremonies there a sucfocess. I know tens of thousands-probably hundreds of thousands-of Australians have benefited from the work that the Turks have done. Very recently we had the Governor of Canakkale here. Some members will have met him; I did. Canakkale is the province within which Gallipoli resides. I took the opportunity in my meeting with him to thank him very warmly for all that the Turkish authorities are doing. From the ambassador's discussions with the Turkish authorities I am satisfied that they are very aware of our concerns, they are aware of the media reports and they will take all necessary steps-as they have done for many, many years-to be- protect the dignity of the site. Economy: Foreign Debt",18
13,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I ask whether he recalls his comments at the National Press Club on 28 February 1996: ... one of the reasons why high foreign debt matis that it feeds directly into the level of interest rates in Australia ... The truth is that while we have such a high level of foreign debt we are going to continue to have an impact directly onto the level of real interest rates in Australia. Given this, isn't it true the Prime Minister's failure to address foreign debt led him to breaking his word on interest rates?",19
14,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will take the last part of the question and repeat again: no promises have been broken. Let me go back to the first part of the question. I have no doubt that I re- did say something to that effect, and those remarks would have been made in the context of the fiscal conditions of 1996. In February 1996, the person who has just asked me the question was busily misleading the Australian people by saying the budget was in surplus. We knew otherwise, and those remarks were made in the context of having not only a current account deficit but also a very large budget deficit. The reason the current account deficit now and the consequent size of foreign debt is serviceable and manageable in a way it was not in 1996 is that we have got the budget back into surplus. The government is therefore not subtracting from public savings. We have been able to do that whilst being able to invest sensibly in services for the Australian people and also to provide taxation relief which, according to the Labor Party in recent weeks, we should not have been doing. In those circumstances, I feel no discomfort at all about being reminded of that remark. Budget 2005-06",19
15,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline to the people of Ryan and to the parliament the parameters of the forthcoming budget? Has the Treasurer been receiving alternative views on those parameters?,20
16,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a great pleasure to outline to the people of Ryan and the people of Australia the parameters for the upcoming budget. The government's midyear review forecasts a surplus of $6.2 billion in this current financial year. It is important that the government run a surplus because, at a time when individuals are borrowing and at a time when we expect businesses to actually be investing, it is only the government that will be adding to savings and it will be business and individuals that will be running down savings. So it is important that the government runs surplus budgets. Up until this morning, I thought the criticism was that the budget surpluses were not large enough, but I read in the Sydney Morning Herald today some criticism that they might be too large. Can I just say the government will not be entering into the business, pre-budget, of confirming or denying any particular stories which journalists intend to write, because it puts the government in an impossible position. The government will outline and update the position at the time of the budget. But, as I said, until this morning I thought the criticism was that the budget surpluses were not large enough. That was certainly the criticism levelled at the government by Professor Ross Garnaut in his Sir Leslie Melville lecture, and it was certainly the criticism levelled at the government by an interviewee on the John Laws program last week. It was quite spooky. We had someone go onto the John Laws program last week and excite members of the press gallery by giving the government some advice. This spooky commentator seems to be Labor's modern economic spokesman-he has been rediscovered. The spokesman was no other than Paul Keating, who went on the John Laws program on 2 March 2005 and said this: ‘I mean, the budgets really should have been in much greater surplus.' For the record, as Treasurer, Mr Keating did eight budgets; as Prime Minister, four. Labor was in office for 13 years. This government has done nine budgets, and the cash balances of those nine budgets have been a surplus of 5.5 per cent of GDP. The cash surpluses of the 13 years of Keating economic management were minus 20.2 per cent of GDP. And there he was in a spooky interview on the John Laws program last week-‘I mean, the budgets really should have been in much greater surplus'! We have been getting the same kinds of lectures from the Leader of the Opposition, who has been out complaining that the government has had unsustainable tax cuts and unsustainable expenditures. The Prime Minister reminded us the last time the Leader of the Opposition promised Australia it had a budget in surplus he missed by $10,000 million. We will start taking advice from the Leader of the Opposition on budget deficits when we start getting our marriage guidance counselling from Elizabeth Taylor! That is when we will be doing that. We then had the member for Lilley, the shadow Treasurer who up until today has also been criticising $66 billion in tax cuts and family payments, go out there today and be asked what should happen and he says: ... we desperately need investment in skills opmentthat is more spending... we desperately need some incentive in the tax systemthat is more tax cuts. What is the Labor Party's answer? Attack the government for tax cuts and spending and then demand more spending and more tax cuts. This even makes me pine for the days when the member for Hotham was the shadow Treasurer. Why do they do this? Because when these ALP state secretaries go to the white bread training school they are told that whatever the issue is either it is too much spending or, if it is not too much spending, it should be too little spending. It is either too much tax or too much in tax cuts. But at the bottom of the day it is empty, vacuous, platitudinous and self-contradictory from people who have not done the work, do not understand the issues and cannot make a contribution. So I finish with a last word on this subject from Alex Sanchez. Remember him? He used to sit over there in the box last year advising the member for Werriwa.",20
17,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,21
18,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is looking for a policy in there. But it is empty. This is what Alex Sanchez said: What is Labor's response ... Return to Hawke and Keating and use it as a curtain to disguise an empty policy cupboard. Right there! Right in the box which he opened up, as vacuous as the policies of the member for Lilley. Economy: Foreign Debt",21
19,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think $66 billion has got under your skin-it certainly has. There it goes. We have got it. That will do us. That will do very nicely that one. My develquestion is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall saying to the then Prime Minister on 30 March 1995, when the current account deficit was 6.1 per cent of GDP: You cannot blame anybody-the Fraser government ... the British, Sir Henry Parkes or the prophet Moses-except yourself. By this logic, now that the current account deficit is 7.1 per cent of GDP, isn't the current double whammy of a record current account deficit and rising interest rates the Prime Minister's fault?",21
20,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Unlike the attitude taken by my predecessor and many of those around him at the time, of course I accept ultimate and full responsibility for the state of the Australian economy under the stewardship of my government. I accept full responsibility and I am proud to do so. I am proud to take responsibility for what my government has done, with the very able and special contribution of the Treasurer, to bring to the government of this country. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for this question. I am proud of the fact that we have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. I am proud of the fact that, when the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia goes overseas, he is told by other central bank governors that he is the envy of the Western world because of the tight fiscal policy that this government runs. I am proud of the fact that in the years I have been Prime Minister we have provided more choice for Australian families. I am proud of the fact that the opportunities for Australian women have been greatly advanced since 1996. I am also proud of the fact that we have rebalanced Australia's foreign policy and security approaches. I am not ashamed of anything that this government has done in the management of the Australian economy. We have delivered to the working men and women of Australia. We have delivered to the blue-collar workers of Australia, a group that the Leader of the Opposition was talking about this morning, the quadrella of historically low interest rates; increases in their real wages-13 per cent versus one per cent in the 13 barren years of Hawke and Keating; tax cuts; and the opportunity for their children to have jobs that in the previous generation they did not have. I am proud of that and I take full responsibility for it. Health: MRI Machines",21
21,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House how the government is providing better access to magnetic resonance imaging services?,22
22,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can inform the House that the government will extend Medicare funding to 21 new MRI machines, on top of the three new MRI machines promised during the election campaign. I know that the member for Solomon will be pleased to know that there will be new Medicare funded MRI machines at Darwin, Bunbury, Bendigo, Gippsland, Dubbo, Lismore, Toowoomba, Rockhampton and Mackay as well as at 15 metropolitan locations. I am also pleased to say that 11 of the 21 new chines announced the other week will be in public hospitals. In1996 there were just 18 Medicare funded MRI machines. Soon there will be 101 Medicare funded MRI machines, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. But there is more good news from the Howard government: all of the new machines will bulk-bill pensioners and concession card holders and 15 of the new machines will bulk-bill every single patient. All of this demonstrates that you can trust the Howard government with Australia's health system. As everyone knows, the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. We will do what is necessary to make a very good system even better. Skills Shortage",22
23,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that, according to the Housing Industry Association, major home renovation activity is at a two-year low because of the Howard government's skills crisis, falling 28.6 per cent in the December 2004 quarter? Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that home renovations have jumped an average 8.3 per cent over the quarter because of the acute shortage of tradespeople driving up renovation costs? Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that this government's failure on skills has created this skills crisis that is driving up costs, hurting Australian families and putting upward pressure on interest rates?",22
24,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The short answer is no. The slightly longer answer is to remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, now that I have had an opportunity to examine the Skills at Work report released yesterday, that there has been a strong growth in new apprenticeships in the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors in response to rapid expansion of employment in those sectors, and that mathe number of apprentices commencing a trade apprenticeship increased 32 per cent between 1996 and 2003. The report also shows that 90 per cent of new apprentices have ongoing employment within three months of completing their apprenticeships. Figures released last week by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research show that commencements in traditional trades-and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was surely talking about a traditional trade if she was talking about the building industry-have increased by 19 per cent in the 12 months to September 2004. So the question of whether, over a particular period of time, there is a rise or fall in renovations influenced by a variety of factors but it does not merit the wholly misleading and dishonest description of a ‘skills crisis'.",22
25,Dr WASHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of progress being made to establish a transitional government in Iraq? Are there any alternative policies?,23
26,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me thank the honourable member for Moore for his question and his interest. The process now is that the transitional assembly is to meet and a transitional government is to be formed by that transitional assembly. Interim Deputy Prime Minister Salih said the Transitional National Assembly would meet on 16 March. The reason 16 March was chosen is that it is the anniversary of the chemical weapons attack against Halabja by Saddam Hussein. So it is a very symbolic day. It is a very important day for the Iraqis and it is a symbol of reconciliation in that country. A two-thirds majority will be required in the National Assembly to elect a president and two vice presidents, who will in turn appoint a prime minister. That process is, of course, under way already and it is very encouraging to see this democracy at work. What is also encouraging is that there is now international consensus. President Bush's visit to Europe illustrated that point only too clearly. The international community is getting right behind the Iraqis in trying to ensure that the new democratic Iraq works. I was quite interested to see that amongst those who were virulently opposed to the original overthrow of Saddam Hussein was a British Labour MP called Harry Barnes. Some members opposite may know Harry Barnes. Having been a very passionate anti-war MP, he has now done the honouris able thing. He has set up a group called Labour Friends of Iraq. I would like to feel that our own Labor Party could think about Labor friends of Iraq as well, and take a leaf out of Iraq Harry Barnes's book. Harry Barnes said: I thought it was right to oppose the war. But history moves on and the Iraqi people now have a golden opportunity to take back their country and build a decent non-sectarian democracy ... Here you have the British Labour Party, even the anti-war dissidents within the government majority there, getting behind the people of Iraq. Just about the only people left who are continually harping on in a negative way about Iraq are the Australian Labor Party led by the current Leader of the Opposition. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition made an 18-minute speech. It was another simple illustration of his capacity to walk both sides of the street. It was a speech where he said nothing positive about the Iraqi election. I think the only thing he said about the election was that he thought it was flawed. The European Union, the NATO leaders and the international community all know that the Sunnis were intimidated in order to keep the turnout low, but we are being positive and constructive about the future of democracy in Iraq. The Leader of the Opposition apparently thinks that the real issue here is that the country is about to descend into a civil war. So let's talk up that issue. He walks both sides of the street. He said, in terms of Australia's contribution, that he thinks the maintenance of a strong position in the Persian Gulf is not an unreasonable thing on a more long-term basis. So we should have people-the Navy, I suppose-in the Persian Gulf in the long term. But the Leader of the Opposition also said in the same speech that we should not commit ourselves permanently outside of the Asia-Pacific region. We should have the Navy there but we should not have the Army there! We should be there; we should not be there! He had a new criticism which was that when the al-Sadr forces were in revolt there was a need to increase our deployment in Iraq. But with Iraq so much quieter now he thinks that we should have increased our troop numbers earlier. And maybe having increased them earlier we should reduce them. He makes the argument that we do not have enough troops there-450 is not enough! We need more troops there but we should not have troops there at all! I think the Labor Party in Australia should follow the lead of Harry Barnes. They should get behind the Iraqi people, set up a new group called ‘Labor friends for Iraq'-not ‘Gough Whitlam in Blues Point Tower friends for Iraq'-and get behind the Iraqi people and support democracy. On this side of the House that is what we do.",23
27,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The only people walking both sides of the street are those who said they would not do this before an election, and did it afterwards.",24
28,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The leader will come to his question.,24
29,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement to parliament in which he said that one of the two roles of the new ADF deployment to Australia is to: … provide a secure environment for the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction Support Group … I also refer to statements made overnight by the commander of Japanese forces, who said: It is not necessary to protect directly our troops by Australian Army forces. Prime Minister, will you now confirm that the Australian task force will involve a broader role in the provision of security in Mutthana province? Prime Minister, why have you not provided Australians with the same equipment as the Dutch, including the provision of helicopter support in covering such a vast area, which was considered by your Defence advisers?",24
30,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can confirm that the role of the troops will be as I outlined in the House yesterday. I heard on AM this morning the remarks made by the Japanese officer. I also heard the remarks of the Chief of the Defence Force that came immediately afterwards and properly explained, in a way I thought even the Leader of the Opposition might understand, very plainly the role of our forces. So far as the equipment and force protection are concerned, the advice of the Defence experts is that the equipment they have will be appropriate to the task. Given the interest of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Barton in these matters, if there is anything additional of a confidential nature they would like to know, I am Iraq very happy to make it available. But they would both appreciate that there are some operational reasons why we do not go into all of the defensive and protective material that is made available. It is self-evident that the role of the ADF will not precisely replace the role of the Dutch, for reasons that were outlined by the British commander, I think, in the same interview this morning, when he said there had been a significant improvement in the capacity of the Iraqi security forces to look after themselves and their fellow Iraqis brought about by something the Labor Party continues to oppose-that is, the role of the coalition in training the Iraqis. Here we have this impossible contradiction in the position of the Leader of the Opposition. He says that the imperative is to have an exit strategythe imperative is to tell the Australian people when we are leaving-but he opposes the means whereby we can leave the Iraqis safely in charge of their own security. It is not possible to have an effective coalition withdrawal from Iraq until the Iraqis are able to look after their internal and external security. Yet the Labor Party opposes us providing that. It is the ultimate example of the pacity of the Leader of the Opposition to walk both sides of the street on an important issue of national security. Skills Shortage",24
31,Mr BAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister advise the House what the government is doing to resolve skills shortages and provide opportunities for young Australians?",25
32,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He is working very hard and sits up straight and pays attention for Braddon. Of course, we visited Caterpillar Elphinstone last week. They have 627 employees and 93 apprentices, and they would take a lot more tomorrow if they could. Since this government came to office, the number of apprentices in this country has increased from 146,000 to almost 400,000. In fact, in the 18 months that the Leader of the Opposition was the minister in the government responsible for training, the number of apprentices in traditional trades dropped from 143,000 to 107,000. As he told his biographer, he did not find education and training particularly ‘straining'. This government is investing, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, $2.1 billion this year alone in training. Of those 400,000 apprentices, 148,000 are in traditional trades. That represents 38 per cent of all apprentices in Australia in traditional trades despite the fact that traditional trades are 13 per cent of the labour market. In the election campaign this government announced, as the Prime Minister said today, more than $1 billion of extra funding to support apprentices over the next four years. That includes $91 million for scholarships for apprentices. If people going to university can get a scholarship, why can't a young bloke who is going to be a plumber or a tiler? This government will deliver a ca- $500 cash payment at the end of year one and another $500 at the end of year two. There is another $75 million, opposed by the Leader of the Opposition, for tool boxes. The Leader of the Opposition laughs at tool boxes. Commencing from 1 July, the government will deliver $800 for a tool box and tools for an apprentice three months into their apprenticeship. There are another 27,000 training places for school based apprentices and young and not so young people that need a bit of training before they start their apprenticeship. The other rock I have been looking under is careers advice. I have discovered that not everybody who is offering careers advice to young people is well trained. There will be another $103 million delivered to improve the quality of careers advice given to children in schools. I am also asked about alternative policies. Let us remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has just asked the Prime Minister a question, that, in the last parliament, at question time-question time is where the opposition defines its priorities-59 questions on universities and five questions on training were asked of me, and in only one question was the word ‘apprentice' even mentioned. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition delivered Labor's manifesto to the ACTU congress in August 2003-that is, Labor's platform on education on trainingthere were 27 mentions of universities, six mentions of TAFE and two mentions of training. How many mentions of apprenticeships were there? None. How much priority does the Labor Party place on apprenticeships? Zero. In terms of policies, the Labor Party needs to understand that the state governments, which run the TAFEs, last year cut 1,200 training places out of the automotive sector and 1,300 places out of utilities, mining and construction. You know what they have replaced them with? You can do feng shuithe member for Griffith would love that. There is fruit carving for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The member for Port Adelaide would be concerned to know you can do rave party management. For the Leader of the Opposition-there is a course for everybody in the Labor Party-there is belly dancing for beginners. What Australia needs is more brickies and fewer belly dancers. Family Services: Family Payments",25
33,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And we have a Minister for Education, Science and Training who does nothing about it!",26
34,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Jagajaga will come to her question.,26
35,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister explain why his government has reneged on its election promise to pay the child-care rebate to families this financial year? Does the Prime Minister realise that, because his government is delaying the introduction of the rebate by a year, working families will continue to incur child-care fees of up to $90 a day for long day care and not be able to claim a cent back from Tax until July 2006?",26
36,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We have in fact brought it forward. We have brought it forward to 1 January. I do not know where the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is coming from. Workplace Relations: Building Industry,26
37,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Will the minister update the House on the government's program for the reform of the building and construction industry?,26
38,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question and for his important role in chairing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation. As the member for Deakin knows, the Cole royal commission found an unassailable case for the reform of the building and construction industry in Australia. Justice Cole found an industry characterised by a culture of intimidation and unlawful behaviour. I can inform the House that tomorrow I will be introducing the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005. This bill will do two things in particular: firstly, it will increase the penalty provisions in the Workplace Relations Act and, secondly, it will finally give the building industry task force the powers it needs to effectively prosecute illegal activity. This bill is intended to send a clear message to employers and unions that the government is serious about taking action in relation to what Justice Cole found in the building and construction industry. For those in the industry who may be contemplating taking unlawful action, it will act as a powerful deterrent. The increased penalties are up to a maximum of $110,000 for a body corporate and $22,000 in other cases. It is unacceptable that people in this industry should continue to act outside the law. No responsible government could turn a blind eye to the problems that exist in the building and construction industry in Australia. Yet I have to report that this is exactly what the opposition has done. The Labor Party's current workplace relations platform-written, I remind the House, by an ALP conference at which 50 per cent of the votes belonged to the unions-compels the Labor Party to vote against this law. This platform is binding on ALP members of parliament. It also states: It reaffirms the strong bonds between the union movement and the parliamentary Labor parties in Australia. At this very time, we have the CFMEU threatening major industrial disputation to exploit the privileged position which it currently has. It is not about the interests of its members; it is simply about shoring up its power before the government's reforms come into operation. Yesterday, the Western Australian state assistant secretary, Joe MCDonald, promised: ... the biggest stoush that I have seen in my and I have seen some major ones. The CFMEU is the union which has donated over $4.9 million to the Australian Labor Party since 1995-96. And it is the union which is pulling the strings of the Australia Labor Party, who will not do anything about the culture of lawlessness and intimidation which exists in the building and construction industry. Ms Annette Ellis-You would not have done it.",26
39,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The interjection from the other side simply proves the point. Health: Funding,27
40,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Can the minister confirm if the Lyndon Drug Withdrawal Unit at Orange, established in 1999 with federal support under the government's Tough on Drugs policy, will be receiving the interim and recurrent funding necessary to ensure its long-term operation and thus avoid its threatened closure?",27
41,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Calare for his question. I appreciate his concerns for this particular service. A number of my colleagues have similar concerns, particularly Senator Heffernan. This service has been funded by the federal government to the tune of about $1 million a year. I understand trade that this funding will shortly run out. I believe that the service has been strongly and unsuccessfully lobbying the state government for additional funding. I have no desire to see the service close. I do have every desire to see the service work effectively and efficiently. It is my expectation that my colleague the parliamentary secretary will shortly be in a position to make an announcement. Resources: Infrastructure Investment",27
42,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question time, is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Will the minister inform the House of the government's approach to encouraging investment in resource infrastructure?",27
43,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his ongoing commitment to the resources sector, particularly in his own seat and in the Gladstone region. Of course, it is the resources sector that is driving Australia's economy through a major export contribution this year alone of $53 billion. In as little as two years, that will rise to $82 billion, and going with that is a very significant ongoing commitment to resource infrastructure development that ensures that we as a government will continue to provide a strong future for the resources sector. Here are just a few examples: a $102 million interest-free loan to Comalco to put in place a co-generation plant in the city of Gladstone; $125 million to construct multi-user infrastructure such as water recycling and air separation facilities in Western Australiaprobably not far from Brand, in the area of Kwinana; and $10 million to Queensland Alumina to assist them in their conversion from coal to natural gas, underpinning the development of the PNG gas pipeline into Queensland and eastern Australia. As well as all of those, there have been literally hundreds of millions of dollars put into developments such as those on the Burrup Peninsula and in other areas within Australia. Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting",27
44,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All these funds have been put forward to encourage investment of footloose projects here in Australia, footloose projects that will come here rather than go to another country. These investments, this infrastructure, these jobs and this future for Australia would not have existed under the Labor Party because they want to abolish the very agency, Invest Australia, that is behind attracting these investter's ments here and arranging for their funding. Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting",28
45,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They can sit there and make their comments; the reality is that their policy is not to have investment here. This government continues to target its infrastructure spending on projects with solid private sector backing-real value for the Commonwealth taxpayers' dollar. Nothing could be more different from what a Labor government would do. The Beattie government is one case in point at the moment-a classic example of what a mess the Labor Party makes when it tries to invest in infrastructure. I read today that Macarthur Coal have been forced to bypass Dalrymple Bay, the port that was privatised by the Queensland government-the Beattie government. They were forced to bypass Dalrymple Bay and the 40-ship queue waiting offshore because the Beattie government made a mess of that lease. The reality is that the Labor Party, whether it is in state government or federal government, makes a mess of its investment in infrastructure. Peter Beattie may be looking around for someone to blame but, as I said in the House yesterday, he does not have to look very far. He can look to an old colleague Keith DeLacey. Keith said quite graphically, ‘It was the Queensland government's decision to privatise Dalrymple Bay coal terminal.' The Labor Party continues to make a mess of infrastructure investment while this government has a proud record. Regional Services: Program Funding",28
46,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and relates to answers to questions she has previously given to the parliament. Can the minister confirm that on 22 June 2004 she approved a $30,000 Regional Partnerships grant to pay for staff accreditation at a long day care centre in the Deputy Prime Miniselectorate? Can she advise the House how she assessed the needs of this child-care centre against the unmet accreditation needs of the 4,484 other day care centres in Australia? Mr Causley- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think I clearly remember the statement made by the member for Dawson. That was not in the statement. It was an issue that was dealt with when she was parliamentary secretary, not now as a minister of the government.",28
47,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On that point of order, Mr Speaker: you last ruled on this matter on 10 February 2005, when a series of questions was asked of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs about matters associated with the Regional Partnerships program. At that point, you ruled that if questions related to things about which she had spoken in the parliament, they were in order. This question does that as it is about the program which she spoke about in a great deal of detail and which she has now taken many questions on. So it is on all fours with the ruling you on 10 February. Mr Gibbons-I suppose a rort is out of the question!",28
48,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,ANNE KELLY-I will again look through the records of the hundreds of very worthwhile Regional Partnership programs that were funded right across Australia and respond to the member. Indigenous Affairs: Women,29
49,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney-General advise the House how the government is helping to empower Indigenous women?,29
50,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Greenway for her question. I am interested that she asks me a question today, on International Women's Day, about violence against Indigenous women. I want to make it very clear that violence against women in our community is never acceptable, but the tragedy and reality is that Indigenous women in Indigenous communities are perhaps the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in our society. In terms of Indigenous family violence, the victims are almost always women and children. This government is resolute in its determination to address these issues of family violence, and as Attorney I want to empower victims of family violence by increasing their access to our judicial system, where they can obtain support and assistance. Recently I announced the location of seven new family violence units as part of a $22.7 million expansion of the Family Violence Prevention Legal Services Program. Ultimately, this roll-out of new services will see the number of units doubled, from 13 to 26, across Australia. They will provide legal support for victims. I know that my colleagues who represent rural and remote communities will welcome the roll-out of gave these new legal services. They include Bourke, Rockhampton, the Kimberley region, Dubbo, Mildura, Geraldton and also the Northern Territory. These build on other initiatives that we are taking. They include appointing family consultants in Darwin, Alice Springs and Cairns to help Indigenous families access the courts, and funding of legal services specifically for Indigenous women through the women's legal services in each state and territory. We are also looking at ways to recognise the extended family role in raising children in Indigenous communities, and I hope to have something to say about that shortly. These initiatives indicate the government's very real and ongoing commitment to practical reconciliation and a better outcome for Indigenous Australians and Indigenous women and children in particular. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, and I am raising this at the first meaningful opportunity: as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, was coming to the dispatch box a moment ago there was a rather crude interjection across the chamber from the member for Lingiari. I would ask him to withdraw and apologise. Mr Snowdon-As I have not said anything, I am happy to withdraw. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, if I misheard the source of the interjection and if it was not in fact the member for Lingiari, I am sorry, but there was a crude interjection. I am advised by my colleagues that the member for Bendigo may have been responsible. It was a crude and demeaning interjection, most inappropriate on International Women's Day, and it should be withdrawn and apologised for.",29
51,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the member for Bendigo has made an offensive statement he will withdraw it. Mr Gibbons- Mr Speaker, I said nothing that would be regarded as being unparliamentary in line with the standing orders. However, if the Manager of Government Business finds an offence in those remarks, I do withdraw. Regional Services: Program Funding",29
52,Ms KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. What representations did the minister make to his former parliamentary secretary about the approval of child-care accreditation funding in his electorate under the Regional Partnerships program? Can the minister confirm that of the more than 500 Regional Partnerships grants approved up to December 2004, only one has gone to a project concerned with the training and accreditation of child-care staff, and this was awarded to a child-care centre in his own electorate? Will the minister now agree to allocate accreditation funding for all childcare staff across the nation who have identical or lower accreditation standards than the staff at the centre in his electorate?",30
53,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. So far as I recall, I made no representations on the matter. It is not inappropriate for any member to make representations on behalf of constituents. We have had representations from those opposite in support of Regional Partnerships programs. We have had representations from the Leader of the Opposition in support of Regional Partnerships programs-and I have not claimed in this place that it was illegitimate for him to do so. He claims that all Regional Partnerships programs should be scrapped except, of course, for those in Brand as he seeks to walk both sides of the street again. But I will check. So far as I recall, I made no representations. It is a flexible program that meets some very real needs. For example, it has approved funding for 239 rural transaction centres, which provide vital banking, postal, Centrelink and Medicare services. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition would like to nominate which rural community should have missed out on face-to-face banking services.",30
54,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It goes to relevance. The Deputy Prime Minister was asked about the one child-care centre that received funding. This has nothing to do with that.",30

56,Mr HOWARD,ATTENDANCE,"Could I have the indulgence of the House, Mr Speaker, to inform the House that one of our colleagues, the honourable member for Fadden, David Jull, had an operation for lung cancer this morning and he has come through the operation well. It has involved major surgery but the prognosis, as I am advised, is good. I know that all members of the House will want to wish David well in this very difficult time. Whilst I am on my feet could I also on behalf of all members send our good wishes to Brian Harradine, who is in hospital in Tasmania. We wish him a very full and complete recovery.",30
57,Mr BEAZLEY,ATTENDANCE,"I am going to claim to have been misrepresented but I would like a bit of indulgence beforehand so I can respond to what the Prime Minister has just said and, on behalf of the opposition, join with him in extending our very best wishes to both our afflicted colleagues.

61,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,31
62,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yesterday, following question time, the Prime Minister asserted that I was wrong suggesting a majority of 13 particular nations with higher interest rates than Australia also had higher growth rates than Australia over the last year. To support his claim he tabled a document purporting to show average economic growth in these nations over the last five years. I seek leave table a summary sourced from the OECD detailing economic growth rates of 13 nations having lower interest rates than Australia. The table shows nine of these 13 nations recorded stronger economic growth than Australia over the past year, thus dispensing with the claim yesterday that these countries had lower growth rates over the period. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: when making a personal explanation showing where he has been misrepresented, that is precisely what he is meant to do. The Leader of the Opposition has just debated the point and broken the standing orders.",31

64,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question to you understanding order 103 and it relates to the interpretation of application of standing order 94(a). I refer you to the House of Representatives Hansard for 17 February when Mr Deputy Speaker Causley was in the chair during the matter of public importance debate. Mr Speaker, I think you are aware of the course of events then. On that occasion the Chief Opposition Whip, the member for Chifley, was excluded from the House understanding order 94(a), having not been warned and whilst seeking to make a point of order. I contrast that application of 94(a) with the way in which the standing order was applied yesterday when there was the prime ministerial statement about Iraq. As you would be aware, the Leader of the Opposition was granted 18 minutes to make a statement of comparable to length. As I believe the Hansard adequately shows, and certainly members of the House would recall, the Minister for Foreign Affairs interjected consistently for 17 of those 18 minutes. At about 17½ minutes you warned him. Then, as the Hansard clearly shows, he interjected again, but standing order 94(a) was not applied. I am seeking your guidance for the edification of members of the House, Mr Speaker. What is the appropriate standard: that members will be excluded without having been warned when seeking to raise a point of order; or that they be allowed to interject for 17 minutes, then, being warned, interject again and not be excluded?",31
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the Manager of Opposition Business. I will refresh my memory on both of those Hansards and report back to the member. Parliament House: Public Access  your attention been drawn to a circular regarding public access to this building? I think that it is fair to say that all members pride themselves on the public's ability to access this building and see the parliament in and progress. It appears from that circular that access has now been denied from 6 p.m. rather than 8 p.m. Could you advise honourable members whether my interpretation of the circular is correct? What is the impact as far as the public is concerned on accessing the parliament after 6 p.m.?,31

68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the member for O'Connor. Standing Orders,32
69,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I seek your guidance also in the same vein. Having reflected on standing order 100 and associated standing order 98, I can find no provision in the standing orders for the Leader of the Opposition at question time to enter into a preamble before his question. Previous speakers have deemed that out of order and have sat the Leader of the Opposition down. Can I say that if consistent practice were applied, he would not go back to type and make those preambles before he asked his question.",32

Question agreed to. NA Iraq: Australian Task Group Deployment Debate resumed from 7 March, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the document.",33
85,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Let me begin by expressing my strong support for the statement the Prime Minister made yesterday and by saying that it is a great source of pride to me-as the Minister for Foreign Affairsand to the government, that Australia joined the international coalition to remove Saddam Hussein's barbarous regime. Saddam Hussein was a brutal and evil dictator. He was a threat to his own people, he was a threat to international peace and security, and he defied the international community's expressed demand that he disarm and comply with no fewer than 17 mandatory United Nations Security Council resolutions. His regime perpetrated some of the most egregious human rights abuses that the world has seen. Prime Minister Allawi has estimated that the total number of people missing from the Saddam Hussein era exceeds one million. Since the end of the war the coalition has received reports of some 275 mass graves, containing the remains of some 300,000 slain men, women and children. We have removed a regime that sustained its rule through rape, torture and murder. Over one million people perished as a consequence of the brutal war he launched against Iran in 1980. Some 5,000 people died during chemical weapon attacks on the Kurdish town of Halabja on 16 March 1988. There was of course debate in this country on whether we should or should not have participated in the war to overthrow Saddam Hussein, but there is no doubt that Iraqis have embraced their newly won human rights-such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and association-new political parties have emerged, women and minorities are engaged and welcomed in political life, Iraqis are conducting religious ceremonies and pilgrimages which were banned previously under Saddam's tyranny, they have access to a flourishing media, with some 170 newspapers, satellite television stations and the internet, and they have exercised their right to elect their own government in the highly successful elections of 30 January. No-one has any illusions about how difficult it has been to get to this point, the point where we are at today on 8 March 2005. Australia has made a contribution because Australia is a significant country, a country with a network of alliances and a country which has the capacity to contribute to the resolution of these problems in a more stable international environment. We sent troops in the initial phase to overnow throw Saddam Hussein's regime and now we are proposing to send another 450 troops in order to provide support to the Japanese and ensure that they are able to do the humanitarian work that the Japanese Self Defence Force is undertaking in the Al Muthanna province. This was of course a difficult decision, as the Prime Minister said. It came, as he also said, out of the initial requests that were made firstly to Senator Hill and then to me when I was in London the day before the Iraqi elections on 29 January. I discussed this matter with Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secretary, and as a consequence of that he sent me a letter which I received in London on the Friday. The Prime Minister, Senator Hill and I and increasingly others discussed that during the next two weeks and eventually the cabinet made its final decision following a decision by the National Security Committee of cabinet. We make no secret of the fact that it had not been our intention to send more troops until that time, that sitting fortnight-the last time the House sat-but nevertheless I believe it to be the right decision. I was supportive of the decision partly because of the role we are able to play in assisting the Japanese to ensure that there is a secure environment within which they can operate and do their humanitarian work. I think the contribution that we will make will be very much appreciated by the Iraqi people as well, and that is obviously a very important issue. My view on this overall issue is that, as other countries have made it clear-so our position is a pretty common position these days-on the question of Iraq, whatever the differences that people may have had on whether Saddam Hussein's regime should have been overthrown or not and whatever the controversy about the weapons of mass destruction, the fact is that, like it or not-and people will take different views on that-we are dealing with a situation on the ground in March 2005 and we have to make decisions day by day on what we do to address that situation. If the international community showed a lack of resolve today and decided to abandon Iraq, the consequence would be that Iraq would be left in the hands of the terrorists and the insurgents who make up the remnants of the Saddam Hussein regime. The consequences for the 22 million or so people of Iraq would be quite dire, of course, if that were to happen. It would plunge their lives back into utter chaos. The consequences for the progress that is now being made with the slow spread of democracy and the stronger, more constructive and more positive climate in the Middle East would be disastrous. So many of the gains that we have seenparticularly, by the way, in the last few months-would be lost. Obviously the consequences for the United States and its allies from what is sometimes broadly described as ‘the West' in the war against terrorism would also be utterly disastrous. I appeal to people, whatever their political perspectives may be, to think about this issue in this context. It is reasonable enough for people to have different views over whether or not it was right to overthrow Saddam Hussein, whether the strategy on the ground has always been right since the overthrow and whether mistakes have been madethose are all important debates. I do not think there is any reason why we should necessarily walk away from those debates, but they are, in substance, historic debates. I think real challenge for us today is to ensure that we do the right thing in the future and that the new emerging democratic Iraq is a success. Australia is not a small country: it is the sixth biggest country in the world in area; it is the 11th or so biggest economy in the world; it has about the 50th biggest population. It is a very significant country. And Australia is a country which has the capacity to operate not just within the Asia-Pacific region; we have the capacity to operate beyond the Asia-Pacific region when we see it to be in our, our allies' and the international community's best interests. That is what we have done here. I think it would be a shameful thing if Australia were to cut and run from Iraq, to use a phrase-if we were to take the view that we should do nothing and abandon our responsibilities in Iraq. I think that would be a shameful thing. I think it would be Australia withdrawing in ignominy, and a matter of real national humiliation for us. I am actually, on the contrary, very proud of the fact that in Australia we continue to make a very strong contribution. Australia is committed also- (Quorum formed) As I was saying, we are very proud of the role we played in ensuring that Iraq is moving towards becoming a free country and we will continue to shoulder our share of the burden. I must say, though, that the Labor Party's position on Iraq has been a series of quite extraordinary outbursts over a long period of time. When the Labor Party first addressed this issue, they said they would support the overthrow of Saddam Hussein if done via a United Nations Security Council resolution or, if that resolution was not carried because of a veto, as long as there was substantial support for it. That position was abandoned, presumably as a result of a caucus decision. We had the call for the troops to be out by Christmas from Mark Latham and the claim the that this had been discussed in the shadow cabinet when it clearly had not been, and that of course has been very much revealed since the federal election. The Labor Party lost the election and we then had the resurrection of the former Leader of the Opposition. Regrettably, for somebody who claims to be an expert on international security issues, he walks both sides of the street. He is not able to articulate clearly and in a way that anyone can remotely understand what the Labor Party's aspirations for Iraq are and what the Labor Party wishes Australia's contribution to be. We do not have enough troops there; we have too many troops there. We should bring our troops back into Asia-I am not quite sure what they would be doing in Asia. We should keep the Navy in the Persian Gulf, but we need the Navy to undertake maritime interception between the Philippines and Indonesia and we should bring it back to do that. The series of contradictions and the waffle coming from the Leader of the Opposition are not just bamboozling but an embarrassment. I often say that the only people who would take heart from the Leader of the Opposition's speech yesterday would be Geoffrey Barker and Alan Ramsay. It was a completely incomprehensible collection of thoughts, many of which were contradictory. The Labor Party needs to do what it said it would do before the Christmas period. It said it would go away over the Christmas-New Year period and consult with the United Nations, the Americans and the Iraqis on what Australia should doMr Rudd interjecting",33
86,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Yet we have no statement from the Labor Party on what the Labor Party has concluded. Ms Gambaro- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask that the member opposite refrain from the rude comment that he made a moment ago. It was unparliamentary.",36

92,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"We have just seen exit the chamber Australia's now longest serving foreign minister and, I think history will record, Australia's least significant foreign minister. In terms of his contribution to this country's long-term national security interests and foreign policy interests, historians will make the judgment. But, if they look long and hard at this minister's performance in the parliament, at his performance before the Australian people and at what concrete actions he has taken in his portfolio to enhance this country's national security and long-term foreign policy interests, I believe historians will cast a harsh judgment indeed. Dispatching troops to war in the first place is a grave decision; dispatching further troops to the same war is an even graver decision. This government has done both. Our troops of course have responded magnificently to the policy direction of the government and, as a consequence, they have done our country proud-as they constantly do our country proud wherever they serve and wherever I have seen them serve abroad, be it in Timor, Aceh or Iraq. Once again we pray for their safe return-each one of them. Each one comes from a family, from friends, from a community and from loved ones and each, therefore, is a precious life. However, our purpose today is to debate the policy decision of the government on Iraq, the reasons for our involvement in this war, the consequences of our involvement in this war and what we can now do to build peace in Iraq. What were the government's reasons for going to war? It is important in this debate to refresh our minds. They were cohervery simple. They were threefold: (1) to eliminate stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons; (2) to prevent said stockpiles falling into the hands of terrorists; and (3) to eliminate said stockpiles by unilateral military means-absent the approval of the United Nations Security Council because the demand was so acute for our national security. They were the three arguments advanced in this parliament at the dispatch box for our going to war in a foreign country. What the government did not argue was that their action in this invasion of Iraq was about international humanitarian intervention. They did not argue that they were about to liberate an oppressed people; they did not argue that they were involved in an enterprise of developing democracy in the wider Middle East. If honourable members have any doubts about any of these scores I would commend to them a quick read of the international legal opinion, which was tabled in this parliament by the Prime Minister, canvassing the reasons for this country going to war in Iraq. Of course, if that is not a good enough test, honourable members could do a very simple word search. They could go the Prime Minister's three statements delivered to the nation on why we were going to war and do a simple word search and note how many times they find in those three core statements these words: ‘weapons of mass destruction'. They were not just mentioned once; they were not just mentioned twice. A truck load of references were made to ‘weapons of mass destruction' and their falling into the hands of terrorists. That is exhibit A. Exhibit B is the statement made by the Prime Minister. If you look at the text of statement and apply the same old word search-insert again the words ‘weapons of mass destruction'-what do you find? Not a single reference. The reason is that the argument which this government advanced for going to war has collapsed. Zero, zip and zilch is what you had in yesterday's statement on the core reasons the government gave for going to war. When you have lost the reason for going to war, you have to invent a new reason. That is what this entire exercise has been about. How many times have we in the opposition said of those who sit opposite us that they are loose with the truth. They are loose with the truth on national security and loose with the truth in putting Australian lives at risk. ‘Honest John' is loose with the truth. The core arguments put for going to war are themselves the absolute essence of how this government has misled the Australian people, and people wonder why this Prime Minister's reputation of trust in the Australian community more broadly is beginning to fracture. What are the consequences of the war? Remember the objective set for this war was that it was an extension of the war against terrorism-that is, to reduce the overall terrorist threat. That was what it was about. The Prime Minister was warned, not by us but by others, as to the consequences which might arise from invading Iraq as far as terrorism was concerned. It was from no more reliable source than the British intelligence community. In February 2003, the British intelligence community wrote that the Joint Intelligence Committee: ... assessed that al-Qaeda and associated groups continued to represent by far the greatest terrorist threat to Western interests, and that threat would be heightened by military action against Iraq that The date of said dispatch: February 2003. They read it; they had it before they went to war. We went to war in March 2003. We know this because it was subsequently outed entire through a Senate inquiry, which we requested and which they opposed, that this was presented to the Prime Minister. He knew that if he invaded Iraq it would actually exacerbate the terrorist threat. That was back in February 2003. Roll the clock forward a couple of years-the chickens have come home to roost. Who was their authority on this occasion? Porter Goss, the incoming Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In his congressional testimony, which I commend to honourable members for a read about what has actually happened as a result of the Iraq war, he says: Islamic extremists are exploiting the Iraqi conflict to recruit new anti-US. jihadists … … … These jihadists who survive will leave Iraq experienced and focused on acts of urban terrorism. They represent a potential pool of contacts to build transnational terrorist cells, groups and netAgency. works in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries. In other words, what Porter Goss, the Director of the CIA, is saying is that British intelligence warned this mob a couple of years ago. Remember that Iraq at that stage had had negligible contact with al-Qaeda, the mob that killed all those people on September 11, and its offshoot, Jemaah Islamiah, which killed our people in Bali not long after. Iraq, at the stage that we went to war, had virtually no connection with al-Qaedavirtually none. What we have turned Iraq into-and this is the core national security issue at stake in this-is a new recruiting ground, training ground, facilitating pool, swamp, in which the new breed of global terrorists is being trained. This adds to the overall terrorist threat across the world. If we go back again to the extraordinarily arrogant statements by this arrogant minister about his foreign policy responsibilities, I do not know how any person in conscience can walk around and say: ‘Oh, I have just gone over there and created civil war. I have also created a new training ground for a whole bunch of new terrorists. And that is all just tickety-boo; everything is just moving along fine, thanks. There are no real problems.' This affects our security in our own region, our own neighbourhood, our own backyard. Remember the objective was to invade Iraq to reduce the overall terrorist threat. The achievement has been the reverse. Therefore, when the Australian people ask themselves the basic and legitimate question, ‘Is our security as a nation, as a people, better or worse as a consequence of this government's decision to invade Iraq?' any sober answer has to be, ‘It is worse.' Because they are now out there by the thousand trained, exacerbated and excited by the events in Iraq and potentially unleashed on the world. And our authority on this? The Central Intelligence What can we now do to help the Iraqi people, those who have suffered most from this war? First of all, let us just knock on the head some of this bogus, latter-day, post facto humanitarian concern on the part of those opposite. Remember the whole debate about whether they were going to take up their responsibilities as an occupying power in Iraq once the invasion had happened: if you are an occupying power you are responsible, once you invade the country, for the well-being of the civilian population of all 20 million Iraqis. They ran from that at a pace of knots. We reminded them time after time in the public debate and in here that they had formal responsibilities under the Geneva conventions, but they were out in a flash, or at least that is what they asserted-a month or two as an occupying power and flick pass the responsibility to others. This is the mob that now say they have this active role in humanitarian concern. Ask this government this question-and I am sorry Tweedledum, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is not here today, because we could ask him this question and he could give us an answer.

96,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,The member has withdrawn it.,39
97,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I have done it twice. Do you want me to do it three times? So here is the key question about the absolute guts of this government's concern for the Iraqi people. Ask this government today-and we have tried to do this through Senate estimateshow many Iraqi civilians have been killed since the invasion; how many Iraqi civilians have been injured since the invasion. I would have thought that, as an occupying power in Iraq, at least until June last year, you would have a passing interest in this because you are the mob running the country. You have got rid of Saddam Hussein-and the Prime Minister has given us his reasons for doing that-you have then actually taken over the government for a period of about 18 months and you are responsible for about 20 million Iraqis, but as of the most recent Senate estimates you were not able to tell us whether there was any reliable calculation of how many people in the civilian population have been killed and injured as a consequence of the invasion. They say now, ‘What about the Iraqi people?' There are things we can do when it comes to the Iraqi people. There are practical things we can do, but this Prime Minister's response is to add this new deployment of almost 500 troops. Despite having been ‘Honest John', loose with the truth for far too long, he said to John Laws: I can definitely say we won't be adding hundreds. I can definitely say we're not going to a capacity to put more regular soldiers on the ground. We just don't have that and I've made that clear to the Americans and the British ... I do not see any weasel word in that. ‘I'John Howard-‘can definitely say we won't be adding hundreds.' That is what he said last April. Of course the Prime Minister now says circumstances have changed. The reasons given are tilting points, tipping points, lipping points, backflip points-you name it, they come up with it. There is a new word every day to explain what they have done. Dutch in, Dutch out; Ukrainians in, Ukrainians out; Bulgarians in, Bulgarians out; Australians up, down-all of it a series of reasons given by this mob, if you listen on any given day, relating to their assertion that circumstances have radically changed. None of them are convincing, but the Prime Minister says, ‘Not to worry, because I haven't misled you.' This is the key point I wish to impress upon the parliament-because it affects all of us, not just in the foreign policy sphere. It is the new prime ministerial doctrine of truththat is, what constitutes lying to the Australian people, what constitutes misleading the Australian people. What John Howard says is, ‘Don't worry; I don't regret it because it was consistent with my state of mind at the time. I like to be inconsistent with my state of mind at the time but it was consistent with my state of mind at the time.' This is worth drilling into just a bit, because it affects all of us. That is, ‘So long as I, the Prime Minister, am convinced that what I, the Prime Minister, said last year was consistent with my state of mind at the time, bob's your uncle. Therefore what I, the Prime Minister, actually say to the parliament and people is not relevant; it is what I think in my mind is consistent with my mind as it was back then.' How do you know what is consistent or inconsistent with have the Prime Minister's mind back then? There is only one person who can tell you. Who's that? The Prime Minister. He is the only person who can actually define whether he has been consistent or inconsistent with his mind when he makes a statement. Anything the Prime Minister actually says is irrelevant, because there is a deeper, hidden, psychological, almost Freudian truth here, which is, ‘What is deeply in my mind at the time?' That is his benchmark for deciding whether you are misleading somebody or not. So this is basically it: ‘I, Louis XIV, the person who runs the show here, do not take questions that are inconvenient. The new standard of truth is this: it is not what I say; it is what I had in my mind at the time.' That is the new Howard doctrine of ministerial accountability in the parliament. There are practical ways in which the Iraqi people can be helped. We on this side of the parliament have argued those for a long time, because the Iraqi people have suffered much in recent years. We argued that we can assist the Iraqi people in their continued efforts against terrorism by assisting in the protection of their oil terminals on the Gulf by the maintenance of HMAS Darwin and those ships which have preceded it and which may follow it. We have argued that we can assist the Iraqi people through enhanced border security. Why? Because there are jihadists coming in through highly porous borders with Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia. Based on my last visit to Iraq, one of the areas where acute assistance is needed is in enhancing the border control systems of the Iraqi border security services. We can also assist the UN presence in Iraq itself, and we have made practical proposals on that line. How about a cancer hospital? Oncology services in Baghdad are virtually non-existent. We have a policy which says we should put our shoulder to the wheel and build an oncology hospital. Why not an Australian oncology hospital to service the needs of the Iraqi people? These are practical ways in which we can assist the people of Iraq and help build the peace, but we do not believe you can do that with a Prime Minister advancing a proposition to the country based on a lie.

123,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Jagajaga) (3.51 p.m.)Unfortunately, on International Women's Day today, we had the Prime Minister misleading the parliament on a matter that is of utmost importance to working women in particular: the government's promise to introduce a 30 per cent tax rebate on child-care expenses. When the government went to the election last year, they promised that this rebate on child-care expenses would be payable from July this year, 2005. In question time today we had the Prime Minister in his usual triumphant and arrogant manner telling the parliament that he did not know what Labor was on about. Not only is he now up to breaking his promises but also plainly he forgets them. He said in the parliament today that we had got it all wrong and that in fact the payment was being brought forward. Let me inform the Prime Minister about his own promise which is now, of course, yet another broken promise. The Prime Minister has only the Treasurer to thank. Just before Christmas, the Treasurer announced that this promise to allow parents to claim the childcare rebate from July 2005 would not apply any more and that parents would have to wait until July 2006. Parents are going to have to wait another whole year before they get to see any of this tax rebate. The Prime Minister forgets that the promise he made during the election was to make sure that parents could get the benefit of this tax rebate from July 2005. So, Prime Minister, it would be a good idea to tell parents the truth, that this election promise has now been broken and parents will not in fact be able to claim this tax rebate until July 2006. This means that parents are going to have to continue to pay very high child-care fees and that they will not get any relief from those high child-care fees for another yearanother year past the time that this Prime Minister promised before the election. This is a very bitter disappointment to Australian families, and to Australian women in particular on this International Women's Day. It should be a day of celebration, but it is a day when Australian women will have to face up to the fact that on this very important election promise this Prime Minister has yet again broken his promise. Today is a very important day to remember all the other areas where we have a very long way to go indeed. One particular area where this government continues to fall behind is in closing the gap between the average wages of men and women. If we have a look at what has happened to the gap over the time that this government has been in power, we can see that we now have a gap of over $300 a week between men's and women's average total wages. The gap is about $300 a week. The total average wage earned by women is just 65 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Women's average weekly earnings are now $587.30 while men's average weekly earnings are $898.20. The shocking news for women, particularly for those women on lower wages, is that the gap between men's and women's total average wages grew from $229 a week in 1996 to $310 in 2004. This government has presided over an increase in the gap between men's and women's wages between 1996 and 2004. We have also seen an extraordinary increase in the number of women working in casual jobs. Between August 1996, when this government came in, and August 2003 the number of women in casual work has increased by over 18 per cent. So we now have 1.2 million Australian women working in casual jobs. That is the reality of what this government has done to working women since it came to office. An extraordinary change has taken place in our workplace. Women in workplaces have also been treated like second-class workers under this government. We have seen the pay gap increase, and we have seen more and more women having to take casual jobs where their financial security is at risk. We have women on lower earnings, and the results of that are lower living standards and lower rates of saving and, for women in many circumstances, a chronic and precarious financial outlook. One of the major problems that this government has imposed on Australian women over its time in office is to make their living standards that much worse. It is in the area of child care that we have some of the most serious concerns. We all know that if good quality affordable child care is not available it is just impossible for women to return to work after the birth of their babies. We know how essential it is for women to be able to choose to go back to work, and in circumstances where for their own family's financial well-being some women must work. What are the problems that so many families, so many women, present to us on a daily basis? First and foremost is how hard it is to find a child-care place. Second is how hard it is to afford a child-care place. And, of course, as a result of the Prime Minister's broken promise, the tax rebate that he promised during the election campaign will not be able to be claimed by parents for another year. It is also the case that quality is threatened, primarily because we have an increasingly severe shortage of child-care workers. There has been a lot of discussion in the parliament in the last few days about skills shortages. It does not apply just to the traditional trades; it also applies in this very important area of child care. The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, who is responsible for this area, revealed her belief earlier this year. She said in a statement that there were no child-care shortages. I will quote a statement in the Courier-Mail: Federal Minister for Families Kay Patterson said resources had been expanded and her spokesman said demand was being met. Those of you from Queensland, I am sure, would vouch for the fact that that is absolutely not the case. It just flies in the face of reality and it shows how out of touch this government is when it comes to making sure that there is an adequate number of childcare places available. This minister realised the folly of her ways just a couple of days later when she admitted grudgingly that there were ‘a few areas of unmet need', in which case she said the market would solve it. ‘The market will solve it', she blithely wrote in a letter to the editor of the Herald Sun. After this second instalment of the minister's official view on child-care availability I have no doubt that each and every one of you got an avalanche of phone calls. There were various letters to the paper about how it is absolutely necessary for the government to step in and make sure, especially in those areas where it is just not economical for private operators to work-maybe in the area that the member for Gwydir just mentioned; I think the member for Gwydir might have some areas like that in his electorate and I think in Wollongong and in many other parts of Australia there would be some areas like that-where it is just not viable for private operators to work, that child-care centres are available. We do need the government to come in and make sure that child-care centres are available. The cost of child care has skyrocketed under this government. Just two weeks ago a task force on child-care costs-a consortium of leading employers and businesses-put out a press release. Child-care costs, according to them, have increased at 2.2 times the rate of average wage and salary earnings in the period 2002 to 2004. Just in that period we have seen an explosion in child-care costs. This task force also found that more than 37 per cent of the workers they surveyed were likely to leave the work force in the near future because of the cost of care. That is why this broken promise by the Prime Minister is so significant: women are saying they will have to leave the work force because of the extraordinary increase in the cost of care. The government said that they want to introduce a 30 per cent child-care rebate, but only two months after the election-they did not wait very long at all-before the ink was dry, they broke the promise. They said, ‘Sorry, everyone-sorry, parents-you're going to have to wait for another whole year before you get the benefit of this child-care rebate.' Parents have also been left not knowing what they will have to do. Do they have to keep all receipts for two years and then present all of those receipts to the tax office to claim their rebates? Parents have not been told that this is what they will have to do, goodness knows how they are going to find the receipts when it comes to claiming this 30 per cent rebate. The government also broke their promise-once again, just before Christmaswhen they said that the amount of child-care tax rebate that could be claimed was going to be capped. I am sure you all remember that during the election campaign the Prime Minister said that there would not be a cap on the child-care tax rebate, but now they have decided that they spent far too much money in the lead-up to the election and that they are going to have to pull the belt in in relation to child care. The savings that this Treasurer has made as a result of these two broken promises is $344 million. So it is no good the Prime Minister coming into question time and saying, ‘I don't know what you're talking about.' How could it be that the Treasurer is claiming a saving of $344 million if they have not broken those election promises? Either they have the saving because they have broken their promise or they do not have the saving and they have another blowout in their budget figures. In question time today we had an extraordinary example from the Deputy Prime Minister of how to go about making sure you have high-quality child care in your childcare centres. Obviously, the answer is to make sure that you put in your application at the right moment and be the beneficiary, under this regional rorts program, of additional funding for a child-care centre so that you can help with accreditation. Funnily enough, none of us heard about it! None of us knew that you could apply for this money. Funnily enough the regional rorts program extends to the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate and to his child-care centre, but to none of ours! Everybody wants to make sure that their child-care centres are of the highest quality. so All parents want that. Certainly all childcare workers want to make sure that they are delivering child care of the highest standard. One of the major problems with child care is making sure that we have properly qualified childcare workers and that they are properly paid-childcare workers receive very low pay. Very recently we had a decision from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission awarding a significant pay rise to childcare workers in Victoria and the ACT. We certainly hope that when that is implemented it will help. Parents cannot afford to see their fees go through the roof as childcare workers are appropriately paid. That is why, once again, it is so critical that this rebate be paid, and paid on time-and that the Prime Minister is held to his word so that parents ensure that their children go to centres where childcare workers are paid properly but parents are not paying through the nose or having to leave work because they cannot afford child care. Labor had quite a different approach before the last election. We recognised that there was a serious shortage of child-care places. We wanted to add to the number of long day care places, where there are very serious shortages. We also wanted to add to the number of places for after school hours care, where there are significant shortages. I do not think there would be a parent in the country who does not know how hard it is to organise child care, especially during vacations and after school. So on this very important day, International Women's Day, it is time for us to recognise the enormous pressure that this government is putting on parents especially, as a result of its broken promise on child-care.

124,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I find it rather ironic that this debate, an MPI alleging the failure of the government to deliver for Australian women, should be brought into the House by the federal Labor Party, hot on the heels of a Labor Party factional brawl over the leadership of the party-a brawl which saw Labor members questioning the credentials of a woman for the leadership job, based on her marital and family status. What message does the federal Labor Party send to the women of Australia? In reference to the Labor Party, Susan Ryan, a former minister in the Hawke government, said in an interview on the 7.30 Report: Now we're back in the dark ages, where a woman's marital status and where she has children or not is being used against her by her own colleagues. We can't even blame the media for this; it's her own colleagues that did it. The member for Gellibrand went on in this interview to say, rather plaintively: Let's actually have a debate about the skills and talents that women can offer to politics, rather than try to denigrate people about their personal circumstances. It is little wonder that former Labor member Cheryl Kernot revealed a culture of what she called ‘bullying' in the ALP. It was enough for her to say that she was not suited to the ALP culture and would not return to politics-local, state or federal-unless the culture within the ALP changed radically. So it will obviously be a long time before we see her again. But Labor have double standards on this and on so many other issues in terms of what they say and what they do. For Labor to raise the role of women in Australian society and suggest that their record is something to emulate just exposes their rank hypocrisy. The Labor Party elected as their leader the former member for Werriwa-a man who in his public utterances single-handedly denigrated and demeaned all Australian women when in his crude vernacular he referred to a professional journalist as a ‘dirty whore'. When he spoke so disparagingly about a woman, what did we hear from the men or women of the ALP? Did anyone ask or demand that he apologise as common decency would require? Mr Adams interjecting",45

128,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"to speak with any authority on the role of women in Australian society. This incident highlighted for women across Australia the double standards and sheer hypocrisy within the Australian Labor Party. At the last election, the women of Australia looked at the record of achievements for women under the Howard government and voted accordingly. I am here as a minister in the Howard government to speak with pride about the increased status of women in our society and the Howard government's regard and respect for Australian women and their contribution to our society. A hallmark of the Howard government's public policy is choice, and nowhere more so than in the area of public policy issues affectLabor ing women and their role in society. Since 1996, we as a government have recognised and embraced the changed and changing role of women within our community. We have attacked in a practical way areas of continuing discrimination. We have established practical options for Australian womenwherever they live, whatever they choose to do, whatever their personal circumstances and whatever situation they find themselves in. The government have recognised that the right solutions for women are the right solutions for the community as a whole-and they are the outcomes that women themselves want. So instead of the cliches trotted out by Labor, which reveal a mind-set that is still so out of step with contemporary Australian women-Labor are still in a seventies time warp-let us look at the undeniable facts. This government has provided more opportunities and choice for Australian women than any previous government. We recognise that women fulfil many different roles throughout their lives. They have different needs and responsibilities, whether they be education, families, careers, retirement, health or aged care. The greatest opportunities this government has provided to women come from the benefits that flow from one of the strongest economies that Australia has ever seen. We have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. That means there is an increasing number of jobs for all Australians, including women. At 66 per cent and increasing, women's labour force participation is the highest it has ever been. In recognition of the aspirations of many women to maintain a balance of career and family, the Howard government has set record levels of support for women in many areas. Let us take child care, for example. The coalition government has spent and continues to spend more on child care than any government ever did. In fact, we expect to spend around $8 billion over the next four years to support child care. Our commitment will be significantly boosted, with additional assistance of $1.1 billion to 200708 for the child-care tax rebate and grandparent carer measures which the Prime Minister announced in the election campaign. So we are looking at women in their roles as mothers and grandmothers. In addition, the government has funded 40,000 new outside school hours care places and 4,000 new family day care places. These have been available since December 2003. In the six years to 2003-04, around $8.8 billion has been spent on child care. That is more than double the amount spent in Labor's last six years in office-in actual dollars. Child-care benefit assists over 700,000 families a year using approved child care. The child-care benefit subsidises around 67 per cent of the total cost of full-time long day care to low-income families paying average fees. The latest available figures show that families receive an average child-care benefit payment of over $2,000 a year. Child-care benefit is indexed each year in line with the CPI to maintain the value of that payment to families-it was boosted by 2.4 per cent last July. The number of government funded child-care places and services has increased substantially since the Howard government came to office. Child-care places have increased by about 83 per cent from over 306,000 to 561,900. The outside school hours care places have increased by 277 per cent from 71,000 to 270,000. Family day care places have increased from 60,100 to 776,300. We are talking about massive increases. Child-care services have increased by some 28 per cent. Record numbers of children have access to Australian government funded child-care places. So it is a sense to suggest otherwise. The number of children using child care has increased by about 21 per cent since the introduction of the child-care benefit. The Australian government have implemented quality assurance systems in long day care, family day care and outside school hours care to ensure the services provide quality outcomes for children. In order to be eligible for the child-care benefit and other funding support, services must comply with all applicable Commonwealth, state and territory legislation and regulations. We fund the National Childcare Accreditation Council to administer quality assurance to ensure children have a positive experience that fosters all aspects of their development. In so many ways, whether it be implementing quality assurance, the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme or the community support stream in child-care support, we are doing what we can to ensure that women have the choice to maintain their careers and go back into the work force while ensuring that their children are being appropriately cared for. The Howard government are delivering for Australian women in a number of other areas. We have ensured that our tax policy provides support for families to give women choice within the family situation. The family tax benefit provides support for the cost of children to around two million familiesabout 3½ million children benefit from the family tax benefit. The vast majority of Australian families with dependent children are now eligible to receive the family tax benefit. In recognition of the special needs of new mothers, since 1 July last year new mothers have received a non-means-tested maternity payment of $3,000 to assist with the costs associated with the birth or adoption of a new baby. The rate of the maternity payment will increase to $4,000, from 1 July 2006, nonand then to $5,000, from 1 July 2008. So in so many ways the Australian government is recognising the needs, the hopes, the dreams and the aspirations of Australian women. Let us focus on women in the work force. Since 1996, full-time adult ordinary time earnings for women have increased in real terms-that is, after taking account of inflation-by $152 a week. That is a 21 per cent increase and represents an annual rate of growth in real earnings of 2.2 per cent. Under Labor, women's real earnings grew at an annual rate of just 0.6 per cent. The claim by Labor that the gap between male and female earnings has increased is also wrong. This can be seen in the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates of full time adult ordinary time earnings. Women's earnings have increased as a proportion of men's. The proportion has risen from 83.2 per cent in February to 84.8 per cent today, so the gap is closing, not increasing. Let us consider what has been achieved under this government's responsible economic management in relation to women's jobs. With strong economic management and the fiscal discipline shown by the Howard government, women have benefited from the creation of almost 820,000 new jobs-53 per cent of the total of more than 1.5 million new jobs created under the Howard government. This additional employment for women comprises nearly 340,000 full-time jobs and 480,000 part-time jobs. So this balance reflects the diversity of aspirations and choices of Australian women. The impact of these increasing opportunities can be seen in the rising proportion of women participating in paid work. While in 1996 49.6 per cent of Australian women were in employment, with the strong growth of the economy this is now 53.6 per cent. There has been remarkable growth in the employment of older women. Support for families with children, for women entering the work force and for women remaining in the work force has enabled so many women to choose to combine both employment and the care of their children. In my portfolio, the Ageing portfolio, the government supports women in their varying roles as carers and aged care workers. In fact, women make up 95 per cent of the aged care work force. Through increased government support, women have been able to find rewarding and challenging careers in aged care. In the last budget, over $101 million of funding was made available for increased training and education opportunities. It is a fact that most carers are women. We have increased funding for the National Respite for Carers Program fivefold. This year over $105 million is being invested in the program. All of these measures help underline the government's principle of choice for women. Unlike Labor, we believe that people should have choice in how they live and how they manage their work and their family. We do not believe in one-size-fits-all systems which tell people how to live, that they must work, that they must have children or that they should or should not do certain things. We do not believe in the nanny state. We do not believe in artificial quotas, and this is in line with what Australian women want. In this government, for the first time in Australia's history, there are now nine female ministers and parliamentary secretaries. Women from the Liberal Party side were elected first to the House of Representatives and to almost all of the state parliaments. We have a proud history of supporting women's choice and women's role in society. It was a Liberal government that introduced child endowment, that introduced the first national child-care office, that first recognised the rights of married pensioners in the tax system and that introduced private health insurance provision. On the international front, we can be proud that Australian women now hold 19 high commission positions. (Time expired)",46
129,Ms BIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would like to respond to a few comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Curtin. I suggest to the member for Curtin that, if we want to conduct a debate on International Women's Day around issues of who promotes women and who wins ballots in parties, the Liberal Party is indeed-as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, would appreciate-not always the best example. Much of the member for Curtin's speech, where she focused on choice and the importance that the Howard government places on the concept of choice, reflected a lot of statistics and amounts of money and not much of the reality and the challenges faced by many of the families we deal with in our electorates. I welcome the opportunity to address the subject of this debate on matters of public importance today, International Women's Day. There are so many areas in which the ability of Australian women to participate fully and effectively in our communities and our nation has suffered significantly under the Howard government's policies. The Howard government constantly trumpet their two magic words-‘choice' is one of them; the other is ‘flexibility'-and tell us how much joy and sunshine these two principles bring into the lives of Australian families. is obvious from the real experience of families that all that has been achieved is that greater pressure has been placed on the ability of families to balance their work commitments and provide quality time for their family needs. One of the most serious failures of the government has been its refusal to take on the crisis that exists in many areas in the provision of child care for working families. Indeed, the member for Curtin has just exhibited that failure again by fundamentally denying that there is in fact a problem. During the election campaign last year, the member for Throsby and I invited the shadow minister to visit our area. We did that because we needed to address the concerns that had been raised with us by so many local families. I will give just one example of the stories that were brought to us. There was a young couple we met who were very organised and proactive and who had registered for a child-care place on the day they discovered the woman was pregnant. At the time of the election they were still waiting to find a place; their child was 10 months old and the woman was to return to work in two months time. The waiting lists continue to be a real issue of concern in our area, as they are in so many other places, particularly for noughtto two-year-olds. It is interesting to note the government's speculation currently under way about requiring single mothers to return to work when their children start school. It is clear that this will place an unbearable and unrealistic demand on single mothers if they are unable to access child care. Indeed, if the existing working population is already having trouble finding child care, how much pressure will this requirement also place on the child-care providers? For many women the ‘flexible' work environment actually means casual or part-time It work that is often unpredictable in hours and unreliable in income provision. In fact, the number of women in casual work has grown by close to 19 per cent since 1996. This has no doubt contributed to the fact that since 1996 the gap between men's and women's total average wage has widened by over $300 per week. Indeed, there are reports today that the lower wages we are seeing are also causing lower superannuation savings for women, affecting the financial security of women in retirement. The other factor arising from the nature of casual work is that it severely erodes a working woman's capacity to meet the needs of her family. I have had many local women describe the difficult dilemmas they face when a child falls sick, for example. As casuals they have no access to parental leave. They do not dare refuse a shift or ring in sick, as they know that such a black mark against their name can only mean fewer shifts in future. They do not have extended family to rely on-the reality is that many grandmothers are now working and are not readily available for emergency child care. Very often their partner is also in casual or part-time work where they cannot afford the black mark of trying to get time off work when children are sick. This is the real face of flexibility in the work force, which is wrongly represented by the Howard government as the new friendly structure that allows families to negotiate family-friendly work conditions with their employers. The government so often also talks about the need for Australians to be having more children, yet over a quarter of women of child-bearing and child-rearing age are in precarious and family-unfriendly working conditions which become a major deterrent to young couples beginning families. Approximately one-third of women are in jobs where they have no rights to important entitlements such as sick leave, annual leave or compassionate leave-the very entitlements that make it possible for women to be working Australians and mothers at the same time without making heart breaking choices between those roles. I also point to the growing trend of women undertaking greater responsibility for elderly parents who are often frail and highly dependent. Many women are working, looking after the needs of their own immediate family and also trying to juggle doctors appointments, banking, shopping needs and so forth for frail or elderly parents. The shadow minister for industrial relations correctly identified today that 60 per cent of low-paid workers are women who will be seriously affected by proposals by this government to undermine the ability of the minimum wage cases to deliver some fairness to these low-paid workers. Clearly, the future for so many women workers is looking more precarious and difficult under this government. The minister for industrial relations has made it clear that fairness an important principle, apparently, for this government. You are only going to get the flexibility ‘f'; you will not get the fairness one. In recent days we have also heard much from this government about how seriously it takes skill shortages. I have been taking issue with this claim in terms of the investment in addressing the growing demand for traditional trades apprentices. I would like to take this opportunity to point out that it is also failing to deliver sufficient funding for the training of child-care workers. As an example from my own area, there were nearly 100 young people turned away from child studies courses at TAFE this year. Sixty-two had applied to complete the child-care diploma and 33 had applied for the certificate III in child care. Clearly, the government is failing to recognise, and invest to address, a future shortage in the child-care industry as well as in the traditional trades. I might say that the vast bulk of those who were turned away were young women. The other issue that we hear about constantly from child-care providers is the growing problem of recruiting workers. It is clear that the problem is not caused by any job snobbery by young people or their families, as the Prime Minister would have us believe. The problem is that funding of the TAFE sector has been frozen for so many years that young people are being turned away, even when they are looking to train in areas of skill shortage and in an industry that is critical to the capacity of families in our communities to balance their family and work commitments. The same problem I have just described for child-care training applies to the thousands of women who are turned away each year from other critical training areas such as nursing, aged care nursing and teaching. International Women's Day is obviously an is not important day on which we recognise-97 years after women in the United States first went on strike for better wages and improved workplace conditions-the importance of working to improve women's wages and working conditions. Women are constantly and loudly still calling for fairer access to education, affordable housing and health care, and working to expose the instances of abuse, neglect and discrimination in our society. To simply paint a picture that says that this side of the House is attempting to raise negatives in a time when all is sunshine and roses is an absolute indictment of this government for its inability to come to terms with the reality facing many families in our communities. Indeed, it does not take long in your electorate office talking to people about the challenges they face-such as the family that cannot get child care or the family that is trying to an aged care place for elderly parents-to realise these are very real pressures and demands on working Australian families. They are very real pressures that face women in trying to make choices between work and family. It is no surprise that young people in our community who are facing the cost of housing and health care and, indeed, the pressure to work to fund their basic lifestyle are not choosing to have families. The government constantly runs the line about the importance of young families having children so that we do not have the problems of an ageing population but walks away from the things that would fix the problem.

130,Ms LEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a pleasure to join the debate today on International Women's Day. I thank all those all over Australia and the world who are taking time to mark this very special occasion. I think it was Virginia Woolf who said, ‘As a woman I have no country, my country is the whole world.' As we used to say, the sisterhood stretches across countries, class barriers and distinctions in a way that perhaps no other connection can. I think that that is the message for today's International Women's Day, that we remember women all over the world. I urge all Australian women to reach out to women on the other side of the world, especially those who struggle with poverty and disadvantage, particularly in developing countries. We should remember and support women who have not had the advantages we have had, both in terms of living in a wealthy country and living in a society where opportunities between men and women are equal. We should remember women who have to watch their children go hungry or not receive adequate medication. As mothers, we should understand the heartache that that produces. find That should be the main message coming from this parliament and this debate today. It was disappointing to hear the member for Cunningham and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition niggle at the government over slight differences, either in policy or in philosophy. We should, as women, unite across and in spite of our political differences and recognise together how far we have come, thanks to the guts of the women who have gone before us. They made, for example, my life so easy as a woman with three children all at school, able to take my place in the parliament today and represent the people of Farrer. There are many examples opposite of women who have small children and who, in fact, have given birth while they have been members of parliament. The flexibility and the choice that they have is testimony to the society in which we live. I want today, particularly remembering that it is International Women's Day, to spare a thought for the women of Iraq and the women of Afghanistan who have laboured under some horrendous regimes. Now that democracy is being introduced to that part of the world, they can look forward to a brighter future. I remember during the regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan seeing some file footage of some men getting into the front of a station wagon and bundling the women into the back, where there were not even any seats, just like so much baggage. The horror of that picture is something to be remembered. This is not a religious biasthis is not a criticism of Islam, which is in fact very generous towards women-this is a cultural bias in these societies. We certainly saw it in the very secular Iraq under the very brutal regime of Saddam Hussein. We should spare a thought for the women who yearn to bring democracy to a post-Saddam Iraq and who are working hard to do that. These women appreciate the difference between totalitarianism and democracy, between the worlds that separate a person whose life is controlled by a tyrant and a person who can walk and talk freely. This Australian government has always had a policy of opportunity and choice for women. Recent research indicates that, since 1996, full-time adult ordinary time earnings for women have increased in real terms, after inflation, by $152 a week, which is a 21 per cent real increase in wages. I point out that statistic because those on the other side today have said that wages have somehow fallen when you compare the wages women earn to the wages men earn, and that is to be refuted. It also has to be remembered that while the aggregate wages women earn probably are less, they reflect the different lifestyle choices that women make. As an example, anecdotally, women who have been in highflying professions might choose, when they come to the child-bearing time of their life, to drop back to not working at all and then work perhaps in a part-time, less stressful so that they can devote that time to caring and sharing with their family. It is the role of governments to facilitate the choices that families make, not-as the Minister for Ageing so correctly pointed out-to be in there telling people what to do and how to live their lives. So that we should not describe the cultural characteristics of our society as being negatives for women. The fact that women choose to stay at home or leave the work force for a while in order to have and raise children or take less pressured, lower paid jobs in order to get the work and family balance right should not be a reason to condemn the government for low wages or less opportunity for women. Women in Australia 2004, the third in the Women in Australia series, was published today. I commend this publication to anyone who is interested in the state of women in society today. One of the things that was pointed out was that women do not have prominence in managerial and decision making roles. I would like to see that increase-I am sure we all would. But I suppose it is reflective of the fact that the average working life for a man is, I think, 38 years and for a woman it is 18 years. That is not a problem; it is simply a feature of the fact that women bear the children and women generally take the time off to raise them. These are cultural features of our society and they should not be something that governments in some way should try and correct, even if they could. I mentioned Women in Australia 2004. It is an excellent statistical and analytical reference publication and I commend the Office of the Status of Women for doing such a good job in conjunction, I think, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It provides a snapshot of the state of women in Australia today-the good and bad and the ugly. But job overwhelmingly I think it gives a positive picture of where we are, where we have been and where we are going. Women are living longer. The retention rate at school for year 12 girls is now 81 per cent. The proportion of women in management and decision-making roles is not as high as I would like to see it it is important but it is increasing. This particular publication highlights the story for Australian women in a range of diverse areas-management, politics, rural and regional areas. As a rural and regional member in this place, I pay tribute to the work that women do, often in isolation and in very dire financial circumstances, in my own electorate and in other rural parts of Australia as they battle life on the land, with culties that that presents and continues to present as we face year after year of low rainfall and difficult commodity prices in some areas. Of particular note in the publication Women in Australia 2004 are the significant improvements in women's employment which demonstrate the success of the government's economic policies in providing increased opportunities and rewards for participation. People talk a lot about what the government can provide. Of course it can only provide what the economy can produce. This economy over the last 10 years has seen record growth in productivity. We are now coming up against supply constraints in the economy so, in the context of the current industrial relations debate, that is what we as a government are quite rightly paying attention to. If we can remove industrial relations bottlenecks then we can make the economy more productive. We can make it easier for businesses and easier for employers and therefore easier for the people that work for them. I encounter many small businesses in my electorate overwhelmed by state government red tape. They have got to have a policy for this and a policy for that. In carrying out basic day-today activities, they have to check somehow that they are dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's. These people would love to provide the conditions that, say, a government department can-a government department which is bigger and better resourced-but they are not able to do that because they are small and they are struggling under this burden. So when we have addressed the issues of industrial relations and red tape and bottlenecks for small businesses we will then be in a position to indirectly offer the people who work in those areas a much better deal and employers will be able to be more flexible and more generall the diffious with their employees. As a government we are delivering for Australian women because we manage a strong productive economy. We provide significant family support. In her speech in this debate the Minister for Ageing demonstrated how much we provide in family tax benefits. We have provided a record number of childcare places. We understand that the work and family balance is an important agenda item for this fourth term of the Howard government. In conclusion, I urge all womenyoung, old, single, married, in the work force or out of it-on this International Women's Day to stand tall, be proud and take your place in the modern intelligent economy which you are a part of. Thank those who made it possible and think of those who have still some way to go.",51

134,Ms GILLARD,MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,"I think we would be entitled to say ‘here we are again' when dealing with medical indemvirtu- nity issues and the Howard government. It is like a perpetual version of Groundhog Day: we are back at it again, putting another patch through, another piece of medical indemnity legislation-another patch-up job that is required because they did not do the job right the first time around. I suspect that if I am feeling a little bit wearied by all of this there are probably some in the advisers box who have more cause than I to feel so. The bill which is before the House on this occasion amends legislation first implemented to address the crisis facing the medical indemnity sector in 2002-03. Specifically, the Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 seeks to correct anomalies arising from that legislation's interaction with industry practice. Labor have not at any point opposed the Howard government's patch-up jobs on medical indemnity. Indeed, we have on more than one occasion facilitated rapid passage of bills as necessary to help dig the Minister for Health and Ageing out of the medical indemnity hole he had dug for himself and then jumped into. Whilst we Reference have taken that approach with the medical (4.42 indemnity legislation, that is not to say that we do not think all of it could have been done better. We have made consistent suggestions to the government about how it ought to be done better and there will be some matters in that regard that I want to go to today. Perhaps we should all remind ourselves where this started or at least where it first got onto the government's radar. In truth, anybody with a modicum of intelligence could have seen that medical indemnity issues were going to be big and bad news for Australia, medical professionals and patients, but the Howard government-arrogant as it is, out of touch and often negligent itself when it comes to addressing public policy issuesmanaged to do nothing until the crisis burbled up in a way that it could not ignore. That first happened in November 2001 when Australia's main medical defence organisation, UMP, failed to fund $460 million worth of incurred but not reported claimsreferred to in the trade as IBNR claims‘incurred' meaning the adverse medical event which caused an injury has happened but that the injury has not been reported. viously, in many examples of medical misadventure there will be long lead times before even the patient recognises that there has been an injury or the true loss flowing from the injury can be assessed. Perhaps a good example of that is a baby who is injured due to some form of medical negligence at the time of birth. It will not be sible to assess the full dimensions of the pact on the child or the adult for many years and obviously there are statutory issues about when that infant can sue and has legal capacity. So in any sense of dealing with medical indemnity issues there are also a significant number of incurred but not reported claims, and it was in relation to the funding of such anticipated liabilities that UMP basically said, ‘We can't cope.' UMP was at that stage Australia's biggest medical defence organisation and significantly covered doctors in New South Wales as well as in other parts of the country. In December 2001 UMP increased its premiums by 52 per cent on average to cope with the crisis. However, for obstetricians and neurosurgeons this increase was as high as 123 per cent. In February 2002 UMP also faced pressure by the prudential regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, to raise additional capital to meet minimum capital requirements and APRA gave UMP until 30 June 2002 to raise over $30 million to meet these requirements. Finally, the crisis was in an unignorable form, even though the Howard government had gone on in their blithe and arrogant way of ignoring the real issues that affect Australia and certainly ignoring public policy issues which were on the horizon. In health they never do anything until there is an absolutely unavoidable crisis either of a political or true health policy dimension. But this crisis threatened to be one of both a political and a health policy dimension as it became clear Ob- that doctors might end up uncovered and uninsured and therefore unwilling to practise if UMP failed-or, if UMP struggled on, it would be in circumstances where doctors, particularly people in high-risk specialties, would be picking up enormous additional loads of medical indemnity premiums and would be looking for a way to pass the inposcreased costs on either to government as a im- funder of medical services or, more particularly, to patients. In circumstances of an uncertain environment, another effect is that people in high-risk specialties pull back from doing the high-risk end of the work and choose to solely practise in the lower risk end of the work. So, for example, many obstetricians indicated that they intended to practise only as gynaecologists and not as obstetricians because of the additional medical negligence issues that arise when one is practising in obstetrics. So with this crisis finally on the government's radar, the government reacted by intervening on 28 March 2002 to provide a short-term guarantee of up to $35 million to enable UMP to meet its minimum capital requirements as required by APRA. Then in April 2002 UMP unsuccessfully sought further assistance from the Howard government to enable its directors to get personal liability insurance. On 29 April 2002 UMP filed for provisional liquidation, and a provisional liquidator was appointed on 3 May 2002. The main objectives of the provisional liquidator were to determine the company's solvency and ability to continue trading, so the crisis was gathering momentum at that point. Finally, the Prime Minister made a commitment to ensure that, in the event of provisional liquidation, doctors who were members of UMP would be covered whilst a solution was developed to the medical indemnity crisis. The Prime Minister was blithely promising at that time that it would be a long-term solution. Here we stand all these wearying years of the medical indemnity saga later and we certainly cannot report that the Howard government has managed to stumble over a long-term solution to the medical indemnity crisis. On 28 April 2002 the then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer announced that the Howard government would guarantee claims arising from any procedures from 29 April to 30 June 2002, with those procedures being undertaken by doctors covered by UMP, and that it would legislate this guarantee and assist in determining the long term viability of UMP. So there we have it: UMP staggering to a provisional liquidation point and the Howard government stepping in and saying, ‘Well, we'll at least fix that the short term and we'll have a think about the longer term.' Understandably, the AMA and doctors covered by UMP were unsatisfied by the Howard government's guarantees and there was a climate of great uncertainty. In that climate doctors were necessarily thinking of some drastic steps such as leaving their profession entirely, leaving the high-risk end of their profession or postponing surgery until they knew, with more certainty, what the environment would be. There were then some exchanges of letters between the Howard government and affected doctors. In that environment, the guarantee that was offered by the Howard government was finally approved by the courts in June 2002. This approval included an extension of the guarantee until 31 December 2002. The government also agreed to assume responsibility for the IBNR claims where the incident giving rise to the claim occurred before 30 June 2003. The Howard government indicated that it would impose a levy on members of UMP so it could recoup the amount that it had guaranteed it would cover because of the crisis that UMP had got itself into. So we have Australia's major medical defence organisation basically not able to meet its liabilities and certainly not able to meet liabilities which will be incurred in the fullness of time as incurred claims are reported. In those circumstances the Howard government finally manages to say, ‘We'll pick up the financial obligation for those liabilities'-which was around $460 million-‘and in exchange for that we will levy doctors over the medium term and make something that looks like our money back.' As many members of this House would recall, because many electorates would have had patients affected by this crisis, when the Howard government moved to impose the levy there was a highly adverse reaction in from doctors, and understandably so. There was little warning to individual doctors about what was going to happen next. Doctors around the country, but particularly in New South Wales, were opening up levy notices which imposed on them huge additional liabilities. They were necessarily very concerned about that and many of them were in the circumstance where they were going to down tools, close wards and walk off the job. It was in the face of that crisis that the Howard government had to react again. Perhaps many of us would remember that, after the current Minister for Health and Ageing was appointed on 29 September 2003, one of the first things on his desk to do was to resolve this re-emerging medical indemnity crisis. A deal was struck with doctors and a high-level panel was created to talk about medical indemnity issues and seek a resolution. So we were in a situation where there was backing and filling and patching, and it was still a question of crisis. In that environment, Minister Abbott was necessarily trying to strike a deal to ensure that tors did not desert wards full of patients cause they were so concerned about their medical indemnity position. Faced with this crisis, what did the Howard government do? Obviously some changes were made to levy arrangements which found greater favour with doctorsyou could not characterise the doctors as having ended up happy in this set of arrangements-than the originally proposed arrangements. Then there was a series of other things added to try and pacify doctors and deal with the medical indemnity crisis. One of the things implemented was the medical indemnity premium subsidy scheme. This was about subsidising the premiums for obstetricians, procedural GPs, neurosurgeons and GP registrars undertaking procedural training. Typical of the Groundhog Day backing and filling and patching that has beset this area, that scheme in its original iteration was changed in 2004 to strike a new formula for the way the premium subsidy scheme would work in relation to doctors' gross incomes. The government also implemented the High Cost Claims Scheme to further reduce pressure on medical defence organisations. Under this scheme, 50 per cent of insurance payouts over $500,000 are reimbursed to medical indemnity providers. The government also struck a run-off cover arrangement. That was necessary because a part of the suite of changes that came into effect following the crisis manifesting itself was that the whole medical indemnity set of arrangements moved from offering doctors cover on a claims incurred basis to a claims made basis. So in the past a doctor who was in practice, say, from the age of 30 to 65 could be insured for each of the years that he or she was employed. Presuming that each year they had been working they had purchased claims incurred cover, if there was a claim that was reported when that doctor docwas in retirement at 68 or 72 or 75-or even be- if that doctor was deceased and the family was then in charge of the doctor's estatethe claims incurred cover that the doctor had paid for whilst in work was satisfactory to meet their obligation under that claim. When the medical indemnity industry moved across to claims made cover, as it did in the course of this set of changes, it meant that, if the claim was not made in the period that you were working and paying your premiums and you had not made any further arrangements, you could end up with a claim being incurred at a time that you were uninsured. For example, a doctor who was involved in an adverse medical event when they were 62 might find that the incident was not reported until they were 72 and out of the work force and no longer insured. As a result of that, there was a need for run-off cover to cover the set of arrangements where doctors had left the work force. There are obviously a variety of circumstances in which doctors can leave the work force. They can leave the work force because they have wholly retired, because they are moving into their older years and no longer want to work. They can move from the work force because of disability. They can move from the work force because of maternity. They can move from the work force because they have died. They can move from the work force because they have given up being a medical practitioner and gone into some other line of work. The government has obviously found in the original iteration of the run-off cover arrangements that the definitions of when this cover was going to apply and to whom it was going to apply were insufficient, and this bill deals with the clarification of some of those arrangements. This bill also deals with another of the schemes put on to patch the medical indemnity crisis. That scheme was the Exceptional Claims Scheme, previously known as the blue sky scheme. The scheme applies when a doctor sustains a claim above $20 million-that is, a claim above an amount for which the doctor has insurance. That means that the Commonwealth will step in and pay the difference between the $20 million and whatever the claim is. Whilst that has offered doctors some theoretical reassurance, as far as I am advised there has never been a claim of that order in Australia. I think the highest was a $14 million claim, which may then have been revised downwards on appeal. Obviously an anxiety amongst doctors, having seen a highvalue money claim in the order of $14 million, was that they could end up being exposed to liabilities that topped out beyond insurable levels. That is what the Exceptional Claims Scheme was about. All in all, the bill we have before us other patch on the run-off cover arrangements; it is another patch on the Exceptional Claims Scheme arrangements. I think it adds to three other bills in medical indemnity that I have dealt with in the time that I have been shadow minister for health, and each of them has been about patching on a patch to try and fix the medical indemnity problem. As I have had cause to remark in the House before, it did not need to be like this. And why didn't it need to be like this? It did not need to be like this because a more prudent government would have seen the medical indemnity problems emerging and it would have got in first-not responded to a crisis after it had occurred. If the government had got in first then obviously it could have consulted. It could have better structured and better managed arrangements rather than waiting for a crisis, whacking down a solution, finding that solution was unsatisfactory and whacking down another solution and so on, which is what has happened with medical indemnity. Did you need to be Nostradamus to see the medical indemnity crisis coming? Did you need to have a crystal ball of considerable power in front of you? No, you most certainly did not. All you needed to do when you were sworn into office in 1996 as a Howard government minister was to read the reports sitting on your desk. If the then minister for health, Dr Michael Wooldridge, had put himself through that process, he would have found sitting on his desk the Tito report-a report by Ms Fiona Tito, who had been asked by the outgoing Labor government to report on medical indemnity issues because the outgoing Labor government realised that medical indemnity was going to be a major issue. In some senses we do not know whether Dr Michael Wooldridge got round to clearing is anthat section of his desk or whether he did clear that section of his desk and decided to do nothing. Whilst we might not have great insight into everything Dr Michael Wooldridge did in the days after the swearing-in of the Howard government when he was looking at what was on the desk, we do know from his own words that he is very proud of not having done very much in this area of policy. At a conference at the University of Melbourne in 2003, Dr Michael Wooldridge, who had been minister for health for nearly six years after the Tito report would have crossed his desk, said: As Minister, I was accused of doing far too little on medical indemnity. That's completely unfair. I did absolutely nothing whatsoever. So there it is in the former minister's own words. It is not something that I said; it is something that anybody presently in this chamber said. There is the former minister's own summation of his performance in this area when he was minister. He is proudly saying in a humorous formulation of words that he did absolutely nothing whatsoever to deal with the medical indemnity crisis. What has been the consequence of the Howard government doing ‘absolutely nothing whatsoever' until the crisis was such that they needed to scramble and act, because doctors were packing in their medical practices or walking off the job because of their medical indemnity exposure? It has certainly been lots of legislative time of this parliament as we have legislated, re-legislated and legislated again to try and get this right. It has been hundreds of millions of dollars, not all of it easily tracked and added up because it has been over a number of financial years. Hundreds of millions of dollars have flowed from the Howard government into the various patch-up schemes and, of course, the original bailout of UMP. One can only believe-and I am sure this is the case-that, if the Howard government had reacted in a timely way and had devised a policy solution that was going to work before the crisis was a crisis, it could have been addressed for a far cheaper sum. The real underlying work that is needed to be done to resolve medical indemnity issues remains undone, despite all of this-despite legislation. It is a perpetual Groundhog Day, where we talk about medical indemnity despite many growing old and grey puzzling over the issue. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars of Howard government expenditure, some things remain completely unaddresed and unfixed that could make a real difference. One of those obviously is the question of not quality control and the quality of care in our medical system. There is always going to be human error in any system that involves human beings, but most people in the medical area say that with a better focus on quality control we could limit medical misadventure, and that not only avoids human tragedies, death and disability but feeds into medical indemnity issues. The data in this area tends to be old, but it is the best we have. Data from 1999 shows that 16.6 per cent of the 14,000 hospital admissions in New South Wales and South Australia resulted in disability or a longer hospital stay than was necessary. The adverse events were due to ‘a wide range of human and system based failures' and half of these adverse events were considered preventable. Similar data from the UK and USA shows that adverse events are at 10 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively as a percentage of total admissionsnot 16.6 per cent. To draw a parallel with the airline industry which is often made: if one applied the UK rate of ‘misprescribing' of antibiotics for respiratory infection to an equivalent error rate in flying planes, there would be a thousandfold increase in the risk in dying in a plane crash. Our rate is significantly worse than the UK rate. In those circumstances there clearly is major policy work to be done on quality and quality control across our health and medical system. That is not something that the Howard government has bothered itself with. The Howard government has also not bothered itself with structuring a system to deal with people who have long term care costs from having sustained a catastrophic injury. The issue of caring for those people arises whether or not the cause of their catastrophic injury was medical misadventure or some other problem. To conclude my remarks in this debate, can I say that the obvious new challenge in medical indemnity-one that the Howard government needs to face up to and one that flows from the patch-up jobs and the perpetual Groundhog Day that we have been through in this policy area-is a competitive neutrality issue of considerable consequence. In November 2004, news stories confirmed that UMP, the company that was going to go under, had reduced premiums. News of this caused outrage amongst other medical indemnity providers, who have not been subject to the same level of assistance from which UMP has benefited since it was bailed out. The circumstance now is that UMP members will enjoy premium reductions of up to 30 per cent a year. The Howard government has tipped out all these buckets of money to try to fix UMP. UMP is now offering its members premium reductions as a result of having been a beneficiary of these buckets of money and the other medical defence organisations are saying, ‘What about us? We did not get the same bucketload of money, so we cannot reduce premiums the way UMP is reducing premiums, and that raises a competitive neutrality issue because it obviously means we are disadvantaged in the marketplace when we go to doctors and say, “Buy your medical defence product from us, not from UMP.”' Treasury is currently reviewing the competitive neutrality issues in the medical indemnity sector. Some medical indemnity providers have expressed concerns about competitive neutrality issues as a result of the way in which the government has provided assistance. Treasury's inquiry will examine the competitive advantages in the medical indemnity industry arising from measures undertaken by the Australian government specifically to assist medical indemnity providers since 29 April 2002. This is an important review of an important issue. The review is supposed to be analysing the forms of government assistance and their interactions, assessing the implications for competitive neutrality and assessing what has happened with competitive advantages as a result. That assessment is going to extend to possible advantages such as savings on reinsurance or capital servicing costs. We look forward to that report, which is due on 15 March 2005-not many days from where we are now.",56
135,Dr EMERSON,MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,The ides of March.,62
136,Ms GILLARD,MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,"The ides of March, as I am reminded. Maybe there is some significance in that, but I am not exactly sure what in this context. We could be going on about Brutus and the like. But when that report is due we will be pressing the Howard government for its release and we will be pressing the Howard government for timely answers as to what will happen next in the medical indemnity debate so that we do not find ourselves here, sitting session after sitting session, yet again helping the Howard government dig itself out of its mess on medical indemnity issues.",62
137,Mr TUCKEY,MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,"O'Connor) (5.12 p.m.)During her speech on the Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 the member for Lalor used words to the effect that it does not need to be like this-a prudent government would have got in first. Of course, we lacked an expert on what was going to happen, which she might have been in her previous life when she and the firm for which she worked were the cause of the problem. The reality was that, until the plaintiff lawyers got into ambulance-chasing, the prudential management of UMP and other medical indemnity providers was excellent. They had a long history of the sorts of claims with which they had to deal and it was only when the American disease arrived in this country that those indemnity organisations were unable to manage. Yes, this government should have rung her and her partners up at Slater and Gordon, or wherever it was, and said, ‘What are your plans for the future so we can be ready for it when you extract $20 million in a single claim?' To this date, they have not told us how much the legal profession kept, but I think Premier Carr on one occasion suggested that it could be over 50 per cent. The reality is that this is a problem of bulance-chasing. If we want any evidence of that, the tort reforms that have been implemented, the capping of some claims and the limiting of some claims have created a real problem-a crisis, in fact-for property developers. I read in the paper the other day that it is becoming very hard to collect the rent in bar chambers. The barristers have got no work because there has been a collapse in the market by tens of thousands of claims of this nature. We have got to look at the reality of the American disease which is fast approaching this country. As you go to the outpatients clinic on your way out after some medical process, you are confronted by people with clipboards who go through a checklist with you and, if you have missed anything under the contingency requirements, they offer on a no-cost basis to pursue an action for you. Capping of claims and some of these reforms are not unique to Australia. Certain American states undertook this process some years ago and the percentage cost of delivering health care in those states is less as a consequence-not because of the payouts to the ambulance chasers but because medical practitioners feel they no longer have to tect themselves from this avaricious arrangement by prescribing every conceivable service by way of tests and other things to make sure, if at some future time a problem arises, they cannot be accused of not taking every opportunity of care. And, of course, the pathology clinics have been one of the greatest investments in history since that issue arose. The reality is that we are told by a practitioner in that field that we ought to have been ready for it. She knew we ought to have been ready for it, but there was no reason that the government of the day-and she mentioned Michael Wooldridge-should have had to have been involved. The other issue that has got to be conamfronted in these matters is that old, old saying that there is no such thing as a free lunch. What we are talking about here is government having to spread across all taxpayers a cost that was relevant to the claims of a few and beyond the resources of medical practitioners. We remember well and truly the debate on bulk-billing. If ever there was an attack on bulk-billing, it was the massive increase in medical indemnity insurance policies. Of course medical practitioners had to increase their fees and of course the general public pay, as they are paying for what the government has been forced to do, to literally keep medical practitioners in business. It is ridiculous to say that the government got it wrong. The government did have to deal with a crisis-a crisis that was not evident until the ambulance chasers got into the business. In doing so, it has had to make adjustments over time. This legislation is further work in progress as to how we deal with various circumstances as issues arise. I well remember drawing to the minister's attention the great consideration that comes with the major aspects of this legislation as it refers to ROCS-the issue of people who have left the industry. This was a significant pro- problem in my electorate where a very high percentage of locums who were servicing and giving some respite to single-person practices were coming from overseas. The AMA in Western Australia were great recruiters. They actually campaigned and offered this opportunity as a sort of a holiday in Western Australia where young practitioners from other parts of the world could give locum services and, in the process, see the country. Many were taking that opportunity but, as things stood originally, arguably in leaving the country they had to pay insurance premiums here in Australia for the next 20 years. That of course was unacceptable and in fact was drying up that particular opportunity. This legislation has recognised the aspect of certain people-younger women and others-leaving the profession for the reasons that have been mentioned by the member for Lalor. As a consequence, it is better legisla- closed down. tion. I am pleased that, by regulation, we have addressed the issue of locums from other countries operating around Australia and particularly in rural areas. There is nothplaintiff ing wrong with these measures. They do not warrant criticism, other than to say it is a great pity that they ever have to be implemented. I have spoken in this place before and attracted some criticism, but I am prepared to say again that I cannot understand how money can fix any sort of problem. The payment of money, as compensation for loss of income by a breadwinner in a family and things of that nature where negligence of whatever sort has prevailed, is of course quite proper, but in so many cases the suing of medical practitioners-particularly where a death was involved and the person concerned was not a breadwinner-in my mind is an unfair burden on the rest of society. None of these things allows for the materialisation of money. Somebody has to pay and, as we speak today on these measures, the Australian taxpayer will pay or will lose some other benefit. The question is: how should we deal with medical negligence? Why does money absolve it? Why, in circumstances I think we will see less of today, should a medical practitioner stand up and say, ‘Yes, I was negligent, let the insurance company pay'? If they are negligent, why are they still practising? Either they are negligent or they are not. Negligence, particularly if it has happened more than once, should raise a question about their entitlement to practise. I can see the sense in that. But why does a bit of money fix it, and why should the wider community have to pay that money, as they do in every case, either through the fees they pay on a consultation or through the tax system? The only certainty is that if the government had not intervened in the way that it did most medical practitioners would have If we think that the issue is lost in this regard, we should realise just how much difficulty this attack on the medical profession by lawyers has caused. It is virtually impossible, outside a couple of the larger cities in my electorate, to get a local doctor to deliver a baby. I put forward a very interesting photograph to get more rural childcare assistance. The photograph was of two little kids-I think they were aged three and two-who were spending the entire day with their father in the cabin of a harvester, a header, because their mother was away in Perth to have her third child delivered. It could not be done locally. She could not be at home with the kids and hop in the car in the normal fashion and go into the local hospital to have the child delivered. They could not find medical practitioners who would pay the insurance premiums relative to what was once, if you like, bread and butter for a local practitioner. The first thing these doctors did was to deliver the local babies, many of whom can be delivered without any great risk. But you never know what the risk is now. The turnover of doctors, which again is heavily subsidised by local authorities and the local people, is such that they cannot expect to pay the sorts of premiums associated with one of the fundamentally more simple medical procedures in a high percentage of cases. So I welcome this legislation. I congratulate the minister and the government on, as I say, work in progress as issues have arisen. I am quite interested in the reference of the member for Lalor to competitive neutrality. Of course that should apply. My briefing papers suggest that these days we are talking about medical indemnity insurers, MIIs, as those who are covered by these measures. In other words, it is not just UMP, although I well understand that there was originally a very substantial grant made to UMP to keep it afloat. I think these measures today deal with all practitioners, where they receive a subsidy when their premium costs exceed 7½ per cent of their revenue and where assistance is given to their insurer when claims exceed $300,000. As I understand it, these matters today are not specific to UMP, notwithstanding that they were the first we had to save. So, again, the legislation has moved on. I will conclude my remarks at this stage, considering that other members need the opportunity to speak, but I repeat that the criticism from the member for Lalor is a bit like the pot calling the kettle black. She could have advised us soundly when she was still in the profession and did not bother to do so.",62
138,Dr EMERSON,MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,"Rankin) (5.26 p.m.)The medical indemnity insurance crisis has been emerging since the mid-1990s. The Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 before us today is yet another attempt to patch up a crisis that could well have been avoided. It is a crisis in which doctors have threatened to walk out of hospitals, and in some cases they have done exactly that. It is a crisis in which many doctors have seriously considered abandoning their professions. At a time in Australia's history when highly skilled, professional doctors are so scarce, it would be a national tragedy if those doctors carried out those threats. But they were confronted with some chilling realities. One reality was that doctors who had spent so many years not only training for a basic medical degree at university but also training further to achieve the high levels of specialisation and skills that they possessed could be confronted with awful circumstances and therefore have to leave. It would have been a tragedy for our country if that had happened. Yet it was a very serious risk. It was not an idle threat. They were confronted with soaring medical indemnity insurance premiums and unconscionable risks to their own incomes not only as practising medical professionals but also in circumstances where they may have retired and a successful claim was lodged against them several years after their retirement for a procedure that they performed during their working life. The government, confronted with this crisis, has lurched from one stop-gap measure to another. This is in fact the fourth piece of legislation in which the government has sought another stop-gap measure to try to deal with a crisis that it could have avoided. One attempt by this government was to cover through legislation the circumstances where a doctor had subsequently left the work force, the circumstances that I have just described. This is called run-off cover. The definitions of run-off cover in previous bills have proved to be deficient. This bill attempts to rectify those deficiencies. We hope that this is the last time that legislation will be needed to do that. We will be supporting this legislation in the hope that it will prove to be effective. I said that this legislation could have been avoided. Indeed, the entire medical indemnity insurance crisis was entirely avoidable. A responsible government would have seen this crisis coming. It did not need any powers of clairvoyance. It did not need to read the tea-leaves. All it needed to do was to read a report. It simply needed to read a report that was on the desk of the incoming health minister, Dr Michael Wooldridge, in March 1996. That report was prepared by Fiona Tito in response to concerns of the outgoing Labor government that this crisis was beginning to emerge. Yet again, we have a story of a Labor government understanding the development of a problem and seeking to act on it before it became a crisis. The government changed and the incoming minister ignored that report. To this day, we do not know fully the circumstances of his ignoring the report. We do not know whether he read the report and dismissed it or, alternatively, whether he failed to read it altogether. But we do know that the minister was entirely unrepentant. Indeed, he boasted of his failure to act on the medical indemnity insurance crisis, telling a conference at the University of Melbourne in 2003: ... I was accused of doing far too little on indemnity. That's completely unfair. I did absolutely nothing whatsoever. What a scandal that a health minister could be so proud of his wilful negligence, and what an irony when medical indemnity insurance issues can surround allegations of negligence. I certainly make the allegation of negligence against the then health minister, Dr Michael Wooldridge. At that conference at Melbourne University he pleaded guilty to negligence and boasted about it. The consequences of the negligence of the Howard government in relation to the Tito report have been quite horrendous. This is the fourth piece of legislation, and the cost associated with those four pieces of legislation has run into hundreds of millions of dollars. Much of that government spending was entirely avoidable. It has also had horrendous human consequences and consequences for the viability of our health professionals and our highly skilled doctors. As in all aspects of health policy, prevention is far better and far cheaper than a cure. This government should have applied that philosophy in handling a crisis that it knew was emerging. It could have prevented that crisis; instead it has sought to cure the crisis through a series of bandaid measures. There are issues of quality control in our public hospitals. Evidence has been presented that almost 17 per cent of procedures and admissions have gone wrong in some way or another at some state hospitals. Now there is a new challenge in relation to medical indemnity insurance, and it is the one to which the member for Lalor referred. It appears that UMP-the business that was about to go under-has in fact reduced its premiums after receiving huge financial support from the Howard government. That has put other insurers-competitors to UMP-in an invidious position. UMP stands to gain market share assisted by massive subsidies from medical the Commonwealth of Australia at the expense of insurance companies that adopted more prudent practices and were not the beneficiaries of such largesse from the government. So much for the government's commitment to competitive neutrality and national competition policy reforms. Fred Hilmer would be appalled at the government's management of this issue. A report by Treasury has been scheduled for release, we understand, on 15 March-in just a couple of weeks time. The member for O'Connor said in his contribution to this debate just a moment ago that this legislation is further work in progress. That is a very ominous statement for the member for O'Connor to make. We will be interested to see what the Commonwealth does, in response to this report, about the very clear evidence that the principle of competitive neutrality has been violated by the government's handling of the medical indemnity insurance crisis and by the financial support that it has provided to UMP. This is yet another example of the mismanagement of the Australian health system by the Howard government. Many will recall that the previous coalition government that ruled from 1975 to 1983-a seven-year period-had seven different health policies in those seven years. The one commitment that the government had was to the dismantling of Medibank, the Labor creation of the previous period. Mr Entsch-Medicare.",65
139,Dr EMERSON,MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,"It was Medibank, not Medicare. The government did indeed dismember Medibank, but it did not know what to put in its place so it made seven different decisions in seven years. It took the incoming Hawke government to address the situation where two million Australians were without insurance cover. Some of those Australians who then did get admitted to hospital had their hospital expenses covered by a benevolent hospital. But it is completely unacceptable in a modern society for two million Australians to be living without the knowledge that they have insurance cover against some bad health experience. Medicare, introduced by the Hawke government, ensured universal health insurance. Those two million Australians could breathe and live a bit more easily upon the election of the Hawke government. The trouble is that this government does not believe in Medicare. It does not believe in a public health insurance system. Indeed, the Prime Minister said just a couple of years ago that he recalls the health system that was in placeMr Laming- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order on the grounds of relevance. I am not sure the history of the health system prior to medical indemnity dispute is relevant to the debate of the bill today.",67
140,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,"The member for Bowman raises a point of relevance. The debate has ranged widely and continues to. I think it is within the parameters that are allowed, but I will continue to listen.",67
141,Dr EMERSON,MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am talking about health insurance cover. I certainly would have expected the member for Bowman to understand that health insurance cover to Australians is entirely relevant to this debate because we are in fact discussing medical indemnity insurance, and I am speaking about the issue of health insurance cover more generally. I pointed out that in the period since this government has been elected the Prime Minister has not been committed to a national health insurance scheme. He in fact referred publicly, just some time ago, to the system that was in place before the introduction of Medibank, before 1972. The Prime Minister declared that he believed that to be a very good system, a system which did not provide health insurance cover for all Australians. So where to from here in respect of insurance and the provision of affordable quality health care to Australians? The health minister before the last election attacked Labor on the basis of assertions that Labor supported the pooled funding system for health care in Australia. He described it as a $60 billion behemoth. Yet, straight after the election, the health minister said that it would be a good idea if the states gave their hospital systems to the Commonwealth so that there would be a pool of Commonwealth funds covering both hospitals and aged care. The irony here is that this was the fundamental philosophy behind Medicare Gold-an arrangement where there would not be cost-shifting between the Commonwealth and the states in respect of health and aged care. At present, hospitals are a joint responsibility and aged care is a federal responsibility. There is an ongoing problem of cost-shifting as one level of government seeks to push patients into the care of another level of government. The truth of the matter is that the health minister himself is advocating a pooled funding arrangement. Yet the Prime Minister has said: ‘No, it is not going to happen. There will be no transfer of hospitals to the Commonwealth.' I understand why the Prime Minister would do that. Every day we see in the media reports of hospital waiting lists and the occasional horror story in hospitals. Probably the Prime Minister thinks it would not be a very clever idea for the Commonwealth to be taking responsibility for those adverse news stories. There is certainly a conflict over this between the Prime Minister and the health minister. I do note that the New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, thought it was a pretty good idea to give the running of hospitals to the Commonwealth. This has to be the most centralist government that the Australian people have experienced. The health minister says he wants to take over hospital cover, and we know what is happening with industrial relations and other areas. If it did happen, the Commonwealth could pool funds for hospitals and aged care. But in my view, if there were to be any sort of pooled funding model, there would need to be provision for copayments-that is, not copayments by those who lack the capacity to pay but by those who have the financial capacity to pay. I refer to a model that is in practice in United States, one of the more free enterprise nations on this earth. It is called Kaiser manente. In that model, which is an operating model, there is a pooling of funds to cover an integrated health care system that includes health promotion programs, prevention, early diagnosis, primary care, hospital care and aged care. The virtue of Kaiser Permanente is that there is always an incentive to seek the most cost-effective solution. We know that prevention is more costeffective than cure. Indeed, the diseases that kill most Australians are largely preventable. In the land of free enterprise a pooled funding arrangement applies. Across the Tasman pooled funding arrangements apply; the New Zealand government has introduced a pooled funding system. That now covers more than 50 per cent of New Zealand citizens. Significantly, that New Zealand system does involve copayments. An opportunity exists for the federal government-now that it has been re-elected and does not necessarily have to attack Labor with assertions that it was supportive of the pooled funding arrangement-to overhaul federal-state relations in relation to Australia's health system. I call on the government to take on the reform mantle that is needed there. Although our health system is one of the very best in the world, we are confronted with the challenges of the ageing of the population. In 40 years time, if current projections turn out to be broadly correct, there will be four million more Australians over the age of 65. Four million more Australians over the age of 65 means a lot more health care and a lot more age care. It is at this moment that we should be looking at reforms of our health system to ensure they are sustainable; otherwise, through avoidable problems, health expenditure, including medical indemnity insurance, will become a big challenge and an enormous drain on our rethe sources-absorbing resources that could be used instead to ensure that every young perPer- son in Australia has the same life chances, irrespective of whether they come from disadvantaged or wealthy backgrounds. I will conclude by saying that we will support this legislation. The statements made by those on the government side that it is a work in progress are ominous. We have had four pieces of legislation already. We await the report from Treasury on competitive neutrality and we hope and pray that the next piece of legislation that comes into this parliament on medical indemnity insurance will be the last.",67
142,Mr LAMING,MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,"I rise today to support the Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2005, which makes modifications to a series of medical indemnity arrangements in this country. I am compelled to comment on the contributions from the members opposite, hopefully before the member for Rankin leaves. What has been demonstrated from both contributions is a staggering vacuum in fine details and proposals for what the opposition in government would have done with the medical indemnity crisis. What we have so far from two contributions is effectively drawing the Labor wagons into a circle, holding the Tito report above their heads with everyone else pointing at it and saying, ‘That's what we would have done to fix the problem.' We know they had a penchant for asking for inquiries and reports, but it is an incredidriven bly simplistic approach. We know that an enormous amount of those dues that accumulated under UMP did so between 1983 and 1996. I also suspect that a great proportion of the profession would be thankful it was our government on the watch at the time that a solution had to be found. Today's bill demonstrates responsiveness and communication with the profession in an incredibly difficult piece of indemnity legislation. Many of the health workers could really only imagine at the time this was happening that a solution could be found in the short term. UMP was representing 60 per cent of doctors. We were in crisis at that time. I remember the early nineties when we were already aware of that situation evolving but there was no solution to be found. In response to this crisis the government has rolled out a series of measures to alleviate the upward pressure on insurance premiums and the unsustainable operating environment that insurers had to work within. I did not want to cast the first political stone in this debate, but for the shadow health spokesperson to comment that we were legislating, re-legislating and legislating again-‘patching up and bailing out'-and then to propose that the alternative was to simply focus more on quality in health care is, I think, overly simplistic. Every developed economy is focusing on quality in health care. We have a National Institute of Clinical Studies that does just that. An enormous amount of resources are committed by the federal government, and we are in step with what is happening in the US and the UK. The comment that a possible alternative for the federal government was structuring the long-term care arrangements for those who are catastrophically injured again misunderstands that this crisis was inherently by a combined state and federal issue. We had the capping and the controlling of tort law reform being predominantly a state issue, yet with the federal government effectively wearing the problem. So, in this federalist environment, a solution was never going to be easy. It really did have to reach a point in the crisis where all players were motivated to act. I do not take this opportunity to criticise state governments. I think they made a reasonable effort across the board, in their own ways and in their own time, to find a solution to tort law reform. Today I will touch briefly on the four areas where minor improvements have been made. We have already alluded to the run-off cover indemnity scheme. Let me give a background on that scheme. Traditionally, doctors were using a claims based approach and not an incurred based approach. We know that in insurance, once medical indemnity came under the Insurance Act 1973, they were expected to move to a claims incurred arrangement, which meant that the insurance had to cover not just events that occurred in the period with which one was insured but for long after. In medical indemnity, it is enormously difficult to predict how you have to set your premiums for events many years, if not decades, into the future. The agreement was to fall back to a claims based approach, to allow doctors to insure in that way; and for the government to step in-in this case the Commonwealth-with a run-off cover indemnity arrangement, where the government assisted and bore some of the responsibility for that long-term cover. A doctor now with a claims based policy can leave practice and retire safe, knowing that that arrangement is in place. A doctor who is pregnant can leave with maternity leave and take care of her child and, as long as she is not practising, know that that cover is available. Finally, someone who is permanently disabled or suffers a major injury that prevents them from practising can also have that security. The Commonwealth also reimburses the medical indemnity providers for the costs of managing that run-off scheme. But keep in mind that the cost of that scheme is around 8.5 per cent-or, in UMP's case, 9.5 per cent-of the cost of the total amount of the premium. It is a large amount. So what is changing? The eligible run-off claim for doctors who have some but not total cover means that they are now protected. If a doctor has coverage for obstetrics but carries a gynaecological procedure, and down the track finds that they are not covered for that procedure, the run-off cover will protect them, so long as they had some level of insurance and were practising in a prudent manner. In schedule 1, items 17 and 18 prevent double counting of that support payment. That is important so that this run-off scheme payment is not included in the premium outcome upon which that payment is calculated. That provides enormous reassurance to those who are leaving the profession, and particularly those who are retiring. The High Cost Claims Scheme addresses an issue that has been of enormous concern to the medical profession. The solution found by the Commonwealth was that, for all claims over $300,000, the Commonwealth would assist with 50 per cent of the cost. That reduces the cost of insurers finding reinsurance. That exerts a downward pressure on insurance coverage because many of the insurers were having difficulty matching their level of reinsurance-the degree to which they go around and obtain secondary cover-with setting the level of their premium. This scheme will help enormously. It now gives insurers a 12-month waiting period after it is entered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments to apply any decrease in that percentage payable for an eligible high-cost claim. It effectively makes it easier for medical insurers. All of these amendments, small as they are, are bringing more closely into alignment the work of medical insurers with community practice. Another change is to the Exceptional Claims Scheme. As I have already said, once medical indemnity fell under the Insurance Act 1973, medical indemnity cover provided to doctors contained a cap of $20 million or $25 million on the amount of damages that may be paid under the policy. Obviously out some doctors realised they would be financially exposed if an award were to be made to a patient in excess of that amount. That put them in a difficult position of potentially being personally liable for certain amounts in a claim made against them. The Commonwealth has again stepped in and assumed liability for 100 per cent of those damages that exceed the doctors' insurance cap. How could an alternative approach from the opposition have made any difference to these issues? I really think it is enormously simplistic, if not a little vacuous, to say, called on Fiona Tito to write a report in the final, dying days of government,' because there was no evidence that any progress was being made while the opposition were in power. It is overly simplistic today not to present a few alternative solutions, if the position are in fact so uncomfortable with some of the items and the legislation that has been developed throughout 2002, 2003 and 2004. Technical changes have also been made to the Medical Indemnity Premium Subsidy Scheme-a scheme which I too hope to be eligible for in my clinical career. Where a doctor's gross medical indemnity costs become so high that they exceed about 7.5 per cent of gross earnings, the Commonwealth again has a scheme so that, in particular, a procedural specialist only pays 20 cents in every dollar of the insurance over and above the 7.5 per cent. That has been enthusiastically welcomed by the profession. Of course, these premium subsidies are paid directly to medical indemnity providers and doctors receive premium subsidies automatically through reduced premiums from the insurer. It should also be noted that the bill today modifies the functioning of this scheme slightly so that it is broadened to all medical indemnity providers and not just the well known medical defence organisations. That is relevant for doctors who are often working in the public system. They too can be covered by this scheme. Premium subsidies also apply to procedural general practitioners. Many of those GPs in rural areas were being forced out of procedural work-general practitioners were putting down the scalpel because the insurance premiums became completely unaffordable. Once again, the solution here was to say, ‘Let's look at a similar GP doing nonprocedural work in the same location who ‘We has the same insurer and we will insure 75 per cent of the difference between the procedural and the non-procedural GPs' insurance premiums.' Again, 10 years ago, when I was a remote and rural general practitioner, a solution like that was unheard of. This has op- been a significant contribution both from the Department of Health and Ageing and from the doctors with whom they have liaised and consulted. Small changes have also been made to the incurred but not reported protocol, which is how one handles claims that are likely to be brought before an insurer but have not yet eventuated into a claim-they have merely been reported by the doctor. There will be changes to that so that insurers will be covered for claims of incidents that are notified to them and the costs that are borne by the insurer, even if they do not progress to a formal claim from an injured patient. There was a comment today from a leading medical practitioner in Queensland who said that we had a lot to be grateful for in this legislation and that by and large the issue of medical indemnity had been sorted out. A comment like that from the medical profession was almost inconceivable four years ago. I know from what has happened in Redlands Hospital that the issue of medical indemnity has all but disappeared from the common rooms and coffee rooms of hospitals. Morale is higher in Redlands, in particular, which is a fine hospital. Redlands is waiting for an emergency department upgrade promised by the state government, which is coming soon. What are not appearing are the nine renal chairs that allow dialysis to be done in our area. That puts an enormous burden on the nearby Princess Alexandra Hospital and obviously upon a lot of annoyed renal patients. The topic of indemnity has almost disappeared from hospitals and from practices around the country. It was once said-I am not quite sure by whom-that, like God's infinite mercy, professionals should never really rely on government when it comes to sorting out indemnity issues, except as a last resort. That is exactly what happened in 2002. I was flying across the Gulf of Carpentaria when it happened, I recall. At that time there were no clearly understood solutions to the problem. It almost had to reach this stage in negotiation before all of the groups involved, including the state governments, could be brought to the table to have a summit. That is exactly what this government organised. I am thankful that that happened. It happened under the watch of a government that was able, willing and keen to strike a solution for the benefit of the profession. Announcements were made in December 2003, and all of those measures have now been implemented today. Consultation with doctors, of course, remains ongoing. It will have to-there will be further finessing. Again, it is overly simplistic to say that this has been a botched job, a patch job or a bailing out, because there was really no other way, and I am yet to hear from the opposition that there was any other way of handling this issue. I am glad that the elements of the bill today will be working as they were intended. The small changes, many of them technical, some of them quite detailed, do just that. I congratulate not just the current Minister for Health and Ageing but also his predecessor, Minister Kay Patterson-and also Minister Helen Coonan for her work as Assistant Treasurer-on the work they have done in helping medical indemnity insurers, because they know, as we do, that by helping them we help doctors, which, in turn, helps patients.",69
143,Mrs HULL,MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,"Riverina) (6.00 p.m.)Again, it is a pleasure to rise in the House add my comments to the debate on the Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. This has been a long-running and sometimes terribly volatile issue in my electorate. Some 18 months before UMP collapsed, I had visits from my obstetrician, Dr John Curry, who came to tell me that there had been calls on the profession. He felt that there was going to be a disaster with UMP and needed to raise my awareness of this issue, which he did. We travelled to Canberra on numerous occasions and addressed backbenchers and committee meetings and pulled together meetings of backbenchers. Specifically, Dr Curry highlighted the issues he felt were going to happen, certainly with UMP. He felt that there was no money in the system and that the call was significant on the profession. He said that, unless somebody stepped in and did some work on tort law reform in the states, particularly in obstetrics areas, looked at the 21-year statute of limitations and at the way in which certain cases were playing out whereby compensation was being paid in the extreme, this was going to be a major issue that we would face as a nation. We did a lot of work on this matter. Many of my specialists came on board and explained that they thought there was a problem. Then we had a problem because there was no indemnity cover in the state hospital system, so all my specialists in the Riverina decided not to offer their operating services. I was involved at the time in the process of trying to resolve the issue with New South Wales Minister Craig Knowles. Finally, common sense prevailed and the state government, to their great credit-and it is not often that I give credit to the state government-decided to pick up the indemnity in the public hospital systems for medical practitioners. It was very much appreciated by me and all of my medical specialists, GPs to and others, because it certainly resolved the issue of getting cover in the public system. It stopped a mass exodus from the public system to the private system whereby we would have had an enormous gap in services that could and should be provided by the state hospital system. The issue was resolved at the eleventh hour on Christmas Eve. It was pretty significant and pretty hair-raising to think that, after the new year, no specialist services, operating services and visiting medical officer-VMO-services would be available in the state hospital system in my electorate. We then moved to the UMP crisis-and what a crisis it was! It saw, very quickly, mass exodus of specialists who had decided to retire, or who were thinking of retiring, three to five years. They were insecure about what was going to happen in the future and not quite sure what was going to happen in their family lives and with the assets they had built up over a long period. We put in a lot of work and a lot of effort. Various crafts assisted me in trying to resolve this issue. One of my good general surgeons, Henry Hicks, was absolutely sensational. He, along with Dr Gerard Carroll, a heart physician in Wagga Wagga, and Dr John Curry, an obstetrician, assisted me in resolving this issue, particularly in my electorate. It seemed as though this matter was just going to escalate-and it did. Obstetricians have one private outlet in the Riverina-that is, Calvary Hospital-and they decided to remove their services from that hospital. We have about 600 or 700 deliveries per annum in the private hospital and about 700 to 800 in the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. It was obvious that the base hospital was not set up to take all the deliveries from right across the Riverina into their sector, and we had a crisis. Two thousand members of the community-mums and dads with prams and babies-marched up the streets of Wagga Wagga to demonstrate that they needed this facility at Calvary Maternity Hospital and that we in the government desperately needed to resolve the issue. There was a significant amount of discussion and negotiation, as a former speaker has said, by ministers and the Assistant Treasurer at the time, and we ended up resolving the problem in the short term. We then introduced a levy system and, of course, some anomalies started to develop in that system. We saw new entrants coming in. One of the surgeons in my electorate, Dr David Littlejohn, was a new entrant in the system, and it seemed that he was going to the have to pick up the tail and pay for the mistakes of people before him. That, of course, in needed resolving. This issue has been a moving feast for ministers, because every day there was a new and extremely significant issue that they had to deal with and try to resolve. The Australian public were beside themselves because they thought there was every chance that they were going to lose their services. It certainly did have a major impact, particularly on obstetrics. We saw many of the obstetricians in my electorate move out of obstetrics entirely and into the field of gynaecology to reduce their premiums. This left a great shortfall in obstetrics services, not just in my electorate but right across Australia. In what I think is its absolutely best performance to date, in an effort to underpin services right across Australia, the government has had to deal with a moving feast of variable issues that were surrounding things that governments had not previously been involved in. It did not just involve obstetricians, orthopaedics or surgeons; it also involved anaesthetists. A host of different specialists had been impacted upon by the very difficult circumstances with United Medical Protection. So I congratulate the government on all the processes it undertook to ensure that everybody's interests were served-not just those of specialists, GPs, obstetricians and surgeons, but also those of all Australians. Some positives have grown out of this. There are some positive advantages in what has happened. After we had the march in 2000 up the streets of Wagga Wagga, we developed a new program called the rural obstetrics training network. I sat down and thought that if the UMP issue was going to cause such a crisis in my region, what were we going to do to stop people from being discouraged from entering obstetrics because of the 21-year statute of limitations? I decided to work with a group of specialists to determine how we could deliver obstetric services into the future in rural and regional areas. From that came the birth of the rural obstetrics training network and we now have a very good pilot project operating out of Wagga Wagga which is looking at how we deliver obstetric services for rural and regional people into the future. It utilises wives and a whole host of different mechanisms that need to come into play in before and after care in obstetrics services. I am very proud of this. Dr Ian Stewart is a practising obstetrician and gynaecologist. He has now reduced his hours to part-time gynaecology in order to take on the directorship of the rural obstetrics training network. In my opinion, nobody has more experience in the needs of rural obstetrics than Dr Ian Stewart, and he has been prepared to forgo his own monetary benefit to ensure that he can put together a valuable project that can be applied anywhere in Australia. The project will ensure that we are best utilising the service of midwives and it will encompass regional universities such as Charles Sturt University, which has a magnificent nursing and midwifery course. It will put a process together to provide a different form of delivery of service for those people who are removed from many of the major areas of delivery. At one stage, we thought we would have to airlift mums to Sydney or to a metropolitan hospital just to have simple, straightforward procedural deliveries, which would certainly not have been a good use of taxpayers' money. As I said, this is a long-running issue that I have been absolutely involved with, well and truly before the problems with UMP, simply because of the understanding that the specialists that work in my area had to be involved as part of the solution and not just as part of the problem. I am very fortunate to have each and every one of the specialists in my area. We have recruited specialist services due to all of these guys putting in together and utilising their own money, their own time and their own travel to get other specialist services into the Riverina. The average age of specialists in the Riverina now is between 40 and 45, which is absolutely sensational. We have one of the best medical midwork forces in specialty services. We are certainly lacking in some areas but the Riverina is starting to be well supplied with specialist services. The government has assisted the Riverina in many, many ways to ensure that specialists remain committed and have the incentive to move forward and to be able to continue to offer these services into the future. In other positive news in my region, according to a recent newspaper article Cootamundra is also benefiting from an increase in professionals who are providing obstetric and maternity care. This is fantastic because, while most regions are seeing a reduction in these services, I am starting see a significant increase, mainly due to the commitment of the existing specialists there. The article in the Cootamundra Herald on 2 March 2005 states that two new midwives, and a new general practitioner with an interest in obstetrics, have moved into the town of Cootamundra. The report says: ‘We have been short of midwives for a long time and Cootamundra is very lucky. Not only do we have the two new midwives but we have a new doctor in Dr Scholz.' Scholz is a significant name because Granny Scholz delivered Sir Donald Bradman in Cootamundra and now Dr Scholz is there providing obstetric services. Now that I have finished making conversation in the House, I am pleased to congratulate the government on the very fine effort that they have put in and in particular congratulate the Minister for Health and Ageing on the services that he has secured for rural and regional Australia.",72
144,Mr ABBOTT,MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,"I am very pleased to sum up the second reading debate on the Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 and I would like to thank all members who have taken part. I would particularly like to thank the member for Riverina for a very interesting tour de horizon of the medical services available in her electorate. I am not entirely unfamiliar with them, having visited a couple of times and also having pedalled through a large slab of her electorate in company with, amongst others, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. It is good to see the medical services of the Riverina appropriately eulogised in this place by a very hard working local member. Eighteen months ago there was a genuine crisis in our health system. A large number of visiting medical officers were resigning their public hospital positions because they believed that medical indemnity premium increases were the last straw. They believed that they were being hit with unconscionable burdens as a result of changes to the tort ture, particularly in New South Wales but also in Queensland and in other states. As a result the government established the Medical Indemnity Policy Review Panel comprising a series of distinguished leaders of the medical profession, along with John Phillips, former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank; Nancy Milne, the insurance partner at Clayton Utz; and the then Minister for Revenue, Senator Coonan and me as co-chairs. But the key people on this review panel were Dr Bill Glasson, the President of the AMA; Dr Andrew Pesce, the insurance expert on the AMA; Dr Sue Page, President of the RuI ral Doctors Association of Australia, and Professor Don Sheldon, Chairman of the Council of Procedural Specialists. That committee spent a very intensive six to eight weeks looking at the problem and coming up with a series of recommendations which were ultimately accepted, almost in total, by the government just before Christmas in 2003-and which, I am pleased to say, have brought stability to this sector since. I do not say that it is a perfect system and I do not say that it will not be in need of further work in the future, but certainly the crisis has passed. The medical specialists rescinded their resignations, our hospitals began to work normally again and the Damoclean sword hanging over them was withdrawn. This was very good news for the people of Australia but it was particularly good news for the standing and public respect of the medical profession. Every one of us in this place owes a great deal to the medical profession. None of us enjoys perfect health all the time, and invariably when ill health strikes it is the medical profession which takes the lead role in restoring us to health. While many doctors earn large incomes, the vast majority of them carry very heavy cul- responsibilities, work very long hours and earn comparatively modest rewards for the training, dedication and time that they bring to their jobs. It is right that we as a society do not impose unduly heavy burdens on them. Thanks to the Medical Indemnity Subsidy Scheme, finalised by the government as a result of the work of the review panel, doctors who face very high premium costs will have 80 per cent of those premium costsabove 7½ per cent of gross private medical income-met by the government. That is the essence of the scheme put in place by this government to meet the crisis, but there are other important elements: the ‘blue sky scheme' to cover doctors who face claims in excess of $20 million; the High Cost Claims Scheme to cover doctors who faced claims in excess of $300,000; and the very important retirement Run-off Cover Scheme to cover doctors who had retired from practice but who still faced the possibility of claims as a result of the long tails on these sorts of actions. As I said, it has not been an absolutely perfect set of arrangements. Obviously it has cost the taxpayers of Australia heavily. The package put in place after the review panel did its work cost an additional $200 million over the forward estimates period on top of about $350 million that had previously been invested by the government in medical indemnity insurance premium support. But the package has worked well and this legislation is designed to clear up technical difficulties which have arisen in the operation of the scheme. In particular, we have tried to ensure that the legislation precisely matches the intent of the government back in December 2003 and that it precisely matches the practical operation of insurance schemes of this type. The legislation is highly complex and technical but it has been drawn up in the closest possible consultation with the insurance sector and expert members of the medical profession. I know that the legislation has the support of the medical profession and the medical indemnity insurance sector. I know that it is in the best interests of patients that we should pass this bill and I particularly thank the opposition for being as constructive as they have been on this whole issue. Before closing, I should also thank the public servants of my department, who have toiled mightily over this issue for the last two or three years. We tend to take the Public Service for granted-and certainly the general public often talk dismissively of Canberra as if it were a paradise of overpaid and underworked public servants and people such as ourselves-but the fact is that the Public Service of Australia always get the job done. Sometimes, as our experience grows, what they do needs to be finetuned and further improved, but they always get the job done. In my experience as Minister for Health and Ageing there has been no finer illustration of the Public Service at its best than the work that the Department of Health and Ageing did to resolve this very acute, very pressing and very serious problem. So I thank and congratulate them on behalf of the government and the people of Australia. I particularly single out Charles Maskell-Knight, who is in the advisers' box this evening and led the team which did such a good job. Thank you very much indeed. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",75
145,Mr ABBOTT,MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,"by leave I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 February, on motion by Mr Truss: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (6.24 p.m.)-The opposition will support the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005 through this parliament. The bill seeks to reinforce the structural adjustment focus of the Farm Help program by tightening the definition of ‘full-time' farmer and by providing the ongoing monitoring of those who have accessed the re-establishment grant, to ensure that they do not go back into farming. In June 2004, some eight months ago, I debated legislation to extend the Farm Help program to 30 June 2008. The opposition has been broadly supportive of the thrust of this element of the Agriculture Advancing Australia package. This program forms part of the government's Agriculture Advancing Australia package and is aimed at supporting the ongoing process of structural adjustment in the rural sector. However, if the number of farms accessing this program is supposed to be an indication of the success or otherwise of the program, then the statistics would seem to indicate that it has been a failure. Farm organisations regard this program as largely having failed to meet its objectives, and, on the government's own stated objectives, it has failed badly. On that basis, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give reading, the House condemns the Government for the failure of Farm Help and other programs to deliver appropriate structural adjustment assistance where it is needed in the farm sector”. Farm Help has been operating since December 1997 to facilitate adjustment by providing assistance to people on farms in severe financial difficulty. Program components include up to 12 months of income support at the newstart allowance rate, up to $5,500 in professional advice and training, the development of an activity plan customised to each farm family situation and a re-establishment grant of up to $50,000 for those who decide to exit farming. The Farm Help program was renewed in the 2004-05 budget for a further four years and will conclude on 30 June 2007. The farm exit provisions of this program have been the centrepiece of the government's structural adjustment efforts in the farm sector. But in most years the program has been significantly underspent. While the amendments proposed represent an improvement on the current situation, particularly in terms of accountability for assistance received, they will do little to encourage an increasing number of marginal farmers to exit farming. The main elements of this bill are that it will amend the definition of a farmer as ‘a person who has a right or an interest in land used for the purposes of a farm enterprise' and that it will define a ‘full-time' farmer, for the purposes of the Farm Help provisions of the bill, as a person who, for a continuous period of at least two years immediately before they apply for entry to the Farm Help program, is a farmer, has derived more than 50 per cent of his or her gross income from the farm enterprise, has contributed more than 50 per cent of his or her capital to the farm enterprise and has spent more than 50 per cent of his or her working hours on the the bill a second farm enterprise. The bill will also provide a greater degree of flexibility in administration. For example, a person may be unable to satisfy the income test because, during the two-year period, the enterprise has experienced flood, drought, bushfire or some other natural disaster; an unforeseen extreme variation in seasonal norms; a market collapse; or serious illness or disability. Accordingly, a person is considered to be a full-time farmer if they can demonstrate that they meet these circumstances and other qualification criteria. Of course, there is another provision of the bill to enable ongoing communication with Farm Help re-establishment grant recipients. This provision basically allows for the tracking by Centrelink of people who have received assistance under these provisions. One has to ask why these matters have not been adequately addressed by the government before this time. It is quite extraordinary that here we are some seven years after the introduction of the scheme, and the government is still grappling with the definition of a farmer and a full-time farmer. I think it demonstrates the sort of tardiness in the preparation of legislation and the administration of schemes that is typical of a government in terminal decay, as is this one. The government introduced the scheme in December 1997. One has to ask where the minister has been since that time in tightening up the provisions of this particular legislation. At least, I suppose, some seven years down the line we are finally getting some certainty into these definitions. Of course, in doing so, the minister simply demonstrates once again his incompetence in this portfolio. The process of structural adjustment in farming has produced mammoth changes in our agricultural sector. Of course, this is what this particular legislation is designed to address. I have, on more than one occasion in this place, referred to the impact that it had on my own farming family, who farmed a small, mixed dairy farm in the western district of Victoria some four decades ago. That process has produced quite profound social changes in rural communities, often with great pain to families who were farming and who, in a historical sense, have farmed as a lifestyle choice as well as a means of earning a living and supporting a family. The process of structural adjustment has been propelled by a range of factors. In Australian agriculture in recent decades, we have witnessed quite consistent growth in the annual productivity of the sector of between one and two per cent. This has been driven by massive investments in technology on the farm, land productivity improvements, huge strides in plant and animal genetics, the decisions of government to remove the regulatory framework under which industries have operated for long periods of time, an expansion of market opportunities, the upskilling of farmers, the introduction of new management and information systems, some improvements in essential infrastructure and, of course, significant gains from a concerted research and development effort in the sector. Together these have driven the creation of new opportunities and new efficiencies in Australian agriculture. They have also, however, contributed to the massive structural adjustment in the sector that has occurred in recent decades. Other influences have contributed to the process as well. Climatic changes, such as the recent drought, have put enormous pressure on the financial viability of many farm enterprises in affected areas, with corresponding pressures on businesses and local communities. The overall issue of climate change and the potential impact it might have on the farm sector are the subject of considerable debate in the general commuhas nity and in farming circles today. That certainly was not a debate that was taking place with any intensity some five years ago, but of course it is upfront and centre in the considerations of farmers and their leaders today. I have taken the view in that debate that the sector must look to innovative opportunities and not simply wallow in the negative aspects about the extent of the sector's contribution to the problem. The reality is that managing this problem and related problems, such as the increased incidence of pests and disease, may well be beyond the management skills of many farmers in some prone areas, forcing the pace of structural adjustment even faster. Similarly, the changing nature of consumer preferences in how they buy and consume the output of the sector has dictated changes in the structure and will do so in the future. Consumers can be very fickle indeed in changing their preferences and having their needs and wants met, and sometimes the resources in agriculture are not flexible. Some industries, such as the stone fruit industry, require significant time frames for adjustments to occur and significant investments to meet new consumer demands, so the process of adjustment for many in the farm sector is a difficult one indeed. Likewise, the changing nature of the domestic and the international marketplace and the dominance of huge retailers are putting significant pressures back on farm. These changes are eloquently outlined by Mick Keogh, the Executive Director of the Australian Farm Institute, in a perceptive article in the February 2005 edition of the Farm Policy Journal, entitled ‘The industrialisation of Australian farming'. He refers to the fact that this process of industrialisation appears to be rapidly developing in agriculture. I forgot to bring that article with me today to quote from it in this debate, and I regret that because it is an excellent article. It is very ceptive and very detailed, and I think it makes very important reading not only for farmers but for those in agribusiness and those who have an interest in the process of structural change in the sector. Farm structures have adapted to accommodate these new arrangements. Keogh refers to the emergence of large-scale corporate farms. They have emerged and they are highly integrated into current food marketing systems, with direct contractual arrangements between those large corporate enterprises and large retailers that literally bypass traditional marketing systems. Keogh provides a very comprehensive analysis of the nature of these new marketing arrangements and the impact that they are having on the contractual relationships in the agricultural sector, on intellectual property rights and on patterns of trade. In the face of these particular changes I think Australian agriculture has shown remarkable resilience, but there are even more economic changes bearing down upon the sector as we speak. We are going to see further structural adjustment in this sector as a result of the rising interest rates under the Howard government. It is now a matter for the public record that the Prime Minister and the Howard government have deceived farmers, as they deceived other Australian households and businesses before the last election, on the matter of interest rate rises in the future. The Prime Minister is in his usual pattern of doublespeak on this matter in what I consider to be a pathetic defence of his deception. The economic framework has direct relevance to the pace of structural adjustment in the rural sector, and it is that issue of structural adjustment that is the focus of this particular piece of legislation before the House. Before the last election the Prime Minister led farmers to believe that interest rates perwould not rise. The Reserve Bank has recently increased them by 0.25 basis points, and it would appear there are more rises in the pipeline. What is the impact of this on the farm sector? I refer to a press release by the National Farmers Federation on 2 March 2005 where they have analysed the quantum of the impact that that is likely to have. Mr Charles Burke, the Farm Business and Economics Committee chair, had this to say: Around 10 per cent of total farm cash costs go towards servicing average debt levels of about $370,000 per farm. This means that today's move by the RBA will cost Australian farmers another $120 million a year and squeeze margins which are already under pressure from high exchange rates and high fuel costs. Here we have the triple whammy: the rise in interest rates, courtesy of the Howard government, which is adding $120 million to farm costs; a squeeze on margins which are already under pressure from a high exchange rate, which in part is due to the policies of the Howard government; and, of course, high fuel costs, which in part are a result of this government's involvement in the Iraq conflict. So in a whole raft of economic policy areas we have a direct pressure on farm costs and on farm adjustment-which is the subject of this particular bill-as a result of the policies of the Howard government. Mr Burke went a little further. He said: The rate rise also comes on top of one of Australia's worse trade performances on record. The Current Account Deficit has hit $15.2 billion or 6.5 per cent of GDP. I think that is perhaps a little bit on the light side. But it is the impact of our trade performance on exchange rates and on rural exporters that he goes on to analyse. He says: Higher interest rates will push the exchange rate higher, damaging exporters and fuelling more imports. He further concludes: We need to boost exports to address the record current account which means that ideally, our interest rates should be falling relative to our jor trading partners. As we know, Australian interest rates are at decidedly higher levels than those of our trading partners. The high interest rate regime in Australia is fuelling the pressure on the exchange rate and this, in turn, is damaging farmers as significant exporters in this country. The foreign account relies very heavily on the input of the farm sector as far as earning national income goes in the international marketplace. So here we have, as a result of the Howard government's policies, a double whammy coming to farmers. Courtesy of the Howard government's economic policies, we have a rise in interest rates which is adding to farm costs to the tune of $120 million on this occasion-and that is not taking into account the massive increase in costs that has occurred as a result of interest rate rises that had already occurred courtesy of this government. I would say that, just as a rough rule of thumb, the interest rate rises courtesy of the Howard government have added some half a billion dollars or more to farm costs, and that is not an insignificant amount. And then, of course, as this feeds into the higher exchange rate, farmers as exporters are penalised. Their income is reduced from their exports into the international marketplace. So there is a squeeze on their incomes, their costs increase and their financial viability is further threatened. I am very interested in the interest rate debate because we know that the Prime Minister is apt to get up in this parliament and talk about high interest rates under Labor. But of course he conveniently forgets that when he was Treasurer of this country not only did he leave us with a deficit, which in current dollars would be the equivalent of $30 billion, but he presided over interest rates to businesses of 15.8 per cent. And the Prime Minister has the gall to get up in this parliament maand criticise the Labor Party for high interest rates. One thing that we did do, something which really assisted farmers to cope with this issue of structural adjustment, was break the back of Liberal inflation in this country-the double-digit inflation that prevailed when the Liberal Party was in power under the Prime Minister's stewardship as Treasurer. We broke the back of Liberal inflation. We set the basis for the low interest rate regime that this country now enjoys. So the issue of the total economic performance of the country is very important to this process of structural adjustment and it is very important to the issues we are debating here today in this legislation. I go to the statistics that relate to the Farm Help Re-establishment Grants Scheme. We have seen that the number of exits under the legislation has not been of any substance since the year 2000. For example, in 2000-01 there were 182 re-establishment grants. In the next two financial years, 2001-02 and 2002-03, there were 161 in each of those years. It further declined in 2003-04 to 102 re-establishment grants. We can go to various industry reform packages that the government has introduced since it has been in office. If we look at the Sugar Industry Reform Program, for which funding of some $94 million was made available over the years 2004-05 to 2006-07 for re-establishment assistance, we find that, as at 4 March 2005, 82 growers had accessed re-establishment grants under that industry reform package for 2004-05. That is not a lot, given the noises that the government was making about the need to encourage many sugar farmers to exit the industry because of the economic challenges it faced. With the Pork Producers Exit Program, the government and the minister's estimated target was 140 producers, but only 74 have received pork producer exit grants. We see a similar situation occurring in the Dairy Exit Program where Centrelink have advised that there have been approximately 138 grants awarded under that program. So it is hardly a massive structural adjustment tool. It is no wonder that many in the farm sector have been very critical of the government for its administration of this particular piece of legislation. If we go to the National Farmers Federation submission to the review of Agriculture Advancing Australia, we see that very little has been done by the government to address their concerns in this matter. For example, the National Farmers submission said: Farmhelp and similar exit programs should provide incentives for farmers considering retirement or industry exit to link with young individuals pursuing industry entry, therefore facilitating and accelerating the generational transfer of viable farm businesses; Nothing has been done on that particular request. The submission also said: The Retraining Grant and the entire Professional Support components of Farmhelp should be available to farmers prior to them making their final decision on exiting the industry (through taking the Re-establishment Grant), therefore providing additional confidence and guidance to farmers in considering their future options; This is one that has been done. But then, further down in the submission, National Farmers suggested that Farm Help: Introduce flexible measures to allow support to continue beyond the first 12-months in circumstances where farm exit maybe inadvertently delayed (ie: problems in selling property etc) or where an assessment of farm viability may take longer than this period; On that sensible suggestion, nothing has been done. The National Farmers also state: In lieu of a bank statement documenting a farmer's credit rating, allow Rural Financial Counsellors to certify the legitimacy of an individual farmer's Farmhelp Application. We know that in this provision accountants can now certify, but the request of the National Farmers Federation to extend this certification to rural financial counsellors has not been granted. There is another particular request that was made by the National Farmers Federation: Increase the net assets threshold for the re-establishment to $150,000 therefore enhancing the financial capacity of farm families to successhis fully re-establish following exit and reduce the likelihood such individuals will require ongoing welfare support following exit. Nothing has been done. The problem in this particular area is getting worse as asset values rise. I mention this because although we have some definitional tinkering in this piece of legislation, the substance of what farmers require from it has not been addressed by the government. We will be supporting this particular legislation through the parliament but I think it is now a matter of public record that farm organisations are very disappointed in the administration of this area of policy by this minister and by the government.",76
146,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Rudd-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,82
147,Mr BROADBENT,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT," Mr Deputy Speaker, of course I am opposed to the amendment, but I will speak to what has just been outlined by the member for Corio, which is the opposition's inability to grasp the importance of this Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005 as it affects farmers, particularly in the electorate of MCMillan. More importantly, through the whole of a 30-minute address the member for Corio did not mention one positive statement about what the opposition would do if it were in government. In fact the member for Corio seems very comfortable in opposition. He said that the opposition is broadly supportive of the government's programs. From the list of positives he read out about the government's programs, I would say that the opposition is totally acquiescent to the government's programs, particularly with regard to agriculture. Would the member for Corio, if he were the minister, do anything different from what is being done by this government? I suggest not. Throughout address he was positive about the government's programs. He said that the opposition supports what the government is doing and that the only massive readjustment program was Paul Keating's interest rate regime of 17 to 22½ per cent. That is what changed the industry forever and did so much damage. I want to refer to the member for Corio's address because he did mention one article. I mention another, a very positive article that I will not have time to address. On the Insiders program on Sunday morning there was a woman involved in agriculture, and particularly chemicals, who spoke to the nation through the program about interest rates and how they affect the farming community and the fact that good farmers factor in the range in which interest rates may climb or fall in a given time. Where is the difference between the government and the opposition on interest rates? The range under the Howard government has been between six and eight per cent-rises, drops. Under Labor, interest rates moved between 10 and 17 per cent. So I would not like to take the member for Corio's figuring on his cost to agriculture to this point and then add what it would cost the farming community of Australia under Labor if we were moving between 10 and 17 per cent. However, enough about what the member for Corio has said, because he did not outline where he had a problem with this legislation. We will be positive. This bill is of importance to the seat of MCMillan because MCMillan is dependent on agriculture, with the dairy industry at its heart. Reconstruction and deregulation of the industry have required greater efficiencies with fewer farmers milking more cows and producing more milk. Our dairy industry in Victoria now supplies 63 per cent of Australia's milk production. Further efficiencies, though, are inhibited by a number of measures-and, as the member for Corio mentioned, we have just come out of a prolonged drought. We have a shortage of labour and now in many areas an increase in the cost of land affects the opportunities for neighbouring farmers to buy the land at a reasonable price for viable milk production. The bill may help free up some land by helping farmers on unviable small holdings to take the opportunity to exit the industry. I am reminded today of the mendacity of the member for Corio as he stepped between the cow pats of the dairy herds in MCMillan where he made an offer to local farmers to turn back the clock to 1950. He had a range of statements that he made only in MCMillan. They did not go out of MCMillan because he did not want to spread the news outside the local papers. He got tremendous coverage. He was all over the place. He really led some people to believe that he had the magic pudding in the back of his car for the dairy industry of Australia. But he was misleading the farmers and the people. We have the leaders of Fonterra and other industry leaders saying, ‘We have a great opportunity now to move forward with our dairy industry because of its efficiency and quality.' But we will never be able to supply the markets that are available to us and we will always be looking for new people to come into the industry. How can we do that? This legislation is particularly important to the farmers, particularly dairy farmers, MCMillan because of the dominant role that dairy plays in the total economy of my electorate. Indeed, MCMillan is only one of a small number of federal electorates in which primary industry plays such a dominant role. The agricultural sector in the seat of MCMillan is dominated by the dairy industry, which accounts for almost half of the total farming in the electorate and makes a significant contribution to the state and national economies. MCMillan also boasts a beef cattle industry and a range of smaller agricultural and horticultural sectors, all of which are important contributors to the local economy. The dairy industry in MCMillan is emerging from several years of dry conditions which have had a serious impact on both farm production and employment-and farm families. Despite these leaner years, it continues to make a major contribution to our local economy. Over 1.2 billion litres of milk annually, almost a fifth of Victoria's total production, comes out of the seat of MCMillan. This is a sizeable contribution to the Victorian economy, with the dairy industry accounting for more than $3 billion in domestic sales and more than $2 billion in export sales. These sorts of figures can only be achieved by an industry that is continually striving for greater excellence. The dairy industry has gone through massive reconstruction over the past 30 years. Coming from a dairying community, I have lived with those changes for most of my life, with the greatest reform, outside of the highinterest years of the Hawke-Keating government, coming from deregulation five years ago. Since the 1970s the number of dairy farms has been reduced by more than 50 per cent, while herd numbers and production have increased, so there are fewer farmers milking more cows and using greatly improved manin agement processes. It is the desire of this House and the government that this momentum be maintained. We have to help the industry by creating an environment that makes it possible for the dairy industry to further improve all its management and ways. At the moment global demand for dairy products far outstrips production and, as the world's fourth largest exporter, lia appears well placed to capitalise on this demand, and the dairy farmers in the seat of MCMillan will be best placed of those across the nation to capitalise on this opportunity. In the short time. I have today, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, I want to refer to some of the environmental programs that local farmers are putting in place in MCMillan. Outside of those that are well known to you-the sustainable farms program, Landcare programs and other programs-56 per cent of our dairy farmers have been involved in property revegetation, 64 per cent of our dairy farmers have some remnant vegetation on their properly and 57 per cent of our dairy farmers with waterways have all or most of them fenced off from livestock. Eighty cent of our farmers have formal effluent management systems, and there is potential for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through reducing or using the methane gas emitted by cattle, though improved management of organic matter, fertilisers and irrigated pastures will be of importance as the industry moves forward. The opportunity to grow the dairy industry in Australia is before us now. I believe that the opposition is supportive of this bill. I believe that this is opportunity for us-and I know that you have dairy farmers in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker-to show that these people are our future and that dairy will be a part Australia's future and a part of Australia's growth and export opportunity.",82
148,Mr FAWCETT,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I rise to support the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005 as tabled by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. This bill reinforces the structural adjustment focus of the Farm HelpSupporting Families Through Change program. Farm Help is a program that has been operating since 1997 to provide support to people on farms in severe financial difficulty. AustraSince the program commenced, over 9,000 farmers have received income support and some 8,000 have received advice and training, while over a thousand have received assistance to re-establish themselves outside the farming sector. The government has spent over $187 million on the Farm Help program to date. It has done this because it recognises not only the monetary value of the sector to the Australian economy but also the value that our rural heritage and community bring to Australia as a nation. It also recognises that, while ‘structural adjustment' is a nice succinct academic term, at the end of the day it is real families who are affected by the process and these people deserve our support. Because Australia is a net exporter of agricultural produce, which has traditionally formed a large part of Australia's economic base, there has been investment in the sector over many years. My father, Dr Bob Fawcett, played a key role in this over his working life, developing new technologies and practices for reduced tillage and dryland farming. Increasing sophistication in farm management, meteorological forecasting, market analysis and an ongoing focus on sustainable an land use have increased the potential value of the primary production sector. Despite these advances, those involved are still vulnerable due to factors which are beyond their conof trol. Key amongst these factors are such things as export conditions-the exchange rate, markets, competition, the yields and prices and the vagaries of weather-long term droughts and even short-term events such as cyclones or a late rain. My family has been affected by this, with some members farming north of the Goyder's line in marginal areas where one year in five they are lucky to get a good return on their crops. Others have suffered the changes that have made their small holdings unviable and forced them to move off the land. Farmers whom I represent in Wakefield are prime examples of some of these factors. This year they had a growing concern about the expected yield of cereal crops due to a very late break in the season. When rains did come, many became optimistic that, despite the late start, crops were looking very good. But the unseasonably dry and windy conditions on 12 and 13 October caused significant moisture loss from crops approaching harvest. This led to crop losses and to yield estimates falling by up to 30 per cent in many areas. In some areas, farmers failed to even get their seed back, which represented a significant unexpected loss to their farm businesses given the large investment in fuel, time, herbicides and fertiliser expended in anticipation of at least some return. As well the resulting poor harvest now means a downturn for local business, who were hoping for an ongoing investment in farm infrastructure and machinery maintenance or upgrades. Farmers therefore may face not only the costs of long-term issues such as the compounding effects of land and stock degradation due to drought and the ongoing costs of living outside metropolitan areas but also these unexpected losses in income. At times like these they need support but also certainty-something that this bill will deliver. The government rightly has a focus on getting results for the people of Australia. spite the comments of the member for Corio, the timely introduction of the Farm Help program is one example of where the government saw and responded to a need. The government also has an obligation to exercise good governance over taxpayers' hardearned money, which is why it maintains the Australian National Audit Office and is now responding to the mid-term evaluation report conducted by the Audit Office on this program. The purpose of the amendments contained in this bill is to reinforce the structural adjustment focus of the program and, in doing so, to remove ambiguity about eligibility for assistance. It will do this through: defining a farmer as someone who has a right or an interest in land used for the purposes of farm enterprise; defining that a full-time farmer is one who, for a continuous period of at least two years immediately before applying for the assistance, can demonstrate that more than 50 per cent of their income, capital contributions and work time result from their role as a farmer; recognising that there may be circumstances where a genuine farmer does not in fact meet these criteria due to circumstances beyond their control, and so there is a discretion clause; and, lastly, putting in place penalty provisions to ensure the ongoing integrity of the program by enabling the departmental secretary to notify recipients of their obligation to inform Centrelink if they change their address or choose to reenter farming within five years of being paid the grant. My electorate of Wakefield has been blessed to not suffer some of the long-term drought issues affecting other parts of Australia, but, as a representative of an electorate with a large number of primary producers, I recognise the unique pressures faced by these enterprises and by the families who De- both enable and depend on them. I therefore welcome the renewing of the farm support program for four years as of the last budget and support these proposed amendments to strengthen the legislation which demonstrates this government's commitment to this important sector of our community.",84
149,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I rise tonight to speak in this very important debate on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005. The purpose of this bill is to bring forward amendments to the area of legislation related to the Farm Help program. This program has been running since 1997 and is widely supported by the farm organisations. When we need to make amendments to the program it is important that we do so with the support of the opposition, and I hope we receive that support. Due to the collapse in commodity prices or the unfair trade practices of other countries and the impact that they have on our farm sector, structural adjustment is something that goes on all of the time. As hard as we and our Minister for Trade, who tonight is on his way to China to negotiate the scoping parameters of a free trade agreement with China, fight in this place, international is not always fair. It certainly does not always have a level playing field. So often the impact of unfair trade in the international trading environment is felt by our farmers across Australia. But it is not only the unfair trade practices of some countries that impact on our farm sector; it is also drought. I want to touch on some of the ways extreme drought is impacting on the agricultural and pastoral sectors and on families in my electorate. Since its inception in 1997, the Farm Help program has had tremendous support. An indication of that is the fact that some 9,000 farmers have sought support from this program since its introduction. I think that clearly demonstrates that this program is needed. Just those figures alone suggest the sort of magnitude of support that is going to farmers, and without this program there could well be 9,000 farm families put under even greater stress. Some 8,000 of those 9,000 farmers have received valuable advice and further training in business practices and some 1,000 have accessed the re-establishment grant of up to $50,000. I know from people in my own electorate that it is indeed a very painful process for so many farmers to have reached the point where they need to exit farming and receive that grant. I want to touch on the issue of household support and how it is helping so many families. I mentioned earlier in my comments tonight that farmers are accessing this support, not just because of collapsing commodity prices but because of extreme drought. This government has been very supportive of our farm sector. I am pleased to see the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry enter the chamber. He knows only too well, as a former farmer himself and from his travels around Australia, how this exceptional drought-a once in 100 years eventtrade is impacting on farm families. In the west of my electorate people are now entering their fourth year of extreme drought. Only last week I was in western Queensland, in Longreach, speaking with representatives of Anglicare Central Queensland. They gave me a report of the impact that the exceptional drought is having on the families of this very vast region of central western Queensland. Their experience shows that most property owners are entering their fourth year of drought. They are down to about one-third of their viable stocking levels and their debt-to-equity levels are rising all the time. Notwithstanding that land prices have improved, the debt levels of families are rising faster than the value of their land. So, with the debt-to-equity level rising, families are finding it more difficult to continue to go to the bank and seek additional accommodation. Anglicare pointed out their concern about the social effect that this drought is having on so many families. In their report to me they say that many women are an integral part of the property work force-if I could put it that way-because they are out there working with their husbands and their children, in some cases, just to keep the family business enterprise together. But some of these women have now gone to town to give their children access to education so that the women do not have to supervise their children's education as they did when they were receiving lessons from the School of Distance Education. In other words, the women were being a governess as well as being that extra pair of hands on the drought-stricken property. I was disturbed to receive this report Anglicare. Among some of the references made to me by the drought coordinator for Anglicare Central Queensland were that many of the women in these families just simply cannot cope, as I mentioned earlier, with the role of being a mother, that extra pair of hands and teacher of their children who are being educated from home. The drought is taking a huge toll on these farm and property families and on their lives. Anglicare in western Queensland are continuing to refer many men and women to the Royal Flying Doctor Service mental health unit and to other services-such is the stress that these families are under. The extremely high use of antidepressants is also a very worrying factor. One thing that the drought coordinator said to me was that not only women but more and more men are being referred by Anglicare to the Royal Flying Doctor Service mental health unit, which is based in Longreach. That is why this program is so important. The Farm Help amendments before the House tonight are supporting those families who are under extreme stress. Sometimes when I stand in this House I find it rather hard to describe the mental state of these families and other people who are living in the towns. School numbers continue to fall as people move away from these towns in western Queensland. They have not only dealt with the structural adjustment in the wool industry and with it their declining fortunes but they have seen loss of employment opportunities for the shearers and their families, who have now moved away because of the decline of the wool industry. In Quilpie alone there are now 40 houses for sale. It is a town of about 700 to 800 people. What prospects there are for the sale of those houses, I do not know, but that is the sort of roll-on effect that this exceptional from drought and the decline in fortunes of the wool industry are having on these small country towns. As I said earlier, school numbers are falling in most of those western Queensland towns. It is a reflection of the impact that the structural adjustment and the exceptional drought has had on those families. So many families are being forced off the land through no fault of their own. They have been forced off because of exceptional drought-not bad management. It is not because of bad decisions that they have made; it is because of the exceptional drought. The drought has not broken and the seasonal outlook for this year, sadly, looks as though we are heading into another El Nino effect. That, too, creates enormous stress for those families who are already stressed with trying to cope with the impact of this exceptional drought. The amendments before the House tonight are very worthwhile. I strongly support them. I support the farm household support program because of the way in which it is helping people who need our help. We are a lucky country and we can afford to support families. That is what the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005 is doing: it is supporting families in circumstances where they desperately need our help. The other point I want to raise tonight is how the household support program will help the families of our citrus growers in the Emerald shire in Central Queensland. Those families are being affected by quarantine restrictions that have been placed on that shire because of an outbreak of citrus canker in the citrus industry last year. Those families also need our support. I thank the minister, who is in the House tonight, for his diligence and determination to try to work with the state Minister for Primary Industries and Fisheries in Queensland, Henry Palaszczuk, who just reneged at every point in trying to negotiate a Commonwealth and state joint sharing of the financial support that we need to be giving these farmers affected by an outbreak of citrus canker-not only on their farms but in the region as well-because of the quarantine restrictions apply to these farmers and have had a financial impact it is having. In that region, of the orchardists I spoke to, ready there have been 40 permanent jobs lost. Something like 1,500 workers in the horticultural industry would normally be there working the orchards right now, pruning them for the harvest later this year. They are no longer there because there is no prospect of being able to sell the product on our domestic market, should it come to fruition this year. The only option is to sell this uct into overseas markets, where there are no restrictions on citrus coming from an area that is under quarantine because of the citrus canker outbreak. This program for household support will also help those families, particularly those in my electorate in the quarantine zones. Special provisions that the minister was able to get approved by cabinet will mean farmers will be able to access invaluable household support to support their families. It will also support families from outside the quarantine zone in Queensland if they can demonstrate that they have been affected by the quarantine as it applies in Emerald shire and the impact it has had on the citrus industry in Queensland. I am delighted to have made a contribution to this bill tonight. I say to the other side of the House: we need your support on these issues, because we are supporting families. These amendments to the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005 that amend Farm Help will go a long way to alleviating some of the stress and trauma that families go through when in so many instances they find themselves in situations where they must adjust out of farming and accept the up to $50,000 to help them start a new life. I commend the bill to the House and support this bill and the actions of the government.",85
150,Mr TRUSS,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I thank all of those who have conal- tributed to this debate on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005 and, in particular, the member for Maranoa, who from the experiences of his own electorate has been able to give a real insight into why this bill is so important. It is, of course, true that there is a large number of Australian farmers who are going through very difficult times because of the drought, including prodmany in your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin. A range of programs have been put in place to assist Australian farmers. More than 30,000 farm families have benefited from this drought assistance since it began. There has never in Australian history been a greater effort provided by a national government to assist people facing the effects of drought. The Farm Help program also provides assistance in good times to help farmers better prepare for drought, to address the various issues of concern in their industry, to help them deal with the need to improve farm skills and to provide support to those farm families that have to make the very difficult decision about whether or not there is a future for them in the industry. Ongoing programs of this nature I think have a very, very important role to play in ensuring agriculture remains strong and prosperous in our nation. There have been a number of particularly difficult issues to confront as industries face changing world situations, problems in endeavouring to compete and alterations to their regulatory systems which place extreme pressure on some of those industriesparticularly in less favoured areas. But there is nothing more heart breaking for anyone in agriculture than to see their crops die or animals struggling because of the impact of drought. It not just has an economic impact on communities but also depresses their will and kills the spirit of so many in rural and regional Australia. The assistance that is being provided by way of drought aid has helped many families. I am disappointed that there has been a lack of cooperation from the states in the delivery of these arrangements; nonetheless, the Commonwealth has tried to provide real and practical assistance and tens of thousands of Australian farmers have benefited. In relation to this bill, which makes amendments to the Farm Help arrangements, it is particularly important to recognise some of the context in which the Farm Help program exists. The AAA-Agriculture Advancing Australia-program is the government's overarching commitment to all farmers and an ongoing commitment to the development of self-reliant, competitive and sustainable rural industries. AAA began in 1997 and in seven years has provided over $1 billion towards a range of programs to help ensure the long-term prosperity of Australian agriculture and agricultural communities. Over 150,000 primary producers, representing more than half of the Australian agricultural sector, have directly benefited from the package. AAA was renewed in the 200405 federal budget due to its success as a trigger for positive change in rural and regional Australia and in recognition of the considerable assistance it was providing to farming families. Perhaps I could mention on this occasion some of the recent successes of AAA. The Rural Financial Counselling Service, which is funded under the AAA program, has responded promptly after the devastating bushfires on the Eyre Peninsula. I visited that area with the honourable member for Grey just the week before last to announce some new their Commonwealth government assistance to the producers in that region. As soon as the fire had been through, there was a need for some emergency assistance, and the Commonwealth is playing its role in that regard. But many families face the despair of having lost significant parts of their property-and, in some cases, family members and loved ones. The Eastern Eyre Rural Counselling Service located at Tumby Bay, north of the disaster area and the most affected by the bushfire, is providing a focal point for general assistance with the disaster response. Through the South Australian Association of Rural Counselling Services, additional counsellors were deployed into the impacted area on a rotational basis from Kangaroo Island and several other South Australian counselling services. The Rural Financial Counselling Service has been reviewed with a view to further improving the efficiency, timeliness and sustainability of the program and its delivery. What it has been able to do to assist in the South Australian bushfire disaster is an example of how important these services are in rural communities. Farmbis continues to be a key element of the AAA package and last year was renewed for a further four years with a government commitment of up to $66.7 million. The government has been working closely with the states on new program arrangements and has finalised agreements with Western Australia, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia. I am very disappointed at some of the comments being made by the New South Wales minister. We are still waiting for New South Wales to commit to the Farmbis program. Even though they announced with much fanfare funding in their last budget and in subsequent budgets, we now have Minister Macdonald endeavouring to play games and pretend that, somehow or other, he is waiting on a commitment from the Commonwealth in relation to the financial arrangements. That commitment was made ages ago. All of the other states have managed to pick up on that commitment, but New South Wales, in spite of their earlier promises of funding, are obviously looking again at where they are moving. The Northern Territory also have not yet formalised their funding commitments to the program. I hope that, as soon as possible, those remaining states and the Northern Territory will ensure that primary producers and rural land managers continue to benefit from the training opportunities in business and natural resource management skills that are provided by the Farmbis program. The AAA Industry Partnerships program is encouraging industries to be proactive in responding to challenges and opportunities. It is working in partnership with Australia's agricultural, fisheries and forestry industries to assist them to improve their resilience and self-reliance. A key part of the Industry Partto nerships program is the successful Young People in Rural Industries program. Since 2001, the government has provided over $2 million in funding to further the skills, knowledge and participation of young people in rural industries. I have to say that an element of the AAA package that gives me a great deal of satisfaction. To see the talents and the skills of many of the young people who have the potential to make such a significant contribution to Australian agriculture certainly gives me heart and the will to ensure that we provide the kind of environment that can properly reward their enthusiasm and commitment to their industries. A further AAA success has been the Farm Help program. It continues to provide assistance for farmers working towards adjustment. Farm Help has a long record of achievement. Since the program commenced on 1 December 1997, over 9,000 farmers have received Farm Help income support, almost 8,000 farmers have taken up advice and training sessions and over 1,000 farmers have received re-establishment assistance. In that regard, the criticism from the honourable member for Corio of the failure of farmers to take up the exit package is obviously hollow. The member for Corio can surely not have been believing his own words when he criticised the fact that around a thousand farmers have taken up this exit package. He also made reference to the take-up of exit packages specifically provided in particular industries. Is he not aware that 82 farmers so far have already taken up the sugar package re-establishment grants, that 74 took up the Pork Producer Exit Program and well over 140 took up the Dairy Exit Program? There has been a response by farmers unable to continue in the industry to take advantage of these exit programs which help to smooth their passage to an alternative lifestyle. It is not easy for farmers who choose leave the career that has perhaps supported them throughout their lives and may have supported their families for generations. There is a sense of failure in many instances and an uncertainty about their capacity to deal with what a new life might hold in the that is cities or some other places. This re-establishment grant helps farmers to adjust to those circumstances. It gives them an opportunity to undertake some new training and to equip themselves effectively for a new life. The purpose of the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005 is to reinforce the structural adjustment focus of the Farm Help program. It seeks to do this by clarifying qualification provisions for entry to the Help program and by enabling ongoing communication with Farm Help re-establishment grant recipients regarding their undertakings not to re-enter farming and to notify a change of address. These provisions aim to improve the effectiveness of administration of the Farm Help program by allowing for follow-up to determine whether the program has assisted farmers to re-establish successfully out of farming. They are also to ensure that they comply with their agreement not to return to farming within five years of receiving the re-establishment grant. The opposition has indicated support for the bill but has moved a second reading amendment criticising the government for the failure of people to take up the various exit packages, to which I think I have already provided a response. Clearly the opposition amendment is without substance. But I must also refer to the major point the comments on the bill of the member for Corio where he spent a great deal of time criticising the government about interest rates. I am amazed that any member of the Labor Party could come into this parliament and criticise this government on the question of interest rates. Farmers well remember that when Labor was last in government they were paying interest rates of around 23 per cent on their loans. Can anyone imagine in this day and age, when interest rates have been around five, six and seven per cent for an extended period of time, the burden on their mortgage if they were paying the sorts of interest rates that farmers were paying when Labor was last in government-figures like 20 to 23 per cent? No business can sustain that kind of interest rate bill. For the opposition to come into this parliament and criticise a government that has adopted and delivered a low interest rate policy is clearly the height of hypocrisy. On those grounds the alone I think the contribution of the member Farm for Corio should be dismissed out of hand. Nonetheless, I am grateful for the fact that, in spite of his spurious criticisms and inaccurate comments about the purpose and relevance of elements of the legislation, the opposition have indicated their willingness to support it. I thank all of those who have made a contribution to the debate on this bill. The AAA program continues to be founded on the success of its key components, which are the catalysts for prosperity and growth in Australian agriculture and for the sustainability of rural communities. I commend the legislation to the House.",88
151,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Corio has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER Wilkie)-Is the amendment seconded? Ms Corcoran-I second the motion.",92
154,Mr SWAN,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"Labor will be supporting the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005. However, I would like to take the opportunity presented by this debate to highlight the government's continued neglect of our social welfare system and the implications for struggling Australian families. As is the case with most of the government's agenda in this area, Labor supports the bill not because the measures within it are strong or the best approach to dealing with the issues we face as a nation but because they go some way to alleviating the hardships created by the government over the last nine years. Many Australians continue to suffer because of the government's mismanagement of our social security system, and Labor has second no intention of standing in the way of any relief they can get. Disappointingly, however, this bill makes no attempt to address the underlying structural problems in our social security system. This is particularly evident with the government's consistent failure to address the flaws in the family tax benefit system. We continue to see hundreds of thousands of families hit with large family tax debts year after year, and we have learned that some of Australia's wealthiest families, with earnings of over $1 million each year, are still being paid obligation-free payments of up to $3,000 a year in the form of FTB part B. Yet the bill makes no attempt ‘tax reto address these obvious inconsistencies. Instead it introduces another quick fix, demonstrating yet again the government's bandaid approach to social security. So I want to take the opportunity to point out the failings of this bill and show how these are sympto(Mr matic of the government's continued mishandling of our social security system. I have also moved a detailed amendment that deals with these problems. In summary, the bill proposes to amend the following legislation: A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 and A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 to introduce a new family tax benefit part B supplement from 1 January 2005; A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 to replace the existing formula to the child income cut-out amount for the family tax benefit with a specified index cut-out amount; and the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to exempt aged care accommodation bonds from the operation of the assets test. I will deal with each of these measures in turn. As part of its election policy ‘Extra assisthat tance for families', the government promised to increase the maximum rate of FTB part B by $300, starting from 1 July 2005. The government subsequently announced that it would backdate the new payment to 1 January 2005 and that it would now be paid as a lump sum on income reconciliation after the end of the relevant income year. It is claimed that schedule 1 of the bill gives legislative effect to this commitment through the introduction of a new FTB part B supplement. The annual amount of the new supplement will initially be set at $302.95 for the 200405 financial year. This amounts to a daily figure of 83c. As the FTB part B supplement commences from 1 January 2005, and there are 181 days in the period 1 January to 30 June 2005, the maximum FTB part B supplement for that period would be $150.23. The FTB part B supplement will be subject to a one-off six-month indexation arrangement on 1 July 2005, which reflects its 1 January 2005 commencement, and then will be indexed on 1 July 2006 and each following 1 July according to annual movements in the CPI. Of course the creation of another FTB supplement was not what the government promised at the election-and I will return to that point later. Schedule 2 deals with the child income cut-out amount. An individual cannot be an FTB child if, among other things, the individual has adjusted taxable income, for the relevant income year, that equals or exceeds the cut-out amount. The relevant eligibility rules and definition of ‘cut-out amount' are in sections 22A and 35 of the Family Assistance Act. Under the bill the current definition of ‘child income cut-out amount' will be replaced with the amount of $11,233 from 1 July 2005. This amount will be subject to annual CPI indexation to maintain its value in real terms. The new amount is apparently higher than the cut-out amount of $11,218 would have been applicable from 1 July 2005 under the existing formula in family assistance legislation. Schedule 3 deals with accommodation bonds. As part of its election policy, the government promised that accommodation bonds paid to an aged care facility would be exempt from the Social Security Act and veterans' entitlements assets tests. Currently where a customer pays an accommodation bond to an aged care facility the refundable balance of the bond is held as an asset of the customer for means testing purposes. This may result in a reduction in the pension the customer receives and may in some cases mean that a pension is no longer payable. These amendments therefore mean that many older Australians will be able to receive a higher rate of payment or obtain a payment they would not otherwise have had. These amendments will also allow customers to pay their accommodation bonds by periodic payments and to rent out their former home without the rental payments affecting their rate of payment. Customers in this situation will also be able to retain the asset test exemption for their former home during any period in which they rent it out. This change mirrors existing concessions available to residents in high-level aged care who pay accommodation charges. There will also be provision for customers, who will now be eligible for either a social security or veterans' affairs payment because of these changes, to have their payments backdated to 1 July 2005. The backdating will be available where customers apply to Centrelink or the Department of Veterans' Affairs for a payment prior to 30 December 2005 or, if they have special circumstances, prior to 30 June 2006. I now want to deal with the government's broken promise to increase family tax benefit part B. As I indicated earlier, the proposed changes to family tax benefit part B included in this bill are not what families were promised during the election campaign. Indeed, eligible families will now only receive half of what they were promised during the financial year. As part of its election policyExtra assistance for families-the government promised to increase the maximum rate of FTB part B by $300, starting from 1 July 2005. Families had every right to assume that the $300 annual increase would be made available to families through their regular fortnightly family tax benefit payments and that this money would start to become available after 1 July this year, but this has not occurred. Under the arrangements included in this bill, families will not receive the promised $300, which will now be paid as a lump sum, until after 1 July 2006. Instead, the Minister for Family and Community Services announced on 9 February 2005 that eligible families would be paid a $150 bonus, a bogus bonus, at the time they lodged their tax returns for the current financial year-that is, after 1 July 2005. This so-called bonus is only half of what eligible families were promised at the election. So we have seen the government swing into full mean and tricky mode by fudging the accounting and then having the audacity to dress up the revised measure as somehow being a bonus for struggling families. In a breathtaking display of hypocrisy-and this is pretty incredible for that minister-the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, continues to have the hide to claim that this consolation payment of up to $150 is somehow a bonus for families. Senator Patterson clearly, as usual, does not understand her own election promise, which was that families would get the full $300-not $150starting from 1 July this year. It is either that, or the minister is plainly being deceptive. The delayed payment of the full $300 was confirmed by officials from the Department of Family and Community Services at the Senate estimates on 16 February 2005. It is also clear that families no longer have the choice of receiving the additional money through their fortnightly payments. The removal of any choice is contrary to the government's rhetoric that families should have the choice of receiving regular fortnightly payments or a lump sum through the tax system. In the last week we have seen even more damning evidence that the government's family tax benefit system is not working. New figures have revealed that Australia's wealthiest families continue to be big winners from family tax benefit part B. Nearly 30,000 families with annual incomes of over $100,000 received family tax benefit B payments worth up to $3,000 a year during the 2002-03 year. At the same time poorer families continue to be confronted with a mounting FTB debt load year after year. Imagine how these families felt when they saw the reports last week that wealthy families, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, were able to get family payments. While wealthy families are pocketing thousands of dollars in payments, other families are being saddled with family tax benefit debts every year. Where is the fairness and equity in all of that? The fact that wealthy families are being rewarded with up to $3,000 a year in obligation-free family payments shows the failure of the government to provide assistance to those families who need it most. If the government were really serious about welfare reform then fixing this glaring inequity would be a good starting point. The largesse for Australia's wealthiest families contrasts with the government's harsh plans to take away payments from people with a disability, and sole parents. While the government is happy to pay wealthy families thousands of dollars each year it wants to force single parents back to work as soon as their children start primary school. This demonstrates why Labor remains committed to introducing a single family payment with a consistent income test for all Australian families. This is the best way to ensure that our system of family payments is fair, consistent and targeted to those families that need the help most. Struggling families have every right to demand an explanation from the Howard government about why its policies continue to reward wealthy people at the expense of people who have a genuine need for assistance. The government is also setting out clearly to target single parent families. The broken promise to increase family benefits to single parent families is one of the three major hits on these families since the election. And the same story with the promised child-care rebate. Shortly before Christmas last year, the Howard government broke its promise to introduce an uncapped 30 per cent child-care rebate this year. The rebate will now be capped, and families will not be able to claim one cent until after 1 July 2006, a full year later than the government promised at the election. The rebate would have provided much-needed relief to single parent families struggling under the weight of high childcare fees. Now we learn that the government wants to force single parents back into the work force as soon as their children start primary school. These three hits on single parents demonstrate that the Howard government is more interested in cost cutting than in looking after the needs of families or giving them the capacity to participate fully in the work force. Single parent families are right to be anxious about what will happen next time they appear in the Howard government's firing line. We have also seen the government continue to leak information about its plans for so-called welfare reform. The government basically wants to make it harder to access payments so that it can save money but not necessarily assist people to fulfil their capacity. The government does not seem to understand that real welfare reform is about making the social security system simpler, fairer and more accessible for the six million Australians who access income support payments each year. There has to be a system which invests in their capacity and provides incentives. Real welfare reform is about unlocking the welfare trap that this government has created in both the tax system and the family payment system and investing in the capacity of individuals to participate in the work force. Neither of these things is happening. Successful welfare reform should develop opportunities for the full work force it is participation of those who are receiving payments. As always with the Howard government, its plans are simplistic and narrow. The narrow cost-cutting focus of John Howard's agenda is best summed up in his failed attempts to limit access to the disability support pension. By recycling these plans, the government has again shown that it cannot tell the difference between cost-cutting and reform. Labor recognises that encouraging people to move from welfare to work is a policy objective in its own right, and one of the most important we can have. We want fewer people on welfare and more people in work. By helping people make the transition from welfare to work, we can deliver social and economic benefits for individuals, their families, their communities and the nation as a whole. Welfare reform should deliver increased work force participation, which has been recognised as an economic priority for a very long time. But, as the Reserve Bank and others have noted, skills shortages and stagnant work force participation are big threats to Australia's continuing economic prosperity. After almost a decade in government, John Howard still has not made any progress on welfare reform. As always, the government is long on rhetoric but very short on action. That sums up the story of the Howard government: nine years of failure to invest people and real welfare reform. It has a tax system which punishes people trying to move from welfare to work, whereby some of the people on the lowest incomes in our community lose more than a dollar for every additional dollar they earn. Rewards should be there for working harder-for people trying to move from welfare to work and for people working overtime. People should not be financially punished for becoming active in the work force, but that is currently the situation we have in the intersection between the family payment system and our income tax system. Labor took up this challenge seriously at the last election. Labor's policy was not fect, but it did seek to fundamentally address the punishing effective marginal tax rates that are holding our economy back. It had the overriding objective of boosting participation, particularly amongst jobless families. Income splitting was allowed, enabling a tax-free threshold of up to $12,000 for one parent. Combined with the new working tax bonus, the incentives for jobless parents to move off benefits and into work were dramatically improved, slashing effective marginal tax rates by almost 20 per cent. Family tax benefits were combined into a single payment, ensuring that multiple benefits could not be withdrawn at the same time. The income threshold before payments were withdrawn was lifted substantially from just over $30,000 per year to $50,000 per year, massively improving the rewards for work for middle-income families. The Melbourne Institute assessed the impact of Labor's package on participation and concluded that up to 71,000 extra people would be drawn into the labour market, including 49,000 jobless parents, with the potential for savings in social security outlays and extra tax revenue rising to more than $1 billion per year. That is welfare reform. We in do not have welfare reform from this government. What we really have is a welfare trap which the government remains unwilling to unlock because it will not deal effectively with the problem of high effective marginal tax rates. Nor will it come to grips with the need to invest in the capacity of people, particularly those who are denied access to rehabilitation-disability support pensioners who could do some activity in the labour market if they had real access to support when it comes to rehabilitation. In comparison to Labor's scheme, the Howard government's family benefit changes announced in the 2004 budget were estimated by the Melbourne Institute to repersult in 22,000 individuals leaving the work force. So Labor has been leading the way in constructing a participation agenda-the agenda which the government claims to have, but which it does not practise. The government has put in place a welfare trap by not putting the necessary resources forward to invest in the capacity of individuals and by not reforming the intersection between the tax system and the payments system, which punishes so many Australians who want the opportunity to move from welfare to work. It is with these remarks in mind that we have moved our constructive amendments to point out that this government has reneged on two key election promises. When it comes to the 30 per cent rebate for child care, the government has fiddled the system. Essentially, people cannot access any of that rebate for something like 18 months. What sort of payment or initiative is it when this government thinks it is assisting families by telling them it is going to give them a 30 per cent rebate for child care and then makes them wait 18 months before they see a dollar? It is just incredible. I do not think I have seen anything from this government that is more out of touch than this proposal. The government tells families to keep receipts for child care, which many of them cannot afford, for 18 months and then it might give them a quid-and does not bother to tell anyone how it intends to do it. Similarly, the fiddle that they have done with family tax benefit B is a shocker. These measures combine to essentially rip $550 million out of their original election commitments. Why don't the government own up and say, ‘We promised too much; we're ripping $550 million out and putting down an affordable scheme'? You would have more respect for them if they said that. But we get these sneaky cutbacks hidden underneath which we had to tease out from them in estimates committees. Their reneging on the child-care promise was announced two days before Christmas by Treasurer Costello, hoping no-one would notice. So $550 million has been ripped out of the commitments and taken away from families in yet another broken election promise. When you look at all these things combined, what this country desperately needs is some real welfare reform which invests in people and provides incentive and the backup to give people the capacity to stand on their own two feet. They have not been getting that for nine years and there is nothing in bill to deliver it.",92
155,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"Herbert) (8.00 p.m.)The Australian Labor Party will support the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004 before the parliament. It is interesting that there has been discussion about ‘sneaky cutbacks', the government fiddling with the system, ‘bogus' bonuses, payments not being real and in ‘mean and tricky mode'. I do not think the Australian people believe the Australian Labor Party when they hear that kind of rhetoric. They know what is proposed in the bill this evening is certainly of benefit to all Australians. I am also moved to defend the current Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Kay Patterson. There could not be a more decent and caring person in that particular portfolio. Senator Patterson knows the portfolio backwards. She knows what Australian families face and she argues fiercely for them in the cabinet. She is a great advocate for those who need income support or other benefits, for Australian families and for older Australians. This bill tonight is the result of her advocacy. Senator Kay Patterson is indeed a fine minister in this portfolio, and I would not have any other. Another thing that concerns me is the continuing attacks from the Australian Labor Party on the agency that delivers the benefits that are in this bill this evening-Centrelink. Centrelink is the model of a welfare delivery and income support system that the entire world could take note of. Centrelink is a marvellous organisation. Centrelink deals with such a huge volume of inquiries every day, does it extraordinarily efficiently, yet cops extraordinary criticism when once or twice something might go wrong. Mistakes will happen no matter what. There are althis ways mistakes. They are never wilful, but they happen. When they happen once or twice in millions of transactions every day, I get pretty cranky that such criticism is directed against the good people in Centrelink right across this country. I pay tribute to ter Doutre, who looks after the northern region from Gladstone and Cape York to the border. Peter Doutre and his people are just fantastic and a model of what happens right across the country. I certainly respect and compliment the people of Centrelink and the great work that they do for all Australians on behalf of the Australian government. I have also heard criticism tonight that welfare reform is about the government saving money. It is not. Some of the welfare reform that occurs-and some is in the bill tonight-actually costs the government fairly significant amounts of money. I want Australians to understand that just cutting costs is not the agenda of the Howard government; it is delivering services and support to Australians who need it at the time that they need it. I heard criticism in the debate tonight about the government wanting to limit access to the disability support pension. Right now there is a fellow in my electorate who is on the DSP and he runs a concreting business. How can that be? How can he be getting a disability support pension and at the same time be the principal working in a concreting business? That is wrong. Yet the Australian Labor Party say to the government: ‘We're not going to help you fix that. This is a costcutting measure.' No, it is not; it is a measure to look after people who actually need looking after and to not look after people who do not need support. All Australians would support that-all Australians, apparently, except the members of the Australian Labor Party. We have heard criticism tonight that there has been no progress on welfare reform in nine years. Goodness gracious me! The Australian Labor Party ought to ask Australian families how they feel about that. They ought to ask Australian families about the payments that the Labor Party claimed were not real. They might find that Australians are Pe- very satisfied with the progress and the reform that has occurred under the Howard government in the last nine years. Ms Hall-Ask them about interest rates.",97
156,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"Yes, we might ask them about interest rates. You know what they will say? They will say, ‘We remember what they were under the Australian Labor Party; we remember the range that they were and when they were 17 per cent.' We are happy to ask about interest rates. In relation to progress on welfare reform, of course the government have not been able to implement all the reforms we wanted to. And why not? Because the Australian Labor Party stood in the way of sensible reforms. I do not think you could point to a single reform by the Howard government-all the difficult things we have done over the last nine years-that has not been proved to be right. We have fought tooth and nail to get them through the Australian Senate, and when they have been implemented the government have been vindicated in what we wanted to do. The reforms have been very effective for Australia. We will continue to do that and Australians will be better off because of it. I am particularly pleased to see the changes to the accommodation bonds in the bill before us tonight-a very sensible measure indeed and one that will be welcomed by older Australians who currently are not exempt from lump sum accommodation bonds being taken into account in relation to their social security benefits. This not only applies to social security recipients; it also applies to recipients of veterans' affairs pensions, and so it should. It should be consistent. The government has ensured that the relevant acts will be amended, when this legislation passes, to have consistency across benefit delivery to all Australians. In exempting this particular accommodation bond from the assets test, the government has also been mindful to exempt situations where residents might not sell their home but instead rent it. The government has very sensibly exempted the rental payments to avoid those payments affecting the person's pension. This is an example of the Howard government's caring attitude towards Australians in these sorts of circumstances. We have heard about the other two parts of this bill, the FTB part B supplement and the child income cut-out amount. All of these measures in the bill are good news for Australians. They are good news for older Australians and they are good news for Australian families. My allotted time has now expired so I commend the changes in the bill. The whip says I can only speak for 10 minutesMr Murphy-What a tragedy!",98
157,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,I have to say to the member for Lowe that I would not dare challenge the whip. I commend the bill to the House and I ask the Australian Labor Party to cut out the words they have been using in relation to our welfare reforms and work with the government in the interest of all Australians.,99
158,Ms HALL,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"Shortland) (8.10 p.m.)Before I turn to the contribution I intend to make in this debate, I have to pick up on some of the comments made by the previous speaker. We on this side of the House know that when they on that side of the House mention ‘welfare reform' and ‘welfare to work', they are not talking about caring for the person or getting the best outcome for the person, they are talking about cost cutting. Cost cutting is what this government is about. It is not about getting the optimal outthey come for the person who may be in receipt of the welfare. When I heard the previous speaker pull up a person from his electorate who may be running a concreting business and use that as an example of why there should be a reform to the disability support pension, it made me sick. As somebody who worked for 13 years with people with disabilities, constructively trying to get them into the work force, giving them the skills and confidence to go in there and try to get a job, I have to say that to hear that member on that side of the House denigrating people and trying to scapegoat them, stereotype them and make out that anyone getting the disability support pension or benefiting from the current system is in some way trying to rort the system is absolutely disgraceful. The member should hang his head in shame. To say that the Howard government is noted for its caring attitude, for its caring nature, for being caring towards all those people who are on welfare is an absolute joke. He must take the members of this House for idiots if he thinks that is what the people of Australia think of the Howard government. Members of this House sit in their electorate offices with constituent after constituent coming into see them to complain about actions taken by the Howard government, so I would have to say that the member is deluding himself. I will turn to the substance of what I wish to say in this debate. I and members on this side of the House support the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005, but our support is somewhat tempered by the government's failure to fully deliver on an election promise it made to the Australian people. I suppose you could say that we should not be surprised by that, but the Australian people voted for this government and believed what it had to say. Unfortunately, have put their trust in a government that has made a name for itself for not delivering or not quite telling the truth about matters that it puts to the Australian people. Unfortunately, part of this legislation falls into that category, and I will touch on that in a moment. But, overall, I think that the bill does deliver some meaningful gains to the Australian people. The bill seeks to implement the introduction of a family tax benefit part B supplement, and I will concentrate on that a little later. There are changes to the formula for calculating the child income cut-off amount for family tax benefit and exempting aged care accommodation bonds from the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. When this legislation is enacted it will introduce a new family tax benefit part B supplement and that will be effective from January 2005. It will replace the existing formula for the child income cut-off amount for family tax benefit with a specific cut-off amount of $11,233 and there is a new formula for annual indexation of this amount. It exempts aged care accommodation bonds from the operation of the social security and veterans' affairs assets test. I will concentrate on that last part first. I like to be positive. I was a little bit negative at the start of my contribution to this debate but I will be positive now. I think that it is a very good move to exempt aged care accommodation bonds from the Social Security Act and the veterans' affairs assets test. This is one of those matters that I have had constituents come and talk to me about. It is a matter that has created great angst for elderly people and for their families. It is something that I have made representation to the government about and that I have tried to support for a long time. It is very commendable that finally the government has embraced this matter. By doing so, it is assisting those elderly people who find they have to move into low-care accommodation and making it a lot easier for them to make the transition. I mean ‘easier' not from a financial point of view but from a psychosocial point of view. It is very hard for an older person to make the decision to leave their home. They are very attached to it. The ownership of that home, the memories that go with it and everything else that is associated with it are very important to them. When they do sell the home and then find out that it can affect their social security or veterans' benefit, that further exacerbates the anxiety that is caused because in many cases they feel that they are losing the security that the money they had for their home gave them. This legislation puts them in a similar position to those people who are currently in receipt of social security and veterans' payments. So I see that as a very positive move by the government and a very positive part of this legislation. I am sure the members on the other side of the House will recognise that I do not give compliments lightly, but I think this is positive and that it should have happened a long time ago. On that point this legislation gets a big tick but, unfortunately, there are other parts of the legislation that I am not quite so happy with. I support the second reading amendment. The first part of that amendment is about the failure of the government to pay families the $300 increase in the maximum rate of the FTB part B starting from 1 July 2005 which is what was promised in its election policyextra assistance for families. But, once again, the government has walked away from a promise it made to the Australian people. It thinks it can shuffle sideways and it thinks that it can trick the Australian people. It does not understand that Australian people actually rely on the government and they believe the government. Every time the government changes its position, every time it does not deliver properly, it not only undermines itself, it undermines all members of parliament. It creates a belief in the community that you cannot trust members of parliament because they do not deliver on what they say. The government says one thing before an election and does another thing after the election. I find that particularly obnoxious because as a member of parliament I always try to be very honest with the people that I represent in this parliament and I place great importance on the fact that, as members of this House, we have an obligation to the people we represent and to all Australians to tell the truth. By not fully delivering on that promise of $300, the government stands condemned. But I know I should not be surprised. I know people on this side of the House share my feelings. I think that it is very disappointing. The next part of the amendment is to condemn the government for hypocritically claiming that the payment of up to $150 that families will now receive from 1 July is a ‘bonus' when in fact it is only half of what was promised in extra assistance. That goes back to what I was saying a moment ago, because a bonus is not getting half of what the Australian people believed that they would be getting by voting for this government. What they are getting is trickery and deceit and the government stands condemned for that. The next part of the amendment criticises the government for not giving families choice in receiving the additional family tax benefit part B money fortnightly or having it paid in a lump sum as part of eligible families' tax returns. Families find that quite diselection. turbing. It is important that people have choice about how they receive their payments. I suppose if you look at the daily amount it is rather small, but if you are on a tight budget and you need that money on a fortnightly basis, you need it then; you do not need it at the end of the financial year. The government just does not understand how hard it is for families. It does not understand that people actually struggle on a dayto-day basis to make ends meet. It does not understand the difficulties that families experience. And to remove that choice, in itself, can create hardship for people. I know that many people of the other side of this parliament have extreme wealth and do not understand just how important it can be to have that money on a fortnightly basis. The final part of our amendment, which is pretty self-explanatory, is the failure of the government to address the work disincentives caused by the family tax benefit B. It is all driven by their ideology, by their philosophical bent. They are not looking at the real issues, at how their decisions, their actions, affect Australian families. This is a government that gives on one hand and takes on the other. It throws money at Australian people before the election and then it takes it back afterwards-in this case, it takes half of it back. It is a government that talks about keeping interest rates low-and what happens after the election? Interest rates are on the way up. That in itself creates enormous hardships for families. I have already had families contacting my office, talking about the hardship that this will create. This is a deceitful government. Its failure to fully deliver on its election promises in this legislation demonstrates its deceit. The Australian people recognise this deceit and if the government continues in this way they will send it a very strong message at the next",99
159,Mr FAWCETT,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"I rise to support the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005. Before the member for Shortland leaves, I note that it is terrific to see that she recognises the things that the government is doing even though, along with the rest of her party, she seeks to mislead the Australian people time and again by listening only to the parts she wants to and by spreading misinformation in this place as well as in the media about the things the government has done. The good news is that the people of Australia are far smarter than the ALP and the member for Shortland realise, hence the result of 9 October last year. This bill is about the government's ongoing commitment to listening to and acting in support of three of the most significant parts of our community: families, seniors and veterans. On the first occasion I was privileged to speak in this place I highlighted my belief that families are a key part of our society. Part of the reason I chose to stand for election to represent the people of Wakefield here was a commitment to families. I welcome any move toward supporting stronger relationships and functional, loving families. This commitment to raise the amount of family tax benefit part B through a supplement a welcome addition to the other practical outcomes this government has delivered to the people of Wakefield. I am happy to sayand I am sure that this will disappoint the member for Shortland-that these outcomes do not go unnoticed. While I was door-knocking the many young families living in new housing developments such as Blakeview, Hillbank, Hewett and Andrews Farm, many spoke of their relief that the Howard government has kept interest rates in a low band of around six to eight per cent compared to the 10 per cent of the previous, Labor government. This means that families can enjoy the security of their own home. Parents I have spoken to have welcomed the facts regarding immunisation. The member for Shortland has said that this government is about money and that it does not care about people. She is partly right. This government is about money, because of the outcomes that it brings for people. While the last Labor government spent just $13 million on vaccines keeping our children healthy, in the next financial year the Howard government will spend $286 million on vaccines-a 22-fold increase on the 1996 figure. This means that childhood immunisation rates, which were at just 50 per cent in the early 1990s under Labor, are now amongst the best in the world at above 90 per cent. Furthermore, groups such as the Clare and Gilbert Valley Council in the north of Wakefield have gone from telling me about the shortages of child care in their area to now telling me that because of the policies of the Howard government they have a number of providers vying to provide long day care in Clare. The residents of Kapunda and surrounding districts have told me of their excitement about the $519,000 incentive funding made available recently by the Howard government to enable the establishment of a is child-care centre and the opportunities this will open up for families in their district. While this family tax benefit supplement will assist families, I note in the legislation the measures needed to take account of the single parent situations and situations where custody is shared. Wakefield has a large number of families whom this will apply to, and often the children involved require additional support and help, particularly with early learning. I have begun discussions with local church, community and education groups to examine the best ways this govto 17 ernment can provide targeted support to these communities of children in need. I am passionate about this not only so that these young people can have a better childhood but so that they have the opportunity to achieve their full potential as they grow into young adults-the future of our society. These same clauses in the legislation highlight to me once again the enormous financial and emotional cost of relationship breakdown and the dysfunction that so frequently follows in our community. An article on the front page of the Australian of 10 February this year highlighted the fact that, while not all marriages work, successful relationships are possible, that they are about choices and support and that, importantly, the benefits of successful marriages flow not only to the couple involved but to dren as well as the broader circle of people touched by the family. With this government, I will continue to work with the people of Wakefield and Australia to identify and promote ways to better value and support healthy, viable marriages. This bill is also about the Howard government delivering outcomes for pensioners and veterans. Whether it was in Davoren Park, Elizabeth Grove, Salisbury North, Mallala or Riverton, talking with pensioners and self-funded retirees highlighted to me their concerns about the viability of their lifestyle now and at the point when they move into care of some kind. These people welcomed the Howard government's provision of a utilities supplement which will help them meet practical needs; the $148 million package for elderly carers, which will provide more financial help and respite; as well as the increasing rebate for private health insurmunity ance for older Australians. Another real concern, however, was the potential impact of the costs of aged care. They saw that the inclusion of the accommodation bond in assessing their social security payment and the retention of the family home, which in the eyes of many is an inheritance, would affect their disposable income through both asset and income testing. This bill will not only resolve this issue, by exempting the balance of the bond from the assets test, but also it will provide certainty as to the status of their former family home. If the property is rented out and the income is used to pay periodic bond payments, the rental will be excluded from the social security income test and the home itself will remain exempt from the means test. Importantly, these amendments also apply to veterans. They will enjoy the same benefits and have more certainty about their future once these amendments to the social security law, the family assistance law and the Veterans' their chil- Entitlements Act are passed. Unlike the member for Shortland, the Australian people recognise that these amendments-this follow-through of the commitments made during the election-are just the latest instalment from a government which over the last nine years has consistently listened to, and delivered results and real benefits to, the families, pensioners and veterans in Australia's community. I am therefore happy to support the bill.",101
160,Mr CIOBO,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"I am certainly pleased to speak this evening on the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005. The bill sees the Howard government following through on a commitment that we made during the election campaign to ensure that we provide in a very full way for those people in our comthat rely on family tax benefit part B, as well as providing increased certainty for veterans under the veterans affairs assets test when it comes to dealing with social security. As well, the bill replaces the existing formula for the child income cut-out amount for family tax benefit part B with a set amount of $11,233. I am also pleased to speak to this bill because it addresses the primary concerns of two communities in my electorate of Moncrieff, particularly those people on the Gold Coast. They are of course the veterans community on the Gold Coast and those many Gold Coasters with young families that rely on the support that the Howard government provides them through family tax benefit part B. Before I get to the detail of the bill, I would like to make some comments on family tax benefit part B, particularly the fact that the government took the decision to pay the increased amount of $300 from 1 July onwards as a lump sum payment. This is an important component of the government's legislation and goes to the core of the fact that the Howard government recognises that Australian families benefit from lump sum payments. Despite the many concerns that the opposition raises, I would contend that those concerns are false and hollow and that the rhetoric that the Australian Labor Party engages in, especially when it comes to lump sum payments made by the Howard government to support hard-working Australian families, is done for no reason other than cheap political point scoring. I am pleased to associate myself very closely with the Multiple Birth Association, one of the many very active community groups in the Gold Coast community. The Multiple Birth Association have a very active membership. I am a big supporter of theirs and I am very proud of the work that they do as advocates for those people that have had twins or triplets and the like. I am also very proud of the role that they play in keeping informed those people that are encountering a lot of the burdens and challenges that go with having multiple children from the one birth, by taking them through the process and teaching them about mechanisms that they can use and also about assistance that is available, so that the experience of young children is one that is ultimately not too stressful for the parents concerned. I think we would all recognise that perhaps having twins or triplets in one birth would present series of unique challenges for many families, so the role that the Multiple Birth Association play is an important one, and that is why I am pleased to assist them. Recently, during the campaign, I had the opportunity to have the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator the Hon. Kay Patterson, visit my electorate for a short while. While the minister was there, I made sure that she had the opportunity to meet with representatives of the Multiple Birth Association. We made sure that we took the opportunity, while we were discussing the challenges that they face, to discuss the ways in which family tax benefits have been of assistance to them. I would highlight the message that came through very loudly and clearly from the large number of mothers that were there on that particular day to meet with the minister. They indicated their overwhelming support for these types of payments being made as lump sums. The reality is that, contrary to what the ALP says, it is not a case of families going out and squandering the money on all sorts of inappropriate purchases or activities. The vast majority of families use this money very effectively to ensure that they make available to their young children the very best that they can. This might include, for example, using the lump sum to purchase seats for their vehicle, new bunk beds or other equipment that is crucial to ensuring that the children that are born into these families have the very best possible start in life. That is why I am particularly pleased to support this bill. In particular, the announcement during the 2004 election campaign that the government would increase the rate of family tax benefit part B by $300 per annum from 1 July 2005 was one that I had no difficulty at all in highlighting to my electorate and explaining the benefits that would flow from it. I am certainly pleased about it and I know from the a mothers I have spoken with at the Multiple Birth Association as well as other people who have approached me at the listening posts that I hold in the community that parents like lump sum payments and they like the fact that they provide them an opportunity, as I said, to purchase a new set of bunk beds or the kind of equipment that they need for their children. Likewise I am pleased that now the federal government has been able to ensure that aged care accommodation bonds are exempt assets when it comes to social security and the veterans entitlements assets test. This been an issue that a number of veterans have raised with me. On the Gold Coast there is a very large and significant veteran population. The Gold Coast has the fourth largest veteran population in Australia and I am very pleased that the government has been able to move in this way thanks to its economic responsibility. Thanks to the good economic management of the government we are in a position where we can exempt aged care accommodation bonds from the social security and veterans entitlements assets test. The reality is that many veterans rely on this exemption to ensure that they are able to obtain the greatest entitlement that they can. It is an entitlement that I know veterans appreciate. On the Gold Coast my relationship with a number of veterans groups-in particular the Nerang RSL, the Surfers Paradise RSL and the Southport RSL-has shown me that this issue was important to them, and I am pleased the government has been able to respond in this way. The third aim of the bill is to replace the existing formula for the child income cut-out for family tax benefit with the new set amount of $11,233. This is an important amendment. Whilst I will not go into detail, I know that it will be most welcome. In summary, this is an important bill. I know that all areas of the community will benefit from it. I am pleased to support it.",103
161,Mr BILSON,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"It is a great pleasure to conclude remarks on the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005. This very important measure is further evidence of all the things that the Howard government has been able to achieve through its sound management of the economy and parhas ticularly helping those sections of the community most in need. I commend the member for Moncrieff for his remarks. I particularly relate to the comments he made regarding the exemption of the aged care bonds from the means test. Two important commitments made by the government during the 2004 election campaign will be put into effect through the social security, family assistance and veterans entitlements amendments made by this bill. They are aimed at Australian families with children and older Australians-arguably those Australians most in need. Under the first of these commitments, families will benefit from the introduction of a new family tax benefit part B supplement. The new supplement will be paid on top of the standard rate of FTB part B as a lump sum on income reconciliation after the end of the income year. This mirrors the payment arrangements for the FTB part A supplement introduced last year. The initial annual amount of the new supplement for 2004-05 will be $302.95. On a daily basis, this comes to 83c. The first payment of the FTB part B supplement will be made at the daily rate for the remaining portion of the income year after commencement of the measure on 1 January 2005. Therefore, the maximum FTB part B supplement for this financial year would be 181 days at 83c per day, or $150.23. The FTB part B supplement will be indexed annually on 1 July according to the annual movements in the consumer price index. However, the first indexation, on 1 July 2005, will be a one-off six-month indexation arrangement to reflect the supplement's commencement on 1 January 2005. The bill will make a further amendment to FTB to repeal the existing formula set down for the FTB child income cut-out amount. A child whose income equals or exceeds the cut-out amount cannot attract payment of FTB. The formula is being replaced with a specified amount of $11,233, which represents annual indexation of the existing amount for 2004-05 of $10,948. This new cut-out amount, which will apply from 1 July 2005, will be CPI indexed on 1 July in each following year. The new amount is higher than the amount of $11,218 that would have been applicable from 1 July 2005 under the existing formula. The second of the election commitments addressed by this bill has been made by the government to give older Australians peace of mind and greater capacity to manage their transition to aged care. The measure is to exempt aged care accommodation bonds from the social security and veterans entitlements means test. If a customer pays an accommodation bond to an aged care facility, the refundable balance of the bond is currently assessed as an asset of the customer under the means test. This may reduce the customer's payment or rule out payment altogether. These arrangements will significantly improve that situation so that many older Australians will receive more or will receive a payment that was previously unavailable. Furthermore, customers who pay their accommodation bonds by periodic payment will now be able to rent out their former home without the rental payments affecting their rate of payment. They will assets test exemption for their former home while ever it is rented out. This advance is in line with the current concessions available to residents in high-level aged care who pay accommodation charges. Customers who will now be eligible for either a social security or veterans entitlements payment because of these changes may be able to have their payment backdated to 1 July 2005. All that will be necessary is for these customers to claim payment from Centrelink or the Department of Veterans' Affairs before 30 September 2005 or, if they have special circumstances, 30 June 2006. I commend the bill to the House.",105

164,Ms MACKLIN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga) (8.46 p.m.)The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005 is the fourth bill we have dealt with that tidies up a host of bungles that have now been discovered in the Higher Education Support Act. This is in addition to the hundreds of government amendments moved when the act was originally passed back in December 2003-all this for an act that has only been in force for about nine weeks. When the original legislation was introduced in September 2003, the Minister for Education, Science and Training tried to convince us that we had to pass it without amendment as a matter of urgency. This is the sort of arrogant and sloppy legislation that unfortunately we can expect to see a lot more of once the government has absolute control over the parliament from July this year. The bill before us has four main elements: firstly, to meet funding commitments made in the lead-up to and during the election; secondly, to provide the fourth round of technical amendments associated with the implementation of the Higher Education Support Act passed in December 2003; thirdly, to alter the composition of the governing council of the Australian Maritime College so that it complies with the national governance protocols; and, finally, to give access to table B providers to the capital development pool. I will go through the first part of the lation. The bill includes $48.7 million over four years for the following initiatives: 100 new student places in radiation therapy, 40 new aged care nursing places, 12 new medical places for James Cook University, infrastructure funds for James Cook University, infrastructure funds for the new Australian Maritime College campus at Point Nepean, infrastructure funding for IT for Charles Darwin University, and national institute funding for the Australian National University. The Australian Labor Party support all of these worthwhile initiatives, but we note that many of the commitments are to be delivered to universities in highly marginal coalition held seats. This is an issue I will return to later, but I must say I feel a bit sorry for the universities that do not happen to be located in marginal electorates, and it does call into question the way in which this government allocates funds to our universities. As I indicated, this is the fourth bill to tidy up the mess that the minister presented to this parliament in 2003, and from the look of the program we have even more to come. Every time we look, we are faced with another tidy-up bill to paper over a few more of cracks in what appeared at the time to the minister to be a faultless bill. The technical amendments before us today deal with the following issues. Firstly, they make clear that compliance with the tuition assurance requirements for higher education providers is ongoing, not only at the point of approval. Secondly, they alter the minister's powers to exempt higher education providers from the tuition assurance scheme to allow conditions to be placed on the exemption. Thirdly, they clarify the conditions under which the Howard government's seven-year learning limit must be recredited and the HECS-HELP loan recredlegisited should a provider be unable to offer a unit in which a student is enrolled. Labor will support all of those amendments. The most significant policy issue in the bill is the proposal to give table B providers access to the $43 million a year capital development pool for university infrastructure. Since general capital allocations were rolled into operating grants for universities more than a decade ago, this is now the only capital funding to universities over which the Commonwealth has discretion. The current impact of this section of the bill would be to give Bond University, the University of Notre Dame and Melbourne College of Divinity the ability to apply for grants under the capital development pool. However, this list could grow as additional providers are added to table B in the future. While we will not be opposing this provision, the opposition do have a number of concerns about the lack of transparency and about the way in which this proposal has been introduced. It is important to note at this stage that extending the number of institutions that will be eligible to access the fund without an increase in the size of the fund amounts to a real cut in funding for what is already pretty dilapidated university infrastructure. Like many of my colleagues, I am aware that our universities have countless examples of need for capital development to either expand or replace existing infrastructure. The government in this legislation is cutting the finite pie into a larger number of pieces. Of course, the size of each piece will inevitably get smaller. If the government is serious about providing support where it has not previously done so, it would be good if the government decided to make available increased money as it increases the number of institutions that can apply. It is also worth noting that there was absolutely no prior warning and no public discussion of this initiative prior to the bill's introter's duction to the House just three weeks ago. There was certainly no mention of it before the election and there has been almost no explanation of the rationale for the change, just a pretty bland statement of the outcome. There has been no explanation of where this proposal might sit within the government's broader ideas being floated by the minister at the moment about which higher education institutions are going to be eligible for public subsidies. These are very significant changes that the minister is floating and, as I say, it would be useful to know where this change fits within his thinking. There has been absolutely no discussion about whether this proposal will be used as a precedent to extend funding under more significant programs. There has been no comment on whether the government has similar plans to extend access to other funds to the much more numerous higher education providers outside table B. So we are certainly very keen to hear the government's response to these issues and get a much more detailed rationale from the government to inform consideration by the parliament. I look forward to the minister's response to our concerns when he sums up and to further exploration of his response when the bill reaches the Senate, but in the end we will not be standing in the way of the change. As I said, there was no mention of this proposal to expand the number of institutions eligible for the capital development pool before the election-absolutely no mention at all. You might ask how the minister could have told us about it during the election campaign because he did not actually release a higher education policy. Of all the things we have heard about from the minister, all the kites that have been flown, not one of them was talked about before the election. Maybe it was something that was out of the miniscontrol. We certainly had the impression that the government wanted to talk about anything but the changes that it has now foisted upon our universities and, more particularly, foisted upon students and their families. Students and families are by no means impressed with the government's continuing attempts to expand the number of full fee paying places at our universities. Students and parents do not support the increases in HECS that have now impacted on so many students around the country. Maybe it is no surprise that we had a government that was not prepared to talk about higher education before the election, but it pretty extraordinary that immediately after the election we have a minister who, out in the media, is floating ideas all the time but who made no effort to discuss those with the Australian people before the election. Even if the government had decided to release a policy before the election, you would have to wonder whether anyone would have believed what it said, because the government when it comes to higher education promises before elections certainly has a bit of of giving up on those promises pretty soon after. I remember the now Leader in the Senate promising before the 1996 election that a Howard government would not introduce full fees for Australian undergraduates. One had only to wait until August, following the election in March, for that promise to be ignored-it did not take long at all. The government, of course, decided they would introduce full fees for Australian undergraduates, and now we have fees of up to $210,000 at one university. Students can now buy their way into university, ahead of students with better marks, but of course only if you have these massive sums of money$100,000, $150,000, $200,000-outrageous sums of money, whereby students are jumping the queue and buying a place at university. The government, as I said, have got form. Once again, in 2001, they went to the electorate and promised they would not increase the proportion of full fee paying students. That promise was not worth much. By 2003, the same minister that we have now was announcing his intention to lift the number of full fee payers by increasing the proportion of courses that can be taken up by full fee payers to 50 per cent. This was pulled back somewhat in the Senate to 35 per cent, but we will have to see how long that lasts once is the government has absolute control over the parliament from July this year. We also should not forget that the minister told us in the parliament that the deregulation he was pushing through when he introduced the last round of changes to higher education would not mean huge HECS hikes. He actually had the audacity to say to the parliament: What that means in real terms is that the HECS charge for most courses in most universities will a track record not change at all. Nothing could be further from the truth, as I am sure you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. It did not last. Within a year, the vast majority of universities had put their fees up for all possible courses, and most of them by the maximum allowed under the legislation. You would have to say, when it comes to higher education, the government's track record of saying one thing before an election and then doing something completely different is pretty strong. They did not say anything about this clause in the bill before the election; they have just dreamt it up since the election. They did not bother talking to the public about it, and here we have it in a piece of legislation. The other serious concerns that we have about the impact of the government's changes on higher education particularly go to what is happening to the number of places in our universities. Last year, under this government, the number of HECS students actually fell by more than 8,000 while the number of full fee paying places increased by 2,500. What an extraordinary record for a government. The government is very fond of claiming that full fee paying students do not displace a single HECS student. Debate interrupted. NA",107
165,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. International Women's Day",110
166,Ms OWENS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to acknowledge the women in my electorate and around the country who every day break down barriers and overcome obstacles to build full lives for themselves their families, women who rise through the ranks, women who break into new career paths for women, women who find ways to mix family with career and women who choose to stay at home and cope with the financial penalties that arise from that choice-the ordinary and extraordinary women who, at a time of changing roles for men and women, work every day to find ways to fashion lives of their own choosing. International Women's Day, 8 March, is just over 30 years old, but the fight by women for women is much, much older than that. Mary Wollstonecraft, who wrote A Vindication of the Rights of Women in 1792, said: I do not wish women to have power over men; but over themselves. She was years, perhaps centuries, ahead of her time, but today her words are absolutely appropriate. Women all around the country and women that I meet every day want and expect power over their own lives, yet we find on a daily basis that there are barriers for women seeking to exercise that powerbarriers that governments have the capacity to overcome. A couple of months ago I met a woman in Rydalmere who had an eight-month-old child. She had put her child on the waiting list at the local child-care centre when she was still pregnant. She did not have a car; she needed to use the local centre. When the child was eight months old, she planned on going back to work, so she started looking for work. She found work that would start two months after that. A month before she was due to start work, the local child-care centre phoned and offered her a place for her child. At that stage, because she had not started work, she could not afford the fees, so she said, ‘Can I delay it for a month?' The child-care centre said, ‘No, we have to give and the place away.' A month later, when she tried to start work, she could not find child care for her child. When she had child care she could not afford it; when she could afford it she did not have child care. So this is a woman who remained out of the work force and is still out of the work force while she tries to find a child-care place and a job which appears in the same week. I met another woman raising three children on her own who was desperate to go back to work and had the skills to go back to work, but because of the way the family payments and the tax system are structured the day she went back to work she was worse off. If she could have afforded to have been worse off, she would have gone back to work, but she simply could not afford it. So there was a woman with the skill and the will to work who was trapped by her circumstances. When I meet with businesswomen I am astonished at how often a group of quite senior businesswomen will sit around talking about the difficulties they have with child care. Even given the opportunity to talk about business, when meeting with senior business figures their main priority is how difficult they find it to balance their careers with child care. When I go to a child-care centre expecting to talk about child care, I am amazed at how often I find myself talking to women about how difficult they find it to find work. So it does not matter whether you are talking to women without work or women with work, the issue remains the same: it is about ways to find a balance between children and career. It also is apparent that women are the first to suffer from any downturn in conditions-a downturn in the economy or in working conditions. When the labour force is increasingly casualised, it is women who are the first into the ranks of casual labour. It is women who first suffer that lack of security and income. When we do not provide appropriately for the aged, it is women who drop out of the work force to care for their parents first. It is women who bear the burden of downturns. But, as I said earlier, Mary Wollstonecraft, well ahead of her time, got it absolutely right. I know from my conversations with many women that they expect us to get it right. They expect us in this House to make it possible for them to do what they know they need to do with their lives, which is to build lives that suit them. Whether they choose to stay home or go back to work, whether they choose to go back full time or part time, whether they choose a casual work lifestyle or a part-time work lifestyle, they expect us to take the barriers down so that they can actually make their own choices and build their own lives. Bishop David Chislett",110
167,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in the House today to congratulate the Right Reverend David Chislett SSC, the Rector of All Saints Anglican Church, Brisbane, on his consecration as a bishop in the Church of God on 16 February 2005 at the Parish Church of the Good Shepherd, Rosemont, Philadelphia, in the United States of America. I know Bishop Chislett very well. I have attended All Saints Wickham Terrace for years, first when I was a student at secondary school. I am a former altar server, parish councillor and synodsperson. Bishop Chislett was consecrated to serve the traditional Anglicans in this country and Forward in Faith Australia who are dismayed at the heterodox views of many of the Anglican bishops in this country. Bishop Chislett will work with the Traditional Anglican Communion to bring orthodox Anglicanism to a new future. The chief consecrator was Archbishop John Hepworth, the Australian Primate of the Traditional Anglican Communion, and there were a number of coconsecrators, including the Anglican Bishop of the Murray, the Right Reverend Ross Davies, and the Anglican Bishop of Ruvuma in Tanzania, Bishop Kapinga. It is important to recognise that the Anglican Church over the years has always claimed to be part of the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, and in fact the threefold order of ministry is the same as in the great communions of the West and the East-that is, the Roman Catholic Church and the Churches of Eastern Orthodoxy. I am indebted to the Bishop of the Murray, who participated in the consecration, for some of the remarks I am about to make. I was always taught that the Anglican Church is the Catholic Church of England but, regrettably, in 1992 the Church of England broke with Catholic order when it legislated to allow for women to be ordained to the apostolic ministry of the priesthood. In the same year the Anglican Church of Australia enacted similar legislation. Traditional Anglicans would consider this to be a breach of Catholic tradition and Catholic order, and in fact it does present a situation in the Anglican Communion today in which we have impaired communion and where many bishops and people feel unable to be totally in communion with all in the Canterbury Anglican Communion. In England when this occurred in 1992 there was a provision made for provincial episcopal visitors, and a number of ‘flying bishops' were appointed to minister to those congregations that were not able to accept the ministry of their bishop who had ordained women, thereby leaving the Catholic faith. In the Australian spirit of a fair go it unreasonable that the Anglican Church in Australia should have made a similar provision for those Anglicans who, in all conscientiousness, were unable to accept the departure from Catholic order. I have observed the ministry of Bishop Chislett at All Saints Wickham Terrace. I have seen him build a congregation which was quite small into one that every Sunday now has more communicants at high mass than St Johns Anglican Cathedral in Brisbane. He has pastoral gifts, principles, integrity and is someone who should be held up as a role model for all Anglican clergy. Bishop Chislett will continue as the Rector of All Saints Wickham Terrace while carrying out his new episcopal ministry on behalf of traditional Anglicans in this country and Forward in Faith Australia. He will also work as part of the Traditional Anglican Communion and the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia. I commend Bishop Ross Davies for his courage in participating in this consecration, along with the other bishops. Bishop Chislett is an example to all of us. He is an outstanding pastor and for 10 years has served conscientiously as the Rector of All Saints Wickham Terrace and he is a person who will enhance the future of Anglicanism in this country. Bishop Chislett understands the Anglican Church is the English expression of the Catholic faith. He is quite uncompromising and highly principled. He is a person I want to salute in the federal parliament as a person who should enjoy the admiration of all of us. International Women's Day",111
168,Mrs ELLIOT,ADJOURNMENT,"I am very proud to rise and speak on behalf of the women of Richmond to mark International Women's Day. In talking to many women across my electorate I find that opis not portunity is a common theme of our discussions. Women want the opportunity to further their education, to balance work and family commitments and to access decent health care when they need it and when their families need it. Of course, all of this is made a lot easier when women live in a safe and secure environment. Late last year I met with the women who run the Tweed Shire Women's Service. They provide support, counselling and a safe haven for women who have been the victims of domestic violence. When I was a police officer, the sad truth was that I spent a great deal of my time attending domestic violence situations. In my experience, when women live in a safe and supportive environment it is only then that they can find real opportunities. Let me turn to another issue that, because of this government's complacency, is limiting opportunities for women. Across my electorate there is a shortage of child-care places. We are the second fastest growing region in the country, and I speak to families every week that are waiting to get their children into child care. For too long child care has been underfunded and, on top of this, it is becoming increasingly unaffordable for working families. In another broken promise to families in my electorate, the Howard government has reneged on its pledge to pay a 30 per cent tax rebate on child care this year. Now, families will be forced to wait until July 2006. The Prime Minister is so out of touch with ordinary working families that he has failed to deliver this much-needed relief. This government has indeed become so complacent that it no longer believes it should keep its promises to Australian families. Parents are battling to get their babies and toddlers into long day care and family day care, and when those kids go on to school there is a shortage of available vacation and after school care. I recently visited a local child-care facility that provides after school care and vacation care. The manager of the centre told me she was literally overrun with parents wanting to put their children into vacation care. She simply could not cater to them and had to turn so many of them away. This often means that working families have to find alternatives that simply do not exist. One solution is to provide more funding and therefore more child-care places. Child care has been neglected; it is as simple as that. As a mother of two young children, Alexandra, who is 6, and Joe, who is 5, I know that the reality is that a lack of child care limits opportunities for women. In 2005 women should not have to choose between continuing their career or education and having a family. If they choose to stay at home with their families, they should be able to do so without feeling financial pressure to go back to work straight away. But the government's broken promise has only added to that pressure. These are not just women's issues; they are also community issues. Women make up more than half the population. It stands to reason that issues affecting us affect the tire community. It is unfortunate that women are paying the price for this government's complacency. I also often speak to many elderly women who have so much difficulty in accessing health care, decent dental care and home care, and they have difficulty in finding places in aged care centres as well. There is a whole range of issues in relation to women that are so important, and I have been very proud to stand here today and speak on behalf of the women of Richmond. Roads: Brisbane Urban Corridor",112
169,Mr VASTA,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak about the effects of truck traffic on residents of the Bonner electorate. In particular, I wish to draw attention to a notorious section of the national freight route known as the Brisbane urban corridor, the BUC. To residents of my electorate the BUC is more commonly known as the Mount GravattCapalaba Road. This is not a new issue. It first surfaced in the early 1990s and it has continued to be of great concern to the local residents ever since. It is no coincidence that I have chosen this to be the first matter that I have raised in the House. This issue is as important to me as it is to my constituents. The Brisbane urban corridor cuts across Brisbane's southern suburbs and links the Ipswich Motorway to the Gateway Motorway. This 11-kilometre corridor includes Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road, Kessels Road, Riawena Road and Granard Road. It is a road corridor that was clearly not designed to carry the traffic it now carries. Each day up to 50,000 vehicles travel on this route. Although there are many different users of the BUC, there is no doubt that truck traffic has the greatest impact on the surrounding suburbs. In the Bonner electorate, residents of suburbs like Wishart, Upper Mount Gravatt, en- Mansfield and Eight Mile Plains have to live with the effects of this traffic every day. It has a major impact on their quality of life. This is a fact that nobody disputes. Elected representatives from all levels of government and from both major political parties are united in their recognition that truck traffic on the BUC is a serious problem. In particular, I wish to acknowledge the efforts of my colleagues the honourable member for Moreton, Mr Gary Hardgrave, and the councillor for Wishart, Mr Graham Quirk, who have fought tirelessly for around a decade to highlight the need for action on this issue. In 2002 the Howard government demonstrated their commitment to local residents by funding a major study aimed at finding solutions to the problems on the BUC. This study received feedback from close to 2,000 people, and more than 20 separate community meetings were held during the process. The results of this study confirmed what residents already knew: truck traffic was a problem that impacted on their daily lives in a major way. One local family who participated in the study commented, ‘Traffic, pollution and trucks make our life miserable.' Although this is the comment of just a single family, I know that it reflects the feelings of thousands of people living along the BUC. The outcome of this planning study was a series of recommendations aimed at improving traffic conditions and reducing the amount of heavy vehicle traffic on the BUC. I am pleased to report that two of the most important recommendations to come out of the study are being implemented as I speak. Starting on 28 February, a 12-month trial commenced to allow trucks to travel toll free at night on the Gateway Motorway extension and the Logan Motorway. These toll roads are the major alternative routes to the BUC. The study found that many truckies were using the BUC to avoid the motorway tolls. This trial is aimed at getting non-local and non-essential truck traffic off the BUC when residents are trying to sleep. In addition to this trial, new number plate recognition cameras have been installed on Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road to monitor traffic. These cameras will help us to identify overloaded trucks, oversized trucks, speeding trucks, noisy trucks and polluting trucks. The cameras will also help us to determine the effectiveness of the toll-free trial. In short time since the trial started I have already received some very encouraging feedback. One Upper Mount Gravatt resident told me that even after just four nights he had noticed a dramatic reduction in traffic noise and truck traffic. I have had similar feedback from other residents. While we still have a long way to go, I am delighted that we have now taken the first crucial steps towards achieving better outcomes for residents living along the BUC. I look forward to working with local residents and my federal and state colleagues to ensure that we continue to make progress over the coming months and years. International Women's Day",113
170,Ms HOARE,ADJOURNMENT,"Charlton) (9.19 p.m.)Today, 8 March 2005, women in this place, in our home towns, across this nation and throughout the world celebrate International Women's Day. I pay tribute and my respects to Indigenous women around the country who are still struggling for equality and justice in the areas of health, education and employment. I also pay tribute to the members of the Newcastle branch of the Union of Australian Women. All of us have older women in our electorates who were in the midst of the major struggles to try to achieve justice and equity for themselves and their generation but more particularly for their daughters and their granddaughters. These are the women of the Save Our Sons campaign, who protested against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, and they are still actively protesting against violence in all forms including Australia's involvement in Iraq. Their grandmothers fought for the right to vote for women; they fought against discrimination against women and for free and accessible education and equal wages for women. Unfortunately, today women still lag far behind the men in wages, are still under represented in our parliaments and do not sit in equal numbers as CEOs or executive officers of our major companies. Women still carry the greater responsibility for child rearing, housework and caring for elderly parents-to name but a few. Another major struggle of our grandmothers and mothers was, and is, that relating to women's reproductive rights and women's rights to control their own fertility. Unfortupoor nately, the Australian public has been once again assailed with the abortion debate. Who raised and who is leading the current debate about reproductive rights in this country? Some conservatives and some church leaders, led by none other than Australia's selfappointed morals crusader, the Minister for Health and Ageing. Be afraid; be very afraid. We have here a minister for health in a conservative government who is vehemently opposed to women having control of their own fertility and reproductive rights. Women's access to safe, legal abortion is a major public health issue. Mortality from abortions has declined since 1971, when many states changed their legislation to provide some protection for abortion providers. Prior to 1971, abortion was a major cause of death related to pregnancy, with an average of 25 per cent of maternal deaths being attributed to abortion. Since 1971 deaths associated with abortion are rare. The World Health Organisation estimates that globally 19 million unsafe abortions take place each year and that 68,000 women die as a consequence of this. The majority of unsafe abortions occur in developing countries where unsafe abortions are characterised by unskilled or undertrained practitioners, unsanitary facilities, a lack of post-abortion care and hazardous techniques. The WHO characterises unsafe abortion as one of the neglected public health problems in developing countries. Unwanted and unplanned pregnancy is linked to a range of social, cultural, economic and psychological factors. Of course, we know there are no simple solutions that will reduce the rate of abortions-and taking Medicare funding from the procedure is not the very least of them. This so-called solution, promoted by anti-abortionists, would only serve to deny access to abortions for and rural women, therefore allowing only wealthy women to terminate unplanned or unwanted pregnancies. There is evidence which indicates that comprehensive sex education and access to contraception are effective in lowering the rates of pregnancy, particularly amongst young women. Comprehensive sex education does provide young people with more support and guidance to delay their first sexual intercourse and develop a healthy attitude towards sex and sexuality. There is no evidence that abstinence-only programs successfully delay the onset of sexual intercourse. In fact, abstinence-only programs undermine the use of contraceptives once young people become sexually active. Abortion is the only widely practiced medical procedure that is criminalised in this country. The termination of pregnancy is contained under the Criminal Law in every state and territory except the ACT. Recent data from the Australian Survey of Social Attitudes show that 81.2 per cent of Australians, regardless of gender or religion, agree that women should have the right to choose an abortion. Some 42.4 per cent of Australians strongly agree and 38.8 per cent agree that women should have the right to choose an abortion. Only nine per cent of Australians either disagree or strongly disagree that women should have the right to choose an abortion. I conclude by reminding the House of Labor's platform concerning reproductive rights. It reads: As women are the major users of health and community services, Labor will: … … … support the rights of women to determine their own reproductive lives, particularly the right to choose appropriate fertility control and abortion(Time expired) Hasluck Electorate: Commonwealth Land",114
171,Mr HENRY,ADJOURNMENT,"Hasluck) (9.24 p.m.)During the recent election campaign and in my first speech in this House, I indicated that I would act without fear or favour on behalf of the residents of Hasluck. There is considerable concern amongst constituents and residents in my electorate about the proposal to build a brickworks on Commonwealth land which is currently leased by the Westralia Airports Corporation and is immediately adjacent to the Perth airport. I understand that a couple of weeks ago a notice, effective from 14 February, was served on the West Aviat Golf Club on Kalamunda Road, South Guildford, by the Westralia Airports Corporation Pty Ltd. It gave the West Aviat Golf Club only 30 days-just one month-to vacate the property, with all that that entails. This is allegedly so that the land can be used to build a brickworks. I find it rather amazing that a group of people can be treated so harshly by any organisation. These constituents and residents have lived in the area for a long time and have leased the golf course area since 1984 for that particular purpose. They have put their own blood, sweat and tears into creating this golf course at their own expense and through their own efforts. They have created an excellent recreational area for use by residents. I have had representations on these issues from councillors of the City of Swan, from Kalamunda Shire and from representatives of local community associations from High Wycombe, Hazelmere and Rose Hill expressing concerns about health, safety and the environment, and the impacts that these potential arrangements will have on their amenity. I have received many emails and have spoken with many residents about their concerns. Their concerns about the proposed development of the brickworks on the site include the lack of a consultative planning process; the potential environmental impacts on adjacent residential areas, lakes and wetlands; and the safety to aircraft from the heat emitted from the chimney stacks of the proposed brickworks and from the nearby asphalt plant. Importantly, they are concerned about their health and the air quality resulting from the emissions. In addition, on land adjacent to this area there is a waste material dump site, previously used as a building waste recycling operation. It is alleged that asbestos is contained in this waste dump, and they are concerned about the potential threat and hazard of that. I would like to read from some of the emails I have received: We appeal to you, as a representative of the federal government, to block the moves being made at present to build another brickworks in the Midland environs, of which Hazelmere forms a part, on the West Aviat Golf Club, which club members have constructed with their own hands and, out of their own toil and labour, have maintained a beautiful landscaped area, incorporating two man-made lakes, which are visited by birds of many varieties. Please give this appeal your urgent consideration and try to get your colleague the Hon. John Anderson to rethink the matter and get WAC to leave us on the land which we have invested so much in by way of money, blood, sweat and frustration only to have it taken away from us in just four weeks. According to the honour book, over 6,000 members of the public used the course last year. In 1984 the land was leased to Transport Australia institute, the parent body of the West Aviat Golf Club, which was built and maintained by the members on a purely voluntary basis and still is. The site is marked on the airport master plan as precinct 3 and was previously zoned as recreation and sport. It was vested by the federal government of the day back in the 1940s and is used as a camp for country people to send their kids to today. I assure the residents and my constituents in Hasluck that I will work as hard as I possibly can to achieve the best possible outcome for our community in this matter. I have made representations to the appropriate minister and will pursue those issues on their behalf. (Time expired)",116
