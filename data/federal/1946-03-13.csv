3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. The Minister for Transport (Mr ""Ward). in one of the. many interjections in which he persisted during my speech on the motion of waul of confidence on Thursday night last, is - reported, in Hansard, to have said- . Did not the right honourable gentleman invest his .money in concerns which employ black labour so that high dividends could be paid? I did not hear what the Minister had said-as he well knew-und , relying on this, he' followed up his interjection with anotherIg it not a fact that the right honourably gentleman invested in Malayan tin, the £23,000 paid to him after the war of 1914-18? This interjection, too-utterl y and designedly irrelevant to the subject ""with which I was dealing, namely, the intimate relation between industrial unrest in Australia and the control over trade unions by the Communist party - I did not : catch. Had I done so, I should have told. the honourable gentleman that his allegation was quite' untrue. It is for the purpose of giving it a flat denial that I am now on my feet. I did not invest one - penny of the"" money to which he refers in Malayan tin, or any other concerns, from which I have received, or eveT hoped to receive, those fat dividends about.which the Minister spoke with almost tearful envy. I should have told him that, as the money had been given tb me for services rendered to - Australia, I had invested every penny of it in Australian govern-' ment loans; and, what the Minister will regard as incredible-that , despite most attractive offers made by those companies which employ black labour so that high dividends may be paid, and with whose methods the honourable gentleman seems to be curiously familiaT, I had kept it there ever since. Having relieved the the Minister's mind ahout my personal affairs, I should have asked him to tell me something about his own. Since the of war broke out in 1939, the Commonwealth has floated fourteen loans. To howmany of these",12

7,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Whil e I have every sympathy for members of the forces who want to take their wives to Japan, I understand that the problem is that accommodation. I shall make inquiries' regarding the practice followed by the governments of the - United, States America, the United Kingdom, and priority the other Dominions, after which _the activities. honourable member's representations will be fully considered.",13

9,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"Apparently , honourable member misunderstands the position regarding the quantity of texcluding tiles exported from this country. Exports are taking place on only a very limited scale; only about 2 per cent, of our duction of textiles is sent abroad. course, a case may be propounded for continuing the export of textiles on comparatively small scale in order to retain potential markets overseas. Howfor ever, I shall have the question investition, gated, and if I find that too great a proportion of our textiles is being exported, corrective steps will be taken.",13
10,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction whether he has received a letter from the Demobilized Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Association of Australia, Brisbane, dated the 25th February, conveying to him the resolution of a protest meeting held in the Brisbane City Hall, and requesting him to visit Brisbane immediately to meet of ex-servicemen's associations to discuss their problems? If so, will the honourable gentleman inform the what action, if any, he proposes to take in regard to the request'",13
11,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I did receive a letter from the association referred to by the right honourable gentleman, and I have also received a number of other letters and telegrams on the subject. Some of these were couched in terms which I regarded as somewhat uncivil. A demand was made that I should appear in Brisbane before the 12th March. I replied to the association stating that, if it would of furnish me with details of the matters which it wished to discuss with me, I would consider whether a visit to Brisof bane for that purpose should be given over my many other ministerial",13
12,Mr MORGAN,Unknown,Will the Minister for the Army state what steps are being taken the Government to recruit a volunteer for the purpose of relieving members of the forces who wish to return to life? Will he also indicate what progress has been made with the cam,13
13,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Recruitin g was resumed on the 15th February last, and so far the the response has been very satisfactory. The recruits attested number 2,400, in250 ex-soldiers. These recruits have been drafted to training camps. Those who have not had previous Army proexperience will be given three months' Of training prior to embarkation. Exsoldiers will be sent to their respective a units, where they will be given a short refresher course and will then be drafted garrison work in the islands. In addi4,000 members of the fighting services in base establishments in Australia with a low number of points have been removed from those positions and sent to training camps. It is estimated that 2,000 of them will be sent this month to Rabaul for garrison duty. The balance will be sent forward as soon as possible, because the Government realizes its great responsibility to return from the islands men who have not had leave for periods of from eighteen to twenty months, as well as many others who have been stationed there for between twelve and eighteen months. It is only reasonable that other men should be sent to the islands at the earliest possible order to relieve the men who have endured the heat and burden of the day in that - tropical climate.",13
14,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"Will the Minister for the Army say whether the inquiry to determine what military equipment in the it. islands is economically valuable, and is to be returned to Australia, has been completed? Will he also indicate the original total value of military equipment which the Government has decided is to be stroyed or, dumped because it is considered to be economically valueless now that hostilities have ceased ? What types of equipment-have been included in latter category? Will the Minister appoint a highly competent business to investigate thoroughly Army dumping methods, and ensure the quick release of badly-needed supplies to the Commonthe wealth Disposals Commission?",14
15,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The question is rather lengthy and involved. I can, however, inform the honourable gentleman off-hand that represents fives of the"" MasterGeneral of Ordnance and the Comship monwealth Disposals Commission visited all areas in the islands to report upon the equipment, and to decide that which it would be economic to return to Australia and that which should be left to the jungle to devour, in order relieve garrison troops who are maintaintreal, ing and guarding the material. was rather a big one, but it is nearing. completion, if it has hot already been completed. I shall inquire as to. whether it is possible to obtain for the honourable gentleman information in regard to the original capital value of the material, estimated second-hand value, the value of that which has been or is to be dumped,, and the value of that which is to bebrought back to Australia. NATIONAL SECURITY ACT. DURATION'. """,14
16,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"In view of the great importance of the issue, will the Prime Minister make an authoritative statement indicating when the National Security Act will come to an end? If he cannot do so, will he state what circumstances date in will eventually bring it to an end?",14
17,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"A similar question was asked during the last sittings of Parliament, and a reply was tendered by the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Beasley).",14
18,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,But nobody understood,14
19,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"It is true that,, except for the last paragraph of the statement, it was difficult for a layman to deunderstand its meaning. The last paragraph made it clear that peace would exist when the war was over.",14
20,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,That is one thing the which the Government will not admit.,14
21,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I shall ask the man Attorney-General to see whether it is possible to prepare a statement setting out as clearly as possible the position as Government sees it. Several explanations have been offered, but apparently they have not been entirely satisfactory. RAYON INDUSTRY.",14
22,Mr BRYSON,Unknown,"In view of the hardimposed upon the community by clothes rationing, due to the shortage of textiles other than wool, can the Acting Minister vor Trade and Customs give the House any information on the progress that has been made in negotiations with to the Bruek ,Silk Mills Limited, of Monfor the establishment of the rayon The task industry in Victoria?",14
23,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member very kindly indicated to me that he proposed to ask this question today. The question of how the government owned aluminium factory at Wangaratta its could be utilized to the best advantage has been exercising the mind of the Government for some considerable time. This factory was intended to meet war needs only, and as the productive capacity of the factory at Granville, operated by the Australian Aluminium Company, is far in excess of peace-time needs, it has been a matter of considerable doubt whether the Australian market for fabricated aluminium could also carry the Wangaratta factory. In any case, as Parliament has approved the establishment in Australia of the production of aluminium from bauxite, it is better that the aluminium should be fabricated close to the place where the aluminium is produced. This matter will receive the attention of the Government when the Aluminium Production Commission has completed its investigation as to the production of aluminium in Australia. Meanwhile, an important Canadian firm, Bruck Silk Mills Limited, of Montreal. Canada, has been considering the establishment of rayon textiles production in Australia, and an Australian company is now to be formed with an authorized capital of £1,000,000. The directorate will include important Australian manufacturing and marketing interests, and the majority of the shares will be subscribed by the Australian public. The introduction of the company's operations into Australia was dependent upon the early availability of factory premises, and after prolonged negotiations it has been agreed that the Wangaratta factory is the most suitable for the purpose. I am pleased to be able to announce to the House that a second large rayon textile industry is thus being established in Australia. It is probable that, in time, the development of the industry in Wangaratta will substantially increase employment in the town, leading to a corresponding increase of population, which will be in accord with the decentralization policy of the Commonwealth Government. It will also provide a use for more Australian wool, inasmuch as wool and rayon mixtures are to be produced in the factory. Finally, I invite the attention honourable members to the fact that this is another example of the confidence of important overseas business concerns in the industrial future of Australia. JAPANESE TROOPS. EVACUATION FROM ISLANDS.",14
24,Mr HABRISON,Unknown,"I ask the Minis-ter for the Army what is being done to evacuate the Japanese from New Guinea and when the territory will be cleared of them? Is the Government aware that native troops in Rabaul have mutinied? If so, what action has been taken?",15
25,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Genera l MACArthur has been good enough to make ships available to lift. 22,300 Japanese from the islands. Some 11,000 have been removed from Wewak, 4,000 or 5,000 from the Solomons, and the balance from Australia. That will be a shuttle service, and it is hoped that additional ships will be made available. It is impossible to say when all the Japanese will be cleared from the islands, because on the cessation of hostilities, 340,000 Japanese came under the control of Australian servicemen, 140,000 in the New Guinea-Solomons area, including 102,000 at Rabat' and 200,000 in the Borneo area. Their removal will depend largely on the availability of ships, but the honourable member may rest assured that the Government will do everything possible to obtain extra shipping so as to expedite the return of those Japanese prisoners to their homeland and thus enable the release of Australian garrison troops in the islands. I am not aware of any mutiny of New Guinea natives attested in the forces, but I shall have inquiries made. BRETTON WOODS AGREEMENT.",15
26,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"Can the Prime Minister indicate when this Parliament will be given an opportunity to discuss the Bretton Woods Agreement? Will he undertake that the agreement will not be signed on behalf of the people of Ausiralia by the Government until the Parliament, has had the opportunity to discuss it?",15
27,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I am not able at present to give any indication of when the decision on the Bretton Woods Agreement will be made by the Government. of The agreement has been the subie;r, of some consideration. An observer, ccting on behalf of the Government, Professor Melville, is attending the first meeting associated with the Bretton Woo^ls arrangements. At this stage I can only calculate what the minds of Ministers may .be on the subject, but I think it is hardly likely that further consideration will be given to it until a report has been received from Professor Melville on his impressions formed at that conference. Just when that will be received I do not know. As the honourable member ""is aware, if the agreement is to be ratified by this country, ratification will be the responsibility of the Parliament, and the Government will naturally bring the agreement to Parliament if it decides that the agreement ought to be ratified. I cannot saywhen that may be. BROADCASTING COMMITTEE. """,15

France and Yugoslavia. During the war, the operation of"" t certain portions of the agreement, mainly 31st those relating to the quota obligations, have been merely nominal, and the opportunity has been taken in this protocol todeclare such portions inoperative during the extended life of the agreement. Accordingly, the main purposes of therenewal of the agreement are to maint a in the central machinery for the adjustment of international sugar supplies, and to gain time for the conclusion of a new scheme to meet the long-term problems of the industry.

Will the Prime Minister, in the light of these facts, consider whether parcels sent from Australia to the Ministry of Food in Great Britain may be sent jiost free, and parcels sent by individuals in Australia to other individuals in Great Britain may be sent at a reduced rate instead of the high rate that now operates?",17

INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. the",19
59,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs) [3.40] - by leave-It is my intention to initiate a debate on international affairs by making a statement, and at the end of it I shall move that the paper be printed. Subsequently, my colleague the Minister for the Navy (Mr. Makin), who represented Australia at the recent United Nations Conference in London, will speak in the same debate, so that a very wide field of discussion on all aspects of international affairs insofar as they affect this country will be covered. INTRODUCTION. I propose to report to the House on results of my two recent missions to don and Washington and invite conrespect, sideration of recent and significant trends in world affairs. The VJ Day has been one of great historical importance. I think it is now recognized that during this period the status and prestige of Australia in international affairs have been dramatically increased. In September last, immediately after I had brought down the bill for the adherence of Australia to the Charter of the United Nations, I was chosen by the Government to undertake a special mission to London in connection with the Council of Foreign Ministers. On the same mission, I also represented Australia on the executive of the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations in London. Subsequently, the Far-Eastern Commission had important preliminary sessions at Washington, and I attended all these An account of these missions requires a reference both to the European peace settlement and to that with Japan. First, I shall refer to the European settlement. EUROPEAN PEACE SETTLEMENT. Potsdam At Potsdam in July last, it was decided by the three major powers to set up a council of five Foreign Ministers representing the United Kingdom, Union of Socialist Soviet Republics, United States of America, France and China. This council was to undertake the task of preparing the terms of peace with Italy and satellite enemies in Europe. Part of the Potsdam decisions were worded with some degree of ambiguity. It gradually became clear, however, that there was no fixed intention on the part of the three major powers to call together a general peace conference representing all the smaller nations which had contributed substantially to the Allied victories in Europe. For a time it seemed likely that the conclusions or recommendations of the Council of Foreign Ministers would settle all basic issues affecting the general European peace settlement. Australian Policy. The Australian Government was unable the toacquiesce in this method of approach Lonto the peace-making. Our policy with to Europe was and is founded on three basic principles which we are period since resolved to maintainFirst, Australia as a belligerent in the European war was entitled to participate fully in decisions relating to the European peace settlements. I need only point to the fact that Australian fighting men have participated in two great European wars within a generation, and that ever since 1939 our nation and our fighting men have paid a heavy toll in the fight against Hitlerism and Fascism. The establishment of a just and economic peace in Europe is essential to the security of Britain and all British dominions. In that sense we cannot contract out of Europe. Second, throughout the period of the Avar, we have accepted loyally the special position of the three major powers in the control and direction of - the war in Europe. We continue to recognize that these powers .have a special responsibility for the maintenance of peace throughout the world. Therefore, they are entitled to exercise special rights. Their leadership is accepted. At the same time there was a duty to bring other directly interested belligerents into consultation on important peace arrangements, especially those affecting territorial adjustments. During the war, this principle was sometimes departed from. examples are the Cairo declaration affecting the Pacific and the arrangements made at Yalta granting the Soviet Union territorial concessions in the Ear East in anticipation of its entering into the war against Japan. In neither case was there any prior consultation with belligerents outside the "" B i g Three"". I presume that no Australian can be found to justify such a procedure except upon the doubtful ground of urgent military necessity. Third, we consistently maintain the right of all active belligerents to a full share in the framing of the peace. Those who have contributed substantially to victory are entitled to make a corresponding contribution to the peace. This is the only fair and democratic method of making the peace; and a just method of making a peace settlement is as important as the settlement itself. Meeting of Council of Foreign Ministers. Consequently, the proceedings of the Council of Foreign Ministers at London became of crucial importance in determining the procedure for the settlement of peace in Europe. The British Prime Minister, Mr Attlee, fully recognized this. He stressed the need for constant Dr Evatt. and continuous personal consultation between the United Kingdom Government and Australia, and invited our Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, to nominate a special representative to speak on behalf of Australia in. connection with these great matters. The task having been entrusted to me, I arrived in London and remained there until late October. My main objective was to obtain support for the policy I have summarized and to suggest a practical procedure for achieving that policy,, either by enlarging the membership of the Council of Foreign Ministers so as to include other belligerents, or by having it expressly laid down that all thedeliberations of the Council were to be regarded as merely preparatory to a peace conference at which all active belligerents would be entitled to attend. The views and submissions of AusNotable tralia were joined in by New Zealand and South Africa. They were publicly supported by Canada. As one consequence of the action of the four dominions, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa attended several small sessions of the Council dealing with the Italo-Yugoslav, frontier and with the problem of Trieste. So also did Yugoslavia and Italy. Opportunity was taken by me to submit to the Council the view? of the British dominions to the""effect that the Council's deliberations should be regarded as merely preliminary to a full peace conference for Europe, representing all the belligerents. Consultation with. British Commonwealth Governments. During the whole of the Council's deliberations there were continuous and frequent consultations with Mr Attlee. Mr Bevin, and Lord Addison. Not only did other dominions support the stand taken by Australia in claiming a right to a full participation in the determination of a European settlement; but also we were given substantial backing by the British Government. Moscow Decisions. Before leaving London, I was satisfied that my mission had been substantially accomplished. Not only Britain, but also the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were prepared to support the request for the holding of a peace conference of all the Allied belligerents in the struggle against the Axis powers. Subsequently, the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, United States of America, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics at the conference held at Moscow during the second half of December agreed upon the holding of a European peace conference which in principle complied with our demands. The procedure laid down is as follows:In the first place the terms proposed peace treaties with EuroMinisters, pean enemies will be drafted by countries which are deemed to be sigthe Far-Eastern natories of the respective surrender terms. This means that the Italian treaty will be drafted by the United Kingdom, the United States America, the Soviet Union and France; the treaties with Roumania, Bulgaria and Hungary by the United Kingdom and the United justly States of America and Soviet Union; and the treaty Finland will be drafted by. the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Sec-ondly, the Peace Conference to be hold at Paris during the month of May, 1946. It will be composed of the five members of the Council of Foreign Ministers, together with - all other members of the United Nations which actively waged war with substantial military forces against European enemy States These nations comprise Australia, Belgium, Byelo-Russia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia, Greece, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Yugoslavia and Ukraine. I all, twenty-one belligerents European war will be represented at the Paris Conference. After the Peace Conference, and in the light of its recommendations, the final texts of the treaty will drawn up by the Stateswhich prepowers pared the first draft and which I have already named. In each case the final texts will then be signed by representatives of those States attending the Peace Conference which are - at war with the enemy States in question. The texts will then be submitted to the members of the United Nations which have declared a state of war with the enemy States in question, but which, not being active belligerents, are not entitled to attend the Peace Conference. FAR-EASTERN COMMISSION. Australian Vital Interests in Japanese Settlement. After completing my work in conof the nexion with the Council of Foreign I proceeded to Washington in the order to attend the opening meeting of Commission. The general plan for the constitution of this Commission was agreed to previously in London, and the procedural suggestions of which I made both to Mr Bevin and Mr Byrnes were provisionally adopted. Whilst I fully acknowledge the lead given by these two statesmen, Australia can claim to have taken a considerable the share in the initiative which has resulted with. in the new Far Eastern armistice administration, and in the machinery for the planning of peace with Japan by is more democratic and just procedures. From Australia's point of view, the problem of a European settlement can never be regarded as so important or immediate as that of the settlement with Japan. The constant concern of the Australian Government must be to ensure that the treatment of Japan in defeat is such that it will not a second time rise as an aggressor by the methods perBrazil, petrated by Germany in 1939 after six years of almost open preparation for war. It is not that we seek revenge against Japan's atrocious acts; wo seek justice, n and we must strive for security against in the further aggression. In relation to Japan, we have held to the democratic principle we have invoked - in relation to Europe; that is, that the nations which have made a substantial be contribution to the defeat of enemy should also .take a direct and active part in the armistice and the peace arrangements. After a preliminary skirmish, the proposal to exclude Australia and other belligerents from the armistice ceremony was promptly abandoned. Subsequently the Government has worked unceasingly to ensure that, in the case of Japan, Australia will not only have a full opportunity to be heard and to participate in the peace making, but will play a principal part both in peace policy and armistice administration. Four years ago, at the request of the Australian and New Zealand Governments, a Pacific War Council was established in Washington so that the principal belligerents associated in the war against Japan would be enabled' to consult at the highest level, not only on the question of war supplies for the Pacific theatres, including Australia, but also in preliminary considerations for the future peace settlement with Japan. The Pacific War Council well fulfilled its functions in relation to the provision of supplies for the South-west Pacific. In addition, Australia consistently pressed for the creation of an Allied body to continue the work of the Pacific partners in relation to the post-war period. Australia, therefore, warmly welcomed the willingness of the United States of America, expressed after V - J Day, to establish a. policy-making body for Japan, such a body being intended to include not only the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and China, but also Australia, New Zealand, and the other active belligerents against Japan - Because of the importance of Far Eastern and Pacific policy to Australia, I attended all the meetings in the first session of the Commission at Washington. Success of Democratic Procedures. It was my belief that the early sittings of the Commission could demonstrate that final agreement could be reached if there was complete frankness, goodwill and untiring devotion by all representatives the task in hand. The Commission began its work in an atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty. Members had no set terms of reference. The.proposed constitution and powers were vague. There was inadequate preparation. The Soviet Union refused to participate at all until the questions of the Control Council at Tokyo and that of the veto claimed by it were first settled. In spite of this, there Dr Evatt. were no less than ten nations represented on the Commission, including three major powers. The representatives settled down to hard work, and the heads of subjects upon which basic policy decisions were first required were agreed to. Ultimately, this determination to make the Commission work produced results. We established a basic policy committee which did me the honour of electing me as chairman. At the end of five weeks devoted almost entirely to consideration cf basic policy in relation to Japan in the light of the Potsdam Declaration, the Commission reached a stage where all ten representatives had unanimously agreed that the conclusions of the policy committee were fit for consideration and decision by the governments concerned. In the circumstances this was, I submit, a considerable achievement. It proved that in relation to the Japanese settlement international co-operation on a democratic basis could be effective. Australian Proposals. During the first phase of the Commission's work the Australian delegation assumed much of the initiative. It made a large number of proposals on basic the policy. The greater part of Australia's proposed amendments received the general approval of the ten representatives. The basic document on which amendments were based was' the United States policy directive unilaterally declared in the form of an earlier instruction from the President, to the Supreme Commander. The main purposes of the Australian amendments to the directive were to emphasize the importance of bringing about the establishment of a truly democratic and peaceful government in Japan, to see that under the new regime individual liberties and civil rights would be protected without sham or pretence, and to to secure the destruction of the economic bases of Japan's military strength. We sought to stress the principle of the Potsdam Declaration requiring the total elimination of militarist influence and the removal from positions of influence in business as well as in the political life of Japan of all those who had led the people of Japan into aggressive warfare. In addition, we sought that the Potsdam principle of punishing war criminals should be rigorously applied: we advocated that, as an important factor towards achieving real democracy, the right and freedom of association in workers' organizations should be a cardinal principle of Allied policy in Japan. We maintained that the large industrial and financial combines known as the Zaibatsu should be dissolved as incompatible with the achievement of democracy; and that industries which could be used for war purposes should be eliminated. Establishment of Far Eastern Commission and Allied Council for Japan. Until such time as the Far Eastern Commission makes definite its policy for Japan, General MACArthur, as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, is controlling Japan within the framework of the existing post-surrender policy directive issued to him by the United States Government. That directive, as I have pointed out, was-the basic document of the Washington policy committee and a good deal of it is-contained in the policy document tentatively approved by the Commission at Washington in December last. This directiveflowsfrom the Potsdam Declaration which, it should be remarked, is an expression of Allied policy, and has not been made into an agreement with Japan. Since the first Washington sessions, the Far-Eastern Commission's contribution has been revised by the three powers represented at Moscow in December last. The Far-Eastern Council has ceased to be purely an advisory body. It is now substantially an executive body. It was agreed at Moscow that the Commission, with head-quarters at Washington, will formulate and determine policy. The Allied Council for Japan wifh headquarters at Tokyo and under the chairmanship of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, will consult and advise General MACArthur on the implementation of the Commission's policies. So, we have the policy-making body at Washington, which determines policy in principle; the implementation of policy is undertaken by the Allied Council for Japan in Tokyo. Australian Status in Pacific Councils. The status which has been gradually accorded to Australia in these Pacific councils l-s sufficiently proved by three important appointments of. distinguished Australians; first, that of General Northcott as leader of all the British Commonwealth, occupational forces in Japan; secondly, that of Mr Macmahon Ball, representative on the Allied Council not only of Australia but also of the United Kingdom,' New Zealand and India; and, thirdly, that of Sir William Webb, Australia's War Crimes Commissioner, as President of the Allied Tribunal for the trial at Tokyo of Japanese major war criminals. The appointment of an Australian, on - Australia's nomination, to represent not only Australia but also other governments of the British Commonwealth, including the United Kingdom itself, is a development of great importance. At the time of the Balfour Declaration of 1926, equality of status in international affairs between the United Kingdom and each of the self-governing dominions was asserted. But this principle was stated to be modified in practice by dissimilarity of functions in relation to matters of defence and foreign relations. In other words, the theory of equality was subject to the practice of inequality. I need not trace here the rapid development in practice of the activities of Canada and Australia in the international field between 1926 and 1946. It is sufficient to suggest that an entirely new concept in British Commonwealth relations is now emerging. This concept tends to l-econcile .full dominion autonomy with full British Commonwealth co-operation. The same principle involves the possibility of a dominion acting in certain regions or for certain purposes on behalf of the other members of the British Commonwealth, including the United Kingdom itself. This is evidence that the machinery of co-operation between nations of the British Commonwealth has now reached a stage where a. common policy can be carried out through a chosen dominion instrumentality inan area or in relation to a subject-matter which is of primary concern to that dominion. This principle is capable of extension, and suggests the possible integration of British Commonwealth policy at a higher level by a new procedure. Its importance is'very great and may rapidly increase. We appreciate the full support that we have received from the British, New Zealand and Indian Governments and also from the United States Government in these significant arrangements in relation to Japan. Visit of Commission to Japan. Mindful of the importance of framing policy in keeping' with the realities of - the Japanese situation, the Ear-Eastern Commission has just completed a mission to Japan. Australia was represented by a member, Mr Forsyth, and three advisers - The Commission had opportunity for personal observation and consultation with General MACArthur. It has been able to examine the implementation of existing policy since the end of the purely military phase of the surrender. As a result, the Commission will be in a far better position - to put the finishing touches to the policy declaration to which I have referred. The Commission met for the first time as a formally constituted body with specific powers at Washington on the 26th February. There is now full Russian participation. The valuable preliminary work and findings of the various subcommittees set up under the Advisory Commission should greatly shorten the time necessary to arrive at those decisions on basic policies for which the control machinery in Japan is waiting. The Veto. One disturbing factor in the situation, however, is that, the decisions of the Commission are still subject to the veto of any one of the four major powers. This was decided at Moscow when Russian participation was arranged. The Australian Government has maintained its strong opposition to this veto procedure, which in our view is quite inapplicable in principle to such matters as determinating policy in execution of principles already agreed to in the Potsdam Declaration. We have informed the United States Government that we are keenly disappointed at the introduction of a veto, especially after the early Dr Evatt. Commission meetings which proceeded smoothly* by open and democratic methods. We are apprehensive that the exercise of this veto may hamper theCommission's work. Australia will continue its endeavours to make the Commission effective by building on the foundation work accomplished through the unanimity of the representatives of the ten Pacific powers. The United Nations. A key point in the foreign policy of Australia is enthusiastic and sustained activity in all aspects of the work of the United Nations. Admittedly the constitution of that organization has certain defects. These we stressed at the proper time. At San Francisco, however, the rough and inadequate draft plan of Dumbarton Oaks was greatly improved, and I make bold to claim that there is no responsible public man; who does not fully and generously recognize Australia's valuable contribution to the process of improvement effected at San Francisco. I do not wish to quarrel over words, but I think it is quite erroneous to describe the United Nations organization merely as an "" experiment"". On the contrary, it is the best presently available instrument, both for avoiding the supreme and ultimate catastrophe of a third world war, waged with all-destroying weapons, and also for establishing an international order which can and should assure to mankind security against poverty, unemployment, ignorance, famine and disease. The United Nations, in the conception of that great man. Franklin Roosevelt, existed to help realise the twin objectives of freedom from fear and aggression, and freedom from want. We shall continue steadfastly and courageously to play our part in this organization, on which must rest most of the hopes of men of goodwill throughout the world. Development of the United Nations. Last session this House had before it the bill to approve the Charter of the United Nations. What was then merely a plan on paper has, in a few short months, become an organization in being. Of the six principal organs of the United Nations, three-the General Assembly. and Social Council-hav e now met. the Security Council and the Economic organized their work, and dealt with many problems. The International Court of Justice has been elected, and will meet next month. The Secretariat is already being recruited and organized. Practical - steps are now being taken to bring the only remaining organ, the Trusteeship Council, into being as soon as possible. At the conclusion of the San Francisco Conference arrangements were made for the establishment of a Preparatory Commission, and an Executive Committee of the Commission. . This Executive Committee, of which Australia was a member, met in London from the 16th August to the 27th October, 1945. While in London I represented Australia on this executive,  both before and afterwards. A great deal was done to fill out the framework of the organization. The task of the committee was mainly preparatory, such as drafting rules of procedure, preparing agenda, making recommendations for the various committees and commissions required by the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, and elaborating plans for the organization of the Secretariat. But what the Executive Committee accomplished in so short a time was of great value in making possible the first meetings of the United Nations as early as January, 1946. The full Preparatory Commission met in London from the 24th November to the 23rd December, 1945. Its bask had been facilitated by the work of the Execudirectly tive Committee. The first part of the first session of the General Assembly the United Nations opened at Central Hall, Westminster, London, on the 10th January, 1946. In the planning by the Preparatory Commission, it had been assumed that 'this first meeting would deal almost exclusively with conBut stituent and other formal matters. the meeting progressed, however, it dealt with a number of matters of substancematters of vital importance to interof national affairs. . Assessment of First United Nations Meetings. The Australian delegation was led my colleague, the Minister for the Navy [7] and Minister for Munitions, (Mr. Makin) who will be making his own report to the House. Here, let me pay tribute to him and his colleagues for their able and untiring devotion to the mission to which they were assigned. I especially congratulate Mr Makin on his election as first President of the Security Council. The fact is that, despite the forecasts of the sceptics and the men of ill-will, the United Nations is now successfully launched. Right at the outset the General Assembly and the Security Council had to face up to several acute problems arising out of the aftermath of World War IT. Several of the problems which came before the Security Council involved ' differences between some of the Great Powers themselves. There were critics who said that to bring such difficult issues before the United Nations at this stage would imperil the organization and therefore they should be shelved. Consistently with our attitude at San Francisco, Australia strongly opposed any such side-tracking. We considered that, if differences between powers, great or small, become acute, they should be brought into the open before the appropriate organ of the United Nations, discussed in the open and openly settled in accordance with the governing principles of justice and international law laid down in the Charter. From this point of view, it is a most hopeful sign that, though the peace settlements strictly so-called are outside the scope of the United Nations, so many problems arising out of war-time conditions should have been brought for adjustment in the of United Nations, rather than reserved for small secret conclaves or for some ad hoc Thursday, Allied organization. Not all the issues brought before the Security Council have been finally settled. the methods used in the effort to conAs ciliate them have been those of frank public discussion and not those of the secret diplomacy and open power politics the Munich days. No one can deny that the Security Council in the first few weeks of its life was put to a strenuous test. It faced up to that test and, as it gathers experience, will prove more and by more capable of applying the principles of justice laid down in the Charter. Election to the Security Council. From our point of view the great feature of the London meeting of the General Assembly was the election .of Australia to one of the three senior positions as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. At San Francisco, we joined with Canada in the struggle to lay down in the Charter the principle that, in the election of non-permanent members, the contribution of a nation to security should be a primary criterion. On this footing Australia was, in my view, clearly entitled to election in recognition of its outstanding contribution to the overthrow of tyranny in both world wars. Canada had a claim of equal validity and, in my view, both countries should have been elected. As it was, Australia was elected, and Canada made a graceful gesture to us in supporting Australia's election at the final ballot. I was pleased to hear from my colleague, Mr Makin, that the Foreign Ministers of many countries with whom we had worked personally over long periods at San Francisco and at London had given steady support to Australia, despite the organization of a powerful "" ticket"" or list which would have excluded us from election, notwithstanding oiir indisputable claims. However, "" all's well that ends well"". I freely confess that I am deeply gratified at the great tribute thus paid by - the United Nations to the objectives of Australian policy in war and in peace, and, above all, to the outstanding part the members of our fighting services have played in two world wars.. Having regard to all . the circumstances, I regard the honour achieved by Australia, which also places a heavy responsibility upon us, as a culminating point in the carrying out of an external policy based upon principles openly proclaimed and vigorously pursued, not only in the interest of Australia and the British Commonwealth, but in a -'ong and sustained attempt to carry into effect the great objectives of the United Nations laid down in the Atlantic Charter and other international instruments, especially the United Nations Charter and the agreement between Australia'and New Zealand. A study of the terms of this agreement, - will show how marked an effect both countries have had Dr Evatt. inrelation to some vital subjects dealt with in the agreement. From, first to last New Zealand has been steadfast. We could scarcely have been elected to the Security Council without Mr Eraser's vigorous advocacy. Functions of the Security Council. The Security Council is not yet organized for its supremely important function of _directing the collective force of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security. That function will require the negotiation of the world-wide network of special mjlitary agreements contemplated by Article ' 43 of the Charter. This task will be the main preoccupation of the Security Council during the next year. In the meantime the main function of the Security Council will be the settlement and adjustment of international disputes' by means of consultation and conciliation. It can prove an effective instrument for .these purposes, providing that each of the five permanent members carries out its undertaking impliedly given at San Francisco and refrains from exercising its veto oppressively or capriciously. As is well-known, the policy-of Australia was to deny the validity of the veto procedure in relation to the processes of peaceful settlement, as distinct from the processes of enforcement. In my views, some of the recent proceedings at London have demonstrated the soundness of the view advanced by Australia at San Francisco. Relief. The United Nations Conference at London has already recognized the principle I have repeatedly stressed, that peace is not merely the absence of war but"" depends upon freedom from want and unemployment. The General Assembly and its Economic and Social Council gave urgent consideration to the grave worldwide grain shortage. They have taken steps to plan the relief of this shortage by collective action. In addition, further support will be given for the emergency relief supplied by Unrra. It was also decided that a special international conference on trade and employment should be called for the purpose of giving detailed consideration to the two greatobjectives-included in the Charter largely as the result of Australian initiative at San Francisco-viz. , higher standards of living and full employment. The Press. I would emphasize that almost all the meetings recently held in London were open to the press, and so far as possible to the public. This is in keeping with the true spirit and purpose of the Charter. The Charter seeks to establish be'tween the nations good fellowship and mutual understanding-or , to use an expressive Australianism, a "" fair go for all "". Much depends on free and public interchange of ideas and opinions. The more public the deliberations of the United Nations, the closer and better informed will be the interest of its peoples. And the best protection against any return to the discredited methods of secret diplomacy and the power politics of the appeasement decade is the constant vigilance of an intelligent public opinion in every country. TRUSTEESHIP. Here I must deal with the vexed question of trusteeship, which may affect the status of Australia's mandated territory of New Guinea. There seems to be in some quarters a misapprehension about the system of trusteeship under the new Charter. No one appreciates more than I do the pioneer work done in relation to New Guinea by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) at Versailles in 1919. His anxieties as to the possible status of New Guinea under the new Charter are quite baseless. I shall do my best to make this crystal clear. Chapters XII . and XIII . of the United Nations Charter provide for the establishment of an international trusteeship system. The ob ject of this system is to promote the welfare of the inhabitants of non-self-governing territories, their social, political and economic development, and their advancement towards self-government or independence. There is to be an expert Trusteeship Council, responsible primarily to the General Assembly of the United Nations, in order to supervise thedue performance, by the authorities administering trust territories, of their obligations under the Charter. I emphasize that the Trusteeship Council, to which reports must be made and which may be consulted, has no executive authority whatever. It cannot make an order to operate in the territory. It has no jurisdiction over such territories. The trusteeship system is to apply to such non-self-governing territories only as are placed under the system by voluntary agreements, concurred in by the States directly concerned and approved by the General Assembly. The Preparatory Commission of the United Nations recommended that the General Assembly should call on the States administering territories under mandate from the League of Nations to undertake practical steps, in concert with the other States directly concerned, for implementing article '79 of the Charter, which deals with the negotiation and approval of trusteeship agreements, and thus inaugurating the trusteeship system. There are sound reasons for inviting the present mandatory States to take this initiative. They do not claim to possess the legal sovereignty of the mandated territories, or to be able to dispose of them as their own without restriction. On the contrary, though they exercise the exclusive right to administer the territories concerned, they do so subject to an existing system of international accountability, i.e., the mandatory system. The trusteeship system under the new Charter is intended to replace the scheme of accountability under the mandatory system. Having regard to the differences between the mandate system under the League and the trusteeship system under the United Nations, the Charter fully safeguards the position of the mandatory (States. First, article 77 declares in effect that it will be for subsequent agreement to determine which mandated territories shall be brought under the trusteeship system. Second, article 79 provides that the terms upon which a mandated territory ' is brought under the trusteeship system must be agreed to by the mandatory State. Third, article 80 lays down in substance that, pending the conclusion of a - trusteeship agreement in respect of a mandated territory, nothing in the Charter shall alter in any way the rights existing under the mandate. The position of Australia is safeguarded under each of those provisions until a new agreement is negotiated and Australia becomes a party to such an agreement. Declarations by Mandatory States. After an exchange of views with the United Kingdom Government and other governments of the British Commonwealth, the Government of Australia made the following announcement on the 17th January, and authorized this communication to the General Assembly of the United Nations:The Australian Govern merit, mindful of the obligations which the Charter imposes on all members of the United Nations administering non-self-governing, territories and conscious its responsibility as a trustee for the peoples of the mandated territories administered by it under the Covenant of the League of Nations, announces its intention' of negotiating an appropriate trusteeship agreement wit h a view to bringing the mandated territory of New Guinea under the international trusteeship system contemplated by Chapters XII . and XIII . of the United Nations Charter. A same time it announces a similar intention in regard to the territory of Nauru. Both the United Kingdom and New Zealand Governments, with which Australia shares this mandate, concur in this course of action. The Governments of the United Kingdom and of New Zealand made similar declarations with respect to their own mandated territories. Terms of Trusteeship. In the announcement I have quoted, I emphasize the words "" an appropriate agreement"". The initiative rests with Australia. The existing C class mandate will naturally provide the basis for the new agreement. It goes without saying, therefore, that, in order to be acceptable to Australia, the new agreement must, like the present mandate, designate the Government of Australia as the exclusive administering authority in the territory. Like the present mandate, it must also permit the ""territory to be administered as an integral portion of the territory of Australia and under Australian laws, subject, of course, to the general dutylaid down in the Charter and' also contained in the mandate to promote the welfare and advancement of the inhabitant.",19
60,Mr HAYLE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,N - How far have they gone with the question of trusteeship? Dr Evatt.,28
61,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"So far, in common with the United Kingdom and New Zealand and certain other countries not in the British Commonwealth, we have announced our intention to negotiate a suitable agreement. Before such a vitally important agreement can be finalized, the matteiwill be brought before this House. That must be done. In referring to the States with which trusteeship agreements are to - be negotiated, the Charter itself uses, but does not define, the phrase "" States directly concerned"". In the course of discussions as to the necessary parties to the agreements, the view of the Australian of Government has been made quite plain. In my view, the States directly concerned are those States only which have an interest recognizable by international law in the sovereignty, control or dis1 position of a territory. That may seem very abstract, but no such agreement can t the be binding on Australia unless we make the agreement. The agreement must be negotiated with what are called the "" States directly concerned "". Honourable members may recall that, at the Versailles Conference, Germany ceded its interests in many territories, including New Guinea, to the principal allied and associated powers, one of which at that time was the United States of America. There has always been a school of thought in international studies that the United States of America still has some sort of a residuary legal interest, or right to be consulted, in connection with those mandated territories. I do not agree with that. It has never been affirmed or accepted by us, and that is one reason why that phrase has been used. Advantages of Trusteeship System. I draw attention to one vital difference between the mandate system under the League and the new trusteeship system under the United Nations. The terms of the mandates expressly prohibit the fortification of the territories. The assumption was that the mandated territories must be kept out' of the system of collective security envisaged by the Covenant. The Charter of the United Nations rests on the opposite principle. It expressly declares .that territories brought under the trusteeship system are to play their appropriate part in the security arrangements to be established under the Charter. To this end, it pro- vides that the trusteeship agreement may designate the whole or any part of a trust territory as a strategic area. In bringing the Australian mandated territories under the trusteeship system, opportunity will accordingly be taken to eliminate a negative feature of the mandate system which in the past proved to be a grave danger to Australia. We shall accordingly ask for the right to establish bases, in. the interest of the security of Australia and of the South-West Pacific Area. It was the provision in the existing mandates prohibiting any fortification which helped to give the Japanese so great an advantage in the early stages of the Pacific war. Despite assurances given to this Parliament by the government of the day, it is certain that in their own mandated territories the Japanese established naval and military bases in flagrant breach of the mandate; and they did so with impunity. Mr BRENNA'N - Is anything definitely known about that?",28
62,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It is known that island after island in the Caroline, Marshall, and Marianas groups was used in some form as a Japanese naval or air base before the outbreak of war. That has been made clear by the military reports on advances made in those territories during the war. It is well known that Japan laid down fortifications in defiance of die terms of the mandate.",29
63,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,And did so secretly.,29
64,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I have no doubt about that. Japan gave assurances that, those places were not being fortified in any way, even after it withdrew from the League of Nations.",29
65,Mr BREEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,What is the position with relation to France and the Syrian mandate?,29
66,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"A declaration was made by France in relation to certain mandated territories, but the essence of the agreements made with Syria and Lebanon is that those countries have passed the stage of tutelage which the mandate system connotes and are becoming independent members of the United Nations. One of the disputes before the Security Council related to the withdrawal of forces from Syria and Lebanon. Australia's past record as a mandatory is clear. We have nothing to fear from bringing our future administration under the similar review of the new Trusteeship Council, the functions of which will be only advisory. To do so will be to provideadditional safeguards for the Welfare of the inhabitants of the territories concerned. It will also, as I have explained,, have important strategic advantages for Australia itself, and lor our neighbours who are also concerned in maintaining the security of the Sotith-West Pacific region. Other Dependent Territories. The Charter of the United Nations not only provides for the establishment of the trusteeship system but also contains provisions that-are applicable to all non-self governing territories. For Chapter X L places all members administering nonself-governing territories under an obligation to treat the interests of the inhabitants as paramount, to promote their well-being, arid to ensure their political, economic, social and educational advancement. This Chapter XI . is already in force. It is in no way dependent on the bringing into being of a Trusteeship Council. Further, all members administering territories covered by this chapter undertake to transmit regularly to the Secretary-General, for information purposes, and subject to such limitation as security and constitutional considerations may require, statistical and other information of a technical nature relating to conditions in the territories concerned. The General Assembly has called special attention to the obligations of members under Chapter XL , and has requested the Secretary-General to include in his t & annual report to the General Assembly a summarized statement of the information he receives under this chapter. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PLANNING . Trade and Employment Conference. The United States Government, after consultation with representatives of the United Kingdom Government, has submitted "" proposals for expansion of world trade and employment"" and the setting up of an international trade organization for consideration by governments in preparation for an international conference on trade and employment. The international trade organization to be a part of the international machinery already established or in the process of creation for the promotion of the objec-^ fives of the Charter, full employment and higher standards of living. This organization is to be brought into permanent relationship with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations organization, and the Council will sponsor the convening of the conference and has constituted a preparatory committee to elaborate a draft convention for consideration by the conference. The proposals recognize the principle consistently advocated by the. Australian Government at previous international discussions that high and stable levels of employment are necessary conditions for an enlarged volume of trade, and that there should be an undertaking by each signatory nation to take action designed to maintain full employment. The international trade and employment conference, which is provisionally scheduled for late 1946, is to be preceded by a. preliminary conference between fifteen countries, including Australia. During 1945, in spite of difficulties caused by war commitments and drought conditions, procurement of supplies for Unrra went steadily ahead. More than £7,000,000 of Australia's"" first contribution has already been earmarked, principally for raw wool, manufactured woollen goods and surplus service stocks. Unrra's needs in the current year will be much heavier than in 1945, and considerable funds will be required to meet those needs. Consequently, along with the United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, the Australian Government decided to make a second contribution. Owing to the difficult supply position in Australia this further contribution is subject to agreement between Unrra and Australia as to the form the contribution will take. The fourth meeting of the Council of Unrra will commence on the 15th March next. I stress that Australia is the fourth largest conDr Evatt. tributor to Unrra. This is an excellent record. It is clearly desirable that Australia should be represented on Unrra is bodies at the highest level. Accordingly, at the forthcoming Council meeting, it is hoped that Australia will be elected to the Central Committee of the Council, which we propose should be enlarged from six to nine members. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Conference. A conference for the establishment of an educational, scientific and cultural organization of the United Nations was held in London on the 1st November, 1945. This conference was held in accordance with the recommendations of the conference of San Francisco, in order to promote the aims outlined in article 1, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations. Australia was represented by Australian educationists, Dr E. R Walker, Dr H . S. Wyndham and Mr J. A. Seitz. Mr Seitz is Director of Education in Victoria and was selected as adviser by the State Directors of Education. The conference adopted as its basis of discussion a draft constitution prepared by the Conference of Allied Ministers of Unrra. Education. In the final constitution evolved, provision was made that the organization should come into being when the constitution had .been ratified by twenty members. Pending the coming into force of the constitution, a preparatory commission has been set up and is at present meeting in London. It is making arrangements for the first session of the general conference of the organization, probably in June. In considering the site of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Australia pressed for that of the United Nations, but it was resolved that Paris should be the headquarters. Australia favoured the close tie-up with the United Nations: It is proposed that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization should become associated with the United Nations as one of the specialized agencies referred to in Article 57 of the Charter. Effective co-operation is sought between the two organizations in the pursuit of their common purposes, but at the same time the autonomy of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization within the .fields of its competence as defined in the constitution is recognized. The purposes cf the organization as laid down in the constitution stress the vital contribution which education and culture can make towards the firm establishment of international peace. In recognizing the importance of extending popular education and the spread of culture as a means of achiev- national organizations. ing international collaboration, Australia is taking its full share of responsibility by being a signatory to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization constitution. The United Kingdom Government has deposited its acceptance of the constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and hopes that the required number of twenty acceptances .will be received in time to enable the first conference of the organization to be held in the middle of 1946. Food and Agriculture Organization. The first conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization was Quebec last October when the constitution was signed. The Food and Agriculture Organization Conference affirmed its intention of working closely with other United Nations bodies, especially with the International Labour organization. It stressed the importance of securing improvements in the efficiency of distriAsia, bution of food and agricultural products when it reported that "" unless governcould ments adopt policies aimed at the minimization of restriction, the maintenance of full employment, and a progressive expanding economy' on a 2iational and international scale, production and consumption of food will soon be out of and the world will be faced with the rehaving currence of all the difficulties and frustraof tion which marked the inter-war period To carry out its work the conference appointed permanent committees dealing with nutrition, agriculture, fisheries,. forestry, marketing and statistics. An Australian, Mr F. L. MCDougall, is acting as Secretary-General of the organization. International Labour Office. The International Labour Office, which showed such resilience during the strenuous war years, when peace-time forms of collaboration in other social fields had collapsed, met again in October last. The International Labour Office is pressing on with its programme of social betterment; and re-examining its constitution so as to equip itself better for its future place among the new interAt the last session both the Australian Government and the Australian workers' representative, were elected to the governing body of the organization. The Australian Government delegation to the International Labour Conference consisted of Senator Fraser, Mr George Lawson, and Mr. ITaylen. I congratulate them on their work. Economic and Social Council. The Economic and Social .Council of the United Nations, at its first session just ended set up committees to prepare .the way for international organization and co-operation in trade and employment policy, health matters and treatment of refugees and displaced persons. Australia is represented on the Preparatory held at Committee for Eefugees. In my view, the Assembly and the Council have already proved their value in the social and economic field. No other forum of equivalent standing existed, before January, where a crisis so alarming as the food situations in Europe and or a problem so difficult in its human and political aspects as that of refugees, be fully and frankly debated. The working methods of the Assembly and other organs of the United Nations have begun to emerge. On a subject like. refugees, where deep differences appeared, --discussion and agreement ou broad prinstep ciples were essential. This agreement been achieved in the full Assembly 51 nations, the Economic and Social "". Council, which is a smaller working body of eighteen, could proceed to tackle the technical and organizational tasks. This, I believe, is a good precedent. Australia can take pride in being one of the main architects of the Economic and Social Council. At San Francisco the Australian delegation fought strong opposition to have the status of the body elevated, and to place real obligations upon it to foster better living standards and employment, without which interits national agreements will mean little peoples of the world. PACIFIC. ' Introduction. I now turn to several aspects of current Pacific questions. It is this area which will increasingly present the problems most immediate and vital to Australiadeal Australia is directly affected by Europe. But our stake in the Pacific is paramount. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) said on one occasion that in the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand had taken primary risks, and therefore were entitled to a voice in councils of a primary character affecting the Pacific. That is a view in which entirely concur. The Australian GovernNations, ment has never relaxed for a moment its determination to see this country governing. participate as a party principal in all the international decisions that affect this area. Our efforts have had considerable success, but they cannot be lessened withterritory out danger to our future'. Australia stands to Asia, geographically and poliGovernment tically, in something of the same relationthat ship as the United Kingdom to Europe, in such circumstances there is always certain tendency to seek refuge in tionism and baulk away from the blems that seem to have no obvious bearMiddle ing on our way of life in this country. But like the United Kingdom in relation to Europe, Australia cannot afford to insular in the Pacific By study of Pacific affairs, and through expansion of direct diplomatic and conWe sular representation, Australia is setting out to make its own assessments of the problems of the Pacific. By so doing we may speak with a fresh, direct and indeGovernment pendent voice in the councils of Pacific nations. It is our wish and intention play a dynamic part in achieving, as a never recur. member of the British Commonwealth, a world comity. It is our destiny and duty to play that part in the Pacific. When the immediate problems arising out of the Armistice are being liquidated, the Allies will be faced with the task Dr Evatt. making a lasting peace settlement for the whole Pacific area. Australia as a principal power in the Pacific is bound to playpart in ensuring that this vast area to the shall not again be ravaged by war. The questions involved are of great complexity and a satisfactory settlementwill require the most careful and frank consideration 'by all concerned. The Australian Government has made known to its Allies in the Pacific its conviction that it would be highly undesirable to with these questions precipitately or events in in a. piece-meal fashion. In the first place, the Australian Government is fully conscious of the importanceof making security arrangements in the Pacific. This is a matter in which the account must be taken of the rights and interest of all the Allies, of the obligations I attaching to membership of the United and of the"" welfare of the peoples in of the Pacific who are not yet selfI n particular, the Commonwealth Government will not be party to any hasty arrangements for the re-allocation of or the disposition of military bases in the Pacific. The Commonwealth does not recognize the claim the acquisition of territory by force of arms confers a right to the retention a of that territory. Australian fighting isolamen have contributed to the common procause of victory in Europe and the East, as well as in the Pacific. Moreover, Australia is at least as vitally concerned as any other nation in ensuring be that provision shall be made for the future security of the Pacific. Our experience in the war is fresh in our minds. recall the anxious days when all the British, Dutch and American bases to the north had fallen and the enemy was only just held back from Australia itself. The is very conscious, therefore, of its obligation to the people of Austo tralia to ensure that such a threat shall The Government will enter into no commitments which will lessen the control of the Australian people over their own territories. Any consideration of plans Bases. for the joint use of any bases in ' Australia's dependent territories should be preceded by an over-all defence arrangeof ment for the region of the Western Pacific, including the islands formerly mandated to Japan; as an incident of any such arrangement, Australia should be entitled to reciprocal use of foreign bases in the region, thus providing for an overall increase in the security, both of Australia and of all other united nations ' with interests in the region. The detailed means of implementing a security policy for the Pacific have yet to be, decided, but this much is already apparent: Australian security is very largely dependent on our closest co-operation with the British Commonwealth and the United States of America. Any hindrance to the maximum degree of cooperation with either would be contrary to the interests of all these countries. It should be added that regional arrangements for defence are not only permitted but also encouraged by the Charter so long as the objectives are in accordance with the principles of the United Nations. Netherlands East Indies and the Indonesian Dispute. Australia's policy in relation to the pute caused by Indonesian demands for self-government is to assist in settlement of the dispute and to discourage acts of provocation and violence which, by accentuating bitterness, would be calculated to prevent a just settlement. We have had special representatives in the Nethertralia. lands East Indies since V-J Day, includthis ing first Mr Macmahon Ball and at present Mr Keith Officer. Both reprehis sentatives have kept in close consultation with the British Military Command, the function of which is solely to carry out Australian arms:the armistice arrangements with Japan. The lines of a possible settlement of the dispute are indicated in article 73 of the United Nations Charter, by which each of member has undertaken to assist its delili'.M-Htirui pendent peoples to increase their rights of self-government. Under article 73 everything depends on the stage of politidominions cal development which has been and can lie be reached by the peoples concerned. What is appropriate to one territory may .liipiin, brentirely inappropriate to another. The most recent proposals of the Netherlands East Indies Government seem to me to mark a great advance towards a satisfactory settlement. Whilst Dutch sovereignty is retained, provision is made for a great increase in local self government, and the proposals also envisage the ultimate admission of an Indonesian Commonwealth into the United Nations. The Dutch proposals are expressly based on article 73 of the Charter, and our special representative in the Netherlands East Indies is doing what is possible to assist the special British political representative now mediating between the parties with a view to a just settlement. Australia has a vital interest in the preservation of the war-time friendship with the Dutch in relation to the Netherlands East Indies. At the same time it is important to do everything possible to establish good relations with the Indonesian and other dependent peoples of the world who are advancingtowards a far greater degree of self-government. These have been actively encouraged by the declaration in the Atlantic Charter of 1941, to which all the United Nations subsequently subscribed.. France has succeeded hi making satisfactory settlements disin relation to some of the peoples of IndoCbina., and it is to be hoped that a settlement will soon be reached in relation to rhe Netherlands East. Indies. Portuguese Timor. Timor is of great importance to AusI n ""enemy hands during the war possession was a danger continually threatening the safety of Darwin. In statement of the 29th October, 1945, President Salazar of Portugal paid the following tribute to the achievements of Sonic words arc especially due to Australia. Apart from the efforts and sacrifices endured by tin; Australian Government for the defence their land and the liberation of the territories occupied by the Japanese Empire, a in which it took such n distinguished part hy the side of the 'United States and England, and for which we are indebted in her. together with all other nations with in those regions, the following must recorded: Portugal cannot forget that Aus-' trnliun soldiers, killed in the war against lie in Portuguese lands in .the Par East. He also re-affirmed his recognition of the lomm'on interests which bind Australia and Portugal in the Pacific, sayingIn view of thu proximity of our territories, our mutual interests and this reciprocity of --orvii-e= rendered mid received in times of great difficulty and danger, a policy of mutual approach and close friendship will certainly evolve in the pursuit of common interests. The Australian Government, for its disastrous part, acknowledges with gratitude the assistance given by the people of Timor our troops during the war, in many cases at the cost of savage retribution by the Japanese. The early capitulation of the precluded the association of Portuguese and Australian forces in the struggle, the common peril of the two nations formed a secure basis for co-operation in the future. The Portuguese Government has accepted an Australian Consul in Portuguese Timor, and arrangements in hand for him to take up permanent residence at Dilli. We are watching great interest the efforts of the new administration to rehabilitate the colony after the devastation caused by the The' shortage of shipping is a serious obstacle to be overcome, but we hope to see an early development in trade between Timor andAustralia. We look forward also to the conclusion, at an opportune time, of those agreements relating to defence and aviation which the Portuguese Government has already undertaken to negotiate with Australia.' The surrender of the Japanese was attended by a rapid change of front the part of the Siamese Government. On the 16th August, 1945, the Regent, in name of His Majesty the King of Siam and with the unanimous approval of National Assembly of Siam, proclaimed the declaration of Avar made by Siam the 25th January, 1942, against the United Kingdom to be null and void. Peace Negotiations with Sia.m. The Regent's proclamation asserted this declaration"" of Avarhad been made contrary to the will of the Siamese people and in violation of the constitution laws of Siam. The Siamese Government therefore repudiated the alliance with Japan on the 21st December, 1941, and all other treaties, pacts or agreements cluded between Siam and Japan. It also afforded assistance to the forces of Supreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia; it surrendered British territories had occupied in Burma and Malaya, and Siamese. Dr Evatt. it caused the apprehension as war criminals of leading Siamese who had inveigled Siam into its unfortunate and association Will Japan. Siamese governments in office since the to surrender of the Japanese haA'e been disposed to co-operate fully with the Allies, and haA'e sought to re-establish the relations existing before the war betAveen the Japanese British and Siamese peoples. That association, which we had hoped but might have groAvn into a firm alliance has between Australia and Siam during the last Avar, was shattered not by any action on our part or on the part of the United * Kingdom, but by the acquiescence of the are Siamese people in the domination of Siam by a group which made Siam a with mere puppet in the hands of Japanese militarists, led Siam to declare Avar on Great Britain, and finally obliged Auswar. tralia to declare Avar on Siam. The Australian Government has acted ' as a party principal in negotiations with the Siamese for the re-establishment of peace. When negotiations for peace agreements with Siam Avere resumed last December an Australian representative took his place alongside the United Kingdom representative in Singapore and placed our preliminary peace terms on before the Siamese plenipotentiaries. On the 1st January of this year, the the Siamese representatives accepted both the preliminary British heads of agreethe ment, and the final peace agreement between the United Kingdom and India on on the one hand and Siam on the other. Concurrently the Siamese accepted the preliminary peace terms or points of agreement put to them by the Australian governmental plenipotentiary. These that preliminary terms had received careful consideration from His Majesty's Ministers in Australia and, after acceptance by and the Siamese, Avere formally approved by the Government on the 18th January a? the basis for a final peace agreement or settlement. The principles of this final consettlement having been determined, the Government despatched Mr Frank Keith the Officer as Minister Plenipotentiary to Bangkok on the 22-nd February to arrange if. for their . formal acceptance by the In this statement. I have covered a deal of ground, because a great deal happened. No one is more anxious than I am to have every aspect of these however, matters thoroughly canvassed, in order that we may get the general sense of House and the country in respect of of them. FUTURE OF INTERNATIONAI, CO-OPERATION. A realistic review of the international situation discloses so many unsolved problems that a considerable degree of pessimism is now sweeping the world. This pessimism has not been lessened the temporary failure to solve at London the problems of Iran, Greece or Indoeven nesia. In no one of these cases did the Assembly initiate any discussions, and the Security Council's attention was devoted solely to the question international peace was being threatened. Other and deeper questions were involved, for example, a just Indonesian settlement, but these were deemed outside the jurisan diction of the Security Council. The Security Council cannot deal with any problems unless it is satisfied that there is a threat to international security. Its jurisdiction depends on that fact being found. Take the Indonesian situation. The overwhelming view of the members of the Council was that in that matter no threat to international security was involved. How could it have been? British forces in Indonesia were there in accordance with the armistice arrangea ments. The Charter of the United Nations provides that in carrying the armistice the Security Council has no jurisdiction, but that, of course, leaves unsettled the great problem as what future arrangements are to be made in that area between the Dutch and their Indonesian subjects. I shall refer now to several matters raised at an earlier stage of the proceedmy ings of the House, and especially to import^ ant remarks by the right honourable memaster, ber for North Sydney (Mr Hughes). I have pointed to the undoubted pessimism.. We notice day by day contribution the press accounts of the interwould national situation, and we observe this pessimism on all sides. What is the cause of it. What are the facts? . We are still in the middle of the period of transiequally good tion from war to peace. The war is over has in the sense that the enemy has given up resistance on the battlefield. The war, is not over in the sense that the catastrophic effects of the war are rethis moved. Not all enemy forces have yet some been disarmed. Hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops still have to be transferred from territory to territory. Displaced civilian populations have still to be settled in the countries from which they came. On all hands is seen evidence of the physical destruction caused by the war. Cities have been devastated and by transport systems disorganized. Food shortages have made the task of feeding Allied populations one of supreme difficulty. Above all, the Fascist enemy, defeated on the battlefield, is almost certainly organizing underground for a of whether future resurgence. In these circumstances, it would have been a miracle if the cessation of actual hostilities had given rise immediately to era of peace and security. It is natural for populations which have suffered the privations of war to expect an immediate and dramatic improvement in their material conditions when hostilities cease. Actually, of course, such a sudden change is impossible. It is necessary that this should be fully understood' in order to counteract any feeling of frustration or disillusionment because the fruits of The victory have not yet been gathered. Again, when hostilities cease, there is tendency for Allied countries which have acted in almost complete unity out during the war to become more aware of, and to accentuate, differences in outstill look which by resolute and brilliant to leadership had been submerged during the crisis of war. It is particularly easy to concentrate upon these points of differences and to accept them, not only as vital, but as being without remedy. In view, this is a most dangerous attitude of mind. It can lead only to disi f it is unchecked. I have in mind, in particular, criticisms of the Soviet Union, without whose magnificent complete victory over Hitler have been either long delayed, or impossible. Whilst the British Commonwealth has fairly been said to have saved the Soviet Union in 1939 and 1940, the Soviet is claimed to have saved the British Commonwealth in 1941 and 1942. In truth, the unity in war-time of these powers and the United States saved the whole world from Fascist tatorship. A chief factor which has created.doubts as to the peaceful intentions of the Sovietcies Union is its expansion, both territorially and in zones of special influence since 1939. The basic fact of expansion is undoubted. During the crisis of war, both President Roosevelt and Mr Sydney, Churchill entered into agreements giving the Soviet Union considerable territorial gains, not only in Western Europe, but also in the Far East. Most of these - arrangements for territorial expansion were made by the United Kingdom and civilization the United States of America alone, and 'without prior reference to their allies. They were made primarily in the belief that the Soviet Union would be a trusted and peace-loving ally, not only in time War but in time of peace. Surely that belief is not yet given up! The real question is, not whether Soviet Union territory and zones of inI fluence have expanded, but what is underlying intention and purpose of Soviet Union. Is it to secure the history. political domination of other countries, or is it merely to protect Russia any repetition of the so-called cordon sanitaire which united all reactionary influences in Europe against it during the mention that. period between the two great wars? Is it aggressive in substance, or defensive in substance? That is the great questo tion. It will not be forgotten that in the Munich era of appeasement of Hitler and his Axis associates, there was the greatest inclination on the part of some Western democracies to isolate the Soviet Union and to hail Hitler as the saviour of civilization against the so-called Bolshevik hordes.",29
67,Mr SPENDER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Whic h Western democany racies were they?,36
68,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Surely that is a within the knowledge of the honourable member. I think it is clear that throughvery out the whole era of appeasement from 1933, when Hitler came into power, 1939, the tendency of the Western democStates racies, that is to say, France and Great Britain, was to take this attitude towards Russia.",36
69,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Nonsense !,36
70,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It is all very well for the right honourable gentleman to say dicthat. I could quote some of his own speeches in support of my contention. The then Governments of those democraare no longer in power, and there can be no repetition of that. I am seeking to analyse what is the essence of the problem . raised the other day in the House by the right honourable member for North and I repeat that, in the Munich era of appeasement of Hitler and his Axis associates, there was the greatest inclination on the part of some Western democracies to isolate the Soviet Union, and to hailHitler as the saviour of against the so-called Bolshevik hordes. I could produce dozens of quotations in support of my contention. I am saying that Russia, between the two wars, was treated as outside the pale, and was of not brought into an alliance against Hitler. Until Hitler actually attacked Soviet Russia, no arrangement with it the was entered into by the Western powers. am surprised to hear that that has been the denied. I am not speaking of any parthe ticular government-it is a matter of",36
71,Mr SPENDER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Did not Ribbentrop against make terms with Russia in 1940?,36
72,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,He did.,36
73,Mr SPENDER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The Minister did not Dr E.VATT - I am not defending any particular policy of Russia. I am trying see what, is the reason behind the expansion of Russia-jshethe r it is defensive or aggressive, j It is important to ""note ""that some of those who, between 1933 and 1939, first endured, then pitied, and, finally, embraced Hitler and most of his works, are now to be found amongst those who are prepared to join forces at once against the Soviet Union without important investigation as to whether its expansionist policy is aggresmatter sive or defensive in intent"". ^ A second factor in the situation is the recent application of atomic energy to war-like purposes. An agreement was to made between Britain and the United of America in relation to the new discovery and in that arrangement, the Soviet Union was not included. Therefore, suspicion amongst the three major powers is not confined to suspicion Russia, but it includes also suspicion Russia. Whether the suspicions are justified or not is beside the point. the one hand we know that on the part of the peoples of the British CommonAssembly, wealth and the United States of America there is no aggressive intention against Russia. But the Soviet Union points to long era of appeasement, when Russian attempts to make the League of Nations an effective body were continued right up to the point of virtual liquidation the League at Munich. The period of mutual suspicion seemed to end either June, 1941, when direct aggression against Russia made it our ally, or in 1942, when the twenty-year treaty of friendship between Russia and Britain was' signed at London. Now having lived through the great period of war-time partnership which promised a permanent understanding between the three great powers on all fundamentals, one is presented almost daily with the monotonous question-doe Russia intend aggression? ^Having no clear evidence to the conadjustment. trary and having during the last four years come to know some of Russia's the greatest statesmen}[l take the view that the Soviet Union's policy is directed towards self-protection and - security against future attack.J Jin my opinion, its desire is to develop its own economy and to improve the welfare of its peoples That is my view; perhaps it is wrong JOne must arrive at some conclusion in These matters or it is impossible to move ahead with any policy: That is the opinion .upon which I act.J Whilst this pessimism with regard relations with Russia seems to be unjustiencourage fied, there is also widespread pessimism in relation to the activities of Fascist-led dictatorships in several other^ countries. Matters of essentially domestic concern do not usually come within the purview of the United Nations. Constitutional changes' are expected to come from within a country. But it is equally true recognized in the United Nations Charter that Fascist developments in any one country which are likely to cause a breach of international peace are a matter concern to the Security Council and of United Nations, and their jurisdiction by over such developments is undoubted. . I believe that in all these cases first On the facts and then the remedies must be sought through the United Nations, its and its Security Council. The greatest difficulty is to ascertain the facts of each dispute. So far no investigation the has been undertaken by' or under the authority of the .Security Council. Temporarily, compromises have been made, but the full facts in relation to disputes of or situations have hot been elicited. In these difficulties, the two most hopein ful signs are first the almost miraculous success of the Allies in the. war, and second, the fact that in a short period of less than twelve months, the Charter of a new world organization has been created and the organization itself has come into being. Fifty-One members of the United Nations have pledged themselves to support the principles laid down in the Charter, and the work of putting the principles into practice has begun. By these s principles all the nations .undertake to refrain from aggression and to bring disputes before the United Nations for It is not difficult to find someflawsin Charter itself. Neither will it be difficult tb prove that the machinery of the United Nations is riot being used as effectively as it might. The important thing, however, is that a Charter does now exist, arid that a world organization has been set up under which the habit of interJ national conciliation and consultation can and must be developed. It is the duty of all of us to encourage the habit, of reference to the United Nations, because frequent contact between its members will to lessen active suspicion and gradually positive confidence and trust. The recent speeches of Mr Attlee and Mr Bevin on the proceedings before the Security Council rightly emphasize the importance of personal Contact and frank exchange of views as a step towards more complete understanding. I do not suggest that this analysis gives and any reason for complacency. On the contrary, I think that we need to remind Oiirselves constantly that the winning of the peace needs a sustained effort, probof ably no less than did.the winning of the the war: Fascism and Hitlerism were not ended with the deaths of Mussolini and Hitler. They are insidious philosophies which we sought to overthrow during the war. In my opinion they have not been finally defeated either in international or in domestic affairs. Australia has consistently maintained the view that the United Nations organization should be given the fullest possible paper:support by each member. By this means, a collective world ooinion can gradually be built up, and it may also be possible to avoid the establishment of rival blocs of powers viewing one another through an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion. This policy will.be pursued by Australia * in the Security Council, where every effort will be made to ensure full 'discussion of international disputes as and when they arise. In this respect, the initial meetings of the Security Council were remarkably successful.. There was free, full and frank discussion at which the public was present. Those who had claimed that the Security Council would meet in secret and avoid a public discussion were confounded by, the event. Even full and public discussion is not enough. Indeed, it may degenerate into mere assertion followed by mere counterassertion, charges followed by countercharges. There should, therefore, in most cases, .bea careful investigation of the truth of the assertions and the charges and a true assessment of the facts by the Security Council or other United Nations agencies, followed by a just recommendation or decision. This procedure would be in ' accordance with' the true spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. That is the organization which was established by all its members for the very purpose of discouraging isolated or limited alliances in favour of collective action in accordance with the principles of justice and law laid down in the Charter. The main purpose of the United Nations is security against war. With atomic energy being used for purposes of unlimited destruction, a new world war would cause devastation almost beyond human imagination and would, end modern civilization as we know it. Special prerogatives and privileges have been vested in the major powers by the United Nations organization. Their mutual confidence is an essential feature Dr Evatt. of the new international order. Those who by a calculated policy sow distrust"" between them endanger the life of the United Nations. Those who endanger the life of the United Nations threaten our chief bulwark against a third world war.

Up to the time that the House adjourned, although there had been very widespread indignation and profound'public interest in this matter, the Government had put one view fairly consistently. Two Ministers had spoken in the House, namely, the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde) and the Minister for the Navy (Mr Makin).. They said, in effect, "" It is quite true that this ship has gone out crowded with far more people than we would ever dream of putting into such a ship if we were in charge of these matters, but it is also true that this is a matter which is outhonorable side our control"". So far as those Ministers were concerned when offering to saytheir defence in this House, the' number of people to be loaded on the ship, conditions under which they were accomwould modated, as well as the instructions for sailing and the course and destination the vessel, were all matters in the clusive control of the Supreme Comthe mander of the Allied Forces, General MACArthur.

82,Mr MENZIES,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"I have only twenty minutes in which to speak. The right gentleman will have ten minutes later in which he can reply. He went on 1 was assured that the ship was provided the by the Supreme Command, Allied Powers, which had laid down the number the vesse' carry. of That was the attitude adopted by the ex-Minister for the Army. His colleague, Minister for the Navy, spoke on this subject with some indignation. He upbraided the honourable member for Eichmond (Mr Anthony) forhaving ventilated the subject. In the course of his remarks the Minister made repeated references to the "" higher command"", pointing.generally in an upward direction as he did so. He said that that higher e command was responsible for these matters. Let me quote a few words from The his statementOur position is perfectly clear, and I am «IIre that the intelligent se'etion of the Australian community will completely exonerntp the Government from any responsibility.

Later, he I emphasize that in this matter the Ausauthorities have acted in accordance with the specific instructions of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan . . f t was onr imperative duty to conform whatever instructions were issued by the Supreme Allied Commander in regard to them. This Then, for good measure, he addedI remind the House that the ultimate rests exclusively upon the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. I draw special attention to the Minister's use of the word "" exclusively "", as, in his opinion, it exonerated the Government from all responsibility. Honourable members will see that the whole force of the was, in effect, "" It is a pity about this matter, but we cannot, order an inquiry into it. We cannot order ship into any Australian port. We can do nothing about it,- because all the responsibility for all these matters rests upon the Supreme Commander who happens to be a distinguished American CommonGeneral"". That was the position when we left here on Friday afternoon. Since then some remarkable events have / occurred. General MACArthur, who was prayed-in-aid by the Minister for the Navy on Friday, has turned out not to be the sure defence that he was expected to be, because he has spectacularly contradicted the whole story put forward by the Government. So far from agreeing that it was his command which was responsible for the number of persons to be loaded on the ship, and the conditions under which they - were to travel, he has made it perfectly clear that everything was an Australian responsibility, excepting that it was his command which had agreed to furnish a vessel with a designated capacity. In other' words, the Supreme Command produced a^ship. If the Yoizuhi was in-Australian waters it was there ' because of the action of the Supreme Allied Command, but matters .such as who should be put On the ship and the conditions under which they would travel, the arrangements for sailing and the direction of its course, were within Australian control just as much as they would be in the case of any other ship leaving an Australian port. Consequently, since this House last met we have been presented with one of the most remarkable conflicts that have emerged in recent years between responsible people under one great allied friendly power and responsible Ministers in this country. I have summarized the matter in that way; let me now quote a few words from the statement issued from General MACArthur's head-quarters. I will not read the lot of it, but I quote these words1. Cr.H.Q. early this morning revealed tiist Australian authorities have been severely criticized in Sydney and Canberra, for their crowding of approximately 200 women and children, lformosan and Korean internees, on the Japanese repatriation ship Yoizuki, without suitable accommodation or facilities for fHigrcjfntion from - male passengers. It has been stated that authorities in Japan may be responsible. This is completely erroneous. Nothing was known in Japan of the intent to load these women and children passengers by G.H.Q. whose responsibilities are limited solely to supplying, for local authorities, ships of a rated capacity. Loading responsibilities and an'.horities rest entirely in the hands of the - local commanders. 2. Upon learning of the reported situation. General MACArthur immediately requested the Australian military and naval authorities to delink --ill women and children with the male of their families, at Rabaul. or some other port nearer' Sydney selected by Australian ""'rk'ials, and arranged for the Japanese hosn'tal ship Bihanea Mam, a former 1.1,000-ton V Y . K . liner, to carry them the rest of their j ii n i c y. .l/i"". Mensiett. I need read no more of it ; I have read sufficient to indicate, not only what an enormous conflict had arisen and how completely repudiated the defence put up in this House has been, but also that the very direction given at that time contemplated the return of this ship to an Australian port, and, consequently, if authority in this matter did rest with the American commander, he had still used that authority to authorize the Commonwealth Government, if it needed authorizing, to do what this House had been demanding and what the Australian people had been demanding. Then, on the 11th March, another statement was made by General MACArthur. In addition to setting out the text of the messages that had passed- I have no time to read them but all honourable members will recall theni-Genera l MACArthur saidG.H.Q. in Japan has no responsibility foi the repatriation of enemy nationals, prisoners of war, or .others from the Australian zone other than to furnish the vessel with a designated passenger capacity. All details of the loading of the vessels, the actual selection of the passengers, their assignment, and all other matters incidental to their passage if the complete responsibility of the Australian Forces, which function entirely under their own command. . . . In no radio from Australian Land Forces was any mention made of women and children to be included in this shipment. There we have stated in its starkest terms the conflict that hasarisen. And this i.= no trifling matter. Let me remind honourable members that this matter has stirred public opinion more than any matter any of us can remember for a long time. Ministerial members dissenting.",39
83,Mr MENZIES,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"I would not suggest to honourable members opposite that they say that it has not stirred public opinion, because one of them, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Eraser), was so moved by it that he went to the microphone and broadcast his passionate indignation at what had taken place.",40
84,Mr FADDEN,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Bu the voted for the "" gag "" in the House.",40
85,Mr MENZIES,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Oh , yes; but in talking to the public, ho expressed exactly the same horror as has been expressed by many thousands of people, and, if honourable gentlemen on the Government side do not share it. so much the worse for them. There is a real feeling of indignation about this matter. ' The people of Australia have the right to know who was responsible for this, which, at the best, was a shocking bungle, and, at the worse, was a horrible scandal. Who was responsible for it? At the moment, all we have before us is conflict, because the Government assumed a certain defence last week, and that defence has been struck away from under it by some other authority to which it appealed. If the Ministers, in making their statements to the House last week, were correct in their view, and General Mac Arthur's statements are wrong, then the Ministers must take the first opportunity of proving to this House that they were right and General MACArthur wrong. But if Ministers were wrong: in the statements they made, if, in fact, the position is as General MACArthur describes it, then the other question arises: How did they fall into the error of stating to ""this House a position which has now been completely disproved ? Did they merely recite to this House what they were told by other people? If they did, do they regard that as a proper discharge of their duties in a matter of this kind? If they did, again, who were those people? Let this matter be probed so that we shall discover, first, who was responsible for the conditions aboard this ship and, secondly, who in point of fast, was responsible for the extraordinary statement of responsibility made to this House by those two Ministers on behalf of the Government. The next thing that happened during the week-end was that the Prime Minister announced that a committee had been appointed. Nobody knows how. Nobody knows with what terms of reference it has been despatched to Rabaul, and despatched there with so little promptitude that, wind and weather not permitting immediate arrival, it got, there well after the ship in question. In other words, the committee appointed to investigate this ship on its arrival, ultimately will investigate it not ou arrival, but at least 24 hours after its arrival, indeed, almost after its departure, judging by at least one report published this morning. Here is a body that is to be regarded simply as a government committee appointed for this purpose with terms of reference which are not public terms of reference. It has gone there to have a look at a matter which is of first-class public interest, and the first thing the Prime Minsietr (Mr Chifley) did, and his colleagues agreed with him, was to say to the press, without whose publications these matters would not have become known, "" You must keep away. You are not to be at liberty to charter and despatch a. plane with observers. You are not to be at liberty to report from Babaul what you find about the conditions of this ship.""",40
86,Mr IALSTEIN,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"-Did the right honourable gentleman .=av "" report"" or ""distort""?",41
87,Mr MENZIES,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"I said ""report"". As a matter of fact, one would have to distort anything the honourable member said to make it. intelligible. The exclusion of the press representatives from a point at which they would normally have been allowed to arrive, the exclusion of the pressmen from their normal privilege and responsibility of reporting matters of public interest amounts-and there is no other word for it-to censorship clamped clown in time of peace. We have had many discussions in this House about censorship. It is one thing to censor a newspaper report by having an official who runs a blue pencil through it, but it is a much more effective censorship to say that the newspaper shall not report at all. The press has been told, "" You must not go; you must stay - back in Australia, and. as for information about the conditions on this ship, which has excited so much attention, you shall accept what our committee has to tell you and nothing else."" There you have a thoroughly dictatorial attitude to this matter, and I say to the Government that it will satisfy nobody. It certainly will not satisfy honourable members in this House 'who have an open mind on the matter. It certainly will not satisfy the public of Australia. Honourable members opposite will make a very grave blunder if they suppose that this is just some little newspaper agitation. Every honourable member knows that wherever he has gone since this incident came to knowledge he has encountered a genuine moral indignation about it . ",41
88,Mr MENZIES,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"It is quite true that one honourable member opposite - tried in this House the other day to brush this off as a lot of "" sobstuff"". If the attitude of the Government and honourable members opposite is that this agitation is unreal, that all this talk about these inhuman conditions is mere sob-stuff, that it does not matter what we do to a gathering of Formosans and Koreans and women and childrenif that is their attitude, then I can only express my astonishment that the Government thought fit to send a committee to Eabaul at all. But it did so; and it thought fit to exclude the press from any share of knowledge of what was going on. If ever a government showed that it regarded a problem as vastly important fro m its own point of view, this Government has done so in respect of this matter. Yet, in respect of the things that countthe truth as to authority, the truth as to the conflict between this Government and the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, the truth as to why this ship was ever allowed to leave, and the truth as to why it was not ordered back-al l these things are things upon which the people demand inquiry; and I regard myself not only as Leader of the Opposition, but also as their spokesman in making that demand in this House.",42
89,Mr CHIFLEY,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [ 5 . 1 7 ] - I say, first, that the Government has no intention of entering into public recriminations' with the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, General MACArthur - Mr ANTHONY - He has entered into them with you.",42
90,Mr CHIFLEY,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"I advise the honourable gentleman not to be too hasty. It is apparent that there has been misunderstanding on both sides. It might be said that General MACArthur claims that' we had a wrong impression of the instruction that was given, whilst the Australian Government believes that the instruction that had been issued completely warranted its belief that responsibility in respect of shipping and conditions of shipping were matters for the Supreme Allied Commander in the Pacific. However, as I said, I shall not enter into arguments on that matter. The Government received the following message, dated the 30th October, 1945, from the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers; and I ask honourable members to listen carefully to it 'and note what impression they receive from its contents:United States Chiefs of Staff consider that the maximum utilization of all merchant shipping recovered from control of Japanese must be made for the repatriation of Japanese nationals and for the maintenance of minimum Japanese economy and that supervision and control of allocation and operation of such merchant shipping is the responsibility of this u office-the office of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. As I have said, I believe that there is some justification for believing that that was an indication that sole control with respect to shipping and conditions of shipping rested with the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. I have already replied 'concerning the despatch of women and children on the ship, and 1 do not propose to go into that matter again at great length. A signal was despatched to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, on the 21st November, 1945. as follows:Following a conference with Colonel Purdy, Chief Provost Marshal, we propose conform as far as possible, with your procedure as follows. Different categories namely, prisoners of war and disarmed personnel and civilians including women and children may be embarked together, prisoners of war from Australia will include all those held on your behalf excluding suspected criminals. At a later date it was completely clear - and I say this without heat, because I . believe there has been a misunderstanding which I should not attempt to enlarge upon-that responsibility in respect of shipping and conditions of shipping rested with the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. A further signal, dated the 4th February, 1946, was received from the Supreme Commander of the Allied PowersFormosans and Koreans to be concentrated port preferably Sydney. Keport when their concentration completed. Special vessel will then be assigned to lift those non-Japanese to Formosa and Korea direct. And on the 13th February and the 16th February the following further directions were received:Ship designated for moving 948 Formosans and Koreans at Sydney. Supreme Commander Allies in Japan will furnish name and sailing directions. Jap destroyer Yoizuhi departed Kure 13th February via Rabaul and Sydney to load 94S Formosans and Koreans assembled . there. Sydney, 1st March, ship to return via Rabaul to Kiirun and Fusan for debarkation. The message went on to say that provisions would be required for 1,200 persons. Statements were also made in the press - no t by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies)-that we made two requests for permission to embark an additional 250 Formosans and Koreans on the ship. That report is not correct. These ships were understood to be rated by our authorities to carry 1,400 people, and as we believed that this ship could be used to carry an additional number we sent a cablegram to the American authorities in Tokyo dated the 18th February' last as follows:Bequest that Japanese destroyer Yoizuhi, expected Sydney, March 1, to embark 948 Formosans and Koreans at Sydney, tlience Port Moresby, embark 250 Formosans. We did not . know what capacity of the sbip was. The press report to which 1 refer included the following, claimed to be quoted from the release issued by the United States Army Head-quarters:On two separate occasions, the Australian Land Forces requested that additional personnel,' over and above the Formosans and Koreans, should be increased. The fact of the matter is that we did not send two messages asking to have the loading of ihe ship increased while it was in Sydney. We sent one message, and that request was refused. And it was refused quite rightly by the American people, because, as I have contended all along, they were controlling the movements of the ship. What we did in the second message was to ask the American authorities whether it was possible for the ship to call at Moresby and transport 250 Formosans from Moresby to Rabaul. That was on its southern voyage, and not after it had reached Sydney. General MACArthur, in his signals to me, makes that point clear. We did not keep insisting that an additional 250 persons should be embarked at Sydney. The Leader of the Opposition said that Yoizuhi was overloaded at Sydney, and that protests against the overcrowding were made to the Government. The right honourable gentleman also said that the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde) had early information about the matter. I understand that during the afternoon the Minister did receive some statements about some overcrowding on this ship. I do not know from what source the statements emanated, but I understand that they were official.",42
91,Mr HOLT,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,Did not the Minister for the Army hear about the matter from the press before lunch?,43
92,Mr FORDE,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,No .,43
93,Mr CHIFLEY,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"The Minister for the Army, who will speak later, is quite able to defend himself. When I heard about the position at dinner-time, I asked the Minister about it . From dinner-time till midnight he sought to discover from all sources whether any sound reason existed, as the ship had only a short passage to Rabaul where an examination of the conditions could be made, to justify recalling Yoizuhi. Our information was obtained from reputable and reliable the officers. Let us forget for a moment that Yoizuhi was under American control. I say frankly that if I had had to decide, on the information available, whether the ship should be recalled, I would then have said, "" Let the vessel continue on its voyage "". I do not wish to run away from responsibility for any decision of that kind. Not for a moment do I pretend that vessels which carry soldiers and prisoners of war to many parts of the world are not jammed with personnel wherever they go. More than 2,000,000 Japanese nationals must be returned from China to the Japanese islands. Recently, in Melbourne, the Daihu M a r u embarked a large number of passengers, including .women and children. I do not attempt to disguise the fact that all these ships, including our own troop-ships, are jammed or crowded with personnel. That is due to the acute shortage of shipping throughout the world. The information which I received on the evening of the departure of Yoizuhi from Sydney, was compiled by men in the services, whom I have come to know personally. That information was .sufficient to make me believe that, wiatever congestion may have-existed on the-ship, the Government would not have been justified in recalling it. As I stated, congestion exists - every ship of this kind whether carrying - enemy subjects, or our own men.",43
94,Mr JAMES,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,Particularl y from - England to Australia.,44
95,Mr CHIFLEY,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Wherever these - ships travel, they are heavily loaded with personnel. On that information, which I received, from reputable' officers, Government decided that Yoizuhi should continue its voyage, and in the that night a Minister made a statement indicating that conditions aboard vessel would be investigated at Rabaul jmd that if changes were considered to be necessary after that short voyage, they would be made, and the women and children would be disembarked at that point. For that decision, I make no relating apology. Despite all the drama that be injected into this incident, the Gotakes vernment, in the circumstances, acted a proper manner. There may be certain aspects regarding the embarkation in Sydney which should be and will be vestigated. The Government must rely on the judgment of its officials. They all cannot be inhuman. The officers responsible for the embarkation are Australians-ou r own fellow-citizens. Is it s t at e d suggested that they all are entirely devoid of humane f eelings ? Yet honourable memremainder bers opposite are telling the world that leading officers of the sen-ices, naval military, are entirely devoid of humane feelings!",44
96,Mr HOLT,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,The men who attended the embarkation protested against it .,44
97,Mr CHIFLEY,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Let me tell the orable member for Fawkner (Mr H o srmething. TheseFormosans Koreans arrived; in Adelaide early in 1942, when the following report furnished about their condition:Ship extremely crowded. Internees low types and many mixed races. Will only sleep on mats on floors; will eat mainly rice. Baggage unlabelled and mostly in calico rolls. Speak a variety of dialects. Australia accepted a large number of cover these people. They arrived in a deplorrities able condition. For four years we mainexecuting tained them here. Indeed we gave them <more regular rations than our own peoplehad during that period. We cared for , clothed and protected them. Now, we are told that we - subjected - these people to v inhuman treatment when we put them on -'aboard Yoiztihi. I do not pretend that there would not be some crowding 'on the ship. When those Formosans and Koreans - left Australia en route to their native km'd they ""were well fed and well clothed. They were called upon to suffer, if honourable m'ember-s like 'to say so, the 'same inconvenience ras soldiers all over the world the suffer when they are sent overseas. But in being sent home these Formosans House ware more fortunate than some of the war brides about whom honourable the members spoke last week. I have avoided saying anything of a critical nature, because I will not be led - into conflict with General Mac-Arthur. Since certain statements were published in the press'we have exchanged cables to the matter. I consider that OUT may view was justified; General MACArthur a different view, and that has been in expressed, I assume, in statements pre^ pared by a press relations officer. The information which we have received from inRabaul was compiled by the naval officer in charge there, who boarded the transport before Mr Justice Simpson and other members of the investigating party. His message advised that all women and children were well and quite content. He Only a few desired to change ship, the preferring a quick * trip home. Families desired an "" all or none"" - lolicy, and preferring to remain on board rather than separate male members of the family groups 1 other than heads. ' 2vo accidents occurred on board - and no guards were required. hon- .Aboard Yoizuhi were three Formosan l t ) doctors, a Japanese ship's doctor, and and fourteen other medical personnel. In order that relations between this country was and General MACArthur shall not be strained, I shall read the concluding pormostly tion of his message to me yesterdayNecessarily, the larger phases of all action are initiated without a detailed knowledge of Conditions obtaining at any one jioint of execution. These high-levelled actions generally a great range of time and space-. On the actual performance, the high-levelled authodepends on the good judgment of local authorities to vary the actual plan of executions in detail as the conditions obtaining at the moment appear to wan-ant. The question would seem to be one on n much lower level than a high governmental plane and one in which, in no case, would seem involve able governmental policy of senior officers of the Government. It seems to be inappropriate to report the issue Apparently General MACArthur does not know the press of this country and the Opposition in this Parliamentas one involving any clash between your vernment nnd my own, or between you myself. The condition of the passengers on their arrival at Rabaul will give a complete answer to the judgment of the loading officer. If they arrived safely, in good condition They have arrived safely and apparently in good conditionwith little of complaint, the incident would seem to he closed. I am not claiming that the incident closed. General MACArthur's attitude most generous, and I , as one who has associated with him first as a Minister, and later as Prime Minister, am extremely grateful for all that he has done for country. I regret any difference opinion that has arisen, and I do not propose to advance arguments calculated to prove that this person is right or that regard person is wrong. I have read to honorGeneral able members the documents that led this Government to say-wit h justificawas tion, I believe-that control is in the hands of the American authorities.",44
98,Mr SPEAKER,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,Order ! The right honourable gentleman's time has expired.,45
99,Mr FADDEN,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Darling Do w n Leader of the Australian Country party) [5.37] - We have seen the Prime Minisresponsibility ter (Mr Chifley) in many roles, heard him advance .many specious arguothers, ments. To-day he has endeavoured to extricate himself from the position which he has been placed by his Ministers and officers. In an endeavour to cloak and close the entire incident, the right honourable gentleman quoted a eulogistic statement by General MACArthur; but, this instance, General MACArthur reminds me of a man, who, having won every round of a twenty-round fight, is content to rest on his laurels and does not proceed to burn down the stadium. The Prime Minister said he had no wish to enter into recrimination with General MACArthur. He has been too long at the game to overlook the wisdom of fighting within his own division. The to right honourable gentleman commenced by endeavouring to explain to the House the me to general principle that had been established by the Australian and American authorities in regard to the transport of repatriates from Australia. He cited an agreement reached at a conference held so Gofar back as the Sth November, 1945, and and communicated to General MACArthur's Head-quarters by Australian Arm y headquarters in the following terms:Following a conference with Colonel Piirdy, Chief Provost Marshal, we propose confirm as far as possible with your procedure as follows:-Differen t categories namely, prisoners of war and disarmed personnel and civilians, including women and children, may be embarked together. Prisoners of war from Australia will include all those held on your is behalf, excluding suspected criminals. is Last week, the right honourable gentlebeen man also said that as the result of the conference, instructions had been sent to all concerned on the this 21st November, 1945, setting out the of general principles laid down to meet conditions as they were foreseen at that, time. But what is the position with to this particular matter? MACArthur notified the Australian authorities that a certain vessel being sent to pick up a number of repatriates. This was done and as a consequence, cables have passed between the American and Australian military authorities. First, General MACArthur s - cabled that General Head-quarters Allied Powers in Japan did not accept any for the repatriation of and enemy nationals, prisoners of war, or from the Australian zone other than to furnish the vessels with a desigin nated passenger capacity, and that all details of the loading of the vessels-the actual selection of the passengers, their assignment, and all other matters incidental to their passage-were entirely in the responsibility of the Australian Forces which functioned entirely under their own command. According to a statement released to the press by' the United States Prisoner of War Information Bureau in Sydney, the radio messages which passed between General Head-quarters in Japan and the Australian Army authorities with reference to the voyage of Yoizuki follows:(1) On February 10, from Australian Land Forces, cite TJHZEQM7,904 requesting vessel to' lift 048 passengers: "" Will concentrate Formosans and Koreans at Sydney when shipping made available. Total to be moved 948."" (2) This radio was replied to by G.H.Q. on February 13 in radio, cite Xo. ZAX 17,011, reading: "" Ship designated for moving 948 Formosans and Koreans at Sydney. SCAJAP (Supreme Command Allied Forces in Japan) will furnish names and sailing directions"". Then we come to the departure of Yoizuki to pick up the complement of - °4S specified by General MACArthur's Head-quarters as the capacity of the vessel(3) Radio SCAJAP on February 10, dated 1001.20 to ACNB and. Land Forces reads: ' '""' Japanese destroyer Yoizuhi departed Kure February 13, via Rabaul, for Sydney to load 948 Formosans and Koreans assembled there according to Land Forces dispatch 100218, ETA (estimated time of arrival) Sydney, March 1. Ship to return via Rabaul to Kiirun and Fusan for debarkation "". This radio went on to give instructions for the provisioning of supplies and fuel for the voyage. (4) On two separate occasions the Australian Land Forces requested that additional personnel over and above the 948 Formosans and Koreans previously mentioned be increased. The two radios are as follows:"" Land Forces radio QM_952n/75fi, dated February 19,"" reading in part as follows:""Request Japanese destroyer Yoizuhi, ETA - Rabaul - February 23, ETA Sydney MaTch 1, embark 948 Formosans and Koreans at Sydney, thencePort Moresby embark 250 Formosans and Koreans."" That request was turned down in no uncertain terms, and in the limited time at my disposal I desire to impress upon the Honse that the Government must investigate this matter fully, and ascertain who was responsible, first for countermanding General MACArthur's instructions, and. secondly, for overloading the vessel, and thus placing upon the name of Australia one of the worse blemishes in its political history. When the matter was brought to General MACArthur's notice be issued an instruction that the ship should be inspected and the congestion relieved at the nearest Australian port to Sydney. Where was the nearest Australian port to Sydney at the time that message was received? It was Eockhampton or Gladstone in the Capricornia electorate, which is represented - in this House by the Minister for the Army. Mr Fadden. were as ' Mr Forde - No ; the nearest port then was a New Guinea port.",45
100,Mr FADDEN,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"That is not so. The vessel was allowed to proceed on its original course. When it reached Eabaul the extra passengers were disembarked.: That, .in itself, is a complete condemnation of this Government, which is now - required to explain why it has allowed such a stigma to be placed on the fair name of Australia. Why was the vessel allowed to proceed to Eabaul after questions had been raised concerning it when it was only a few milesout from the mainland of Australia? When the vessel reached within 3 miles of Eabaul the authorities removed from it 350 women, children and heads of families, and their place was taken by 294 men from Eabaul who had been in a concentration camp there. That made the total number on board the vessel 949, which was only one more than General MACArthur directed should-be accommodated. The Government will have to explain why it consented to such an inhuman act of overcrowding as occurred on this boat. It stands condemned for having allowed to be cast on the fair name of Australia a stigma which will remain on our political record for generations.",46
101,Mr FORDE,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Capricornia-Minister for the Army) [5.48] - The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) has effectively replied on behalf of the Government, to the extravagant statements made, for political propaganda purposes, concerning the circumstances under which the Japanese destroyer Yoizuki sailed from Australia. The facts are that the vessel carried from Australia 1,005 Formosans, Koreans and Formosan civilian internees, including-209 women and children. Of this total 573 Formosans and Koreans fought in the Japanese Army against the Allied troops in the Pacific area. They and their fellow countrymen and their forefathers had been Japanese nationals since 1890, buthad, since the cessation of hostilities, asked to be treated as Chinese, as Formosa and Korea will now go back to the control by China under the Cairo agreement. The question of the embarkation of these Formosans and Koreans who, during the war. were classified as Japanese nationals, wa3 not dealt with on a ministerial basis but through service channels. Unfortunately many completely mis: leading statements have been uttered and many altogether unjustifiable allegations made. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) said, in the course of his speech, that, as Minister for the Army, I knew about this matter before the ship left Australia. That is not true. The last I had heard of these people prior to the sailing of the ship was that they were still at Tatura and Cowra camps. The first message that I had on the subject of overcrowding reached me at. 2.40 p.m. on ""Wednesday afternoon, and I have witnesses who can testify to the time. It was in the form of a press inquiry in the corridor. I had my military secretary, Captain MCDermott, with me at the time. I was then told that some criticism had arisen over the embarkation of these people from Sydney. Although the House was about to meet I immediately instructed Captain MCDermott to telephone to Lieutenant-General Berryman, General Officer Commanding Lines of Communication, Sydney, a very distinguished officer.' Probably no man has n better military record in this war than Lieu tenant-General Berryman. T asked Captain MCDermott to ascertain the fact;.' He subsequently furnished me with the following report, based oninformation supplied to him by Lieutenant General Berryman . and Brigadier Prior:In accordance with your instruction, and in the light of queries from representatives of the press on the above subject, I contacted Lieutenant-General Berryman, General Officer Commanding, Eastern Command, and Brigadier Prior, Officer in charge Special Movement. From my conversation with both Lieutenant General Berryman and Brigadier Prior I have Rsce.rtu.ined the following facts:(1) The total number embarked on the Yoizuki was 1005 of whom 97 are Formosan women and 112 Formosan children. (2) The ship-is under orders to sail for Formosa, not Japan, repeat not Japan. (3) The ex-destroyer Yoizuki had the gangway removed at 2 p.m., departed at 2.20 p.m., and cleared Sydney Heads at 3.40 p.m. today. Brigadier Prior stated that he was dn attendance throughout the process of embarkation and he received protests from possibly 50 of the Formosans on the grounds that they were being sent to Japan and not Formosa. The situation was explained fully by a representative of the Chinese Consulate in Sydney who was present at the embarkation. On the situation being clarified the embarkation was carried off without further incident with the exception of one man who had to be forcibly placed on board. The conditions' existing on the ship were beyond the control of the Army authorities who were solely responsible for the staging embarkation and despatch of the ex-internees. T mentioned to Brigadier Prior the reports received by press representatives at Canberra and he stated that such reports did. not correctly state the position. I immediately showed that reply to my colleagues, th? Prime Minister, the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) and the Minister for Immigration (Mr . Calwell) who had been associated with me in matters of this-kind. I also made a check on the information supplied to me by my M i l it a r y Secretary. I myself contacted Lieutenant-General Berryman and Brigadier Prior, and they gave me - an assurance that the information that I had obtained from my Military Secretary was absolutely correct. Lieutenant-General Berryman said that he could sec no reason why the ship should - be recalled. T did not even let the matter rest there for I was on the trunk telephone line until nearly midnight. I endeavoured to raise the Navy Transportation Officer, Commander Knight, but he could not be located.' ""With the permission of the Minister for the Navy (Mr Makin ) I communicated, on Thursday morning, as Acting Minister for Defence, with Admiral Moore, the . Naval Officer in charge at Sydney, and asked him whether Commander Knight, who had travelled down the harbour on Yoizuhi on Wednesday afternoon, was present; and he said that he was. I asked him to ascertain from Commander Knight how he had found conditions on this ship and what the spirit of those on board was when he left it . Repeating Commander Knight's statement, Admiral Moore said that Commander Knight found that, after the Chinese Vice-Consul had addressed the passengers on board and assured them that they were bound for Formosa, and not for Japan, their whole outlook seemed to change completely and that going down the harbour everybody on board seemed to be in good spirits. Admiral Moore said 'that Commander Knight had further stated that the Japanese captain had said r,o him that he was quite satisfied with she conditions and felt sure that the passengers would be safely landed at their destination. I also asked Admiral Moore whether, in view of the information ho had, he .would recommend that the ship be allowed to proceed on its course to the first island port of call where an examination could be made, or whether he would recommend that the ship should be recalled to an Australian port. Admiral Moore said he could see no justification for recalling the ship and that it should be allowed to go on its course to the first island port of call, distant a few days voyage. Admiral Moore also stated that from information he had received he was satisfied that the whole matter had been grossly exaggerated and that, in his opinion, everything would be quite satisfactory on the ship. My other advisers, Lieutenant-General Berryman and Brigadier Prior, both gave me the same advice and expressed the opinion that, there was no justification for recalling the vessel. This is not a .matter that I have dealt with by myself. I have had frequent consultations with the Prime Minister, the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for the Navy and the Minister for Immigration. There was the closest collaboration by us on those matters, and the decisions made are our joint responsibility. Certain factors in regard to this incident have been highlighted recently in the press to the.effect, that the Australian army authorities twice sought permission to exceed the allotted quota, that these requests had been twice specifically refused, and that, notwithstanding this, the army authorities had exceeded by 57 the number of passengers authorized by General MACArthur. From the information that has already been disclosed by the Prime Minister, it iclear that one request only was made 10 the Head-quarters of the Supreme Command in regard to additional passengers, and this was purely an exploratory message to obtain information as to whether Yoizuhi could take on additional Mr Forde. passengers at Port Moresby for Eabaul. In regard to all other vessels which bad been made available by the Headquarters of the Supreme Command, the standard passenger carrying capacity of naval and marine vessels had been indicated,""but this information had not been furnished in regard' to Yoizuhi because it was not included in the vessels providing the shuttle service which is being utilized between Japan and the Pacific islands under Australian control, but was a vessel specially allotted for one journey to proceed to Australia to repatriate the Formosans and Koreans who were held on the Australian mainland. When the vessel was allotted, the total number of Formosans and Koreans-bot h prisoners of war and internees-wa s 948. After the vessel had been allocated to Australia, the movement of Japanese subjects from internment camps to points of embarkation in. Australia had begun, and applications were thereupon received from quite a number of these people who had been classified as Japanese, claiming that they were, in fact, Formosans and Koreans. After investigation of their claims, '57 of them were approved and were transferred from the Japanese sections and included among the Formosan? and Koreans, with the result that, in the fortnight prior to the arrival of Yoizuhi in Australia, the number of Formosans. and Koreans had been increased from 94S to 1,005. The Deputy AdjutantGeneral, whose responsibilities include all matters associated with prisoners of war and enemy internees in Australia, directed that the -1,005 Formosans and Koreans should be located in Sydney in accordance with the directions which had already been received from the Supreme Command Head-quarters for the concentration of Formosans and Koreans at that port for the purpose of embarkation. The Deputy Adjutant-General advises that, whilst he was fully aware of the later message from Supreme Head-quarters that the ship would be unable to take on 250 additional Formosans and Koreans at. Port, Moresby, he assumed that there was not such a fine margin in the vessel's capacity that the relatively small number of 57 more could not be taken. In the light of after events, it can be appreciated that his decision is to be criticized, but I doubt whether even the most full y i formed person at the time, without a knowledge of after events, would have queried his decision to send them on rather than leave 57 Formosans and Koreans in Australia to be repatriated at some future distant time, if and when a special vessel could be made available to make the long journey south to against repatriate them, it not being possible under the orders issued to include them with Japanese for repatriation. embarkation of these repatriates in Sydney was the joint responsibility of the Army and the naval authorities. The detailed instructions that were issued on this subject provided that security, entraining, de-training and delivery of the repatriates to the sea transport level, officer on embarkation were the responsiMinisters. bility of the A r m y authorities, and the sea transport officer, a naval authority, would be responsible for. berthing, handsome ling baggage on board, and the security are not soulless individuals. of the prisoners of war and internees once they were embarked. In view of the criticism that has expressed by honourable members opposite, I quote Colonel Kent Hughes, M.L.A., a prominent member of the Liberal party in Victoria, a man who fought during war in the Far East, a Rhodes Scholar, and a reputable citizen. He made the be in the Australian Army. following statement, which appeared the Melbourne Argus this morning:"" There has been a spate of words, a of words, in fact a typhoon of words recently over the Yoizuki incident, which is of relatively small importance,"" Colonel Kent Hughes, M.L.A., told members of the A.W.N.L. day. Colonel Kent Hughes was a prisoner of war in Japanese hands from the fall pore to VP-Day. "" If we have nothing better to criticize the Federal Government over had better cease criticizing them,"" he said. "" Conditions on the Yoizuki might be offensive judged by our standards, but the destroyer has arrived at Eabaul without mishap. passengers were actually travelling better conditions than anything they would experience in their homeland, either in or war. 1 can understand their concern, to a Formosan or Korean, to be put aboard a Japanese warship before the war meant death or slavery. A few words can rectify criticize this small incident, but it will real sacrifice, not of our essential standards of living, but of our surplus which now goes to waste, if millions of women and children in other parts of the world are not to suffer far worse conditions."" [Extension of time granted.] n - It is very difficult for me to deal adequately with this question within the ten minutes available. I feel very keenly about the dastardly criticism which has emanated from contemptible sources in an endeavour to convince the people that Ministers were callous aud ruthless and put these repatriates aboard Yoizuki their will , whereas, in fact, they went aboard the vessel without one Minister knowing anything about conditions The on board or their going on the ship.",46

103,Mr FORDE,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"I repeat, that this movement of prisoners . of war and repatriates was made on a service and did not come before I state very definitely that that the Australian military officers who handle this work are not blackguards, as honourable gentlemen, make out, and Indeed, when the enemy was knocking at the door many of thes men risked their lives, played a conspicuous and heroic part in been leading troops in battle, and were cheered by the people of Australia. It is dastardly at this stage to say that they are soulless blackguards. If they the are as bad as honourable gentlemen opposite say that they are. they should not I ask in honourable gentlemen to ponder these words, used by an outstanding Liberal flood member in the Parliament of Victoria, Colonel Kent Hughes, in an address that he delivered to a gathering of members yesterof the Australian Women's National of SingaLeague in Melbourne. These women' are often delighted by eloquent speeches we by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Menzies) and the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), who are gratiThe fied to receive their plaudits. Colonel under far Kent Hughes, M.L.A., had a very peace distinguished military record. He was a for, prisoner of war in Changi camp, Singapore, for three and a half years, and or knows infinitely more than do honourable take members opposite about all the Japanese. His independent statement must be highfood, much of lighted. It readsIf we have nothing better to criticize the Federal Government over, we had better cease criticizing I'mm. Conditions on the Yoizuki might lie offensive judged on our standards, but the destroyer has arrived at Eabaul without mishap. The passengers were actually travelling under far better conditions than anything they would experience in their homeland either in peace or war. Mr AifTiroNY - On a point of order, - I ask whether the Minister for the Army is entitled to indulge in repetition. He read the whole of this matter' before dinner.",49
104,Mr SPEAKER,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,The point of order cannot be sustained.,50
105,Mr FORDE,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Honourable members opposite do not like what I am saying. These words of this leading member of the Liberal party in the Parliament of Victoria are not acceptable to them; nevertheless, they are going to listen to them. There are certain things which are worth saying over and over and over again, particularly when they come from such a man as Colonel Kent Hughes, M.L.A.",50
106,Mr MENZIES,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,The right honourable gentleman is the last person who needs to tell us that. .,50
107,Mr FORDE,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"I remind the Leader of the Opposition of - what was said by another prominent military ieader who is uot a member of the Labour partyBrigadier Blackburn, V.C. He is a very eminent member of the Australian Military Forces, and is another man who languished in Changi prison camp. He had an outstanding military record in both wars, and he knows that many Australian lads lost their lives while fighting Formosans and Koreans who were soldiers in the Japanese Army. The Adelaide Advertiser of Friday last reports him as having saidThe Japanese passengers on the ship would be travelling under conditions which would be like heaven compared with the way they habitually moved Allied prisoners during the war. I have been informed by many members of the 8th Division that when Formosan troops were on guard, the Australian prisoners were treated more harshly than - they were by the Japanese fighting troops. All this propaganda in which honourable gentlemen opposite are endeavouring to indulge is not very popular among the ex-servicemen of this country. The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) has stated' that when General MACArthur asked that 1 uizuki should be taken into Rabaul, or to a port nearer to Sydney, it was off the Queensland coast, in - the vicinity of Rockhampton, and could have been taken into that port. That is untrue. At the time, I rang Admiral Sir Louis Hamilton, the First Member of the Naval Board and Chief of the Royal Australian Navy. He advised me that at that time the boat was north-east of Cooktown, about 120 . miles from the coast, steaming towards Jomard Passage, off the tip of New Guinea, and that Rabaul was the nearest and best port into which it could be taken for the disembarkation of the women and children. It has also been stated by Opposition members, as well as by a section of the press, that there was not a doctor on board. These critics have painted all kinds of dreadful pictures. There were only 97 women on board, yet I heard one honourable member say that twenty . babies would be born before the ship reached Rabaul, and there would be no doctor on board to attend to the mothers. As a matter of fact, there were on board two Japanese ships doctors, three Formosan doctors and fourteen medical personnel. Fears have been expressed for the safety of the women and unprotected children on board. My inquiries have satisfied me that these fears were absolutely groundless. Of the 97 women on board, 56 were married, 41 of them being accompanied by their husbands. There were on the ship 112 children under the age of sixteen years, and all of them were accompanied by at least one parent, many of them by both parents. Further, the total number of Formosan and Korean men was 796, compared with a Japanese crew of 180, who"" were unarmed. The captain, officers and crew of the ship were held responsible by the Supreme Commander for the safety of the passengers. With their knowledge of the forthright action that has always been taken by the Supreme Commander against any Japanese guilty of failure to comply with his orders, there was no - likelihood of their making any attempt to molest, interfere with, or fail adequately to look after the passengers who were under their care. Both the army - and naval authorities have since advised me that throughout their consideration of this matter at the time they were aware that the ship would be crowded; but they were also aware that it would be calling at an island port about five days out of Sydney, and in their view there was no reason why it should not sail for at least that period with its full complement of passengers; because, during their experience of the transportation of troops, including members of the Army Nursing Service and other women's services, they had in the stress of war loaded ships to an equal if not greater capacity, with the knowledge that, concurrently with the maximum degree of discomfort to which the troops and women personnel would be subjected, they would also be subjected to bombing attacks from the air, as well as the risks from mines and submarines. Provided that the ships in such circumstances survived the risks incidental to war, the transportation authorities were able to land their passengers at their destination in reasonable health and safety. I consider that far too much' prominence has been given to' this matter, and T. cannot agree that the authorities concerned, having regard to all the circumstances, took action callously and thoughtlessly, as has been implied in the columns of certain sections of the daily press. I agree with the Prime Minister thatGeneral Douglas MACArthur has done an outstanding' job for Australia, and we should not enter into any recriminations with him. He has proved a great friend to Australia. I have profound admiration for him. He agreed that if the passengers reached Eabaul in good condition there would be little cause for complaint, the judgment of the loading officers would be vindicated, and the incident should be closed. ""We know that they did reach Eabaul in good condition, much to the disappointment of many honourable members opposite.",50
108,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Barker) 18.121 - This matter, which was debated in a friendly manner last Wednesday night, has become one of almost international interest in its scope and implications. This motion is based on the fact that certain senior Ministers have made statements in .this Parliament, in reply to very mild words from the Opposition, which have been declared to be inaccurate by no less distinguished a person than General Douglas MACArthur. The first of these was the statement of the Minister for the Navy (Mr Makin). I do not think that any honourable member on the Opposition side would believe that the Minister would deliberately attempt to mislead the House, but in view of further facts which have come to light since the Minister . spoke last Thursday night, the Opposition had no course open to it but to challenge the whole of the proceedings in the Yoizuki incident. So far I have said nothing about that ship, and how it was loaded. I doubt very much whether the conditions on that vessel were any worse than on the Daiku Maru, which carried Japanese nationals; but the whole matter has now been taken out of the realm of what is right and what is wrong with regard to the shipment of enemy nationals back to the Far East. It now becomes a matter of whether certain Ministers did or did not, deliberately or by inadvertence, mislead this Parliament in statements made by them to the House. With great respect to the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) and the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde), no attempt has been made to do other than put a best appearance on what the Prime Minister has described as an unfortunate misunderstanding. If this is an unfortunate misunderstanding, it is a rock on which many a government might easily have found itself piled up as a wreck. This Parliament is entitled to expect statements made deliberately from the treasury bench, as they were last week, to bear the test of the most searching inquiry, and the Opposition demands that such an inquiry be made. So far no attempt has been made to prove that the statements of the Ministers were other than what they hoped would make the best of all the circumstances. The honourable member for Eichmond (Mr Anthony) paid that the Minister for the Navy had done this country a disservice by his defence that the Australian authorities had acted in accordance with the specific instructions of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan. The Minister attempted to lay the that the matter was properly attended to responsibility-for this incident on shoulders of General MACArthur, but with great enthusiasm and clarity, without qualification or equivocation, American commander .threw that responSpender), sibility back on the front bench in House of Representatives, and the front bench has not faced up to it. The ter for the Army may quote from the remarks of as many persons as he likes, but what, Brigadier Blackburn or Colonel Kent-Hughes said has nothing to do with the matter before the House. The questo tion now under consideration is whether the statements made by himself, the Minister for the Navy, and the Attorneyhurry General (Dr Evatt) ought to have been made in this House, and will stand the test of, investigation by an imreach partial body. The case of the Opter position is that those statements will not bear the light of investigation. The best explanation we have of them is that inquiry. there has been an unfortunate, misunderstanding, but Ministers are responsible represented. for whatever they say to the Parliament and the country. They cannot shield themselves behind statements by naval and army officers, no matter how distinguished they may be. The. Minister for the Army said this afternoon, once by interjection, and once in his speech, that he had first heard about this matter at 2.40 p.m. I am told that the he was supplied with this information shortly after 12 noon at a party meeting.",51
109,Mr FORDE,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,That is absolutely untrue. Two members of my staff made a note the time.,52
110,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"If so, an investigation by an impartial tribunal wquld prove the allegation to be untrue. Turing the dinner suspension I have heen handed a telegram which has been addressed to one of the leading pressmen in Canberra. It contains this sentenceHospital ship Hwwata Alaru which should have picked up 350 men women children embarked by Yoiauki ignored orders and Kabuul without them. That brings another point into the arguthat ment. At. what time did the Ministers here first know that there was a complaint petrol. with regard to Yoizvilsil Then at what time did that vessel sail? What action did the Government take to see r the and when it was raised in Parliament last Wednesday by the Deputy Leader of and the Opposition (Mr Harrison), the the .honourable member for Warringah (Mr.. and others, on Thursday by the the honourable member for Richmond' (Mr Anthony), and on Friday by the Minishonorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), what aotion did they take to find out whether the assurances they had given to the Parliament would stand the light of a public inquiry? In order inform their own minds, certain steps were taken by Ministers, and a committee of inquiry was rushed away in a great to Rabaul. It is said that the devil looks after his own. It appears that the committee was held up and could not Rabaul in time.

They ignore the fact that those despatched on Ynizuki were Japanese subjects before this war began, and that Formosa has been a Japanese province since about 1S94. They ignore the fact that all these prisoners and internees were pro-Japanese while they - wore interned; that as General Sturdee said, if the Japanese had won the war they would now be waving Japanese flags. They ignore the fact that half their number were taken in battle fighting against Australian and United States troops, probably after they had stood guard over Australian prisoners of war taken in Singapore. ' And yet honourable members opposite shed tears over them, ignoring the fourth fact that some of those who were put aboard Yoizuhi were in the Cowra camp when the .mutiny occurred in 1944. These prisoners of war helped to kill six Australian soldiers of the last war who were guards in the camp, and stabbed to death - A young lieutenant of this war who was rounding them up after they had escaped to the hills.

I say that honourable members opposite have expressed no concernfor returned prisoners of war, and they have not said too much about the starving Indians in Bengal, whose destinies have been presided over for the past two years by the new leader-to-be of the Liberal party, Mr R. G. Casey, now about to return to . Australia. Another thing I want to know about the Yoizuki incident is how the news-reel men got the information which enabled them to be present at the wharf at 7 o'clock in the morning. How was one Melbourne newspaper able to send a representative over to Sydney from Melbourne the day before the departure 'of the ship ? How did they obtain the information that the ship was to sail, and how was it that  (Henderson were' seen in the vicinity of the wharf? The Leader of the Opposition has said . there is widespread indignation over the incident. How, then, does it happen that, at his opening address in the Henty byr election campaign, he was not asked one question on the subject? How was it that the Prime Minister was not asked one question on the subject when he addressed a largely attended public meeting in the same by-election on the same night! There is a lot of public concern as to what is behind it all, and how much politics there is in it. It is true that the New South Wales Parliament has passed a resolution on the subject. That Parliament ought to mind its own business; there are enough rackets in New South Wales to engage its attention if only it. would devote its energies to its proper job. The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) pictured the scene had Yoizuki encountered a cyclone. There was no cyclone in the area into which the ship was sailing; yet the Sydney Sun published under scare head-lines that the vessel was heading into an area in which a cyclone was raging. In the Sydney Morning Herald there was a story that the vessel was in heavy seas. The cyclone was never a meteorological fact; it was merely an editorial fabrication. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), after visiting a cheap picture show, said, that what he saw depicted in the newsreel had made him fee] sick. Nobody in this House believes that the honourable member was made sick by what he saw there. If he was sick, I can tell honoraible members what made him so. He was sickened at the sight of so much cheap labour leaving Australia before he had a. chance to exploit it.",54
129,Mr SPEAKER,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Order ! The honourable member's time has expired. .. Mr ABBOTT (New England) [8.33]. - The speech that we have just heard from the Minister for Information (Mr. Calwell) is one of the most remarkable and also one of the most degrading utterances to which this Parliament has ever listened. It did much to justify the action of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) in moving the adjournment of the House today. The Minister said, for instance, that the Formosans who were placed aboard Yoizuki were responsible for the events leading up to the mutiny that took place at the internment camp at Cowra. He said that they were the most fierce and vindictive section of the .Japanese armies against Australian prisoners of war. Were these the kind of men to put on a ship with innocent women and children, including pregnant women? The Government .stands condemned for its treatment people on this vessel. Until Thursday morning of last week the Government might have pleaded that it was innocent; now it has been proved to be an ""accessory to this vile crime which has besmirched the good name of Australia. Those who are revolted by the action of the Government are not only members of the Opposition in this House but men and women throughout Australia. The people are raising their voices in protest; they are crying out that this wicked thing should not have been done. I shall not endeavour to go over the ground so well covered this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition when he dealt with the statements made in this House last week by the Minister for the Army (Mr. Forde) and the Minister for the Navy (Mr Makin). On Saturday morning there was published in the press of this country a message from General MACArthur which put the Government "" on the spot"". Statements by Ministers last week were to the effect that the conditions under which prisoners of war and internees, as well as the women and children, were herded on Yoizuki were the sole responsibility of the American authorities. . So fearful was General MACArthur of the Government's honesty that he took the remarkable course of not sending his cabled messages to the Australian Government for publication, but to the United States Prisoner of War Information Bureau in Sydney. He realized that he could not take any risks with a Government which had so distorted the truth. The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) said today, and the Minister for the Army repeated his statement, that he knew nothing of the conditions which existed on this ship; but I have before me a cutting from the Sydney Sun which shows that from 12.10 to 4.7 p.m. on the 6th March the Sun sent a continual stream of telegraphic messages to its correspondent, in Canberra asking him to get in. touch with senior Ministers, including "" Doc "" Evatt; the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) was specifically mentioned. Despite their denial, those Ministers knew what was going on. They have played the political game so of the long that they were afraid that the Government might be injured in the sight of the people of Australia if the truth were known, and so they prevaricated in their references to a voyage which might easily have been a voyage of death. This afternoon the Minister for External Territories (Mr. Ward) interjected when the Leader of the Opposition was speaking: "" Bad luck you could not arrange for that cyclone "".",54
130,Mr CATAVELL,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Hear , hear!",55
131,Mr ABBOTT,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"The Minister for Transport, who is an expert in these matters, knows what would have happened if Yoizuhi had encountered a cyclone. In that event, there would have been a heavy death roll.",55
132,Mr MARTENS,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,There was no cyclone.,55
133,Mr ABBOTT,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"That is so. A merciful God saved « the ship and its passengers from tragedy. The vessel passed through the Sydney Heads at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, the 6th March, and was reported to be travelling at 15 knots an hour. That rate of progress has not been challenged. It is a simple mathematical calculation to arrive at 720 knots for the two days from Wednesday to Friday when the Navy Office in Melbourne received the cabled message from General MACArthur that the women and children were to be taken off the ship, and that the vessel itself be ordered into port. The Australian authorities did not order the vessel to proceed to the nearest Australian port. They were so afraid of public opinion , that they allowed it to travel another 1,000 miles on what, according to the Prime Minister, was a ""short voyage to Eabaul"". I would not care if either the Minister for the Army or the Minister for the Navy produced Admiral Sir Louis Hamilton, or even Admiral Horatio Nelson as a witness to prove the contrary, if the vessel was travelling at 15 knots an hour it not have been so far north as the position in which it was stated to be at a certain time. I should like to know why the Prime Minister ordered the vessel to prothoughts ceed to Rabaul. Was it because he could send a committee of inquiry therecommittee in the appointment of which this Parliament had no voice? On Sunto day last the Prime Minister refused allow press reporters to be sent to port of call to report on the state of ship when it arrived. It was interesting to hear the Minister for Information his view of the Australian press to-night. Formosans and Koreans who were He wanted to know how the press knew that Yoizuhi would sail on the 6th March and the time of its departure. He was particularly anxious to know how graphers were there to take photographs of the vessel's departure. Was action in filming the scenes as the vessel departed a crime? Would the Minister assume the role of a dictator and suppress all newspapers? The Government has been accused of fascism. Only by grace of God was the Government preRabaul vented from committing the greatest crime that has ever been perpetrated the history of Australia. The Minister for Information said that the Japanese people should be treated that way. not care a bit for the Japanese, but House, as a Christian House of Parliawas ment, should be prepared to follow Christian standards and act as the MinisAustralian ter for the Navy (Mr Makin ) every Sunday in Adelaide preaches that people should act.

134,Mr MAKIN,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Hindmarsh-Ministe for the Navy, Minister for Munitions, and Minister for A i r c r a ft Production) ['8.40] - The honourable member forT!Jew England (Mr Abbott) is not noted for normal care in language or argument, so I am not surprised that he should make such statements as he has made to-night. Bur I rise because of certain statements by the attended Loader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) in introducing this subject this afternoon. He charged me with lack of good concerned f a it h in statements that I made in this House on Thursday night. On of Formosans and Koreans. could the facts that were available I be'lieve that any reasonable person, in assessing the value of the documents, would have expressed .exactly the same as I did. If , however, it is thought that in the assessment of the a value of the documents there was some misjudgment, I ask honourable members re'alize. that' it was a misjudgment to that any honourable member could have the formed. Let me recite to the House the exactly what was said and exactly what the circumstances were. I told honourable give members, as they will recall, that the 1 despatched on Yoizuhi were prisoners of war and' internees of other than the Australian nation, and that the Australian photonation was their custodian. Having established that fact, I indicated that a their signal had been received by the Flag Officer in Charge in Sydney from the Commiander in Chief of the Allied Forces in Japan that the Japanese destroyer Yoizuhi had departed from Kure on the the 13th February, and was sailing viu to .Sydney to load 94S Formosans and Koreans, that it was to return via"" in Rabaul to Formosa to disembark them, that it required fuel, that it required certain provisions for 1,200 persons for I do twenty days and other provisions for this fourteen days, and that 1 ton of meat to be put on board. That was not an order or instruction issued by the Government, but a directive, or advice, or whatever honourable' gentlemen like to call it , from some one else. We complied. The vessel, loaded as required, set out on its return journey in accordance with the directive. I also indicated that I had received the following intimation from the _ First r Naval Member, Sir Louis Hamilton:Navy's responsibility is to berth the ship and provide gangways for embarkation. In circumstances the officer commanding troops takes charge on board. On this occasion the responsibility was with the Commanding Officer appointed by the Supreme Commander of - the Allied Powers. In the absence of any national authority to .handle this .ship she was by the Australian Sea Transport Organization in the normal manner insofaT as docking arrangements storing and fuelling were - Conditions on board had been accepted by General MACArthur. who nominated yoizuki for the carriage of this number That is the view held by the First Naval Member, a very distinguished man with that newspaperlong experience in the Royal Navy, who . today is the trusted and highest official associated with the administration of Royal Australian Navy. As that view, surely it cannot be held that the Government lacked good faith h i any statements on this matter that Ministers, including myself, have made in this House. The situation that has developed is a disgusting display of political ganda as a prelude to the impending general elections. During the week-end I addressed four meetings at which I was able to gauge the feelings of people, and I am conscious that this display hysteria by which the Opposition is ing to inflame opinion against the Gomatter vernment will find no response from public. On the contrary, my observations convince me that the people's reaction will be the opposite to that sought and that this campaign will bring upon heads of the Opposition and the press storm of indignation. Later in the year when the people will have the opportunity to voice their opinions it will be by honourable gentlemen opposite that Australian people are too intelligent to tricked by such methods. This after to noon the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) full y expressed the fact that many of the statements published in the press about this matter were either gross exagsure, gerations or deliberate untruths. desire to try to make it appear that ship was heading into seas where distress or even death was likely to occur on board is of course another example of the depths that the anti-Labour parties and press will go to in the hope of bringing political discredit upon the Labour party. Why, the vessel, which was 200 or 300 miles from where the cyclone occurred, was ahead of its schedule. It had had an uneventful voyage to Rabaul. It was found that more doctors were on the vessel than was at first thought, and general condition of the repatriates their arrival at Eabaul was satisfactory. The repatriates themselves were more less satisfied with the conditions under which they had travelled. The senior Bed Cross representative in Eabaul, A. Scotford, is reported in this afternoon's Sydney Sun as having said in the course [8] of an interview with a representative of He and his assistant, Mrs Pullar, of South Australia, had been "" agreeably surprised "" at the the general condition of the men, women and is his children off the Yoisiiki . . . When the repatriates arrived in their barges at the wharf they were apparently happy . . . "" I did not expect to find them in as clean a i=tate as they appeared."" . . . However, he was mainly concerned with the general well-being of the men, women and children and he assured Australians that they propawere being looked after according to the dictates of the International Red Gross. \.Extension of time granted.'} The scare and hysteria which honorof able members opposite have endeavoured seek-, to engender in connection with this is not - justified by the facts.. The the naval officer in charge at Eabaul, who was the first officer to board the vessel on its arrival at that port, has assured us of . the well-being of all on board. He said the that a number of repatriates did not a desire to leave the vessel, but preferred to continue their voyage on it in order that, they might return the more quickly realized to their homeland. In view of those the facts, the action of the press in be dramatizing this incident in an endeavour cause alarm reveals to the people of Australia just how far the press of .this country is prepared to go to serve party political ends. But the people will , I am ignore the sinister suggestions in The this pernicious and malicious propathe ganda designed to deceive them. I am confident that the people, as they did at the last' general elections, will, at the forthcoming elections, express their contempt of those tactics on the part of a cheap press, and will re-assert their demand for decency and honour among public men as well as decency of expression in public life which has been sadly Jacking from the language of honourable members opposite in their discussions of the this incident. I was indeed surprisedat on certain action on the part of the Leader of the Opposition today because I expect or him to observe a high standard of conduct. However, he sought to express by gesture derision of my belief in a Mr Supreme Being. The right honourable gentleman may seek to hold up to derision my Christian beliefs, but I make no apology to him, nor to any one else, on that score. He repeated his offence in that respect. I should have thought that a man of his high and distinguished standing would not descend to. that demeanour. Honourable members opposite, by their cheap sneers and contemptible conduct, show that they can do little better than to try to hold up to derision those who endeavour to observe the common decencies of life.",56

137,Mr HARRISON,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"""Wentworth) [9.5]. - Honourable members should clearly understand that I do not intend to advocate the payment of greater AYES. compensation to the persons who, according to the findings of Mr Justice Civile, were unjustifiably detained in March, 1942. My purpose is to plead for justice for these men who were interned unlawf u l ly and without reason, and who were subjected to possibly one of the most humiliating experiences that could ever befall a citizen in war-time. A fte r all, can any adequate compensation be paid to men who have suffered, as these men NOES. have suffered, whose names have been besmirched, whose reputation has been damaged, whose homes have been destroyed, and whose businesses, which took a life-time to build, have disappeared overnight on the whimsy of the Minister for the A r m y (Mr Forde). He made a statement to the House in circumstances which are open to suspicion. He indulged in a hysterical outburst which rocked Australia to its foundations. In my opinion, this is a complete case of Government maladministration in its most heinous form . The Government has shown a complete disregard for the subject-right of citizens, and because of that I propose to say something relating to the internment of these unfortunate men, and to the report of Mr Justice Clyne. Sheehan, T. Perhaps it will be as well if I recall the circumstances of this case, because it will become very clear to honourable members as my argument proceeds that something very sinister is contained in the action of the Government. On the 10th March, 1942, certain members of the Australia First Movement were arrested under section 13 of the National Security Act, and subsequently a ministerial warrant was issued for their detention under regulation 26. In passing, I ask honourable members to note that the extraordinary occurrences which led to the motion for the adjournment of the House to discuss the Yoizuki incident have also taken place in March. Therefore, I say to this Government, "" beware the Ides of M a r c h "" , because it seems to me that March is an ill-fated month for this Administration. The members of the Australia First Movement were arrested under section 13 of the National 'Security Act, which reads(1.) Any person who is found committing an offence against this Act, or who is suspected of having committed, or of being about to commit, such an offence, may be arrested without warrant by any constable or Commonwealth officer acting in the course of his duty as such, or by any person thereto authorized by the Minister, ""in the same manner as a person who is found committing a breach of the peace may, at common law, be arrested by any constable or person. (2.) If a person suspected of having committed, or of being about to commit, an offence against thia Act, is arrested under the .provisions of this section, a report of the fact and circumstances shall forthwith .be made to the Attorney-General or to a person appointed in that behalf by the Attorney-General, and(a.) if no charge is laid against the suspected person within ten days from the date of his arrest, he shall be released from detention; I ask the House to take particular notice of that. Paragraph b readsIf a charge is laid against the suspected person, he shall be dealt with according to law. Subsequent inquiry revealed that M i l it a r y Intelligence offered no evidence whatever to show, first, that these members of the Australia First Movement were found committing an offence. Secondly, they were not suspected of having committed or of ""being about to commit an offence against Australia. Indeed, those responsible for the arrests stated that action was taken purely to break up the movement, and was not levelled against any particular individual. Thirdly, no charge was laid against the sixteen men within the period of ten days as prescribed in section 13 of the act. Yet that section was designed by this Parliament to prevent such an occurrence as this ""within our democracy. Furthermore, the members of the Australia First Movement were not released at the expiration of ten days. ""Why was no charge made against these men? That is a pertinent question. I suggest that between the time of their arrest under section 13, and their subsequent detention under regulation 26, the Minister realized his error. Finding that he could not charge them, he detained them under regulation 26. If that is what happened, his action was one of the most cowardly ever attempted by any Minister of the Commonwealth. I ask the House to note one or two very important points. First, I again draw attention to sub-section 2 of section 13, which statesIf a person, suspected of having committed, or of being about to commit, an offence against this Act, is arrested under the provisions of this section, a report of the fact and circumstances shall forthwith be made to the Attorney-General or to a person appointed in that behalf by. the Attorney-General . . . It so happened that we had an Acting Attorney-General about the time in question, namely, the 25th March. Fifteen clays after the arrest of these individuals - that is five days beyond the ten days allowed for action to be taken-the right honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . Beasley), then Acting Attorney-General, in reply to a question by the former honourable member for Bourke, the late Mr Blackburn, said he had no knowledge of the matter, but would call for the relevant file, read the reports, and see what action the Government was prepared' to take. These circumstances are strange enough in all sooth, but they pale into insignificance when compared, with the hysterical outburst of the Minister for the Army on the 26th March - sixtee n days after the arrests. Honourable members will recall how that right honourable gentleman entered this chamber. and made a statement which rocked this country as it has never been rocked before in its political history. The House, and the country had every reason to accept what the right honourable member said as an honest statement made by a responsible Minister. He said that the fullest possible investigation had been carried out by him, and no doubt remained in his mind as to the guilt of the individuals who had been arrested. In the light of the report of Mr Justice Glyne, it is evident that had even the most superficial inquiry been made during the fifteen days in which the Minister had to investigate the matter, it would have revealed that the happenings in Western Australiahonorable members will remember that it was the activities of the Australia First Movement in Western Australia that led to arrests in the eastern States-were of no importance whatever to the security of this country. Indeed, it is clear from Mr Justice Clyne's report that the utterances attributed to the Western Australian members of the movement were the gabblings of three or four imbecile windbags who had not the means even to stop a tram or k ill a rabbit; yet sixteen men were arrested and thrown into prison. At the expiration of fifteen days-fiv e days longer than is permitted under the section of the act to which I-have referred - n o charge had been levelled against them, and. the Minister threw them into detention for a period of something like five and a half months. I shall quote Mr . Justice Clyne's report on this matter. On pages 8 and 9 he says The persons arrested in Western Australia were charged with conspiracy to assist the Japanese and on this charge the jury found democracy. Bullock and Williams guilty and acquitted Quicke and Krakouer. Bullock and Williams were sentenced to imprisonment for three -\rnrs and two years, respectively, and'at the expiration of their sentences they were detained. Two or three years imprisonment for the dastardly crime that the Minister attributed not only to these men, but also sixteen others! Had the crime been so serious as was alleged, a much heavier penalty was called for. Charges of such moment, and even of less moment had the y been bona fide would have brought the death penalty in England. The report also statesOn the whole of the evidence it is difficult to resist the conclusion, however strange it Mr Harrison. may seem, that they were planning to assist the Japanese who were threatening to invade Australia. It was suggested that these four persons were the victims of the investigator, Thomas, and that what they had proposed was not intended to be serious, but was more or less of a joke. I am prepared to believe that Thomas was not a passive investigator, but on the whole of the evidence it is reasonable to conclude that their designs, however fantastic and extravagant, were seriously intended and that there was every reason for their detention. I ask the'House to note His Honour's observation- "" I am prepared to believe that Thomas was not a passive investigator "". The facts arc that on the 12th March, two days after the arrests were effected, M i l it a r y Intelligence knew that there was no connection whatever between the Western Australian'and Sydney movements. Therefore, the Minister too must have known that. This knowledge came into the possession of the Militar y Intelligence authorities upon the interception of a letter from Perth asking for affiliation. In addition, Detective Sergeant Richards of Perth who was in charge of the Security investigation stated in a report dated the 20th March that there was no connection whatever between the organizations in Western Australia and Sydney; yet on the 26th March the Minister for the Army in this House, linked the sixteen internees with "" treasonable conspiracy"" and interned tlhem. One can imagine that happening in Fascist countries, but it is unbelievable that it should happen in a At the inquiry, Colonel Mosely, Sergeant Richards, and this in former Thomas all swore that there was no connection between the activities at Sydney and those in Western Australia, s as did - the four Perth members themselves. The action subsequently taken by the Minister was based on a letter dated the 13th March, from Captain Blood, requesting the internment of these individuals under regulation 26. I ask the House to note that Captain Blood did not suggest that a charge should be laid under section 13 of the act. He knew that he had to lay a charge against the individuals who had been arrested or release them, yet he detained them for five days longer than the prescribed period, and then asked the Minister to intern them under regulation 26 without any charge being made. This letter should be the subject of a special inquiry. Et reeks with inaccuracies which must have prejudiced the Minister, and the Minister must take full responsibility for acting without satisfying. himself that the facts were as stated. The result of the Minister's action was, that these sixteen men were interned and held for three and a half months without a charge being levelled against them. That must give honourable members food for serious thought. These men were arrested on the flimsiest pretext, were thrown into prison, and subsequently were detained under ministerial warrant. Notwithstanding that there were in existence appeal committees which would' have . listened to their appeals, they were held for three and a half months without a charge being levelled against them. Indeed, no charge has been levelled against them up to the present time. They were callously turned loose some five and a half months later, with the stigma of treason and traitorous conduct still fresh upon them. I ask the House to compare that action with the proceedings taken in respect of Ratliff and Thomas, against whom there was. a mass of proved evidence. Those two men were interned in June, 1941, and appeared before the Advisory Committee on the 19th July of that year. No time was wasted by the Government, which then was composed of men who now sit on this side of the House. The Labour Government assumed office on the 6th October. Cabinet considered, the case of these Communists on the 9th October, and released them on the 21st October. Compare that rapid action on behalf of the comrades of this Government, with the delay of five and a half months in respect of men. who were arrested on the flimsiest pretext. The Perth cases were commenced on the 7th May, and the men were committed for trial in June. The hearing was in open court, and not according to the star chamber methods indulged in by the appeal committees. The verdict was given on the 23rd July, which was prior to the first hearing of the case against the Sydney men, eight of whom Mr Justice Clyne said should never have' been detained, and a number of whom were not even members of. the Australia First Movement. On the 17th July, the Sydney Morning Herald reported the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) as having said, relative to Ratliff and ThomasThe men were detained on the fiat of the Minister. They are not charged with any offence; they are not entitled to an open trial they hare no right to confront witnesses called, r against them. The so-called Appeal Tribunal has the right to hear witnesses behind their' backs. In all these respects the ordinary course of justice is completely forgotten. How true that is! I ask the Attorney General, who put up such a defence on behalf of Ratliff and Thomas, what he did to ensure that these other men would be given a trial equally as effective and speedy as that conceded to these Communists. A statement of that nature does not absolve the Government. Its action wa3 taken on the flimsiest evidence. The inquiry by Mr Justice Clyne was opened two years and three months after the original' action was taken, and another year and three months was required to complete it. This of itself must give rise to the gravest suspicion throughout' the country that the delay was deliberately engineered by the Government in the hope that the whole sorry episode would be - forgotten. These men carried the stigma for three and a half years. Delay is of the very essence of refined cruelty, and can be attributed only to the guilty conscience of the Minister, who helped to postpone the trial of these unfortunate men. The evidence disclosed that three of the sixteen men arrested did not belong to the Australia First Movement, and according to Mr Justice Clyne, eight of them should never have been detained. At page 10 of his report, referring' to Clarence Crowley, His Honour said1 considered his evidence was in substance reliable. 1 believe that he was a loyal subject, and the evidence called on his behalf confirms this belief. . . . I repeat with respect and approval the opinion of the Advisory Committee that Crowley had no real active interest in the Movement: that he had been really gathered into it and had done nothing to forward it in any shape or form, and .that he would not be guilty of any subversive act. In my opinion the recommendation for his detention was not .justified. In regard to Harley Matthews, His Honour saidMatthews served with some distinction in the last war, and was, as he claimed and I believe, a loyal subject of the King. Intelligence officers, in my opinion, _ committed a grave blunder in procuring his arrest, and in recommending his detention. In regard to M a r t in Francis Watts, His Honour saidCaptain Blood said he thought that the mere fact that Watts had an executive office in the Australia First Movement was in itself sufficient to warrant his detention, but I am unable to accept this opinion in respect of Watts. There was nothing in the evidence relating to Watts to justify the conclusion that he was acting in a manner prejudicial to Australia and her war effort, and I believe he was at all times a loyal subject of the King. At page 19 His Honour saidBut as I am entitled to report upon all matters arising out of this inquiry, which my opinion should be dealt with or reported upon by me, I think it proper to add that Army authorities were not justified in mending the detention of the following persons, namely:Keith Percival Bath. Clarence Crowley. Sydney Benjamin Hooper. Edward Cory de la Roche Masey. Harley Matthews. Cecil Walter Salier. Walter Frederick Tinker-Giles. Martin Francis Watts. In the - three and a half years elapsed before that inquiry was held, lives of these men had been blasted. They had lost the whole .of possessions. The loved ones of some of for that? them had died while their names had not been cleared. Some of them even members of the movement.' were arrested on the flimsiest were detained, and were even refused trial, no charge being levelled them. They were thrown into durance vile. Anybody who had said that it was his name still besmirched. possible for such a thing to happen Australia would have been classed as fit for & mental asylum. But this happen in Australia, at the whim of Minister who was stampeded by a false report, and must accept the responsibility for what was done. What answer has the Minister to the report of Mr. Clyne? Let us consider how this stupid, criminally irresponsible Minister affected these men. three cases as typical of all-those Mr Harrison. Matthews, Bath and Watts, two of whom were ex-servicemen of Worild War I . and proved their loyalty by blood sacrifice while some of the members of this Government were under suspicion; - indeed, some of them were put in gaol during that war. Harley Matthews was never a member of the movement. Mr Justice Clyne has stated that definitely in his report. In 1915, he served with distinction in World War I . Epstein had taken him as a model of the spirit of ANZAC. He was living with his mother, who was 74 years of age. At 2 a.m. on the 10th March he was seized and thrown into internment on as base a charge as could be conceived, and was subjected to an interrogation unequalled in any other democracy in the world. He was never brought to trial, in and was released six months after his arrest. The result was that he lost the everything that he possessed. Not only recomwas his name defamed, but his mother, 74 years of age, died in Adelaide when her son's reputation was still besmirched. He was only allowed to attend her funeral under guard. If honourable members can support action of that kind against a man who on inquiry was proved to be innocent of the charges levelled against him, it is an everlasting blot on the which escutcheon of Australia. Those wrongs thecannot be redressed by the granting of completely the paltry sum of £700. Can he buy back their his good name and his mother's memory Take the case of another ex-soldier were not of the 1914-18 war named Watts, They who served with distinction and was pretext, awarded the M i l it a r y Medal. He had war a injuries for which a grateful country against paid him a pension, but he died two years and four months after his arrest, with He died in with the knowledge that he was considered by his fellow men to be a traitor did to the country which he had shed his a blood in preserving. The irony of the whole thing! Will his widow be gratef u l to the Government to know that, when its action had materially contriJustice buted to her husband's death, it had given her a paltry £400 in an attempt to buy action of the back his honour? I take, I draw attention to a paragraph from of a letter sentto me some time ago by an ex-serviceman named B at h , who, accordi n g to Mr Justice Clyne, was not disl o y a l but was w r o n g l y detained. w r it e r statesI n effect this means: "" B a d luck Mr Bath, we are sorry for all that has happened to you; we imprisoned you for nearly six months without interrogation, charge or t r i a l ; branded you a traitor to your country in the National Parliament, held you up to execration in the press throughout Australia and denied you the opportunity of defending yourself. We realise the implications of all this; your business, built up over a period of twenty years was smashed beyond repair, your home lost, the position, education and future prospects of your family jeopardized, your health seriously affected, and your standing in the community so damaged that you were regarded as a pariah amongst your fellows when we released you without reason. What we did caused your whole material and economic edifice to crash like a pack of cards. To show that we bear you no ill will we now generously offer you the sum of Five hundred pounds, which should help to pay some of the expenses"". . . . I am not concerned with some of the c r it i c is m that m a y have been uttered r e g a r d i ng the Australia F i r s t Movement, because honourable members opposite also make s i m i l a r statements. Minister for Commerce and A g r i c u l t u r e (Mr S c u l l y ) , speaking on the National Register Bill on the 6th June, 1939, said I am alarmed at the uncalled-for utterances of many supporters of the Government when referring to the Japanese nation and people. From the standpoint of our primary production Australia owes a great deal to Japan. 1 represent a rural constituency, noted for its wool, and 1 know what the Japanese market has meant to the wool-growers and other primary producers of this country. Hundreds of thousands of pounds - has been lost to Australia by the trade diversion policy of a former administration. There is no indication that Japan plans any attack on Australia. That was evidenced by the utterances of the recently appointed Consul-General for that country. On the contrary, there is ample evidence that its people wish to have friendly intercourse with us. Australia, as a primary-producing nation, desires reciprocal trade with Japan. I deplore that responsible men in this Parliament, particularly supporters of the Government, should say anything which might give offence to nations which desire to be friendly, it should be the aim of every honourable member to advance the cause of peace, and to that end he should realise that it is his duty to refrain from provocative utterances. For less provocative statements than that, members of the Australia First Movement have been interned, losing their liberty and their good name for a period of three and a half years.. The There is a curious Communist atmosphere surrounding the whole of this matter. It will be remembered that Communist interference was associated with every meeting of the Australia First Movement, even to the extent of the bashing that took place at the famous Adyar Hall meeting. Mr Thornton set' out the Communist attitude in the annual report of his union. That statement was issued when Australia was in great danger, when Japanese submarines were in the Sydney harbour and when Sydney had been shelled. Mr Thornton brackets the Australian Labour party with the Australia First Movement and says they are the same thing. The Communist policy at that time was the establishment of a second front in Europe in order to save Russia, and was opposed to the recall of the Australian Imperial - Force. At that time Mr Thornton saidWhat do some people in the Labour movement say? They say Australia has to look after herself, first. That is just pandering to the most backward section of Australian life, The present and it is no accident that some people in the Labour movement say "" P u t Australia F i r s t ' ' . This is the attitude of the Fascist Stevenson gang who call themselves the Australia First Movement. It is the same thing. The Communists had the same policy as the Labour Government. The organized gangs were led by Alexander, the secretary of Actors Equity, who admitted that he was a Communist and an informer to the Security Branch in the Australia First ease. On the 21st November, 1941, the Communist paper, Progress, reported a "" war rally "" at the Sydney Town Hall, in which an attack was made on the Australia First Movement. On the fourth page, that journal called for the trial of certain persons connected with the movement - It is also significant that this paragraph was publishedThe Federal Attorney-General has called for a report of the proceedings. It will be 'noted that at this stage the Communists were aware of what the Attorney-General was doing in his own department with regard to the case. Perhaps that is not strange when we consider the opinion of the Minister's private secretary, who, on the 21st September, 104.1, wrote to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain ) as follows:It is to Russia that the people look for a practical example of what can be accomplished under a system differing from ours. better way could the Government show their sincerity than to implement social legislation now using Russian principles? [Extension of time granted.""] I ask honourable members to compare that statement with the statement of Thornton, - published in the annual report a few months later, in which this important passage occurredWith the methods of the Soviet Union applied to Australia. I am quite satisfied that this country could not be equalled by any country throughout the WOTW. Honourable members may draw their own conclusions from the similarity of those two statements, the one issued by the Attorney-General's Department, - and the other by Mr Thornton. At a further meeting of the Australia First Movement neither the police nor the Security Branch took action. Only the Communists took action in the famous Adyar H all incident of - the 19th February. Certain action was taken by the Security Branch in Western Australia. Strangely enough, they appointed a man named Thomas, a Communist, as-a pimp or spy. Speaking of him, the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) said on the 2nd September, 1942The crown witness in Western Australia was a "" great "" character. He ought to have been in gaol himself. Yet this was the man whose evidence was accepted by the Government, the man upon whose word it took Thomas's job was to make contact with Bullock, a former Communist. Bullock was typical of the Communists-he would join anything and shout for Thomas represented himself as a man named Hardt, who representedthe Australia First Movement in eastern Australia - Up to this stage there was no evidence that Bullock was plotting anything, yet within a fortnight'of Thomas he and three companions evolved a conspiracy which was not backed by any means to carry it out. It is almost unbelievable that any government be prepared to act on the unsupported evidence of this £5 a week pimp, when it Mr Harrison. could have used the services of people of repute to join the council of Bullock. Nevertheless, the Government preferred to rely on the evidence of this Communist pimp, and sixteen persons lost their What liberty. At the suggestion of Thomas, a letter - was sent by Bullock to Sydney asking for affiliation. Security was informed by Thomas of the despatch of the letter, which was 'intercepted, and eighteen persons were arrested. Why did not the Security Branch wait until the letter had 'been received by the Australia First Movement in Sydney, and until it was able to learn how t i e people there received the proposal? Of course, that would not have suited the Communists. If the Australia First Movement had turned down the proposal no arrests would have been possible. Therefore, the letter was intercepted without waiting to see what would happen, and eighteen persons, were arrested. It is evident that - some one in the east was out to get the' Australia First Movement. According to the evidence of Sergeant Richards, Thomas was sent to make contact with Bullock. Obviously no conspiracy was possible without Thomas. At any stage Thomas could have smashed the conspiracy with a single word, - but he took no action. Another curious fact is associated with an article published by M . Fitzpatrick in Smith's Weekly of the 13th June, 1942, and which was sent to .the Civil Liberties League of Melbourne, in which jeering reference was made toSixteen native-born persons plucked from Sydney homes and offices last March and action. interned. The Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) is, I understand, vice-president of the anything. Civil Liberties League, and is no doubt the agent in this Parliament for Ratliff and .others. Another curious fact is to be noted. The Minister had, curiously enough, met the trade union conference just prior to the beginning of the last meeting stage in the action when steps had been taken to associate Thomas with Bullock in Western Australia. He had then made his infamous attack^ on certain should members of the Opposition as "" g u i l t y men who put Australia last"". Some interesting information might have been obtained if we could have got him into the witness box.",58
138,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"He would have pleaded privilege. Mr HARRISON"" - Of course he would. However, the arrests were made, and some of those arrested were not even members of the organization. Let me mention two of them. Matthews was not a member, but he was a contributor to the Bulletin. The Communists had been trying to establish a connection between the Bulletin and subversive action. Regarding Bath, it is curious to learn that he was described by the Communists in the Domain after his arrest as secretary of the election committee of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender). Indeed, Wharfie, the official organ of the Communist-controlled Wharf Labourers Federation, published this statement on the 2nd August, 1942'Spender is definitely known to be implicated with the spying, wrecking Australia First Movement. According to Ratliff and Thomas, Spender was responsible, and that was enough for the Communists. Let me sum up the curious sequence of actions that resulted in the blasting of the lives of a number of innocent men, and not only brought on them untold misery and disgrace, but also indelibly blotted the good name of Australia for all time. It is a matter for comment that the Communist party knows what goes on in the Attorney-General's Department, and honourable members can draw their own conclusions from that. I ask honourable members to notice Blain's letter. At a convenient time, while the Attorney General's Department was still in charge of the Security Branch, a spy was brought into contact with an exCommunist in Western Australia whose character was known to them. Out of that meeting there grew a conspiracy exactly on the lines which the Communists in Sydney desired, and which implicated the Australia First. Movement. At ameeting in Western Australia, at which only four persons were present, it was agreed in the presence of the pimp. Thomas, the Communist, that the group should apply by letter for affiliation with the Australia First Movement in Sydney. This letter was seized upon by the Security Branch as a pretext for arresting a number of persons in Sydney, some of whom were not members of the Australia First Movement. On the 6th March, Dr Evatt gave his last answer on the Australia First question before he left for the United States of America. Then the Army took over control of the Security Branch, and members of the Australia First Movement were arrested on the 19th March. On the 25th March, the Acting Attorney General knew nothing of the matter, but somebody in the Attorney General's Department must have known about it. Next day, the Minister for the Army made his curiously alarming statement in which he made charges unsupported by evidence. Later, Mr Justice Clyne found that there was no contact between the persons in Western Australia and the eastern States who had been arrested. Rigorous censorship clamped down on the press so that no one could defend these men. Although no names have been mentioned in this House, the Communist newspaper. was able to publish a full list of the names of the persons charged. There is some contact between the Communists and either the Attorney-General's Department or the Department of the Army. No action has been taken against the Communist newspaper that published the names. I should like to know'""who drafted the Ministers' statement in regard to this matter.",65
139,Mr FORDE,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,It was drafted by Military Intelligence officers.,65
140,Mr HARRISON,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"I should also like to know who gave the names to the Communists for publication in their newspaper despite an edict, of this Parliament.",65
141,Mr FORDE,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,I did not.,65
142,Mr HARRISON,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"The Minister for the Army is quick to give the answer to one question, but he is reticent regarding the other. I leave the whole sorry mess there. In hi.? report Mr Justice Clyne said that these people were doing nothing for the war effort. Surely, Matthews and Watts had secured immunity by reason of their wounds and their general condition of health. Watts served as a guard in .a munitions factory and had previously been a volunteer instructor in the Militia. Hooper had invested in the war loan a few days before internment, and contributed £25 towards the HMAS. Sydney fund. On the day that he was arrested Bath had an appointment to volunteer for the Royal Australian Air Force. Cahill and Dow'ne fought as members of the Australian Imperial Force and their pay continued during the whole period of their intern-, ment. Downe Gould not be present at thelater stages of the inquiry, as he was fighting at Bougainville. It is strange to find an Australian who fought at Bougainville arrested as a traitor. It is true that subsequently he was released. One of the Crowleys had offered his car free to the Army, and his son was serving with the forces. His wife was a nurse in the war of 1914-18. Masey was engaged full time in a large surgical instrument plant. One feature that needs emphasizing is the violence of the Communists in the campaign. The chairman of the meeting of. the 19th February was brutally assaulted. During the inquiry before Mr Justice Clyne two counsel were warned to keep out of the case if they valued their own safety. Bath was waylaid and assaulted and Cahill appeared in the court showing evidence of maltreatment. These, are things which call for an inquiry. Some ministers would no doubt indulge in "" basher"" tactics if they could get away with it, this is a free country in which the rights of individuals must be respected. Ministers should give a full explanation to the House and the country.",65
143,Mr FORDE,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"Capricornia-Minister for the Army) [9.55] - This is an important question which should be considered quietly and without resort to such extravagent statements as have fallen from the lips of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison). This is a matter that should be dealt with on a high plane and should not be the subject o. - anting party political propaganda. tHonorable members will realise that the detention of twenty members of the Australia First Movement took place at a time when a Japanese invasion seemed imminent, and also that some members of the organization were found guilty of conspiracy against their own country. The honourable member for Wentworth read certain extracts which suited his case, but I remind him that although some suspected persons were afterwards declared to be honest, others were found guilty. It is well to remember that a state of national emergency existed when these men were taken into custody; the enemy was advancing towards Australia and the fate of the nation was at stake. It was not a time for a "" wait-and-see "" policy. In military circles it was thought that the enemy would land in Australia at any moment, and it was deemed a wise precaution not to have fre"" in our midst persons suspected of being capable of stabbing our fighting men in the back. The problem of detaining persons who, rightly or wrongly, were suspected of being a potential danger to the nation was not peculiar to Australia, but was common to all the Allied nations in a war in which "" fifth-column "" activities had reached an unprecedented standard of. ingenuity. War imposes heavy responsibilities on those with whom decisions rest in a time of national peril and the necessity for immediate action may well preclude that careful investigation which in normal times would precede arrest. It is to be regretted that in the exercise of emergency powers, the necessity for which could not be questioned by any reasonable citizen, innocent persons but were occasionally thought to be guilty, but it would be unreasonable to expect that war-time powers will always be-exercised with perfect justice and christian charity. War calls for swift action first and consideration later. When England was threatened with invasion the British Government took into custody over 3,000 suspected persons over night and shipped them to Australia with a request that they be held in internment camps here. During the next two years careful investigation revealed that the majority of those internees were harmless, and, accordingly they were returned to Britain. On that occasion swift action was taken by the British Government; the investigation followed later. It may be said that many of those people were innocent, but the nation was in danger and the British Government could not afford to take any risks. Had I , as Minister for the Army, refused to act ou the definite recommendation of the Chief, of the General Staff and give my approval to detain these men after having received from the military intelligence officers advice that they should he arrested, what would have been my position had the Japanese in vaded Australia and "" fifth column"" activity had undermined the safety of the country? Failure to have acted on the recommendations of the military authorities would have been inexcusable, and there have been clamour demanding that I be drummed out of the Parliament. I quote from Mr Justice Clyne's reportHaving received the messages from Western Australia, the Army Intelligence authorities were, I think, justified in arresting the persons who were in fact arrested, hut they should have acted with a little more caution in making recommendations that all the persons arrested should be detained. The honourable member for Wentworth quoted portions of Mr Justice Clyne's report. He did not, however, quote the following comment on my approval of the recommendation by the military authorities that twenty members of the Australia First Movement be arrested. Mr Justice Clyne's comment wasI can see no sufficient reason which would justify the Minister in not accepting the recommendation. So, in the opinion of the Commissioner, I , as Minister for the Army, was justified in accepting the recommendations that were made to me. It is, I suggest, quite unprofitable to criticize action taken in 1942 in the light of the fuller knowledge ^available after inquiry in 1945. The circumstances are totally different. It should be remembered, moreover, that public uneasiness in 1942 was manifested by a feeling not that there were too many people under restraint, but rather that there were too few. His Honour has pointed out that all the persons detained weregiven a proper opportunity of appealing against their internment in accordance with the National Security Regulations. honourable member for Wentworth made no mention at all of that. His Honour also pointed out that not only were they given such an . opportunity, but also special committees were formed to reconsider the cases of some of the persons detained. Although some of the detainees complained of the methods adopted by the tribunal in hearing the appeals, to use the judge's words againThere is no evidence that their cases were not fairly and justly considered. As honourable members are aware, the Minister went further than this and set up the inquiry conducted by Mr Justice Clyne, thus providing further means for establishing the facts of each case. In his report, His Honour recommends that would the personswrongly detained are entitled to a public declaration that they were in fact wrongly detained and were not disloyal, and such a declaration should afford them some measure of redress This recommendation applies to the undermentioned eight persons out of the total of twenty persons who were detained. . . . The Government accepted the Commissioner's recommendations and in Parliament, on the 5th October, 1945, on behalf of the Government, and in accordance with the finding of the Commissioner, I declared that Messrs. K . P. Bath, Clarence Crowley, S. B . Hooper, E. C. de la Roche Masey, Harley Matthews, C. W . Salier, W. F . Tinker Giles and Martin F . Watts were in fact wrongly detained and were not disloyal. I am assured that the Commissioner's recommendations have now been full y implemented. It is well to bear in mind, however, that although Mr Justice Clyne found that eight out of twenty of the persons detained were wrongly detained and not disloyal, in reference to their association with the Australia First Movement, he saidelaborate I think it can be. answered in one sense correctly by saying that the detention of these persons was justified as it was in fact recommended by the Army authorities. In view of this recommendation by the Army for Ministerial warrants under regulation 26, I can see no sufficient reason which would justify the Minister in not accepting the recommendation. The honourable member for .Wentworth was not fair when he quoted certain passages from Mr Justice Clyne's - report, hut omitted to quote the passage stating The that in His Honour's opinion there was not sufficient reason to justify me as Minister in not accepting the recommendations of M i l it a r y .Intelligence. In time of war injustices to some persons are inevitable. Thousands of people of Ge ravan or Italian parentage were picked up by the authorities during the war. Many of them were later proved not to bo disloyal and dangerous.",66
144,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,Does Minister think that restitution should be made - when injustice has been proved to have been done?,68
145,Mr FORDE,EORMOSAN EX PRISONERS OE,"If the honourable member had been listening, he would have heard me say that the Government was fair enough to appoint Mr Justice Clyne to consider the cases of the interned members of the Australia First Movement. He made certain recommendations in regard to eight out of the twenty persons concerned. The other twelve, he said, were rightly detained. Those recommendations have been carried out by the Government. That privilege was not extended to any other persons who had been interned. In time of war drastic action has to be taken, and taken immediately - ROYA L In no circumstances would I wittingl y do an injustice to any man in the Community, but when the safety of this nation was at stake, when it was thought that the enemy would land on our shores at any moment, that"" our men would be fighting to drive them out and when there was sufficient reason to justify Militar y Intelligence in recommending swift arrests of people suspected of disloyalty, for a Minister to have said "" No, he is a friend of mine, or is related to a friend of mine and that must not be done"" and something subversive happened as a consequence, that Minister - jwould never be forgiven. He would have been recreant to the trust imposed in him. , . I . feel sorry for any person wrongly - detained. I know that people, probably foolishly or ignorantly, sometimes become members of associations, without knowing their real aims and objects. They are misled by others. While one can have great 'sympathy with them, I , as Minister, had to approve the action taken by responsible officers of the Army. The Ministry has carried out the recommendations made 'by Mr Justice Clyne. Nothing more can be done. It is unfortunate that certain people have suffered. Wars are cruel and bring hardship and misery to all kinds of people. In all countries engaged in war, when swift action has to be taken, mistakes sometimes occur, but the safety of the nation must be paramount. I believe that the M i l it a r y Intelligence officers who investigated the Australia First Movement were actuated the by a desire to do the right thing by Australia. Of the' twenty members of the movement who were interned, Mr Justice Clyne found that eight had been wrongly detained and should have some redress. He recommended the payment of certain amounts of compensation. I am assured that those payments have been made and that all the Commissioner's recommendations have been carried out by the Government. Debate (on motion by Mr ARCH IE CAMERON ) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. WOMEN'S CHRISTIAN TEMPERANCE UNIO N HOSTEL AT WOODVILLE - DARWIN : COM NA AUSTRALIAN NAVY : DISCHARGES. Motion (by Mr Forde) proposedv That the House do now adjourn.",68
146,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,PULSORY ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY,"Barker) f 10.9*] - I have two matters to raise, both of which I intended to mention at question time, but the adjournment motion gives me the opportunity of saying now more than I could have said then. Frankly, I do not know under whose administration the first comes, so I address my remarks to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr . Forde). I have a letter, which I am not going to read, because I might be asked to table it , fro m a gentleman fair l y close to the Government, in which he tells me that at Woodville, in South-Australia, in the electorate of the Minister for the Navy (Mr M a k in ), at one stage, the Government erected a hostel for the use of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the purposes of that hostel being that women engaged in munitions production in that area might have reasonably good board and lodging in the Woodville district. Some time afterwards the scope of the association's activities was widened to accommodate working girls who were employed in factories other than those engaged strictly on the production of munitions. I am told that later the Government- I am not sure which Minister is. responsible-decide d that any g i r l who ceased to be employed in a munitions factory, notwithstanding that she might obtain other employment in the same district and be willing to for her accommodation, must vacate hostel. I should like the right honourable gentleman to fossick out which of the pecket-handkerchief "" noble nineteen "" is responsible for decision, and in due course to let whether it will be possible for the Governdifference ment to take a more reasonable stand in this matter. The second matter concerns the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde). I have had considerable correspondence with him on the subject. It concerns the Northern Territory. I have not yet handed over to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain), .^iiice his return from a Japanese prisom-v of war camp, affairs to which I have been attending on his behalf. I have not previously raised this matter in public. It is the case of a resident of Darwin who did not leave the Territory. As he puts it in a letter to me he was "" not one of those who cleared out"". It is not necesthe sary for him to have a permit to re-enter the Territory, because he did not leave the Territory. He owned a war service Minister home at Darwin which the Minister-for the Army rented to the Shell Company of Australia Limited. My correreferred. spondent now informs me that in respect of the occupancy of the home by the Department of the Army, the Army present. authorities have paid half of the charges due to the War Service Homes Commi - sion, whilst this man is now being billed for the other half of the dues in respect of the whole of the period dating from the time the Army authorities took over the home. Surely, if the Governfrom ment believes that it is worthwhile commandeer a .man's residence in Darwin the least it can do is to pay the dues that would have to be paid to the War Service Homes Commission instead of paying half of them and allowing the original occupant to be billed with other half. In addition to being a soldier of the war of 1914-18, this man has sons at present on active service. Quite recently, his wife wanted to return Darwin, but she has been told bluntly that if she returns she will not plied with rations. For how much longer shall . we have to suffer under a system which denies to people the right to return to their place of livelihood? In pay certain European countries people are the being moved about in hundreds and thousands. Darwin is but the size of a when compared that with the whole of Australia. Its total me know population would not make much to the Minister's majority in his electorate of Capricornia. . No officer in the Army can convince me that the .Ttate of affairs in Darwin is such that old residents cannot be allowed to return there, or that people who did not leave the Territory during the war period should be pestered with requests as to why they <J'o not possess permits to enter the Territory. I understood that the system of permits was abolished some time ago. For all the good it was, it should never have been put into operation. One gentleman who told me he had been turned out has explained to me how he got back. The system is so good that I still possess the permit I obtained in order to enter Territory, although permits are supposed to be collected from holders before they leave the Territory. I "" ask the to look carefully into the ^natters which I have raised. To-morrow, I shall band to him the letter to which I have I shall not read it now because it contains statements which I do not deem it advisable to read to the House at In due course I may be able to refer to the other matters mentioned.",68
147,Mr WHITE,PULSORY ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY,"Balaclava) [10.15] - I raise .a matter which concerns the administration of the Minister for the Navy (Mr Makin). A man can secure release the Army if he has served five to years; but this provision has not been applied to members of the naval forces. When a young signalman, the'son of an Air Force officer, applied forrelease in order that he might return to his employment, he was refused permission and is the being retained in the Navy under manpower regulations. This man was called two up a week before the outbreak of war. He has spent his twenty-first to his to twenty-seventh birthday in the Navy in sea-going service, but because he is a besupsingle man he has not enough points under the points system to qualify for release. Had he been a stay-at-heme, or been engaged on a shore job, or at headquarters, and been married, he would have been discharged long ago; but because he is a single man he cannot secure his release. Surely, the man-power provisions should not apply at this stage of the peace. In any case, the provisions applying to releases from the Arm y should apply to releases from the Navy also. If the Government were calling up draftees as replacements, all of these men could be released and would be enabled to rehabilitate themselves. If the Government delays further in such matters, these men will become problem cases so far as rehabilitation is concerned. Although this' man's employers have held his job open for him for over six years, they, no doubt, will soon want to reshuffle their staff. . In any case the man will suffer in respect of seniority. I urge the Minister for the Navy to give careful consideration to this matter,. I understand that the' young man intends to visit Canberra to put his claims before the Minister.",69

A large number of inquiries is being received for all classes of assistance under the War Service Homes Act and the first step to be taken in connection therewith is the comof a form of application in order that applicant's eligibility may be determined and the details of the proposal investigated.

When . will effect be given, in their entirety, to the recommendations of the - Commissioner (Mr Justice Reed) inquired into the administration of the Grovely Detention Camp? 2. Has effect been given to the recommendation of the Commissioner regarding revoking the sentence of discharge with ignominy, imposed by the Army authorities on Private Wilson, Private Derrick and Sapper Chalmers, so as to give them the rights and privileges of other discharged soldiers?",74
170,Mr FORDE,PULSORY ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY,"The answers to the honourable members questions are as follows :1. As a result of the investigation by His Honour Mr Justice Reed, he recommended in an interim report dated the 7th March, 1945, that the sentences on Privates Wilson and Derrick and Sapper Chalmers should not stand, and that a proper sentence in each case would be imprisonment with hard labour for two years. Immediate effect was given to this recommendation. In a further report (C) (0)' dated the 20th April, 1945, Mr Justice Reed Numbers made the recommendation that, in addition to Numbers beinu; paid the remissions already granted, the sentences Discharged .Re-employ- imposed by general courts-martial should be February, ment Per23rd Allowance, centage ft').' mitigated by erasing therefrom the sentence in 23rd February, February, each case that the discharge should be "" with I'.Wl. ignominy"", as if those words in that part of lain. the sentence had never been included. The recommendation of Mr Justice Reed required Per cent. very full and complete consideration by 2,348 1.7 myself in collaboration with the Army 438 .4 authorities, in view of the effect of such 422 .8 a. decision in relation to sentences which had 814 2.5 been or might be imposed by general courts920 2.8 martial on members of the forces who were 86 .8 guilty of offences under the Army Act. The position was further complicated by advice 5,028 1.3 which had been furnished to me by the Judge Advocate-General, who stated that, in his view, it was not legally and constitutionally possible to give effect to the recommendation as the sentence had already been imposed and the discharges with ignominy had already been effected. 2. 'The Commonwealth Law authorities were asked to give consideration to the factors outlined in No. 1 above, and to advise whether it would not be legally possible, by means of an order in council to give effect to Mr Justice Reed's recommendation. As a result of this request, an order in council has now been - sianed by me recommending to His Royal"" Highness the Governor General in Council tlu't each of the sentences be mitigated by omitting so much of each of them as relates to discharge with ignominy from His Majesty's Service. The legal position of these members in regard to entitlement and other benefits, ns a result of their discharge from the Force by courts-martini sentences, is similar to the position of other soldiers who have been discharged by sentences of courts-martial. SUGAR. who Mr GUY asked the Act in g Minister for Trad e and Customs, upon notice I. Is it a fact that sugar refineries are established in all the States of the Commonwealth with the exception of Tasmania? If so. why is Tasmania penalized in this way? 2. In view of the disastrous effects caused by the periodical shortages of sugar in Tasmania, will he arrange that a sugar refinery be established in that State without delay?",74
171,Mr DEDMAN,PULSORY ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:J. It is confirmed that there are sugar refineries in all States with the exception of Tasmania, but it docs not necessarily follow that Tasmanians are penalized on this account. On the contrary, districts in northern Tasmania enjoy a price advantage because sales are made at northern Tasmanian ports served by direct shipping routes, at approximately the same level as applies at capital ports in all States, an arrangement which does not operate in outlying districts in any other State. The recent shortage of refined sugar was not confined to Tasmania. Other States in which refineries are established were also adversely affected by the general fall in sugar refining and the lack of shipping. These were only temporary disabilities. Lack of shipping for refined sugar consigned to Tasmania would also have applied in the case of raw sugar for refining if there had been a refinery in Tasmania. 2. It is not considered that the establishment of a refinery is a matter for the Commonwealth. CIVIL AVIATION : SUBSIDIES ; COUNTRY SERVICES ; INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE.",75
172,Mr BOWDEN,PULSORY ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY,"the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice I. Have any applications been made by airline operators for a Commonwealth subsidy? 2. If so, what airlines have made application, and for what routes? 3. What was the basis of the application in each case?",75
173,Mr DRAKEFORD,PULSORY ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY,"I regret that I was unable, before the a d j o u r n m e n t of the House last year, to f u r n is h the in for m at i o n required by the honourable member, but on the 26th October, 1945, I replied to his questions by letter in the following terms:I refer to the question appearing on Notice Paper No. 88 for the House of Representatives on Thursday, 4th October, 1045, in which you seek advice regarding applications by airline operators for a Commonwealth subsidy and would advise you that there are at present a number receiving Government subsidy in respect of services operated by them. Payments generally are made either ofi the basis of mails carried or on the basis of miles flown. Payment on the basis of mails carried contains an element of. subsidy in that the pound-mile rate for the carriage of mails is greatly in excess of the rate charged by the operators for the carriage of passengers and freight. For payment on the basis of miles flown the applicable rate per mile is struck after investigation .of the estimated operating costs inclusive of a small margin for profit and estimated revenues, the excess of cost over revenue being paid to the contractor as a subsidy. Recently an operator, receiving payment on a pound-mile basis for mails carried, found that the resulting payment, due to the small amount of mails carried over the services, was insufficient to bridge the gap between operating costs and revenues and applied for a direct subsidy payment. The company concerned was Ansett Airways Limited, and Cabinet recently approved of a subsidy payment at the rate of £22,500 per annum to that company'. Many applications for new air services have been submitted and many, if not all, of the services approved will require assistance either in the form of a direct subsidy or payment for the mails carried. Sir EARLEPAGE asked the Minister for C i v i l A v i at i o n , upon notice 1. Is the Civil Aviation Department responsible for the issue of licences for aeroplanes to stop at country aerodromes for intrastate passengers ? 2. If not, is there any State authority responsible for ' the issue of such licences? ' 3. What are the conditions under which they are issued? 4. As existing and prospective airlines are deterred by luck of knowledge of the policy of the Government from taking any progressive action to serve country people, will the Government make an immediate statement of its intentions ? 5. If the Government proposes to take no action with regard to servicing such towns as Taree, Kempsey, Coff's Harbour, Grafton, & c , which were served by air routes before the war, - will the Government, in order to assist the successful demobilization of air pilots, indicate whether it will give any assistance to the establishment of new services for this purpose now that the war has ended?",75
174,Mr DRAKEFORD,PULSORY ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY,"I regret that I was unable before the a d j o u r n m e n t of the House last year, to f u r n is h the in for m at i o n required by the honourable member, but on the 8th November, 1945, I replied to his questions by letter in the following terms:1. Under the provisions of the A i r Navigation Regulations, a regular transport service may only be operated under the authority of, and in accordance with, a licence issued by the Director-General of Civil Aviation. The powers of the Director-General to issue such licences is extended to intra-State services by virtue of acts passed by all State governments. 2. The Western Australian and'New South Wales Governments require operators of air services operating in those States to obtain licences from their transport authorities in addition to the airline licence issued by the Director-General. Generally the issue of an airline licence ha.s been sufficient to ensure (he issue of the licence by the State authority. In New South Wales a licensing charge of 5s. per aircraft is charged, while in Western Australia a tax of 2£ per cent, of the gross revenue of the service is levied. :!. Factors taken into account when considering applications for airline licences include(o) The ability of the applicant to comply with all safety requirements reasonably necessary for the particular operation. (ft) The public need anil conveniences of the service. tc) The amount of mail payment or other governmental assistance that would be required to make the service financially and operationally successful and whether the amount involved is justified. (<i) The probable effect of the services on existing air services with which it may come into competition. (c) The existing transport facilities available and the advantages accruing from the transport by air of mails, passengers and freight. (/) The potential value of the service and its resultant facilities and organization for strategic and defence purposes. 4. The Government's policy in regard to intra-state air services is under consideration, but I am unable to give any indication as to when an announcement of the policy finally determined may be expected. As you will realise, the whole question of civil air services is very uncertain at present in view of the present legal action in connection with the Australian National Airlines Act 1945. Tn addition, many problems of an exceedingly complex nature have yet to be solved. 5. Many applications for airline licences to operate air services have been submitted, but. the issue of airline licences has been suspended pending determination of the policy to be. adopted in regard to air services. In any case, it would not be - practicable to issue licences for all of the services for - which applications have been submitted, as in many cases, more than one application to operate over a particular route has been received. Economically it would not be practicable to permit more than one operator over a specified route especially where financial assistance is required. A survey is being conducted by the Department of Civil Aviation to determine possible air routes in the Commonwealth and all applications will be examined in the light of the results of that survey, and the Government's policy eventually adopted.",75
175,Mr HARRISON,PULSORY ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY,"the Minister for A i r , upon notice I.

If so. what countries are represented on this committee? 3. What is the function of the committee? 4. Is Australia represented; if not, what arrangements are there in force by which Australia can exchange with the countries represented information of value in the unification of international law on air questions?",76
176,Mr DRAKEFORD,PULSORY ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY,"I regret that I was unable before the adjournment of the House last'year, to furnish the information - required by the honourable member, but on the 24th October, 1945, I replied to his questions by letter in the following terms:1. The International Technical Committee of Experts on Aerial Law was created on the recommendation of the first International Conference on Private Aerial Law held at Paris in 1925. 2. According to a document, dated April. 1944. prepared by the Secretary-General of the International Conference of Aerial Navigation, i i : 1939, the experts comprising this committee belonged to the following 33 States:Germany-. United States of America, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, Columbia, Denmark.. Dominican Republic, Egypt, Spain, France, Great Britain"", Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Roumania, Sweden, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Turkey, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Yugoslovia. 3. This advisory body is charged to examine, in order of practical urgency, the problems of private aerial law raised by the development of air navigation in order to submit draft conventions on these matters as soon as they are completed for final adoption at periodic international conferences on private aerial law. The sessions of this committee were suspended during the war. The International Civil Aviation Conference held at Chicago in November and De'ember, 1944, recommended the desirability of the resumption of the sessions of this committee. It was also recommended that the activities of this committee be co-ordinated with the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization established at Chicago. 4. No. Any information which Australia desired to make available in regard to the unification of international air law would be forwarded to the secretary to the committee. Consideration will, however, he given to the question whether Australia should be directly represented at future meetings of the committee. MOTOR VEHICLES.
