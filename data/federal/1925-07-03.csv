1,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. Last night, ou the motion for the adjournment of the House, I made reference to the Australian, dried fruits industry. I was then under the impression that, pursuant to the legislation passed by this Parliament last year while I was abroad, a board was appointed to control both the export ancl interstate branches of the industry. I have since learned that the board I referred to last night only deals with dried fruits for export. I wish to say that I regret having mentioned it, or any one connected with it, in the manner that I did. From whnt I can gather, I believe that it is rendering good service to the industry. It is only right,, therefore, that I should make this explanation. The state hoard is solely to blame the unsatisfactory conditions that I ferred to. NA ASSEMBLY. NA IN 1924 Alfn 1925.",12

5,Mr BRUCE,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,The representation of Australia at the Geneva Assembly of the League of Nations is considered each year by the Government when the necessity to appoint a delegation arises.

This ter was, discussed here on the 25th June. Australia. Immediately we received information through the press that the cruiser Brisf bane was in Chinese waters, the honorinterfering able member for Batman (Mr Brennan) 'called the attention of the Government to the matter. He and I both urged that prompt action should be taken to prevent Australian warships from being used to interfere in the internal affairs of China.

BrisThose statements induced the honourable member for Batman to bring this matter before the House. I supported him on that occasion, and we both urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action to prevent any Australian - I warship from interfering in the inI ternal affairs of China. Whatever dispute to do that - country may have within its own matboundariescertainly does not concern No one will argue for a moment that we, who exclude Asiatics r o m Australia, have any justification for in- -- their domestic troubles. We wisely exclude them because of our White Australia policy. that in Austraha certain individuals of foreign origin have taken a hand in matters that vitally affect the welfare of this country, and that certain legislation has been introduced to counteract them. Peoples of other countries who read the debates of this Parliament will naturally come to the conclusion that Australia is in danger of a serious upheaval because of the action of anarchists, communists, and others, though everybody here knows that the number of these men in Australia is Only recently several contested the New South Wales elections, and but few votes were recorded for them. These men have no time for the Labour party. Then we are told by tha British Minister for Foreign Affairs that persons from some other probably Russia, are interfering in the domestic affairs of Great Britain and other European nations. These statements are greatly exaggerated to suit the purposes of the Government. The Prime Minister said ten ago that he would let the know at the earliest possible the position as far as the bane was concerned.

Qn the 2nd July the Prime Minister, in reply to the honMr Charlton. We are told orable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), made the following statement:Reverting to the question of the Australian cruiser Brisbane's possible participation in the Chinese trouble, Mr Brennan asked the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives yesterday whether he was informed as to the position of the Brisbane, and whether he would assure the House that the vessel would not be engaged ""in belligerent operations in China or elsewhere without the consent of Parliament. The Prime Minister replied that the Brisbane was at Hong Kong on 30th June, attached to the British-China squadron. He could give no guarantee to the House as to what action infinitesimal. the Brisbane would have to take while there, communists as the squadron might have to be used for the purpose of protecting the lives and property of European residents. The Prime Minister then gave the impression that the Government was taking no action, leaving the matter entirely in the country, hands of the British Government. An arrangement was entered into at the last Imperial Conference whereby the Brisbane was to be exchanged for a British vessel, so that valuable experience mightbe gained by our naval men. I , days myself, do not approve of the exchange House of war vessels. It is unnecessary, bemoment cause our naval men, in efficiency, comBrispare favourably with those of Britain, or of any other country. They need no I enter my tuition other than what they gain here. interferThat was proved during the recent war. other na- But even if exchanges are made, there is no justification for this Govprnment permitting the British Government to send The Prime an Australian war vessel, manned by Auswitli tralians, to take part in a dispute in China. .We wish to live in peace and quietness and to remain on friendly terms with all nations. How can this be done command if we permit our vessels to interfere in the vessel in affairs of other nations? What was there undoubtedly to prevent the Prime Minister from in affairs forming the British Government that, for whilst agreeing to the exchange of vessels, our warships should not participate, in foreign disputes? We wish to avoid The great trouble with Asiatic and other coundown-trod- tries. International law says that domestic legislation is a matter for each country education. to settle for itself. There was strong opposition to the Protocol of the League of Nations because it was thought that its circumstances, adoption might interfere with our domesSuch tic freedom, and our White Australia policy. Yet, although we contend that there should be no interference in our domestic affairs, the Government allows oue of our own war vessels to interfere in the domestic affairs of another nation. No Australian war vessel should take part in the disputes of other countries unless this House has approved of such action. It would be a different matter if Great B r it a in were embroiled in war and we were fighting for our existence. What will be the international effect of the present situation? Everybody knows that the international position is very unsatisfactory. The League of Nations is doomed to failure, chiefly because of the action of Great B r it a in itself.",13
14,Mr MANTT,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,That is not so.,15
15,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"Mr Chamberlain last week stated definitely, on behalf of the British Government, that nothing f u r ther could be done respecting the Covenant. The British Cabinet is aware that the Covenant is not satisfactory, and does not give power to the League to deal with international disputes. If the great nations are net prepared to extend or strengthen the powers of the League, I am perfectly justified in saying that to maintain it is a waste of money, and that its value is mythical. International complications may be caused by what is now happening in China, and I , for one, protest against establishing a precedent for Australia by allowing the cruiser Brisbane to remain in Chinese waters. The Government should let the people know exactly what is happening. We wish to live with in our rights and to have complete domestic jurisdiction. But if we interfere with another country claiming similar rights we are looking for trouble. We in Australia have decided that the Chinese are not to enter this country. We had a perfect right to do that ; but if we follow up that decision by interfering with Chinese domestic affairs, I ask this House how long does it expect international law to stand? At the meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations one of the main points discussed by the Asiatic representatives was the calling of another convention to alter the present international law, and it was because the other representatives were against it that a move was not made in that direction. The Asiatics feel that they are not getting a fair deal,, and that feeling will be greatly intensified if we allow our warships to go abroad and interfere in their domestic troubles. Eventually the answer to such interference must be a combination of Asiatic nations with certain white nations against the other white nations. Many years may elapse before that development occurs, but the possibility of it stares us in the face, and its realization is being hastened by actions such as this Government has taken. If we think that we can enter into compacts with a few strong nations to rule the world, and that the other nations will quietly submit to such domination, we are making a mistake. The Asiatic nations have advanced a long way in political thought during the last 50 or 60 years, and they will resent action of that kind. Australia haa no right to interfere with the internal affairs of any other nation, and the Labour party, when it created the Australian Navy, laid down the principle that it should be owned and controlled by Australians. The sending cf the Brisbane to China, however, is the first evidence that the navy is being handed over to the British Government. No other construction can be placed upon what has happened. If we enter into arrangements whereby our warships are removed from our own coast and placed under che control of the B ritish Government, which is constantly embroiled in difficulties in different parts of the world, we must in evitably be drawn into some conflict. The Chinese nation, if it were sufficiently strong, might reasonably be expected to resent the presence of the Brisbane on its coast at this time as a direct menace to its independence, and to do everything within its power to avenge the insult.",15
16,Mr WEST,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,Why should it not ?,15
17,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"There is no reason why the Chinese should not defend their national independence. Australia has no right to interfere in China's domestic affairs.. If the Chinese j>eople had done anything inimical to the in terests of Australia or its citizens we should be justified in protecting our own people, but so long as we exclude the Chinese from our country and claim the right to manage our own affairs as we think f it , we are not justified in sending a ship manned by Australians to China to participate in the suppression of a domestic rising. We have no definite information as to the part the Brisbane has taken in this trouble, but we know that it is in Chinese waters, that the B r i tishers have participated in the fighting, and that' a large number of lives have been lost. As it is admitted that British bluejackets fired upon the Chinese people we have clear evidence that the warships on the scene were engaged in the disturbance. The Prime Minister has been tardy in this matter. He should have taken action when the honourable - member for Batman (Mr Brennan) first brought the matter up in this chamber, and should not have allowed a week to elapse before answering in the way he did. Australia does not desire to be involved in war or to interfere in other people's internal concerns. We claim the right to work out our own destiny, and we concede the same right to other people. Our interference in foreign affairs has already proceeded too far. Prior to the war nothing of this sort could have happened. When the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was at the head of the Government he always insisted upon the maintenance of the Australian Navy as a separate entity. That policy should be continued. The mere fact that Australia participated in the great war is no reason why we should be involved every time Great Britain moves in foreign affairs. If we consent to be dragged at Britain's heels, we shall bring trouble upon ourselves in the near future. I brought this matter forward because of its importance, and the necessity for a protest being voiced in this House against an Australian warship being employed in a domestic disturbance in a foreign country. If 'the Government is not prepared to advise the British Cabinet, in accordance with the views I have expressed, I hope that at least reports of the debate will be published in England, so that the British Admiralty may realise that its action in sending the Brisbane, manned by Australian bluejackets, to China, does not meet with thVapproval of a big section of this House, representing, probably, the majority of the people in Australia.",15
18,Mr BRUCE,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"Flinders-Prime MinisI teiand Minister for External Affairs) [11.36] - The Issue raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton)- would be of considerable importance if the were anything like the statements he made; but they are very different, and can hardly credit that the honourable gentleman believes what he has said remost garding the present trouble in China. He dealt with it a3 if the foreign powers - deliberately interfering in a matter of - Chinese domestic jurisdiction. That is far from being so. Anybody who takes an interest in foreign affairs, and has followed closely the troubles that have arisen in China, knows that they are in no sense of a domestic character. In past years, China entered into treaties by which foreign countries were granted certain rights, and at what are known as the treaty ports, large foreign settlements have developed. In recent years, these treaties have received a good deal of consideration from the nations of the world, and they were freely discussed at the Washington Conference. In fact, one of the treaties concluded at that Conference dealt with, this matter. As a result of negotiations between representatives of all the Powers and the Chinese Government, great progress towards a solution of the problems had been made, and an arrangement by which the development of China - could proceed, and the difficulties experienced over a long period of years would disappear, seemed imminent. It is very regrettable that, at this stage, when the prospects of China were brightening, anti-foreign riots should have occurred. The Leader of the Opposition stated that these riots are in some way connected with industrial disputes, and the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan), when speaking on this matter a few days ago, emphasized that view. ",16
19,Mr BEUCE,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"Possibl y he did. At any rate, he said that Australia was interfering in a Chinese industrial dispute. That is not so. These troubles have been fomented by the student class, and are directed against the foreign elements in China. These students have been educated abroad, and have absorbed western ideas. At this moment, I am not prepared to discuss whether or not there is any justification for their agitation, but do regret that it should have occurred at a time when a settlement of China's problem seemed to be at hand. China has a very large foreign populafacts tion. How those people became settled has - there is of no concern at this moment. I They are there, just as foreigners are settled in other countries, and one of the sacred obligations of any nation is to ensure the safety of the nationals of other were countries who are legitimately within itsBorders. So far as the British Empire is concerned, this obligation is further strengthened by special treaty provision. Unfortunately, the Chinese Government is not strongenough to protect the foreigners in China. Biots started Shanghai, and extended to other centres, and the lives and property of the foreign communities have, been menaced.. Accordfor isngly British , Americans, Japanese, French, and Italians have co-operated in action, to protect the lives and property of their own citizens, who are legitimately domiciled in China. Br.

I do not proclaimed pose to' follow the Leader of the Opposifor tion in the discussion of the influences that are responsible for these troubles, but nobody whohas studied' the present conditions in China and read the statements of those who are fomenting trouble in the Orient, can doubt that riots have been caused hy a foreign vernment that is desirous of creating chaos in that country. I do not propose to follow the honourable gentleman's ment that we are interfering in domesNorth - tic affairs in China. The other point raised by him was that one of our cruisers is in. Chinese waters, and that the vernment should not permit it. to be used in any way ija connection with the disturbbuild ance there - In this connection two points arise: first, whether one of our cruisers should be there at all, and, secondly, it is there, whafc instructions the ment should issue as to its future movenavy ments. Mr MAXWEM, - The honourable member raises the point whether there should be any exchange of vessels at all .",17
21,Mr BRUCE,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"That is so. The of the Opposition said that the party to which he belongs stands for the Austraa lian Navy being an independent unit, and. he endeavoured to show that the vernment stood for something entirely ferent.",17
22,Mr FENTON,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"So it does. Mr Bruce. - There is no justification whatever for sueh a charge. The honourable gentleman can have no knowledge of what took place at the lastImperial Conference, orof theaction which I , per- at sonally, took there. Moreover;,,, he cannot beaware of theattitude of the British Admiralty. Theright, honourable member North Sydiney (Mr W . M . Hughes;) has statedion many occasions bhat he stands for the AustraJian Navy being an independent unit, co-operating with the British Navy in times of emergency. Honourable members will remember that in connection - with the establishment of the Australian Navy a.long light ensued. One section contended that Australia should contribute to the British N a v y; that w© should, ensure our safety by having the right to call upon the British . is .Navy in case of need. That section comoverlooked the important factor by of Australian sentiment and Australian ""When this question was under discussion the British Admiralty frankly that it would be infinitely better the Australian unit to be completely under its control. At the last ImperialConference, however, the British A d miralty just as frankly admitted that the most successful way to^ obtain co-operation between the British Navy and the naval forces of the the self-governing parts of the Empire was go to regard the latter as separate units capable of co-operation intimes of emergency. For that principle I fought, as argudid the right honourable member for Sydney when he was Prime M in ister. The question then arises what is the best way by which we can develop the GoAustralian Navy. The Leader of the Opposition appeared to suggest that we can ships-, man them, and carry out the whole of the training of their personnel ourselves, that there is no need for coif operation with the British Admiralty . GovernMight I remind him that, as yet, our is young; and has not been in existence sufficiently long to have trained Australian officers capable of holding the more responsible commands:",17
23,Mr FENTON,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,The Goverument will Leader not allow them to be trained.,17
24,Mr BRUCE,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"At Jervis Bay we have naval college, where young Australians are being trained, so. that eventually thay Gomay assume senior commands in the Ausdiftralian Navy. Bufc that college has only been in existence for a few years, and the officers - undergoing training there have not reached the age or gained the experience to fit them for supreme command. Thus we are faced with this position, that if we= are to adequately man our navy, we must obtain the loan of officers from the British Navy until such time as our own men have gained sufficient experience to assume command. While that is 30, we are sending to Great Britain those young officers who have passed through Jervis Bay, so that, in time, it' will not be necessary to rely on officers from the Imperial Navy.",17
25,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,The right honourable gentleman is not answering the main point that has been raised.,18
26,Mr BRUCE,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"It has been objected that, not only have we instituted a system whereby officers of the British and Australian navies are exchanged, but that vessels have been exchanged also. I say, unhesitatingly, that this exchange of vessels is of considerable advantage to Australia.",18
27,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,Does the right honourable gentleman approve of the Australian Navy taking part in a war with other countries ?,18
28,Mr BRUCE,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"The attachment of an Australian cruiser to a British naval squadron provides a splendid opportunity for its officers and men to obtain a more complete training than would otherwise be possible; they have the privilege of working with bigger units than would be possible if they were confined to the Australian squadron. Let me now refer to the situation which arises in connection with the cruisers which have been exchanged. cruiser has gone to the Chinese station, and in its place we have a British cruiser in Australian waters. What is the position of these two vessels ? Is the Aus- speak. tralian cruiser under the command of the British Admiralty, and is the British cruiser under the command of the Australian naval authorities?",18
29,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,Are Australian citizens to take part in fighting in other countries? That is the point.,18
30,Mr BRUCE,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"During the time for which the cruisers are to be exchanged the vessels will be under, the officers in command of the respective navies, and must remain there. The Government has intimated to the British Government that it recognizes that during the period of exchange the respective forces are reduced in strength, and that while that condition exists the British Government is entitled to use our cruiser for any necessary operation, the Australian Government, at the same time, having similar control over the British cruiser.",18
31,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,Then the Australian crew can take part in a war overseas.,18

34,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"I think that honourable members know that the practice of granting an extension of time, by leave, is wrong, and has, therefore, been abolished, so far as this House is concerned. There is, however, a way of overcoming the difficulty, namely, by suspending the Standing Orders in accordance with Standing Order 407. Is it desired that the Standing Orders shall be suspended to enable the right honourable the Prime Minister to continue? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!

35,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"I hope that the Prime Minister will not speak at length, because other honourable members also desire to",18
36,Mr BRUCE,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"I am grateful to the House for the concession it has granted, and shall not occupy more than three or four minutes. This matter is, however, of such importance that the Government's position should be made perfectly clear. I have already intimated that the British Government has been informed that this Government recognizes that, during the period for which the vessels are exchanged, they shall be under the control of the respective governments to which they are transferred; but that they should not be used in action without the consent of the government to which they belong, save in an urgent crisis. That arrangement will meet any circumstance that will ordinarily arise. When a major operation is contemplated, or serious complications arise, the respective governments are to he consulted. That brings us to the question of the position of the Dominions in the event of Great Britain becoming involved in war, and also to the position of Great Britain should any of the Dominions become similarly involved. I do not propose to traverse this matter at length on this occasion. In this case, the Australian Government has consented to its cruiser being used, if necessary, to protect the life and property of British citizens, and, I would remind honourable members opposite, of Australian citizens .also. The Leader of the Opposition knows that many Australians are in China, and must realise that they are entitled to protection by every possible means. ' Let me put a parallel case. The honourable gentleman has probably not forgotten the racial riots which not long ago took place at Broome, in Western Australia. Honourable members will remember the clamour for a cruiser to be sent to Broome to quell that disturbance. Would they say that if the Concord had been at Fremantle, and under our command at th£<.t time, she should not have been sent to Broome, if we had thought fit to send her to deal with the situation inhere ?",18
37,Mr ANSTEY,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"Bourke) [11.56] - We fire indebted to the Prime Minister for having at least made one thing clearthat British, and Australian cruisers also, are on our coast, and under the command of the British Government. Honourable members will, therefore, see that there is no exchange.",19
38,Mr BRUCE,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,I said nothing of the kind. Mr W. M . HUGHES - The Prime Minister said the very opposite.,19
39,Mr ASTSTEY,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"I hold thai there is no exchange. As for the Broome incident referred to by the Prime Minister, it is sufficient to say that our own vessels ensure law and order in Australia. It would be a different thing if the Chinese or Italian Government sent a man-p'-war here to protect its people. The question under consideration is whether an Australian cruiser is being sent into China to deal with industrial troubles there. I point out that, no sooner had the last great war ended-the war which was fought for liberty, democracy, and self-determination-tha n the British shipowners dismissed the men then manning their vessels, and filled their places with Chinamen. British manufacturers, also, established new factories in China, not only in the concession areas, but also in other parts of the country. In 1922, the Chinese seamen went on strike, and the trouble lasted for a period of two or three months. On the 5th March, 1922, they entered into a compact with the shipowners, by which the ship-owners were to give them, a 30 per cent, increase in their remuneration and, in addition, the seamen were to be reinstated, and receive half pay for the period of the strike. The companies named a starting day, ancl all men not reinstated by that day were to receive half pay. The agreement was signed by Mr Sutherland, the chairman of the British, ship-owners' committee; and, on behalf of the Chinese Seamen's Union, the agreement was signed by Chak Ke. It was to apply to all vessels engaged in the coastal trade, and also those trading to Java, Australia, and all Pacific ports. As the Chinese organization would not accept the word of the ship-owners, the British Government guaranteed that the agreement would be fulfilled, the guarantee being signed by Mr Jamieson, the Consul General in Canton; and by Luk King Fo, the secretary for the British Commission for Foreign Affairs. The British shipowners refused to honour the agreement with the seamen, as did the British manufacturers their agi'eement with the Chinese workers in the factories. The companies were to pay into a fund controlled by a comjmittee appointed by the British Government, but not one penny was paid into the fund. An appeal was made to the British Government to enforce the agreement, but that Government refused to take .any action. In 1923, the Blue Funnel Line, owned by Lambert and Holt, of which Butterfield and Squires are the compradores on the Chinese coast, not only refused to pay the money, but deliberately broke the agreement. Wages were reduced by 30 per cent, on all ships manned by Chinese. Low as was the Asiatic standard the ship-owners would not comply with the requirements of decency, but took advantage of the position, and to assist them in attaining their objectives they organized a band of strike breakers. in 1923,. when all the seamen went on strike, gunboats ordered out, and niachme-guna mounted on the wharfs and. along the waterfront. Hundreds of workers were In lied ih almost every port, and the organization of the seamen was smashed, simply because the British Government refused to compel the ship-owners Carry out the agreement which had been violated by them in every From 1923 up to the present time the ship-owners have not paid a cent of the increase in wages which they agreed to give, although the British Government guaranteed it. Now the organization of Chinese workers embraces over men,, and this industrial dispute is the fundamental cause of the present Since it is wholly and solely an industrial Struggle for the purpose of raising ' the standard of living, the efforts of the Chinese should be heartily supported by Australia. The factories round Shanghai are not located in concession areas, but in purely Chinese Instances' of the grossest brutality been reported. The Chinese factory system under foreign capital shows no improvement on the factory conditions obtained in. England a century ago. The Chinese waterside workers are the main support of the industrialists in their great fight fbr a decent standard of living. I wished to do so I could give details showing the manner in which the Chinese are protesting against the treatment are receiving. The agitation that has developed was not caused by the dents but by the industrialists Everybody knows that there has been a conflict waging in China between the reactionary north and the south, but the treatment given .to Chinese seamen, wharf labourers, and workers by foreign capitalists has practically united them all, irrespective of class or avocation. The people of China have joined in military operations by way of protest against the treatment out to the working classes. What is the position in regard to the Brisbane? . We are told that she has gone to China to protect the lives of British subjects. Speaker, let me remind honourable bers that China has been the most peaceful nation on earth for a thousand years. She is not a military nation. accorded the utmost respect to foreigners, Mr Anstey. and they without justification have occupied her terrilsoi'ies. She has threatened no lives at any time. If her people had were been fairly treated there would, not have were been the slightest trouble in China today. What would be thought in Australia if in an industrial, trouble a foreign power invaded our territory and shotdown our citizens? The struggle on the part of the Chinese masses should have to the most hearty endorsement of the people of this Commonwealth. The lives direction. of British subjects are in no way threatened. It is the lives and liberties of the industrial classes in China that are at stake, and it is to assist in their degradation that British cruisers are being sent there. Now the ship-owners are en100,000 listing the services of strike breakers. The trouble. latest news is that they are bringing men from the Philippines in. order to man the wharfs, ships, and factories under the working conditions to which theChinese have objected.. Strike-breakers are being about brought in from Singapore, from all the ports of the Malay States, and from territory. various pai-ts of Asia. And yet Australia have is to. take a part in assisting to increase the racial hatredthat has been bred-,, and to act in the interests-of British and foreign that capitalists. ' How can this Parliament j u s t if y such a proceeding ?- We have been told, that the. Australian. Navy will never he used in. subduing an industrial struggle, If but I contend that that is the object of ordering the Brisbane to the scene of the present trouble. Whatever may be the they .basis of the exchange of cruisers between Australia and Great B r it a in , I say that stu- that is the deliberate purpose in the latest themselves. movements of the Brisbane. At least, this Government should not if y Great B r it a in that, considering the nature of republican the bond' entered into between the British ship-owners and employers, generally in factory China, and considering that they guaranteed the observance of the bond, it insists that, . although the lives of British citizens should be protected, in no case should our cruiser be used to shoot down meted the operatives who are trying to improve their industrial conditions. Whatever justification there may be for naval action at Hong Kong, there can be no Mr excuse for pushing up as far as Cauton, mem- Amoy, or Foo Chow. Under the pretence of defending our own. nationals, the . She has cruiser is to help foreign capitalists to crush the Chinese workers. We should sympathize with these unfortunate people in their efforts to improve their lot rather than use the forces of militarism to assist in destroying them. Australia has never heen a party to a. more outrageous act than the proposed use of the Brisbane for this purpose. Mr W. M. HUGHES (North Sydney) [12.8] - The subject under discussion is of the greatest possible importance. I shall not follow the honourable member for - Bourke (Mr Anstey)' along the by-paths which he traversed, alluring though they may seem. He attributes the present trouble in China wholly to the efforts of the waterside workers of the country to raise their wages nnd improve their standard of living. It must be so, but I shall discuss the matter from the standpoint of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), who, .to my mind, put his case fairly an'd temperately, and although^!!, listened carefully to the exposition! of the situation given by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), it failed to satisfyme. It seems to me that in this matter a departure is being made from those very sound principles of policy that were laid down when the establishment of the Australian Navy was agreed to, and maintained until that Navy, after some years, became a fleet in being. The principles governing the operations of our Navy are entirely compatible with Australia's independence and our relation to the Empire-bu t we own the Navy, and control it. Upon this point Parliament was emphatic. I have not j the ^statute by me, but in the section relating to this matter it is provided that, upon a state of. war arising, the control of our Navy may be handed over, when the Australian Government shall approve of that being done, to the British Government, and then, but not until then, will it pass under the control of the British authorities. The mere existence of a state of war does not cause the Australian Navy to pass to British control; it is for this Government, should war arise, to decide what shall be done with our ships. What has happened in. the present case ? The Prime Minister put 'this' phase of the matter clearly. He said that at the last Imperial Conference it - was agreed that, in order to give our officers the opportunity of the far larger field of training that the British Navy in its worldwide operations affords, there should be an exchange of officers and ships. The exchange of officers was not a hew arrangement, nor was the exchange of ships new in principle. As a result, we find the Brisbane, one of our light cruisers, in China at a moment When, for some reason or other, an! act of war has been committed. The right honourable gentleman said that the measures adopted in Chinese waters do not constitute an act of war, but have been taken for the protection of life and property there. Now, if it is not an act of war to fire upon the nationals of China in their own country in order to protect foreigners there, I should like to know what an act of war is. Let me put a converse case. Suppose that there should be a riot in Melbourne; that some of our white_Jarrip kins should go down Lonsdale-streetjand t assault the Chinese cabinetmakers there. Suppose, also, that China had a navy as strong proportionately as its population would warrant, and that ships of that navy should enter Hobson's Bay, and shell this city under the excuse 'that it was protecting the lives and properties of the cabinetmakers of Lonsdale-street, would that not be an act of war? I understand precisely all that is involved in our partnership of Empire. I have been accused, perhaps not without cause, of being a very strong protagonist of Empire. So I am, and so I always shall be. But we shouldjnot be involved in a policy.of adventure. No one would suggest that the great British Empire, which has a navy that, in fact^ if. not on paper, is ,the strongest in the world, is in danger because of what is occurring in Canton today. It is no.t. We have not to inquire now how our nationals came to China; nor have we to inquire how we came to Australia, or where are those whose places we have taken. Somehow the British are in China, and we are here. But I would remind the honourable member for Bourke that he/is one who lives in a glass house, that he belongs to a race that is to be found throughout the' world, and has achieved its position in one way only. He seems to forget this. We have a continent to defend and develop; we are less than 6,000,000; we bar out one-half of the human race, and w.e are, most emphatically, not in a position to engage in a policy of adventure. If war comes to us we must do our best. But we ought not to deliberately seek it. It .is said than an exchanged Australian I cruiser falls automatically under the control"" of the British Admiralty, while, on the other hand, an exchanged British cruiser falls under the control of the Australian authorities. face of it, that looks a perfectly fair arrangement. But a British admiral is as powerless as one of Pharaoh's mummies to commit an act of war unless the British Admiralty shall so direct him.. He is the servant of the Admiralty, and he would he broken and thrown to the wolves if he dared to fire a-shot without strict instructions to do so. In the present / case some one InJ England has instructed the admiral in charge of the China station to do this or that upon the arising of certain contingencies. vessel is a part of his squadron, and must obey liis orders. The position of a British vessel under the control of an Australian admiral is quite different. Does any one think that the Australian admiral could direct a British vessel to commit an act of .war? He could not do so. The British Admiralty alone has the. power to give orders to ships of the British i Although we^speak of our independence, J we know very] well that our position is subordinate to Britain and to the Empire as a whole in these matters. But in any ease our Navy would not, unless directly ordered to do so, commit an act of war; to do that would be foreign to the temper, circumstances, and necessities of this nation. I am not going to consider the UT, cause of the present trouble in China/ I * ^ am entirely with .the Prime Minister, and disagree entirely with the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) as to that. Undoubtedly, Soviet propaganda is responsible for the trouble. we have no business whatever to interfere with the internal policy of China, unless this nation should decide deliberately that we are to attack Sovietism wherever it is found, and give blow for blow. We must abstain from all interference with the domestic affairs of other countries. There is no doubt whatever that the sword of the Soviet is drawn against all nations, and that the Soviet is interfering in the internal policy of this country, and would overturn existing governments by force if it were able to do so. But I have not time to follow this line of argument further. that if the Brisbane has been engaged in Chinese waters, or its seamen have taken Mr W. M. Hughes. part in what is happening there, our interference has been to protect life and property. I do not deny that. But the Brisbane should not have been so enOn the gaged-if she has been in action-unles s the Government of the Commonwealth deliberately ordered it. Eor what has been done constitutes an act of war against China, and I say that we should do well, eviai at the risk of limiting the opportunities for the education of our officers, to keep out of this imperialistic entanglement. I do not believe that the people of England approve of this policy, and it is a policy odious to us to force ourselves into China because she is weak. Here is a lesson for us, too. No one Our would treat Japan as China is now being treated. I was at a conference when Wellington Koo had the' right and the logic and Makino had only guns; but President Wilson never hesitated as to which side he would support. He gave his decision in favour of the man with the guns, and 400,000,000 of people were sacrificed. We must never forget that Navy, right without the means of enforcing it counts for little in this world. The Government would do well to consider the position which has been set out fairly by the Leader of the Opposition. I do not think that the' policy that is being pursued by the British Government is one to which we should be committed without the Parliament aud Government of the Commonwealth deliberately approving it, with their eyes open as to the consequences. For this reason, I am supporting honourable members opposite. I think the Leader of the Opposition did well to bring up Still, this matter. It was discussed by him, . and I hope will he discussed by others, without heat or partisanship. For my part, I trust that the Prime Minister will see the wisdom of giving such instructions as will prevent any vessel of the Australian fleet from taking part in any act hostile to any nation in the world.",19
40,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"Batman) [12.22] The present position of parties in this chamber is somewhat analogous to that of the representatives of China and Japan as described by the right It is said honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes); we, on this side, have the logic, and honourable members on the Government side have the guns. Much that was said by the Prime M in ister in reply to my Leader may have been informative to some, bufc was for the most part irrelevant to the present discussion. I do not propose to analyse the causes of the trouble in China. Most of us who are as well informed as we can be on that very difficult problem, realise that it is partly national and partly in dustrial. We realise that the industrial trouble arises from the age-long quarrel of workers with their oppressors, which, in China, is, perhaps, more acute than in any other country. We realise also that behind the industrialists of China there is a movement by those who may be described as the intellectuals, to give force and effect to the national desires of the people. The Prime Minister relied on what he gave out as certain main facts to j u s t if y the inclusion of an Australian man-of-war in the British squadron in Chinese waters. At the present moment he said that the object was the protection of the'lives and property of British subjects, and, also, he added emphatically, of Australians. My answer to that is that any excuse is better than none. But I venture to ask the right honourable gentleman where he finds a principle of international law which enables him to declare that an Australian battleship is to play the part of policeman, all over the universe, wherever there may be a local quarrel between our own citizens and the people of any particular country? I suggest that when the honourable gentleman was tickling the ears of his supporters, who were giving him encouragement in his declaration of the prin ciples of international law, he was obviously quoting from a text-book which originated in the office of the National Federation, and which has no established authority in this or any other country. Thei'e is a duty imposed on every country to protect its nationals wherever they may be, but there is a well recognized method of performing that duty when there is not a state of war existing. If in any civilized country of the world an outrage is committed, or believed to have been committed on a British subject, representations of a diplomatic character are i m mediately exchanged between the Governments of the two countries concerned. I ask the Prime Minister whether he would seriously argue that in any such circumstances it is competent for B r it a in or Australia to send a warship to administer speedy judgment, and take the law into its own hands by firin g into the territory of another country. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes), whose interesting speech If o llowed throughout, used an illustration very similar to one which was in my own mind. I was about to put it another way. Suppose that in the TJnited States of America American citizens got into local trouble with our own nationals, or with British subjects-because , after all, we are separate nations though we speak the same tongue- does the honourable member suggest that we would be entitled, in those circumstances, to send a British warship to the littoral of the TJnited States of America and start pot-shotting Americans in their own country ?",22
41,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,Does the honourable member suggest that the two cases are analogous ?,23
42,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"No , the two cases are not quite analogous, because America would be able to h it back, and China is not able to h it back. That is the only extent to which they are not analogous. Of course, we would not dare to do such a thing. Diplomatic and respectful representations would be exchanged between the Government of the Empire and the Governmenb of the TJnited States of America.",23
43,Mr BRUCE,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"The honourable member knows that America can protect foreigners in that country, and that China cannot ]>rotect foreigners in China.",23
44,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"I am not here to pass judgment between the standards of civilization of nations. I remind the right honourable gentleman that China takes an honoured place in the League of Nations, and was represented at the Washington Conference. She is as much entitled to the protection of her people as we are, as America is, or as any other country is. I decline to be led into accepting the view that when a nation is disorganized or weak, because of local troubles from which it is trying to emerge, that should be our opportunity to fire upon its people.",23
45,Mr MAUONY,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,That is the way of the bully always.,23
46,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"That is always the policy pf the bully. That is a plain acceptance of the doctrine that might is right, and that we are to be the judges of the civilization suitable to the Chinese Republic. I decline to accept that view. We ape mot,, technically, at waa* with China, but there have been shots fired. Aets. of war have been committed China. We learn from the newspapersif they are correctly informed'-that of war have been committed by '.French battleships,, by Portuguese and also by British seamen. at any moment-and perhaps at this very moment-(Australian seamen, a vessel taken, front Australian, aoidhanded over to the squadron,, may be engaged upon the nationals of another If the right honourable member North Sydney (Mr W. M. expects mo to discuss a like this without heat he very misunderstands my attitude attitude of the party that matter I represent. We say very tinctly that the Australian brought into being, notwithstanding opposition, for the express purpose of defending. Australia and not to be sentinto the waters of other nations for aggressive or disciplinary purposes. The Labour party stood very strongly for this ciple. The right honourable the Prime Minister said that at the Imperial ference and elsewhere they have stood for that same principle just as strongly, if not more strongly, than honourable members of the Labour party. My answer to that is, the right honourable member has honoured the principle in the letter but violated it in the spirit. He prated of it in the councils, of the Empire, but when the occasion arose in which he had to choose between respecting and violating it, he acted the part of a craven, and weakly gave the Australian Navy into the control of anotherpower. What about the Australian seamen who are on board the Brisbane, and under the commandof the Imperial Government? If they ordered tofire upon the Chinese in China, and they say, ""'We will not do it, for it is against the terms of the ; Defence Act; Ave should not be compelled to. take part in an industrial war in a - foreign country,"" and they should be court martialled, and possibly be called upon to suffer the supreme, penalty for their disobedience, what would this Government say? I. am sure of what th® people of Australia would say, 'ibut I should like the right honourable Mr Brennan. to tell us what the Government would say if Australians were punished for not doing in China what the. law says, they must not be compelled, to do in.

The time may c-omej or it may not, Con- when China will be in a position to send her ships across the high seas to the Australian coast for' the purpose of invading Australia. If she should do so her leaders would be able to say to us, "" You should not complain; you sent your battleship to China to take part in our domestic troubles when we were unableto prevent, you from doing so, and when we had no quarrel: whatever with you, and you canHot expect any mercy from our millions 1 now;."" If this Government persists in. itff present attitude, and does not recall our vessel from Chinese waters, we shall deserve noi mercy frean China, I complain bitterly, first of all, that our warship are should be used to assist the predatory actsof other nations in Chinese waters, and,, secondly, that this should be done Australian secretly.

Mr MARRS '(Wentworth) [12.35] An opportunity should be given to discuss this matter at greater length, fOT it is - very important. As the first member - of this House to suggest that vessels of the Australian Navy should be exchanged for vessels of the British' Navy, - so that - our officers and men could nave the advantage of 'contact with British officers and men, I must confess that I regard the position of our 'ship in - China as unforbunate. I agree with most of the remarks made by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W. M . Hughes), and with many that have been male by honourable members opposite. The position is that our ship was sent in exchange for a British ship, and is now on the China station - The object of the exchange was that our officers and men might gain experience. Since she has been there something has happened which may have disastrous consequences. I have asked myself, if I had bad the hoin'our of being Mimister for the Navy in this Government, what action would I have taken in these circumstances? say, without hesitation, that I - should have advised my Prime Minister that we kad laefcfcer get - our ship back again. I .should have told him that she had been in Chinese waters long enough, that her officers and men had' benefited by the experience, and that it would be advisable for us to have her returned to Australia. Seeing that I should have adopted that attitude, I am not at all .surprised at the views expressed hy honourable members opposite. If I had not been in a hospital for a month, I should, perhaps, have taken some action similar to theirs. I should certainly have advised the Prime Minister to ask for the immediate return of the ship. The whole point is, as the right bonewiable member for North - Sydney remarked, "" If anything happens in China, from where will - our ship receive her orders?"" They wall - CQ-me, of course, from the British Admiral in 'command. So far as I - can see, : the only oil that - may 'he jrcrared on #he water to calm the storm-if one should 'break-woul d come from the 'admiral 'commanding there at present, who was - the First MembeT of our Naval Board, !

I say that, apart from any party opinions, although, if it came to a vote in this House, I should certainly vote with my Government. The Leader of the Opposition made one or two statements with which I did not agree. He - said that we could learn nothing from the Iloyal Navy. As a matter of fact our navy cannot imbibe too freely the great traditions of the British Navy. As the Prime Minister rightly .remarked, our officers and men are .'indebted to the British officers and men for all they know. We shall ""have to continue to look to the British naval authorities for members of our Naval Board. It will be a long time before we shall reach that state of efficiency that will justify us in ceasing to look to the British naval authorities for guidance and help. The exchange of our I ships must go on, and I hope that it will go on, but I do not think that we can he expected to leave this ship in Chinese waters for the ostensible purpose of protecting the lives of Britisli subjects when there are so many other Allied and British warships available for that purpose. It eould he said that our ship has served the purpose for which it was sent to the China station, and that it might now be permitted to return to Australia. I feel sure that if any difficulty should arise in which the British Government felt that it needed the assistance of our navy, and asked for that assistance, its request would be granted immediately. ©r. MALONEY (Melbourne) [12.41] I happened to visit China ou one occasion while .a great strike was in progress there. It was caused by the firm referred to by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey). The workers asked for an increase of 7s. a month in their wages, and the shipping company would not grant it. The men went out on strike, and later every one employed in Hong Kong joined them, even to the waitresses and domestics in the great hotel there. The boarders in the hotel had to cook their own meals and do all the work that was necessary in the hotel, and still pay the same tariff. Later Canton was involved in the dispute. The police at that time wanted to fire on the Chinese. I feel that we are facing an awful moment in our history. We are standing just now in the same position that Britain occupied years ago. She unfortunately took the wrong course, for she ordered that horrible opium, war to be waged, which resulted in thousands of men, women, and children being compelled to engage, against their wishes, in the opium traffic. In spite of the earnest sires of the people the guns of England thundered out and destroyed men, women and children, because their rulers would not do as the Government of England wished. It is possible for this Parliament, at this moment to make a peace gesture that will thrill the world. I think the Prime Minister spoke quite wrongly of the Australians resident in China. How many of our people are resident there? I have been in Hong Kong four times, and I have only met four Australian residents.",25
48,Mr WHITTSIT,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,If there was only one it would be sufficient.,26
49,Dr MALONEY,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"I only know of two who have since gone to reside there. In any case they go to exploit the Chinese. What made the Japanese people stir themselves to such a degree that they have become the great force they now are in world affairs ? It was"" the way in which the guns of other nations were used to fire upon their men, women, and children. We should not dare to do in Japan what we are doing to China. China is known throughout the world as a peace-loving country. Barely in her history have her people extended their boundaries by war. Usually it has been done because the adjacent nations have requested to be received into the community of China. The men who were responsible for that terrible opium war are now dust and ashes, and they have been judged by the Higher Power, but we can do something to atone for their sins by making a gesture which will impress the world. I have seen, unspinning the silk cocoons, little Chinese children whose age and conditions reminded me of those of the little children in the factories of Great Britain a hundred years agowho were lashed to keep them awakeand for whom great reformers like the glorious Earl of Shaftesbury did so much. If the Admiral of the British Fleet in Chinese waters orders the Brisbane to open fire upon the Chinese, what will happen to any of our men who refuse to man the guns ? Would we allow them to be court-martialled and sentenced to death? I misjudge the Prime Minister as a man if he would nor immediately demand the withdrawal of the sentence and the release of the men concerned. If the Brisbane fires one shot in Chinese waters, I shall, as de- long as I live, oppose with my vote and voice any proposal to construct in Australia a vessel capable of causing war. We are told that war vessels cannot be built in Australia. Japan, 60 years ago, could not construct war vessels. In those days junks were used. On one occasion, Formosa, using the first ironclad ever constructed, destroyed an invading army of 200,000 men who were being transported in junks. Are we not as good as the Japanese? Would any man say that our white race cannot do what the Japanese have done? Three times in the history of naval warfare have theJapanese possessed the most powerful battleship afloat. I myself saw one of these vessels lying alongside the Renown outside, the great harbour of YokohamaChina has vast resources in coal and iron, and if in the dim future, she should possess naval strength proportioned to that of Japan, would the Prime Minister dare to allow any Australian war vessel to gothere to quell an internal disturbance. I speak now in the interests of humanity with a view to.bringing about the amity of nations, and removing the causes of war. The Chinese student of today is a cultivated person with a great amount of knowledge, and if he is endeavouring to obtain better conditions in China we have no right to interfere with him. I am given to understand that the British exchange vessel Concord is not today in Australian waters.",26

51,Dr MALONEY,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"The Prime Minister has now an excellent opportunity to recall the Brisbane. It can be done in the kindest of language so as not to hurt the feelings of the admiral of the fleet there. If our cruiser is recalled, we can then claim to have tried to evade a conflict with China. Mr D. CAMERON (Brisbane) [12.54]. - The debate this morning has recalled to my mind my experience in China in 1900. I was then quite young, and it so happened that during the Boxer rebellion I went to Pekin with some of the American troops. That was entirely a political disturbance. A section of the people of China were trying to upset the rule of the Dowager Empress. The present trouble in China has quite a different origin. At that time the Government of China was powerless-as I believe it to be now-to do anything effective for the protection, not only of foreigners resident there, but also of its own people. Because of an exchange of vessels between the Australian and the British navies our cruiser Brisbane happens to be at the moment in China with the British squadron, in readiness to protect life and p r o p e r t y if necessary. I quite uphold the Prime Minister in the contention that it be absolutely wrong now to recall her. I have the most vivid recollection of the position of affairs in China at the time.

52,Mr WEST,AUSTEAJJAN REFBKSKNTATION AT GENEVA,"East Sydney) [12.56] The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) spoke disparagingly about the conduct of the Naval Department, and I can quite understand why that honourable member, when a member of the previous Ministry, was not in accord with his colleagues respecting the control of the Australian fleet. The honourable member has really placed the Government in a very humiliating position. The Prinie Minister has not justified the presence of the Brisbane in Chinese waters. The trouble with China is that outside interests are endeavouring to seize her territory. The American fleet is coming to these waters to give the nations of the Pacific an indication of America's naval power, and to show what a mighty fleet it is. The Russo-Japanese war was fought over possession of Manchurian territory. The Boxer war, in which Australians took part, was simply a scramble among the great nations of the world to establish their interests in China. The Government would not dare to send an Australian cruiser to Japanese waters to assist in quelling a disturbance in that country, but the position is different when the nation concerned is weak and there is a possibility of acquiring territory. The Australian Navy was never intended for the purpose for which it is being used today. The intention was to protect the coast of Australia. During the great war, owing to the activities of our navy, no raids by enemy cruisers were made upon our coast. I am quite satisfied that the action of the Government in allowing the Brisbane to remain in Chinese waters is not endorsed by the people of Australia. The Prime Minister has imperialistic 'ideals, and desires that Great B r it a in , from Downing-street, should control the destinies of Australia. No other nation in the world would allow its fleet to be used by another great power. would Mr SPEAKER (Rt. Hon. W . A.

60,Dr EARLE PAGE,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND," I desire to submit to the House at the earliest possible moment after the conclusion of the financial year an approximate statement of the finances of the Commonwealth. The difficulties which one has to contend with in presenting a state of this nature at so early a date the close of the financial year will be readily realized wheni t is remembered agreethat the transactions in London, up per to the last day of the financial year,- as well as those in every part of Australia, have to be focussed in the Treasury, Melbourne. This can only he done by means of cabled and telegraphed advices. The figures, therefore, can ba published only under general heads, amd must be accepted as approximate only; but the very slight variation which has occurred in previous years between the approximate and the final figures justifies me in feeling confident that those now preilliteratesented will not differ materially from the final result when ascertained. The revenue fbr the yeas totalled £6S,S00,17S and the expenditure amounted to 6ft,S15,S53 be leaving, an. excess of receipts over expenditure of .. . . . £1,984,325 this The unexpended balance brought forward from the previous vear .. .. .. 2,591,153 Leaving a balance to be adjusted, when final entries are made inTreasury books of . . .. £4,575,47S . The principal increases in revenue, compared with the estimate, wereCustoms and excise .. .. £3,192,779 Income tax .. .. .. 636,344 Other heads of direct taxation .. 502,610 Repayment of interest on loans raised by the Commonwealth for the states .. .. .. 279,821 £4,611,560 Sundry inercases and decreasesNet decrease ... ... 206,382 BILL - Not increase .. .. £4,405,178 W it h the large volume of imports throughout the year, and the consequent heavy Customs duties, a considerable in crease above theestimate for the year was anticipated, but the abnormal receipts did not continue during the last two months, so that the estimate of Customs :ind excise revenue which will be available for expenditure during 1925-6 w i ll have to be made with considerable caution. The increase in the income tax revenue is due to the special efforts made to issue the whole of the assessments before the close of the year, and the endeavour to collect arrears. The main increase in the revenue from other forms of direct taxation was contributed by the land tax, the estate duties tax, and the entertainments tax, but owing to refunds of war-time profits tax, the estimate of revenue from that source was not realized. creases in the expenditure above the estimate wereOrdinary votes of the departments, excluding business undertakings. Business undertakings .. Spocial Appropriations, other than war and repatriation .. Miscellaneous services .. War and repatriation services .. Interest on loans raised for the states .. .. .Decreases occurred under the following heads:Special defence provision .. £18,112 Additions, new works, and buildings .. .. 59,734 Naval construction and defence reserve .. . . 1,000,000 1,077,846 Net increase . . .. As previously explained, it has not been possible, at this early date, to obtain the' expenditure in any detail. details of the increase cannot, therefore, nt this moment be furnished. However, the additional expenditure above the estimate which has been authorized is known, and this will serve to indicate the directions in which the increase has occurred. The increase in the ordinary votes of the department, other than business undertakings, £234,205, is made up as fol lows :Department of the Treasury Home and Territories Department . . 41,382 Department of Trade and Customs .. 80,588 Department of Works and Railways 10,288 Other Departments, sundry increases and decreases-ne t increase Total net increase . . The increase of £90,341 in the Treasury was made up almost wholly taxation expenditure. The amount provided in the Estimates for payment to Dr Earle Page! the states for the collection of Commonwealth income tax was insufficient. An additional amount of £90,000 was, therefore, provided. Of the increase of £41,382 in the Department of Home and Territories, £17,000 was on account of Northern Territory general services. That amount was required for relief of distress due to unemployment, increased shipping service subsidies, the appointment of a Land Board, the improvement of educational services, the relief expedition for the white .women who were lost, and the clearing of poisonous vegetables The in - from stock routes. A sum of £7,000 was required for interest on Northern Territory loans, but a saving of a like amount was made in the interest payable from special appropriations. The balance £234,205 of the increase was to cover the electoral .. 722,729 ofiice expenditure, due mainly to altera.. 65,089 tions in the electoral law, special print.. 179,114 ing for the meteorological office, and the 37,424 establishment of a statistical bureau in Tasmania. The increase in the expendi.. 2SG,170 ture of the Department of Trade and £1,524,731 Customs was £80,588, of which £16,000 was required for the administration of the Commerce Act, chiefly in the direction of dealing with perishable products. That waa accompanied by an increase of fees. An amount of £26,000 had to be provided for lighthouse services. That increase was due to a greater use of £446,SS5 contract steamers than had been anticipated, and to a special arbitration award governing lighthouse keepers. The The exact balance of £38,000 was on account of the general customs administration, and in that connection it must be remembered that the volume of goods handled by the department during last financial year showed an increase much greater proportionately than any increase in expenditure, and was the greatest in the history of - the department. The Arbitration Court award after the Estimates were framed affected almost every officer in the Service, and materially increased the expenditure. .. £90.341 That factor must be borne in mind when considering the increases of departmental expenditure, because .the effect was felt by every department. The increase of . . 11,606 £10,28S in the Department of Works and Railways was due to additional amounts . . £234,205 having been provided to cover urgent expenditure in connection with repairs to of and maintenance of buildings. Although the expenditure for 1924-5 was £234,205 in excess of the estimate, yet, when comcess of the estimate. pared with the actual expenditure for 1923-4, the increase was only £11,717. The increase of £722,729 in business undertakings was made up as follows:Postmaster-General's Departmentincrease .. . - .. £7SS,3U collect the tax. Commonwealth Railways-decreas e Net increase .. .. £722,729 The basic wage and telephone officers' arbitration awards have resulted in increased annual expenditure of £280,000. Since the Estimates for the year were framed, a re-weighing of mails was made under the agreement with the Commonwealth and State Eailways Departments. That test resulted in an annual increase of £103,000 in the cost of carriage mails. Additional amounts were vided for the repair and maintenance telegraph and telephone lines. over, the provision of new services ceeded during the year at a greater pace than had been anticipated, especially connection with telephones. The decrease of £65,585 on Commonwealth railways was accounted for by decrease of £105,699 on the Port Augustations), Oodnadatta railway, and an increase. £40,114 on other Commonwealth rail- .services ways. The Port Augusta-Oodnadatta line is at present being worked by the Government of South Australia on behalf with of the CommonAvealth, but the Estimates for 1923-4 were framed on. the assumption that the working of the line would be taken over by the Commonwealth Railservices, way Department from the 1st January, was £128,247 above the. estimate. last. That action was, however, deferred, and the estimated expenditure was not incurred. Of the increase of £40,114 in otlier Commonwealth railways, an additional £10,201 was provided for railoffset way surveys, and £29,913 for the Kalfrom goorlie to Port Augusta, Northern Terripensions tory, and Queanbeyan to Canberra railways. The revenue of the Port to Kalgoorlie line was considerably above the estimate, and the additional earnings involved increased haulage. Further expenditure was authorized for - extrapaid by the states. ordinary repairs. The increase of £65,0.89 in special appropriations was comprised of sundry increases and decreases. Maternity allowance - payments .were -£l-7-,000_inex[33] An amount of' £61,655 was paid to Tasmania under the Tasmanian Grant Act 1924. That pay-; ment represented the lottery tax collected' by the Commonwealth from the 1st July to the date on which the state began to The expenditure on 65,585 other special appropriations was £160,888 above the estimate; the. chief items that, accounted for the increase were:-Iro n and steel products bounty, £37,000; 'sulphur bounty, £32,000; advance under , the an .Hop Pool Agreement Act, £24,500; wine export bounty, £21,000; payments to 'the Dried Fruits Export Control Board', of the dried fruits export charges, £19,000; ,and State Public Service pensions payable under the Constitution, £12,000. - The increase of £179,114 in the misof cellaneous services was composed wholly proof' unforeseen expenditure-£14,00 0 for of royal commissions, £6,000 for compensaMoretion to loyalists, £10,000 for British Empropire Exhibition, £5,000 advance to the Meat Council, £55,000 interest on the adin vance made by the Commonwealth Bank in London pending the raising of a loan (a corresponding saving was effected in a the expenditure under special appropria£10,000 grant to Territory of New of Guinea for medical purposes, £4,000 for of specialist in port administration, £20,000 for bounties to growers of - doradilla grapes, and £15,000 for coping the rinderpest outbreak. mainder of the increase represented The renumerous other similar items. In connection with war and repatriation the expenditure on war pensions* The expenditure also showed a slight increase over the actual expenditure of 1923-4. That wpuld seem to indicate that the reductions resulting from pensioners going off the pension list were more than by new pension payments resulting marriages of soldier pensioners, to additional children, and new - applications from soldiers whose war inAugusta juries had developed. The increase in interest on loans raised for the states, viz., £286,000, was offset by a similar increase in the amount re' Those details of the expenditure are all that are available at present.

IMMIGRATI ON BILL. , SECOND BEADING. Debate resumed from 2nd July (vide page 688), on motion .by Mr Bruce.That the hill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Charlton had:moved, hy way of amendmentiThat after the word ""now"" the following words he inserted:-""withdraw n and redrafted to provide more adequate provisions regarding alien immigration, and for the reconsideration of the drastic proposals to Australian citizens."" : . Mr OKEEFE (Denison) [2.38] - I think that it will be conceded by all honourable members that the debate on this bill has been most interesting. The measure has been divided by every speaker info two parts, each of which has its own peculiar interest to the people of the Commonwealth. So far as the first part of the bill is concerned, I intend to support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), on the ground that not sufficient provision is made to restrict the immigration of undesirable aliens. As to the present necessity for a policy of immigration there is a great difference of opinion, but if for the proper development and prosperity, and particularly the future defence of this country, a policy of immigration is necessary, let us have it, but only if governed by two conditions, which also are absolutely necessary for the future prosperity and defence of the country. The first of those two conditions is that the immigrants shall, be assured of employment without displacing Australians. Is that the case today? I ask any honourable member who has travelled in any part of the country recently whether he has not met numbers of immigrants who, although they have been here only a little while, are already swelling the ranks of the unemployed? Only yesterday I met, in Prahran, an English immigrant who was unknown to me. He asked me if I could direct him to a certain place in Prahran where he thought there was a chance of his obtaining employment. Having given him the necessary directions, I engaged in further conversation PAPER. with him, in the course of which I inquired how long he had been in Australia. He replied that he had been here for nearly three years. When asked if he was seeking employment, he replied in the affirmative. He. told me that this winter was the worse he had yet experienced; he had recently returned from the country, where for eight or nine weeks he had taken another man's place on a farm, but on the return of the former'employee he was discharged. For' two or three weeks he had been out of employment, and he stated that if he failed to get work that day he would be in a precarious position. I judged him to be a man who would deport make a worthy citizen of Australia if employment were available for him. When I inquired if there were more immigrants similarly situated, he replied that there were hundreds of them; he added that as soon as he had saved sufficient money he would return to England. I protested that Australia was a better country than England, but he said that that was not so, because of the difficulty of obtaining employment here. I asked him what occupation he followed, and he said that he was a dyer, but that, having failed to obtain employment in his own trade, he had been, and still was, prepared to accept employment of any description. Many of our newspapers, as well as honourable members on the other side, argue that we should adopt a vigorous policy of immigration in order to fill the vacant spaces of Australia. While honourable members speak and editors write in that strain, tradesmen are being brought here at a time when numbers of our tradesmen are out of work. Before people come here as a result of an immigration policy costing the country enormous sums of money, it should be laid down definitely that) not only should employment be found for these men on arrival, but that they should not displace Australians. The second condition which I consider should govern immigration is that the people who come here-fro m whatever countryshould conform to Australian standards of living and Australian ideals. Do the immigrants who come here conform ta Australian standards of living? During this debate, as well as in sworn evidence before commissions, it has been frequently stated that there are in Australia today numbers of immigrants whose standard of livin g is far below that which we desire should be maintained in this country. - Maltese and other southern Europeans have been spoken of. A few years ago due of our wealthiest mining corporations decided to employ a number of Maltese, probably with the idea of getting them to accept a lower rate of wages than was paid to Australian miners. Two points have never yet'been satisfactorily cleared up-ho w the corporation managed to evade the provisions of the Contract Immigrants Act which prohibit the importation of. .labour under contract, and whether these Maltese worked for a lower rate of wages. It is certain, however, that they congregated in what was afterwards known as the Maltese quarter of the township adjoining the property of the mining company, and when the conditions in which they were living became known, there was such an outcry that force of public opinion compelled the local authorities to make them improve their residences and their ways of living, in conformity with Australian standards. But try as they might, the local authorities could never get these men to live up to the ideals of the Australians with whom they were working. The second part of the bill proposes to give the Government powers which should never be given to any government. This Parliament will be going back 100 years if it agrees to the proposed new sections 8AA and 8AB. Many of us when we were young came across men, good citizens of Australia, who had been deported from Great Britain for offences against the in dustrial laws of that country. Some of them had been transported for life. have a vivid recollection of one very fine old chap who was living in a hut close to where I was born. W it h others I used to take him his food. He was near his end, and was being kept in food by hi3 neighbours."" On one occasion the following conversation took place:- "" Were you sent out here, Tim? "" "" I was, and I cannot get back again."" "" We r e you in prison?"" "" I was convicted and sent out here."" "" Why were you sent out? "" "" For knocking pigs off a hen roost."" The phrase "" for knocking pigs off a hen roost "" was frequently used in Tasmania in contempt of the paltriness of the offences for which many men had been deported from Great Britain . instance, the old man of whom I speak had been deported for the term of his natural life because he had broken, one of the industrial laws of his country, and the Government's proposal takes us' back to those days. Many of the men who laid the foundation of Tasmania's prosperity were sent out here for offences of that k in d ; and their sons and grandsons are among the very best of Australian citizens today, having reached the highest places in public life, and having had bestowed upon them the highest gifts at the disposal of the Australian people. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) opened his speech, which received so much commendation from honourable members on the Government side, with the phrase-- 1 The fundamental right of a self governing democracy is the right to determine the composition of its people. To that very fine-sounding phrase, to which all honourable members would readily subscribe, the honourable member should have addedThe fundamental right of every unit in a self-governing democracy is to have a fair trial in the light of day by unbiased judges and the opportunity to call evidence in his defence. The honourable member and the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), another shining light at the bar, know that even the vilest criminal is entitled to a fair trial in open court, and to call any evidence he chooses in his defence. But as the honourable member for Kooyong did not qualify his remarks in the direction I have suggested, he evidently stands for a Minister of the Crown having in in dustrial cases the power of deportation without trial. I Mr LATHAM - That is to be altered, I am pleased to say.",29
61,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,The honourable member did not say that he would support the proposal of the Government only if it were altered. Apparently he was so anxious to defend the bill which his own Government had brought down that he was ready to find every excuse for it . I do not remember him saying that he would support it only on condition that it was altered. ,35
62,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"Then I am pleased that the honourable member has been partly converted by the arguments advanced from this side of the chamber. For The only modification I heard him utter was when, in reply to an interjection, he said that no government could remain in office for a week if it used these powers wrongly. Let me suppose something which is likely to happen. A man of British birth practising as a barrister, convicted of an offence against the laws of this country ten, fifteen, or twenty years ago, may wiped out the stain on his character, and afterwards lived as a good, honest citizen, only to break the law again. If in these circumstances he should again be convicted and struck off the roll of barristers, would the honourable member for Kooyong support a government that would deport him without a trial?",35
63,Mr LATHAM,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,Not on those facts.,36
64,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"The case is on all fours with that of a man convicted for any other offence against the laws of his country. It has been said before, but it cannot be emphasized too often, that under the powers proposed to be given by the proposed new sections SAA and 8AB, the leaders of a union fighting for better conditions, or resisting an attempt on the part of employers to reduce wages, could be deported. Let us look at the other side of the question. If private railways or carrying companies or shipping companies combine to increase fares, charges, and freights to the detriment of those engaged in business, or those whose goods they are carrying, are they not, in the words of the bill, "" guilty of acts which hinder or obstruct to the prejudice of the public the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengars ? "" Undoubtedly they are - An y man with common sense would say so. Every month shipping companies combine for the purpose of increasing their earnings or dividends. But the Government would not dare to deport any one' in such circumstances. An owner of a steamer entering into such a combine may have been born outside Australia, and may have been' convicted as far back as twenty years ago for some offence against the laws. If he is again convicted of a similar offence would the Government dare to send him out of the country as it would the leader of a union ? In the early part of this year a shipping strike took place which affected Tasmania considerably, because of its geographical situation, and because the maintenance of a shipping service is the very life blood of that state. I do not wish to enter into the merits of that disputeor to say who was right or wrong. There were faults on both sides. But the trouble culminated in an entirestoppage of the shipping service between Tasmania and the mainland. On one occasion, when the Nairana was about to leave the wharf at Melbourne, 300 or 400 passengers for Tasmania, already on have board, were notified, a few minutes before the advertised time for the departure of the vessel, that as there was a dispute in progress between; the owners and the men the vessel would not make the trip . It was conceded on that occasion that the owners had broken the arbitration laws. Hobart, of course, was seriously affected by the disturbance, and I happened to be in attendance at a meeting of the shipping committee brought into existence by the Marine Board of the Tasmanian capital. It would not be suggested that many of those in attendance had any sympathy with unionism, but one of the members;, a leading citizen of Hobart, admitted that the law had been broken not by the seamen, but by the company. Did the Government take any action against the Tasmanian Steamships Proprietary ? No, it endeavoured to blame the seamen. If many of the fine types of Cornishmen, who have taken a prominent part i u the mining development - of Australia, and who have been ornaments of society, were alive today, they would be subject under the proposed law to deportation.",36
65,Mr CHARLTON,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,The same may besaid of men who have come to Australia from every part of the British Empire.,36
66,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,Exactly - A few years ago one of the greatest disasters that has ever occurred in the Commonwealth took .place on one of the mining fields on the west coast of Tasmania. Fifty odd men were either suffocated or starved to death through the negligence of the mine-owners. It had. long beeu known by the men working on the field that in the event of fire in the mine there was a possibility of such an occurrence.,36
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND, Does ' the honourable member intend to connect his remarks with the bill?,36
68,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"Yes . For some reason or other-owing , I suppose, to financial considerations-the owners had not provided a safety shaft by which the men could escape in the event of the main shaft being impassable. There was almost a strike over the matter, and shortly afterwards the dry timbers of the main shaft caught fire and 50 men were imprisoned. If the miners had gone on strike, by way of protest, against the failure of the owners to put down a safety shaft, they would .have been liable, under this bill, to deportation, provided they had not been born in Australia. Instances of the injustice of such a proposal could be multiplied. I regard this as panic legisla-. tion, which can never be effective for any considerable time, and always has to be repealed. I imagine that recent events in the political world have stirred up the supporters of the Government. The election in New South Wales seems to ""have partially paralysed the Ministry, and recent happenings in Tasmania have apparently completed the paralysis. One can imagine Ministers assembling to' consider the position, and my old friend and colleague, the Honorary Minister (Mr Atkinson), saying to his confreres in Cabinet, ""We shall have to do something. Tasmania has gone Labour. We must show that we are a strong Government."" No doubt, a similar attitude would be adopted by Ministers who hail from New South Wales. The position - of the Ministry seems to be helpless. They have been assailed from all quarters. In New South Wales the subject of cruiser construction has brought a hornet's nest about their ears, and in Victoria, owing to the partial closing tories, thousands of people have been thrown out of employment.",36
69,Mr GABB,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,What about the hop industry ?,37
70,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"A long series of blunders has been committedwith respect to that small, though not - unimportant, industry in Tasmania, and this has intensified the feeling against the Government. The refusal of the reasonable request of the Premier of Tasmania for an investigation into the financial relations between Tasmania and the Commonwealth has also heightened the indignation of the people of my state.",37
71,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,How does the honourable member connect these remarks with immigration?,37
72,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"I think that I am within my rights in pointing out the acts for which the Government has been condemned in various states, and my contention is that in view of the general condemnation, and the near approach of the elections, the Government has brought down this bill to lead the people to believe that it is composed of strong men. A number of Tasmanians engaged in the hop industry have been practically ruined, and they have no chance of recovering their position for some years, because of the bungling by the present Government. I understand that they t re about to form a hop-growers union, and since nearly all of them are small growers, who do not employ labour, they may create an industrial disturbance. If so, they will be liable, under the provisions of the present bill, to deportation.",37
73,Mr SEABROOK,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,Utte r rubbish!,37
74,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"The honourable member who has interjected may, possibly, be embroiled in this trouble, but as I understand that he is an Australian by birth he cannot be deported. One could almost excuse the Government for bringing down this measure if it had any hope of accomplishing its purpose. We all know that a great industrial upheaval is imminent. The names of three or four persons have been mentioned, and it is at these individuals that the bill is directed. If Ministers and their supporters believe for a moment that the passing of this measure will in any way prevent the upheaval, their of facaction gives no cause for surprise. But will it do so? Any man who is acquainted with the Australian workman will know perfectly well that legislation like this is ?jound to have a result exactly opposite to that which the Government thinks it will have. It has frequently been said of late that half of the industrial troubles and threatened industrial troubles of recent times have been due to the actions of certain men in Australia. Why has not the Government taken its courage in its hands, and used the power that it already possesses ? The great majority of workers in Australia have no more time for the illegal acts of these men than I have. The arm of the law is surely long enough and strong enough to rea-jh those men and to punish them! For some reason or other, that has not been done. Yet panic legislation is introduced with the object of preventing industrial disturbances! I have always been in favour of arbitration, because I do. not know of a better means for effecting the settlement of industrial disputes. Until I do see a better method I shall continue to favour arbitration. Every man must admit that up to a certain point it has proved very effective. It would have been more effective had the different Governments in the last few years made access to the Arbitration Court quick, easy, and cheap. They have not done so. Many of the wrong actions, or allegedly wrong actions, of those who have been subject to the decisions of the Arbitration Court, were due to the fact that access to the court was not as quick and as easy as it should have been, and as it would have beer. if the Government had amended the act in certain necessary directions. experience gained in the working of legislation will show where it is defective and faulty. The arbitration law was to some extent experimental. do not hold a brief for those who broke away from the Arbitration Court, but I have been greatly amused to hear the howls of protest against that action by men who hold political beliefs similar to those that were held by the men who fought tooth and nail in this Parliament against the passage of the Arbitration Act. They were opposed to arbitration then, but they have been compelled to admit that it has exercised a very beneficial effect in the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. If the workers will not submit to arbitration, they cannot be forced to work. same way, the shipping companies cannot be compelled to run their ships. I know that the great body of the Australian workers believe in arbitration; and do not sympathize with wrongful or illegal acts, but those men are likely to be incensed at legislation which, when an industrial dispute occurs, may render them liable to be arraigned and deported. I have not within the last few years been found in agreement with sentiments that have been expressed by the right honourable 'member for. North Sydney (Mr. W. M."" Hughes), but I believe that h>. spoke truly last night when he - said that this bill would probably do the-very thing that ..if was - intended to prevent. great: body of the workers iin.,Australia would,"" I think, be behind the Govern? Afr. O'Keefe. ment if it used its present powers to impose reasonable punishment upon any man who broke the laws of this country; I am afraid that if the bill is passed there may be an attempt to make martyrs of a few men. I do not agree with, some of the actions of certain men, and I do not defend them, but if action is taken that will make martyrs of them the trouble that the Government wishes to prevent will be precipitated. I am keenly anxious that the shipping industry should remain untroubled, because Tasmania will suffer more than any other state from an upheaval. I support the amendment, because I believe that this action of the Government will hasten trouble. I want to see the bill withdrawn and another introduced containing more effective provisions regardOnly ing immigration, so that we may maintain our present standards of living and the purity of our race. Another reason for my support of the amendment is that II think the powers which the Government proposes to take are more drastic than any that have been asked for in the 24 years during which the Commonwealth Parliament has-been in existence. I know the temperament of the Australian workers perhaps better than some honourable members opposite. I have had a good deal to do with unionism since I was a boy, and I know that 95 per cent, of the workers who are trade unionists will resent this attempt to deprive them of their liberties or to jeopardize those liberties in any way. T do not want to again see the-shipping In the services of Tasmania disrupted. I desire peace. I want to see the wheels of industry kept going, and the ships running from one part of Australia to another. The Government would be acting wisely if , even at this eleventh hour, it tried to settle the dispute in some other way than by passing this. legislation. There is . not an honourable member opposite who really believes that the bill will bring any nearer the settlement of the . present trouble. They do, however, hold the belief that the exercise of such power3 will cause a terrible industrial crisis. I am loth to say it. but I think that the Government would welcome an industrial crisis; otherwise it would not The have brought down such an iniquitous measure, and tried'to pass it through : Parliament^.' - - -.: Hr. PATEBSON (Gippsland) [3.27] I wholly subscribe to the dictum that was so ably expressed by my learned friend, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham), that a self governing democracy has the inherent right to determine the composition of its people. I also believe that such a right must necessarily include the power to both restrict and expel. Every honourable member, no matter where he sits, must concede that much if he is in favour of the White Australia policy. Really the only question that arises is that which relates to the scope of the restrictions and the conditions governing expulsion. Clause 2 provides, inter alia, that the immigration into the Commonwealth of the following persons is prohibited:Any person declared by the Minister to be in his opinion, from information received from the Government of the United Kingdom or of any other part of the British dominions or from any foreign Government, through official or diplomatic channels, undesirable as habitant' of, or visitor to, the Commonwealth. That particular part of the clause has not been referred to by many speakers. 1 cannot conceive of this Government being deluged with warnings from other governments regarding persons who are believed by those governments to be undesirable. It appears to me that when any government learned of the proposed departure of a person who was considered undesirable it would be more likely to wish him "" God-speed "" than to send to another government a warning to prevent his entry into that country. Many honourable members opposite have spoken against, but have really argued in favour of, the restrictive provisions. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mv. Makin), in the light-hearted and flippant manner which is characteristic of him when addressing this House, last night went back over the history of the last 100 years in an attempt to find an argument . with which to oppose the bill. He related the case of a gentleman who rose to a position of honour and importance in New South Wales, although he was a son of a man who had been deported from the Old Country. That argument, to me, appeared to be more in. favour of the deportation of that man than against it. Australia certainly reaped an advantage.",37
75,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"But look at what. - England lost!  Opposition (Mr Charlton) and, I think, . also the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), spoke very strongly against the bill, but yet argued in favour of its restrictive provisions. If the bill had been introduced with the intention of opening wide the door to unrestricted immigration, most of the arguments of those honourable members would have been to the point j but they were strangely outof place if they were intended to be arguments against this measure. Both the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Darling referred to the polyglot population of America, and the fact that that country is closing its doors except to very limited numbers of certain classes of immigrants. They pointed out that the tide of rejects from America was turning in the direction of Australia, and for some reason or other - they denounced the Government in this connection. It seems to me that they an in- should rather have congratulated the Government for the action it took during the recess, which resulted in such a tremendous diminution of the influx of southern Europeans during the first quarter of this year as compared to the last quarter of last year. They should have further congratulated the Government upon introducing a clause in this bill which they might themselves have drafted in collaboration. The Leader of the Opposition dealt at some length with the desirability of preventing too many immigrants coming to Australia at a time when its economic and industrial conditions were such that excessive immigration would be likely to bring about unemployment. If the honourable gentleman will turn to clause 3 of this bill he will find the phrase used in a proposed new sectionon account of the economic, industrial, or other conditions existing in the Commonwealth. The proposed section in which this phrase appears is designed to give effect to what the honourable gentleman considers so desirable. The honourable member forDarling referred to the difficulty of. assimilating certain peoples - within our population, and again we find in clause 3 of the bill that power to deal with this matter is given.to the Government.",39
76,Mr GABB,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"I call attention to the state of the. House... [Qxtorum formed.!]  ahle member for Angas (Mr Gabb) performed his usual function, I was bringing under the notice of the House the fact that clause 3, which increases the power of the Government in restricting immigration, deals with people who are unlikely to be readily assimilated. The clause is designed to exactly meet the argument put forward by the honourable member for Darling. It has been said that there is no need for any of these clauses, that the Government already has power to do all that needs to be done, and the additional powers proposed to he given under this bill are entirely superfluous and unnecessary. In spite of the fact that all honourable members opposite appear to be in agreement on that point, the Leader of the Opposition, who made and stressed the point, has moved an amendment to the effect that the bill should be "" withdrawn and redrafted to provide more adequate provisions regarding alien immigration."" Honourable members opposite say that the .powers which the Government seeks under this bill are entirely unnecessary, yet they move and support an amendment which would have the effect of giving further powers than those for which the Government make provision in this bill.",39
77,Mr BLAKELEY,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"May the honourable member be reminded that the bill is in two parts?  that the bill is in two parts, but honourable members opposite contend that the first part of the bill is unnecessary, and have even suggested that it is introduced as a sort of sugar coating for the latter part of the bill, which deals with deportation. I am pointing out that the terms of the amendment which they are supporting suggest, not only that the first part of the bill is necessary, but also that its provisions should be made more drastic. Other very puzzling contradictions have been apparent in the speeches from honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) made an excellent speech, in which he talked very plainly about the necessity of preserving our racial purity. 'He told.us exactly where he stands in regard to that matter. I am sure that all of us who are sprung from British stock must realise the advantage of living in a country whose people are 98 per cent, of British stock, and must feel that it is our duty to endeavour to keep that stock as pure as possible. When we realise that the population of Australia contains a greater percentage of British blood than does the population of Great Britain itself, we cannot listen to a statement of the kind without a quickening of the pulse. Whilst the honourable member for Reid expressed himself very plainly with regard to alien immigration, other honourable members opposite were"" not anything like so definite. Some referred to the influx of Italians in a way that suggested that they loathed them as usurpers of other men's jobs, and yet while making statements of that kind they seemed to retract, and in the next breath said they esteemed them as particularly good settlers. When' I listened to honourable members opposite speaking in this contradictory way, I could not help being reminded of an explanation given in my school days. A boy who was very cross-eyed attended a certain school, and another boy with a sense of humour more highly developed than his sympathies for this particular affliction suggested that the reason it had befallen the .fir3t boy was because in going home in the dark he found it necessary to keep one eye fixed on a dark wood nt one side of the road, whilst he had to keep the other fixed on the cemetery. I am disposed to believe that the explanation for the contradictory statements to which we have listened from honourable members opposite on the influx of aliens is that they were endeavouring to keep one eye on the welfare of the Australian-born cane-cutter, whilst the other strayed in the direction of the naturalized alien voter at the next elections. The immigration agreement has been criticized under cover of this bill, and it has even been said that the Government is to blame for having brought it forward without consulting the states. In my judgment, the immigration agreement is merely an offer by the British and Commonwealth Governments to the State Governments. It does not bind them in any way, nor does it force anything upon them. It is merely an. invitation to them to accept money at an exceedingly low rate of interest. It is almost humorous to suggest that any arrangement which offers money at the low rate of 1 per cent, interest should need to be forced upon any one. The arrangement proposed is particularly liberal to the states. During the first five years the British Government will take up one-half of the interest bill, the Commonwealth Government will take one-third, and the states availing themselves of the agreement will have to pay only the remaining one-sixth of the interest bill. If the inoney lent to the states under the agreement is raised at 6 per cent., they will have to pay only 1 per cent, interest on what they receive for the first five years. For the second term of five years the division of interest obligation proposed is one-third to Great Britain, one-third to the Commonwealth, and one-third to the states. To suggest that the. Commonwealth Government is to blame for bringing forward an agreement of that kind and leaving it to the State Governments to take advantage of it or not, passes my comprehension. The Leader of the Opposition quoted a statement from a Queensland report to the effect that immigrants unable to obtain employment themselves are still inviting ;Others' to come out to Australia. I do riot doubt that such a statement is to be found in the report, but I certainly do doubt that such invitations would have much effect in inducing people to come to this country. I believe that such an invitation from a man who had been here for some time and had heen unable to secure employment would be futile nine times out of ten. The lionorable member for Beid talked at some length of the necessity of a quota-as did also the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W. M . Hughes)in order to ensure our racial purity. I believe the most important thing is not so much the number of aliens who come into the country as the ratio which that, number bears to those of British blood. America at the present time is effectively occupied. She has, therefore, a .very strong moral claim to enact legislation restricting immigration. Australia is not in a similar position. It is not effectively occupied, and its area is a little greater than that of the United States of America. It seems to me that we should be very careful not to offend the susceptibilities of other nations. I believe that the best way to secure our racial purity would be, not so much by cutting down in an. extremely drastic way the number of aliens who may be admitted, as by doing the utmost we can to increase the number of British immigrants, so that the ratio of aliens to British shall be very small indeed. I do not share the fears expressed by some honourable members with regard to the possible increase of unemployment in the event of considerable numbers of people coming here from the Old Country. If we get the right type of men who are willing to work and willing to go to the country rather than remain in the cities, th^re need be no such fear. It has been proved that every man settled in the country brings about sufficient work ih the city to provide for the employment of five men. The proposed amendment of section 5 of the principal act is apparently designed to deal with stowaways, and seems to me to be very necessary. I come now to the deportation clauses of the hill. I was very much surprised last night to hear the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. W. M . Hughes), with his legal training, say that there is no need for these clauses. The ordinary layman, in the comparatively dim twilight of his powers to construe legal verbiage, is able to see at a glance that the provisions of the act relate to persons who have been convicted within a period of three years of their arrival in Australia, whereas the scope of this bill is much wider. It has been said hy some honourable members opposite, I think principally by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Anstey), that the deportation provisions of the hill are a blow at trade unionism. I do not believe that for a moment. I believe, however, that if we can suppress agitators who are responsible for so much industrial unrest, trade unionists need not be haunted with the fear of unemployment. I believe in unionism, both industrially and commercially, in a highly organized state of society, and, I believe also, that sections not organized go to the wall.",40
78,Mr YATES,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"Does the honourable member believe in compulsory unionism?  ago since I was chief - president of the Victorian Farmers Union, and I did what I could to advance the interests of the members of that organization. We have been told that the measure is directed particularly at one section of the community. Even ifit were, which I deny, it could ' only become, opera-' tive if that section, . or agitators leading it, declared war on the rest of the community. In circumstances such as that, definite action under the measure would be justifiable. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), now interjecting, to whose, eloquence I gave a silent hearing the other night, in picturesque phrasing gave a graphic description of the deplorable conditions of the wage-earners of bygone days.",41
79,Mr YATES,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"What he said was a fact.  lengths wage-earners of former times may have gone in endeavouring to improve their conditions, they would have my entire sympathy, but I remind the House that we live in a different world industrially and socially compared with that so well described by the honourable member for Batman. The conditions of the worker today are infinitely better than those enjoyed. by the workmen in any other country. I do not believe that the worker should cease to strive to still further'improve his lot, but I think that he has ""arrived at a stage in the realization of a better living standard when he is no longer justified in taking the extreme step of holding up transportation, paralyzing industry, and causing unemployment and suffering to his fellow' men. There are constitutional means for achieving his ends. I believe in employing those constitutional methods. A man who defies our laws and causes suffering and misery by paralyzing industry, holding up transportation and causing unemployment, should, if not a native-born, be sent to the country whence he came. Australia is a hospitable country, and men who offend against its hospitality should be dealt with. The powers of the bill certainly are wide. I had only one fault to find with it in its original form. In my opinion the powers contained in clause 8 a, b, were too wide. Therefore, I welcome the amendment which has been circulated by the Government, because, in my opinion, it will entirely remedy any faults which could have been found with the bill originally. . N TATIV E S ] Bill I do not fear that the Government will; use unwisely the powers which this measure will' put into its hands. T am con-. fident that if , as the wheels of time revolve, lionorable members opposite or their descendants, should, by a change in"" political' fortune, find themselves on this side of the-House supporting a Labour. Government, they can be depended' upon not to misuse the provisions of this measure. No government would dare to do so. One argument against the bill is: that other countries might not allow deportees from Australia to be landed on their shores. A well-known fable in themythology of an ancient civilization tells of the fate of a certain undesirable character who, when cast out from among his people and thrown over a cliff, was rejected by the sea as unclean, and was suspended for all time midway between the top of the' cliff and the sea. A more recent case was mentioned a day or two ago by the Leader of the Labour Opposition (Mr Charlton), who reminded the House that a man named Freeman, who was deported during the war, was obliged to travel to and fro across the Pacific before eventually he found a landing place. In his case there was some doubt as, to the country of his origin. I do not believe that many persons will come within the deportation provisions of this bill, but experience during the war disclosed that no country can reasonably reject responsibility for its national progeny.",42
80,Mr CHARLTON,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"This bill is aimed at a man who has been here for 30 years, and is only 31 years of age.  of his birth cannot evade its responsibility. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) last night declared that for the first time in the history of Australian legislation it was proposed to make a distinction between a Britisher in Australia and a native-born Australian by prescribing different treatment for one as compared with the other. It seems to me that the only reason why an Australian-born citizen who may commit offences specified in this bill, cannot be deported, is that we could not expect to foist upon another country a native-born Australian who was unpalatable to ourselves. Such a man is our own responsibility. It may be urged that a. naturalized citizen has cast off his original nationality, and that in the event of deportation from Australia, the country of his origin could not be expected to receive him. The question of naturalization cropped up during the war. We discovered then that other countries claimed their nationals regardless of whether or not they had become naturalized in the country of their domicile, and it appears to me that foreign countries cannot .have it both ways. If during the war they claimed their nationals to fight for them, they cannot very well refuse to accept them if their presence in Australia is undesirable. I conclude by saying that I whole-heartedly support the second reading of the bill. Debate (ou motion by Mr CUNNINGHAM) adjourned. House ncljourned nt 3.50 p.m.",42
