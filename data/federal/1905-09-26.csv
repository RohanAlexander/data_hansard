Whether his attention has been directed to the following paragraph in the Hamilton Spectator :"" MOTOR v. TELEGRAPH - A striking instance of a motor bicycle outstripping a telegram was afforded here on Monday. A gentleman left Casterton for Hamilton on a motor at 10.30 that morning, leaving behind him a telegram for despatch to this office. That message was lodged a few minutes after his departure, but it did not reach the party to whom it was addressed till 12.35 p m-j or half-an-hour after the sender had arrived in Hamilton on his bicycle.

14,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :Reports have been received showing that, in the majority of the cases in which long hours were worked by mail post drivers, those hours have now been reduced. The question of providing in contracts for a maximum number of hours, during which the men employed on coaches carrying mails under contract with the Postmaster-General's Department shall drive is receiving consideration, but there are difficulties in applying one rule in this respect throughout the Commonwealth.

15,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST," I move That a sum not exceeding ^660,185 be granted to His Majesty for or towards defraying the services of the year ending 30th June, 1906. The House has already had before it this session two monthly Supply Bills, and the money voted will all have been expended by the end of September; but as the Estimates for the year have now been laid before honourable members, and the Bill which I am about to introduce makes provision only for the ordinary routine services of the Commonwealth, it is proposed to ask Parliament in this case to As honourable members are aware, new wdrks, was acadditions, and buildings have been provided for by the passing of the Appropriation Works and Buildings Bill. The only item in this Bill which is in any wayout of the ordinary is that which provides for the payment of the half-year's subsidfor the Ocean Mail Contract, so soon as that contract has been ratified', by Parliament. The money necessary for the payment of the subsidy until 30th June, is at present in London awaiting the ratification of the contract. Although the service under the contract with the Orient Company is being carried out, the company has not received any subsidy, as it is provided in the contract that no payment shall Le made until the contract has been ratified. It is necessary that the Treasurer should have funds to transmit to London as cheaply as possible, namely, by drafts payable at sixty days after sight, and, if the proposed vote of ^60,000 is agreed to, steps will be taken to have the money ready in London to meet the payments as they become due up to the end of the year. Beyond this, there is really nothing new in the Bill.",14
16,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST," I suppose that in this Chamber we still recognise that the proposal of the Government to take supply, whether for one month or two months, furnishes a legitimate occasion for a review of the political situation, because such a request to the House involves, as a rule, a state of affairs which I regret to TRADE : say does not exist on the present occasion. The relations between the House and the Government, especially on questions of supply, have, as a general rule, involved confidence in the Government on the part of a majority of members. Now, unfortunately, with more or less truth, since the Federal Parliament began, there has never been a Ministry with an absolutely constitutional majority behind it, in governing the affairs of the Commonwealth. Neither the first nor the second Federal Ministry had any such majority, and when the second Federal Ministry returned from the country, it was in an even less strong position than it occupied in the first Parliament. It was reduced to a pitiable condition, from which the then Prime Minister took the earliest opportunity to escape. The succeeding Ministry was in an even weaker position, because we witnessed the extraordinary spectacle of a Ministry sitting on the Treasury bench with the support of one-third of the House, while the other two-thirds sat on the Opposition benches. That Ministry gave way to another Administration, which was the first under the Commonwealth to possess, an absolute majority. Honorable MEMBERS - Oh , no !",14
17,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"It had an absolute majority, because honourable members cannot ignore the fact that a majority of two is a majority-as compared with the state of things which existed before, the Ministryhad an Overwhelming majority. At any rate, it was a majority, although I admit that it was on the narrowest possible lines. All that can be said is that the state of affairs which' existed whilst the Ministry was in office was infinitely better than any that had obtained before, and - infinitely better also than that which now prevails. One of the results of possessing such a narrow majority was that the gentlemen in office naturally felt sensitive, because they recognised that it became them, so long as they held the reins of power, to maintain an attitude of absolute independence. Therefore, when their majority became doubtful, they did not wait to be ejected from office, but invited Parliament to terminate an unhealthy state of affairs by appealing to the only power that could apply the remedy, namely, the electors. That policy was naturally- I was not surprised at it-distastefu l to the majority of honourable members of this House. There will always be a majority against the dissolution of Parliament if the majority has to decide the question; and so it was in this particular case. If honourable bers who sat on the Opposition benches had coalesced with the present Government, it would have been another matter altogether. If the Labour Party ancl the re-united Deakin party hadcome together upon the basis of a political alliance, they would have been perfectly justified-if they could have forgotten all that they-had ever saidin carrying on the business of the country. But the objection to the present state of affairs is that it runs right across the main principle of parliamentary government. The main attribute of parliamentary government 3 271.3 is that the power of the country should be in the hands of a Ministry supported by a majority of the members of the House, who, if a dissolution occurred at any moment, would face the country side by side with those to whom they had given the power to govern the country. That is the whole basis of parliamentary government. The use of parliamentary powers under any other conditions is altogether foreign to the historv of British Parliaments. If a crisis occurred tomorrow in any British Parliament, the Government would go to the country with those who had supported them; but in this case, we are face to face with the extraordinary position that there is no possible prospect of the gentlemen who siton the Treasury benches going to the country in alliance with those who keep them in power. On the contrary, that would be impossible. There was some hope that, .when the Inter-State Socialist Conference met a few months ago, some arrangements would have been made under winch the gentlemen in this House who are keeping the present Government in power, would be able to put their alliance or connection with the present Government on some tangible political footing. But the: authorities above my honourable friends of the Labour Party-the parliament of those who have the power to return them, or. rather, to nominate them-deliberatel y repudiated any political alliance with the preseijt Deakin Administration. They deliberatelv reserved to themselves the right to stand against the Deakin Government in the event of a general election. Therefore, the basis of parliamentary - responsibility, the responsibility of the men who are prepared to go before the electors to justify what they are doing in this House in support of a Government, does not exist in the present case. In fact it is no secret that whilst the mem- gentlemen below the gangway are supporting the Ministry, the Labour. authorities in Victoria are organizing an opposition to the present Prime Minister. If an election be held tomorrow or at the time when we. cannot prevent it from taking place-and that is generally the period at which elections are held-ther e is nothing more probable than that those honourable members who are now supporting the Government would be found ranged before the people, of the country against Ministers and: their immediate supporters. That is a most unhealthy and unsound state of things. How can we have parliamentary responsibility if public affairs are to be governed under an arrangement by which the Gober for five years. vernment are kept in power by gentlemen who reserve to themselves the right of doing all they can to drive Ministers out fice, in the event of an appeal to the try? So I say that there is no proper basis of Parliamentary confidence, so as the position of the present Government is concerned. My honourable friends beThe low the gangway, having tasted the sweets of office for a short time, and having shouldered the responsibilities of opposiis tion for a brief period, have had an perience which has disenchanted them. As a result, they are prepared to resume their former position- a position not of responsibility, but in which they are enabled to drive the Government in directions that would not otherwise travel, with the full rests upon no principle whatever. intention-afte r they have got all that they' can out of it-of casting it to winds. When the next appeal to the elechimself, tors takes place, I hope that it will be fair and square fight between honourable members occupying seats below the gangable way and the Opposition. In that great contest the Government and their direct supporters will become mere accidents. They will be scattered to the winds tween the power of these two opposing forces. Persons inside this endeavour to create all sorts of artificial situations, but when these issues come before the people, I think the latter will decide-and I hope finally-between the power which is possessed by my other representative. honourable friends below the gangway, and the cause which is advocated bers on the Opposition benches. Any chance of the eighteen or nineteen members who comprise the Government, and their direct supporters in a House of 75, and with 28 and 29 members belonging to the other two parties-survivin g an election in a position of power seems to me to be discuss public matters. absolutely hopeless.",15
18,Mr TUDOR,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Then why does not right honourable gentleman put the Governshould ment out of office?,16
19,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Whils t that is the. duty the Opposition, we have to recollect long as members of the Labour Party can make use of the Government, and so as the latter are willing to be drivenwilling to submit to the humiliation of being 'driven day after day, and month after month - the Opposition are positivelyPrime powerless.",16
20,Mr WATSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"In New South Wales they said that, of the right honourable mem",16
21,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"If they said it for five years, surely I may be permitted to say it of ofonce. But the Ministry in New South counWales, to which the honourable member refers, had the support of the Labour far Party, because the latter were in agreement with it upon one great line of reform. Ministry had the support of the Labour Party, not as a party which drove them, but as one which followed them. There a great difference between the two cases ex- - betwee n the position of a Government which receives the support of gentlemen who believe in some great principle for which it is fighting, and that of ' the it present Government, the support of which The Prime Minister did endeavour to provide .a the principle upon which the Labour Party, and his friends, could work toa gether. Whilst he was supposed to be a friend and ally of the late Government, the honour and learned gentleman openlv made an offer, to the Labour Party. There was a method underlying all his actions. The Inter-State Labour ""Conference was about beto meet - a gathering of gentlemen who settle the policy which certain members of House may this House have to follow.",16
22,Mr WATSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,We were there.,16
23,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The honourable member was there as one delegate amongst many, and he possessed no greater power than did any",16

25,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I am only anxious to get a word in occasionally. I trust that I am not exceeding my right in discussing public affairs. I know that it is becoming a subject of offence for any honourable member to avail himself of his parliamentary right to No doubt, if I would submit to be tutored by mv honourable the friends as to the precise way in which I address myself to public questions, I should receive a very generous hearing. of But I claim the right to express my own that so views in my own way.",16
26,Mr CARPENTER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The right honourable long member is not present very often.,16
27,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"When I was in office I was never absent from the House for a single day. When I occupied the position of Minister I threw all my private business to the wind's, and that, I think, is an example which others might fairly emulate. I should like the honourable member for Fremantle to recollect - and I make no boastful reference to the subject - that, such as my attendance is, it probably costs me a great deal more than the honourable member will ever earn, if he lives to be 100 years oldi.",16
28,Mr CARPENTER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Then it is a question of what the right honourable member earns?,17
29,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,When I ami present I should like - honourable members to be reminded of ithe fact that I have a right to address myself to a public question without a tumult in the House. Surely the drivers upon the box are all right. They do not need to grow restless. Surely they can listen to a public discussion. They occupy the easy and dignified position.,17
30,Mr WEBSTER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"We are not in the "" steerage "" now.",17
31,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Whereve r the honourable member may be, I think that he will be very much the same-easil y identified. However, I should like to take advantage of my presence today to point out the difference between the support which a party give to a Government upon national question, such as that which won for me the support of the Labour Party in ,New South Wales, and the present situation. The Prime Minister-as I have already said-brok e the compact that isted, with me when he extended an inviof tation to the Labour Party to accept the principle of protection, in which case and his friends were prepared to go to, and support, them. He endeavouredpaying slight attention, I think, to the position that he occupied in relation to colleagues and myself-to establish a conto nexion of principle-because , no doubt, protection has been his leading principle throughout his career-betwee n the Labour Party and himself and his friends, cause he stated that if that party would only make protection the leading plank their programme, he and his friends would become their ardent supporters. That peal was, perhaps, made at the wrong time. The honourable gentleman destroyed the rangements which then existed, but at same time there was a definite basis of public principle upon which such an ance might possibly be made. But what was the answer of the Socialist Parliament it met shortly afterwards ? As we all know, enormous efforts were used to engineer, through the Inter-State Labour Conference, the adoption of the principle of protection. But, as one of the delegates- I believe he was a protectionist, although I am not sure that he was-sai d very frankly to his Labour friends at the conference, "" Why 1 we are much better off as we are. We can put up So-and-so as a free-trader in a free-trade electorate, and So-and-so as a protectionist in a protectionist constituency, and we are not going to give up this opportunity to run both causes at the same time. In an electorate where there are a majority of free-traders, we fight for free trade, and, if possible, we return a free trader; but, in a protectionist electorate, we can put up a protectionist candidate."" In the latter case they fight for their man as a protectionist candidate, they vote for him as one, and they return him, if they can, as a protectionist.",17
32,Mr CARPENTER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,No ; Labour is first!,17
33,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"To honourable gentlemen who boast of their rigid adherence to great principles, the situation is one which may well cause the observer to feel amused.",17
34,Mr WATSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Some of the party do, not regard either free-trade or protection some great as a great principle.",17
35,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I have never had much political association with the honourable member; but when the connection between the Labour Party and mvself in New South exWales Parliament terminated, the leader that party spoke to me in terms very different from those which are employed by he the honourable member. There was no atover tempt to sneer, nor was any ungenerous reference made to me. On the contrary, the leader of the Labour Party in. the State Parmy liament testified in the most generous wav the honourable course I had always pursued in all important relations with that party.",17
36,Mr WATSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Hear , hear; but the .right' honourable member has since fallen away. beIt is he who is sneering.",17
37,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"My honourable friends are, of of course, so sensitive that once one begins to differ from them, one is accused of sneeraping at them. As a matter of fact, I am not. There is an absolute difference of opinion arbetween us, and I have been endeavouring the to show the grounds upon which I disagree with' the course they are taking at the preallisent time. If honourable members of the Labour Party were sitting in the Ministerial when corner with any intention, when going before the people of Australia, to take the responsibility of the Government policy on their shoulders, I should not have a word to say about their position. But imy point is that whilst they avail themselves of the powers of this Parli'amet to push tlieir views vo an extreme by using honourable members who do not believe in their principles-who , if they were free, would vote dead against them-the y fully intend when they face the people to disavow those honourable members. They are making use of them with the full intention, when that time comes, to stand against them-in many cases, to put up candidates against them.",17
38,Mr RONALD,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The wish is father to the thought.,18
39,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,I think that the honourable member is today the most precarious straw on the political current. I do not believe that he has by any means made his calling and election sure. I do not think that even his advocacy of Home Rule will bring about his return at the next election.,18
40,Mr WEBSTER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Why raise the sectarian cry ?,18
41,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,That is a new idea. Here we have a sapient member describing m< reference to Home Rule as a sectarian cry.,18
42,Mr WEBSTER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The right honourable gentleman is always ready to live by that cry.,18
43,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The honourable member should choose his epithets a little more wisely. But, as I have said, there is no connection between the Labour Party and the Government that would justify any pretence to a proper condition of parliamentary affairs; because the moment the responsibility of the Government for what is being done in this Parliament is put before the people, the Labour Party, instead of going on the public platforms ot Australia to'support the Ministry of whom they are making use, and to take a share of that responsibility, will adopt an absolutely different course. The Prime Minister, a short time ago, had only one ambition, and that was to take the sense of the Parliament on the engrossing, vital subject of preferential trade. That was the subject on which he soared to his highest nights of eloquence when before the people of Australia. He drew most enticing pictures of the enormous stretches of harvest fields which would, as if. *by magic, spread over the surface of Australia, the"" yield from which would find a safe and profitable market in the mother country. The honourable and learned member asked for an opportunity last session to take the opinion of the House with regard to the question, and I gave him a chance to discuss it. I admit that it was at a time of the session when the matter could not be fairly fought out, but, as the honourable and learned gentleman said, I offered him an opportunity early this session to again bring it forward, in order that the discussion might be completed, and a record taken of the opinion of the House. The honourable and learned gentleman has now been in office some two or three months, but has made no reference to the question. Was there a word about preferential trade in the Treasurer's Budget statement? I have not yet found an opportunity to read the Hansard, report of it, but I do not think there was. Was there a word in the Budget speech about this great policy, which was to be of such enormous advantage to Australia, and which was also to be of some service in bringing the bonds of empire more tightly and profitably, together""?",18
44,Mr CROUCH,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,A number of figures relating to the question were quoted by the Treasurer.,18
45,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,""" Preferential trade and fiscal peace "" was the motto on the banneof the Prime Minister's party at the last election. Now, however, we have a Government that is equally divided-on e half supporting preferential trade, and the other half in favour of fiscal strife. What is the policy of the Attorney-General, the Minister of Home Affairs, and the Minister of Trade and iCustoms? Their policy, when they were sitting in the Opposition corner, was based upon a cry of distress, which naturally awoke the .sympathies of those who did not know them; They had one surpassing anxiety, and that was to relieve certain Melbourne industries from the distress which the Tariff had inflicted upon them. This was notably their desire in regard to the iron industries. Their policy was one not of fiscal peace, nor even of preferential trade, because, according to them-, the only way to relieve the distress in the great iron industries of Melbourne was to increase the duties on iron imports from the mother country. What a mockery it would be-if there be any truth in this cry - to talk of preferential trade while professing, at the same time, to increase the duties on iron imports from the mother country. If the causes of the distress in these great trades in Melbourne are really traceable to the Tariff-to low duties, and not, as I believe, to a number of other circumstances with which the Tariff has nothing to do do not honourable members who face the question fairly know that in order to relieve that distress, the Tariff must be raised against our fellow-countrymen in Great Britain? If we opened the ports of Australia to the iron exports of the mother country, what a mockery it would be to tell the iron workers of this city that we were going to help them. They can be helped only by shutting out one of the biggest iron exporting countries.",18
46,Mr RONALD,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Can we not discriminate until I was interrupted. between imports from the mother country and those from foreign countries?,19
47,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I am pointing out to honourable member that if the duties are not increased against the great British iron exporters, tariff revision will bring no lief. Does he think that, if the duties left as they are against the mother country, there can be any substantial relief to iron foundries of Melbourne, by taxing Germany and the United States out of the Australian market? Although Australia is a great country, still it is a small market compared with many of the large marfor kets of the world, and does the honI orable member think that if duties remain as high as they now against the mother country, with her enoreach mous iron export and machinery trade, any its own opinion. substantial relief can be afforded to Melthink bourne iron workers by putting up the duties 100 per cent, against German and American goods?",19

51,The CHAIRMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"There is no eviduties dence before the Committee that preferenStates, tial trade is part of the policy of vernment. While the right honourable ber was giving a historical review, I did interfere; but I think he will see that a motion, preliminary to the introduction of a Supply Bill , it would hardly be, in ""order to debate a matter which is not before either the Committee or the House.",19
52,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I bow, sir, to your ruling at once, as it is my duty to do; should like to point out to you that the the British people conduct of the Government must always be open to criticism when they come down and ask for supp.lv.",19
53,The CHAIRMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Yes; and if the right honourable member had contented himself with complaining that the Government had not, for example, brought down a certain measure, he would have been'in order. He cannot, however, discuss the details of the question to which he was .referring.",19
54,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I was addressing myself to the very point you mention, sir, I was pointing out that the Government had been in office for some time, and that the the Budget speech did not contain a single word on the subject of preferential trade. I am criticising the conduct of the Governrement in not carrying out a matter which are they had announced a strong desire to proceed with. I was drawing attention to the the unhappy state of things which exists in the Cabinet. Whether we agree with the policy of preferential trade or not, we must all admit that it is one which is worthy in the highest degree of consideration. Either good or for evil,, it is a great policy. t may contain the germs of illimitable these good, or it may contain the germs of unare told mischief; and on such a subject country affected is entitled to have For instance, we may it a splendid thing for us, but the people of another country may think it very disadvantageous to them, and in that case they would ,be perfectly free to But my point is that it is impossible for a Government to stand in this position : That whilst the Prime is an ardent advocate for preferential trade, his colleagues have committed bethemselves by every possible declaration to bringing relief to the iron workers of Melbourne by increasing the duties on iron I say to honourable members, as I said before, "" Y o u may put the up 100 per cent, against the United or France, or Germany, or the GoBelgium, but, so long as you leave memthe Tariff as it stands against Engnot land, it is a cruel mockery to endeavour on to make the iron workers of Melbourne believe that it can give them any relief."" It is impossible to continue a method of fooling the people of the old country because we want some of our great products-and a very worthy object*, too-introduce d under better terms into her markets. It is absurd but I for us to pretend not fo see that are entitled to make sensible terms for themselves, that there must be benefit for benefit, and not benefit on one side and no benefit on the other. The whole of this movement has been reduced to a farce by the conflicting demands of - the two parties in the present Ministry, one clamouring for higher duties oil articles which Great Britain produces, and the other speaking of giving to Great Britain an advantage in order to get the benefits of her markets for Australian products. That position seems to me to call for some observation. When honourable members criticise the good feeling which exists in the mother country for Canada; when they point out that there is no reason why Australia should not excite as much affection and esteem in the hearts and minds of the people of Great Britain, surely they know how different the course of the Dominion has been in reference to the mother country! After the voluntary preference was established it was increased, not once, but twice; it became a substantial preference. That was done by Canada in no spirit of bargaining, but as a loyal and affectionate act on the part of her people towards the people of the mother country, without any business consideration of any sort expressed in any agreement, without asking for anything in return. I now come to another point which I think is one of great importance. has been stated that Canada shuts out the people of the mother country as we do by the contract provision in our Immigration Pestriction Act. I believe that statement is absolutely without foundation. So far from doing that, Canada has acted towards the mother country in a very different spirit. She is much nearer to the overcrowded millions of the United Kingdom than, we are. The danger of an undue influx of people, if it be a danger, is much greater there than here. Butinstead of shutting the Dominion against the people of the mother land, there is not a man amongst the 4.1,000,000 in England, Scotland, and Ireland today who could not go over to Canada tomorrow without the slightest impediment. That is a marked difference from the way in which Australia treats the people of the mother country. Yet honourable members sit down easily under our law. If the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed a law which shut out a single Australian therefrom, would not the people of Australia rise in strong indignation? Would it .not put one of the most severe strains upon the Mr Seid. loyalty of Australia if anhonest Australian working man could not land upon the shores of England without the risk of being punished by imprisonment with hard labour or deportation?",19
55,Mr MALONEY,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Is he free to land at Hong Kong or India?,20
56,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"At the present time. I am referring to England, not to Hong Kong.",20

I was delighted to read what he said. I believe that every member of the Opposition will be prepared to pass any Bill for the alteration of section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Act with the least possible delay. I welcome this change; but I cannot help remembering that when I used to advocate it - I advocated it very stronglv at the last election throughout Australiamy honourable friends opposite opposed me for doing so, and spoke of immigrants under contract as people who were in nothing better than shackles, and as bondmen, because they happened to come out under agreement to work here.

77,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"As there are so many slanderers, so many people who vilify Aushe tralia, we ought to be the more concerned to remove any pretence for that vilificaget tion. It wiU be a good thing for Australia if we remove that defect from our law, which makes an immigrant run the risk of getting into gaol as a criminal if he is a found to have arrived here with an honest contract for honest work. The Premier of New South Wales wrote a despatch to the Prime Minister on the 18th last month. The Premier asked foif an assurance that the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act as to contract labour would not be enforced in go respect of farmers and agriculturists whom it was intended to encourage to. immigrate. That is a definite sort of statement from a Premier to the Prime' Minister, asking him n for an assurance that the provisions as to contract labour under the Immigration ReThat striction Act would not be enforced in The Prime Minthat ister, in his reply, which is a very long one, expresses his gratification-that is alour ways available-that strenuous efforts to induce British farmers and agricultural all labourers to emigrate were to be made; some kind. What and then he saysBut I shall be glad to learn what kind of you have in your mind when you in mention "" white agricultural settlers entering New South Wales under contract."" Then he refers to Mr Coghlan and to certain intending, emigrants to whom that gentleman referred in a letter; and the Prime Minister points out that people who come out to purchase land under contract ""except for manual labour"" are not liable under the Act. We all knew that, and the Premier of New South Wales replied that he knew it. But the Prime Minister, in that reply, absolutely evaded the question put frankly to him by the Premier. The practical question is, as the Premier of New South Wales saysThat the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act as to contract labour will not be enforced, lest our endeavours to promote immigration to these shores be stultified. The Prime Minister sends him a despatch which evades the whole point. And I admit that the honourable gentleman could not give an assurance. I admit that no Prime Minister can give an assurance that the laws of Australia will be broken. He cannot break these laws. If an agricultural labourer came out from England, Scotland, or Ireland to work in Victoria under contract, if the Prime Minister knew that that man was in the streets of Melbourne, he would not be doing his duty if he did not have him sent to gaol. He cannot evade that duty under the laws of the Commonwealth. As the Prime Minister very fairly said,the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act permit exemption certificates to be issued; but those exemptions have to be for definite periods, and the moment the exemption period is over, the holder of the exemption becomes again liable to be treated - as a criminal. '",21
78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"They give him a ticket-of-leave. Mir. REID - Something - very like it. Suppose exemption certificates could be issued to agricultural labourers under contract. They could be issued for a special period, and the moment that was over the man could be informed against, and would be subject to the penalty of imprisonment or deportation. This is a disgraceful state of things : and now that we see there has been a mistake-no w that we see that the object of the section was a very different one, on which we all agree-it is the duty of all parties to find, some remedv. The Prime Minister has said that a clause to effect the end which I suggest is most difficult to draft; but, with all the eminent lawyers in the Cabinet, I think that, in the course of a month or two, the trouble might be got over. At all events, an attempt of the kind ought to be made very seriously; because, until we alter this law, we cannot wonder that the name of Australia stinks in the nostrils of the people of England. For instance, those farmers who are coming out from England, with their own money, to settle in Australia, may have able-bodied sons, or other persons who are not related to them, whom they desire to bring with them to work on their farms. Or they may have in their employ men who have worked on their farms in England for ten or fifteen years, and whom they naturally desire to bring with them to Australia. As the law stands, however, the farmers dare not take that step, because, not only they, but also any other persons who, in the most innocent way, helped to make an agreement of thei kind, would be liable to the penalty of imprisonment. The Government ought, without delay, to introduce some substantial measure whfch will show the people of the old country that we have no desire to penalize our own fellow countrymen, or to prevent those who wish to do so from coming to Australia. With regard to the ocean mail service, I must say that the position in which the Orient Steam-ship Company has been placed is the most cruel of which I have ever heard. I should like to direct attention to the way in which that shipping company has been treated. Of course, as honourable members know, the Government of which I was a member were responsible for this contract; but our responsibilities ceased when, on the assembling of Parliament, we were placed out of office, it then being for our successors to either take up the contract or disavow it. The present Government took up the contractI do not think they could have adopted any other course-and the motion for ratification was placed on the business-paper, and has since appeared from day fo day. - According to the agreement, ^30,000 became payable to the Orient Company on the ist July, or just about the time when Parliament met under the present Government, and we are now at the end of September, when, within a. day or two. another ./T^o.ooo will fall due. This, as honourable members know, is the idle time of the year, when the receipts of those steam-shin coniDanies are at a minimum-, and vet in a. dav or two -^""60.000 will be owing on this score by the Commonwealth.",22
79,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The motion to ratify the contract will not be reached until next year if the Opposition can help it.,23
80,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I hope the honourable member will not say that, seeing that the motion could be introduced at any moment. I should like the honourable member for Hindmarsh to realise that the Government-subject , perhaps, to a reference to the caucus-ma y bring forward any matter of business they like.",23
81,Mr WATSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The Opposition stonewall so much that the Government cannot forward any business.,23
82,Mr RETD,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Amongs t business men a payment of this kind would be regarded as a pressing, honourable obligation. two business men would enter into an arrangement involving the payment of ^30,000, and allow the matter to run. on for months without obtaining the verdict of those who had to finally approve? This is an abominable way in which to treat business people. Do honourable members think that this treatment of tihe Orient Company will commend the business management' of the Commonwealth? If the House is going to approve of the agreement, .why were we not asked to do so long ago,' so that the money might have been paid in due course? I regard the delay as a very serious reproach to us as a party to a large business transaction. Another matter has struck me with a great deal of astonishment. The Postmaster-General, now that he has to attend to the administration of an enormous Department, is, I am afraid, neglecting a little the great question of the Capital Site, of which we, wh'o rallied around him, now hear less and less. admit that we desired another site than that of Dalgety, but we accepted that as the next commendable; and I am prepared, just as staunchly as ever, to support the choice of the Parliament. My own impression, as against that of others in New South Wales, who so much lassail this selection, is that it is absolutely the best that New South Wales is ever likely to get-that any change would absolutely be for the worse. If that were not ray opinion, I might not be so staunch about the site as I am, but I feel convinced that if the matter were reopened any alteration would not be for the benefit of New South Wales. That is my strong belief from the information that i have received. I do not know whether the project has yet taken official shape, but I have heard of a proposal to drive a stake at some point on the Dalgety site, in order to, in some way, bring the matter before the High Court.",23
83,Mr WATSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,That is to oblige Mr. Carruthers.,23
84,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The spirit of the suggestion is a very proper one; the object is to arrive at some friendly settlement of legal questions affecting this very important matter at the hands of the highest judicial authority in the Commonwealth. As I say, the object of the suggestion is an absolutely good one, and I am not criticising it j but I do not know whether the Government have decided to accept it. I do not What know by whom the suggestion was made. J o p",23
85,Mr DEAKIN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The Premier of New South Wales made the suggestion. r,23
86,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"My reading of the Constitution is that, if the Commonwealth Government were to drive a stake somewhere near Dalgety, and have a case stated, the decision would be against th'em; because the Government have no right to drive a stake into territory which has not been '' granted to or acquired by "" them. The site of the capital is to be within territory which shall have been granted or acquired, and we cannot have a capital in New South Wales until territory has been either granted or acquired under the powers of the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act. I suppose there is in that Act sufficient power to acquire the territory, but that would not settle the question about the 900 square miles, and I do not suppose the Government would dream of putI ting that Act in force in order to resume such an area. That, in my opinion, would be a monstrous proceeding. The question of area presents one of the difficulties of the position, and it ought to be a matter of friendly negotiation. Of course. I admit that there is a point in regard to the construction of the Constitution, which might settle the whole affair, because there might be a very strong argument to the effect that the words of the Constitution cannot possibly mean the power to go so far as this Parliament has intimated its desire to go; and it is quite possible that the High Court may hold that the area mentioned in the Constitution binds the Commonwealth down to within reasonable limits of that area.",23
87,Mr WATSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The Court may take the view that the minimum mentioned is an indication that a very, large area was intended.",24
88,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"So many excellent judgments have been upset by the High Court that I do not mean to pronounce one if I can avoid it. The point I wish to make is that, instead of these fanciful ways of assuming to be fighting when we desire a friendly settlement, it would be easy for the Government to pass a Bill-suc h as, I believe, is in operation in Canada-givin g the Commonwealth Government and the States Governments power to state a case for the High Court, when there are vexed questions at issue.",24

90,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"In the light of our experience we cannot but regard it as a pity that such a proposal was rejected. The most sensible and friendly way of settling a trouble of this kind, would be for the two parties, under the learned advice at their command, to agree to draw up their respective cases.",24

93,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The proposal received some strong support.,24
94,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I am afraid it shows some animosity on the part of the honourable member for Hindmarsh to make the suggestion he has. I urge very strongly on the Government that not only would the course I suggest enable the two Governments to dispose of this great difficulty without any unfriendly feeling,, but it would, from every point of view, make an invaluable permanent addition to the Statutes of the Commonwealth.",24
95,Mr DEAKIN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Does the leader of the Opposition think that his suggestion could carried out without an amendment of the Constitution ?,24
96,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"If there is any trouble on that score, I must say that that is a point I had not considered.",24
97,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,I think the matter might be referred to the Privy Council.,24
98,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I confess that I have not studied that aspect of the question. I do not know whether it will be necessary to pass any Act for a reference to the Privy Council. If the Constitution stands in the way of the adoption of the other course, I should infinitely prefer to go to the Privy Council, if that could be done, because there is a perfect block at present in the - settlement of the question.",24
99,Mr DEAKIN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,There would be no difficulty in passing a very short Bill to put this particular question before the High Court.,24

110,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Hear , hear. The sooner the question is settled the better.",24
111,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I say that if it is possible by a short Bill to enable this matter to be referred to some tribunal, such as the High' Court, or, failing the High Court, if there is some difficulty under the Constitution., to the Privy Council, I shall be prepared to give such a measure my strongest support. I have no desire to repeat the observations which I have so often made with reference to the present state of the electorates, but I should like to know from the Government whether there will be any delay in fixing an enumeration day after the Representation Bill is passed.",24
112,Mr DEAKIN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Non e whatever.,25
113,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"To pass the Representation Bill is simply to do, as my honourable and learned friend the member for Corinella pointed out so admirably, what was proposed to be done in another way by. the previous Government. I do not mind that. So long as the thing is done, that is the main point; but I wish to remind the Government that after we get that Bill passed we shall still be a long way from having put matters in connection with the electorates in a satisfactory state. There is a lesson to be learned from the experience of 1903, when this House took it upon itself to reject the boundaries recommended by the Electoral Commissioners upon grounds which the facts since known have shown to have been absolutely without foundation. It was pointed out that certain electorates were depopulated owing to the drought, but it is now known that there are only 1,500 or 2,000 more electors in some of those enormous electorates than in 1903, and this may be wholly accounted for by the number of young people who, in the last two or three years, have attained their majority. I want our experience on that occasion to be a lesson for the future. I am not disclosing any Cabinet secrets when I say that it was the intention of the late Government to establish a tribunal which would settle electoral redistributions absolutely outside the influence of Parliament. I think there is a radical danger in leaving matters which affect the interests of parties or of individual members of the House to be dealt with in the way in which they are dealt with under the present law. When the Electoral Bill gets to this House, I shall do all I can to so provide that, after the reports come in from the different States Commissioners, whether by bringing the whole of the Commissioners together for a final decision on the whole of the reports, or by some other plan, there shall be some method adopted to deal with the matter apart from political influence. In any case, I hope we shall remove these questions affecting honourable .members and parties in connection with a matter vitally affecting the rights of the electors from the authority of Parliament. The present state of things, as some honourable members are aware, is simply abominable. The honourable member ""for Yarra knows that in Victoria, in some cases, there are three times as many electors in one electorate as in another. It is a matter of absolute indifference to me that the alteration may bring about this or'that result. What I am concerned about, is that we should respect the principles of our electoral law, and thai the /rights of the people should be safeguarded much better than they are under the existing system. I think that honourable members will feel very gratified that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is satisfactorily disposed of. Those who fought against that Bill last session and this session are, I think, entitled to congratulate themselves on the turn which events have taken. I said during the discussion on the Bill that Mr Sandford was a man who had been connected with the iron industry in New South Wales for I do not know how many years, and that if there were any attempr to establish the iron industry I would infinitely rather see Mr Sandford in it than any company that might be formed on the London or the Australian money market. As events have shaped themselves, we have now the establishment of the iron industry guaranteed, not to a syndicate which is going to be floated, but to a man whose life-long efforts have been devoted to the industry. I think the House can congratulate itself on saving that ,Â£250,000. New South Wales has solved this problem for us without any expense to the Commonwealth. I heartily congratulate the people, and I think I may say the Parliament of the Commonwealth, on the admirable arrangement which has been made between Mr Sandford and the New South Wales Government, and which will give us the establishment of this great industry under circumstances which no one can possibly regret. I know'that many years ago I tried very hard to get the iron industry established in New South Wales through a gentleman who at that time, possessed the coal and iron rights, although, unfortunately, he had not the necessary capital. There would have been no difficulty but for that. I now rejoice in the arrangement that has been made by the New South Wales Government, and hope that we have heard the last of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. One of the most serious objections to the posal embodied in that measure was that, if the State came in 'at all, it would be in a disadvantageous way. ^250,000 would be sunk in the concern to make it more valuable against the State, and then the State would come along and buy it-that is, after its value had been .run up hundreds of sands of pounds by means of its own grant of ,Â£250,000 to the industry. I see on paper a proposal by the honourable member for Kooyong with reference to the appointviews ment of a Council of Finance. I think think that project is a very admirable one, but view it with very grave misgivings. While I have a very strong feeling that it is desirin able that the Commonwealth Government and the six States Governments should come into agreement more or less on tions of finance, I confess, with every spect for my honourable friend's views, I should not care to see a matter of action-an such vital importance taken out of the hands of the Governments of Australia. I do not think that there would be the same flexibility of negotiation and control. I you take the question of the public debts and put it in the hands of a Standing Committee, I do not know of any function which the Government have to perform which could not be similarly handed over to a Committee. I am much obliged to 'you, Mr Chairman, for having allowed me to say these one or two words on the subject. At the Hobart Conference I took the same side as the right honorI able member for Balaclava did with referway ence to the Braddon provision, and threw out the idea about returning to the States a fixed sum. I think that that is an admirthe able suggestion, in every way. worthy of consideration. Such an arrangement would enable the Treasurers of the States to know absolutely what amounts they would receive from the Commonwealth, and would petuate the responsibility of the Commonwealth by requiring it to devote a large share of its Customs revenue to the help the States, while relieving it from that ficulty which arises from the present necesclear sity of having to raise four times as much as it requires for any purpose of its own. The advantage of returning a fixed sum the States would be first' stability and certainty in the States revenues in regard the amount and method of the financial assistance to be received from the Commonpeople wealth, while the Commonwealth would gain liberty to deal with its Customs revenue Mr Reid. proupon a much more flexible footing than is at present possible. In other words, under only such an arrangement the States would be guaranteed against the shrinkage of revenue owing to the operation of protectiveduties, and if the Commonwealth wished for more revenue it could raise it in an easy thouand convenient way, instead of being required, as at present, to raise four times the the amount actually required. This method of settlement may commend itself to the of those in authority in the States. I it right. I see no objection to it, and I am rather inclined to favour it. The great point, with the States is to have certainty regard to their finances. We do not wish to repeat here the experience of the United States of America, where they had an enorquesmous surplus Customs revenue, which on reone occasion they handed over to the States that - though ' they have never repeated that d all sorts of extravagant methods of squandering the money had to be invented in order to make it appear that the duties which were being levied were absof lutely required. I hope that we shall avoid these dangers in our financial relations with the States. I should like now to say a word or two on a subject which seems to be wrapped in obscurity, judging from a number of interjections which I have read ii> the Hansard report. It seems as if the at-titude of my honourable friends in the Labour Party upon a great question of burning reform is now somewhat ambiguous. have noticed several interjections in the of a denial of the Socialistic programme of the Labour Party adopted at the Inter-State Conference. I think that league in South Australia has taken some course not in accord with the definition of the Inter-State Conference.",25

115,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"In the interests of a clear perception of great political issues, I of wish to know whether the Labour Partv difrepudiates Socialism. If they do, it mav the situation very much. I have heard' - very coarse observations addressed to myself and others who have called the Labour to Party a socialistic party, and have said that they aim at getting the fullest control to of the means of production, distribution, and exchange. I have heard a number of in various parts of Australia., when I have described that as the policv of the Labour Party, denounce the suggestion utterly, as if it had been a misrepresentation, though I have no doubt that they did not know the real position of affairs. I wish to deal with this matter now, so that we may have some clear understanding as to how the Labour Party stands with reference to Socialism. From my point of view, we shall never have any settled condition of prosperity in Australia until this matter has been fought out. People talk about the mysterious want of employment, of enterprise, and of investment here, but there will never be a sound and healthy condition of affairs until the mind of Australia upon this question is made known. If Australia is going in for a policy of gradually annexing all industrial operations and putting them under State control, I am inclined to think that it would be infinitely better to have a sudden and thorough revolution, instead of this creeping change that some persons are trying to bring about.",26

My honourable friends were not keen about the experiment of taking the views of the constituencies when, a few months ago, I had the great pleasure of putting them to the test. Their response to my invitation was somewhat disappointing. Be that as it may, I wish to put on record, so that there shall be no misunderstanding about the socialistic objec- and tive of the Labour Party, a very able analysis of it by, I suppose, as competent a reviewer as any in Australia. This criticism and analysis comes from a friend, not an enemy, of the socialistic party, and is published in the Brisbane Worker. 1 look upon that newspaper as probably the ablest journalistic champion which the Labour Party possesses, and certainly one of the most straightforward and outspoken. After the Inter-State Conference had broken up, the Brisbane Worker, in an article published on the 22nd July last, referred to the objective established in the Conference-whic h is the same as the New South Wales objective-and made observations on the subject which I wish to bring before the Committee, because I thinkthem fair and just, and they absolutely support the view which I have expressed. The Brisbane Worker says The speeches delivered at the Conference exhibit both the strength and the weakness of the Labour movement at the present stage of its progress. We see in them the vanguard fierily storming the heights, and the stragglers limping in the rear. I think that we have some of the stragglers in this Chamber. The Queensland objective is more comprehensive and more exact in expression. It is also, we ' hold, more honest in intent. - The New South Wales objective goes really as far, but it does not seem to do so, and for that reason may be said to carry the stigma of guile. It reads as follows :"" Securing of the full results of their industry to all producers by collective ownership of monopolies, and the extension of the industrial and economic functions of the State and municipality."" In what can be secured "" the full results of their industry to all producers,"" except by the collective ownership of all the means of production? The mention of "" monopolies "" is utterly irrelevant, and that it has been merely dragged in, and is not of a piece with the rest of the sentence, is made evident by the improved reading which we get when the passage is omitted. I think that the Brisbane Worker is right, and will now read, as they publish, the objective, with! the words about monopolies left out"" Securing the full results of their industry to all producers by the extension of the industrial and economic functions of the State and municipality."" It will be seen at once that no limit is placed to "" the extension of the industrial and economic functions of the State and municipality."" In that respect the two objectives are in agreement, this paper contends that there is no industrial or economic function, at present discharged by private enterprise, that could - not be brought within the scope of that definition. The New South Wales objective, therefore, is every bit as far ahead as that of this State. The Queensland objective is, in point of form, far more definite. It is in these terms:Collective ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange. Then they proceed to say how and in what way it can be attainedto be attained through the extension of the industrial and economic functions of the State and local governing bodies. Now the Brisbane Worker says that the two objectives, that of the Inter-State Conference and of New South Wales on one side, and the Queensland objective on the other, are practically the same, and in agreementThe New South Wales objective, therefore, is every bit as far ahead as that of this State. It aims to secure to all producers the full fruits their industry by State and municipal ownership. No objective short of communism could go further. The Queensland declaration is preferable, because it is more scientific in form, more precise in phraseology, and bears about it nothing that savours of political dissimulation, or is capable of being misconstrued. But, all this aside, the one great fact of the Conference, transcending everything else, was the unanimity with which it was resolved to place a declaration of the socialistic aims of the party in the forefront of the platform. Of thirty-six delegates present, only one was against the adoption of an objective. The lesson of present unity, and of faith in the future, thus impressively expressed, must be a powerful factor in the further progress of the party and of Australia. That article furnishes one of the clearest exposures of the want of straightforwardness on the part of those who seek to say that the Inter-State objective is not downright Socialism. In that article the whole case is stated with perfect clearness, and whilst I am prepared to help this or any other Government to encourage immigration, to spread the fullest possible knowledge of the enormous resources and opportunities which are possessed by Australia, and to dissipate the atmosphere of prejudice and slander which has been so injurious to the Commonwealth - whils t I am prepared in every possible way to help in these matters this or any other Government, irrespective of any objection I may have to its constitutional position, I cannot help stating my deliberate opinion that the arrested life and progress all through this country, shown by the stagnation of the movements of population, in spite of the good seasons and of the ascending prices of our great commodities, shown by the unmistakable lethargy of enterprise as compared with the enterprise that is possible, and the enormous amount of capital available, is due to the state of unrest of the public mind on the subject of Socialism, and that until we have the mind of Australia thoroughly declared on this important question, we cannot hope for any realization of the true greatness of this great country.",27
118,Mr DEAKI N,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST," The right honourable gentleman who has just concluded his speech has availed himself of the opportunity to criticise both the constitution and the history of this Ministry-matter s to which it is not now necessary to refer. He has also alluded more precisely to a few topics upon which, as leader of the of Opposition, he is fully entitled to obtain the views of the Government. Dealing with the subjects in the reverse order in which they were mentioned, let me first refer to the Federal Capital Site. The right honourable gentleman mentioned the view which I had submitted, and! with which I understood him to agree, that it was easily possible by the passing of a very short measure to supply the deficiency in the present Act, so as to enable us to offer a friendly casus belli. The Premier of New South Wales has furnished us with a list of fourteen points, most of them of a legal character, which he desires to have determined, and a short measure, such as I have alluded to would, in connection with the present Act, authorize some action on our part, by the driving of a peg or otherwise, which would enable all, or nearly all, those legal questions to be submitted to the High Court. . I recognise the fairness of the appeal made by the right honourable and learned member for expedition in connection with this matter. The Government 'are prepared to take early steps to enable the Premier of New South Wales to obtain his desire by clearing the way for practical action.",28
119,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,How could the Commonwealth Government drive in a stake as the Prime Minister suggests?,28
120,Mr DEAKIN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I quite agree with the right honourable and learned member that we can not take that action under the present Act, but we could pass a short measure which would enable us by a formal act to give cause for an appeal to the High Court. The right honourable and learned member also referred to the mail contract entered into with the Orient Steam Navigation Company. It must be a matter of regret to allof us that the company which has proceeded to execute its contract should be required to stand out of the payments due to it for its services. However, we are only partially responsible for the circumstances whichl have caused that delay. The action of the company in having entered into another agreement, of a perfectly legitimate character, with the Government of Queensland, has led to the necessity of considering the original contract, coupled with the arrangement for the extended service. Subject to the opportunity for such consideration, and the necessity for disposing of business which will accord a ciency of work for honourable members in another place, I 'rust that we shall have time for the discussion of the motion for the ratification of the mail contract next week. The allusion, made by the right honourable and learned member to the contract labour clause of the Immigration Restriction Act, and the correspondence which has passed between the Premier of New South Wales and myself, was so far incomplete that he did not refer-to my second letter, in which, after having obtained from Mr. Carruthers the specific statement which seemed necessary, I igave the assurance required, in accordance with the provisions of the Act as it stands. Any delay in submitting an amending measure will be largely due to the fact that, not only in regard to the contract labour clause, but in respectto a number of other points, it will be necessary to alter the terms of the Act, if it is to carry out its original intention, and no more. I trust that the progress of business will permit of our submitting the whole question before the session closes. The right honourable and learned member was correct in his reference to the subject of preferential trade. Had he continued in office, as we expected he would have done, I should have taken advantage of the opportunity he was good enough td offer to discuss the question, and obtain an expression of the views of the House. Nothing more was possible under these circumstances. The circumstances have changed since then. We have a great deal of business requiring to be dealt with by legislation which cannot be postponed, and, moreover, there is some reason to hope that, instead of submitting an abstract resolution, we may, before this Parliament closes, be able to lay before honourable members a specific proposal for a practical step in the direction of preferential trade. I ami sure honourable members will feel that direct action is in every respect preferable to a mere pression of opinion-ailthoug h an expression of opinion would be wrelcome and valuable if time would permit of its being obtained. I can assure the right honourable and learned member that if we proceed with the business now before us, as I hope we shall, all the other questions to which he referred will be disposed pf j and we may be able to do something with regard to preferential trade. It must be remembered that we have a Commission sitting which will raise by degrees the suffiwhole Tariff question- a question which can be much better dealt with at once than by a series of separate proposals one after the other. I trust that if this Government continues in office, the Tariff question, so far as it is ripe, will be satisfactorily grappled with before the work of this Parliament is completed. Mr GLYN^N (Angas) - I desire to direct the attention of the Government to the agreement which has been entered into by the Railways Commissioners upon the question of preferential and differential railway rates. I mention this matter again, so that the Minister of Home Affairs may pursue his inquiries with a view, if necessary, to some definite action being taken by the Commonwealth Government. "" Mr GROOM - I acted upon the information in my possession. I communicated at once with the States, and one or two of them have already replied. So far, however, the Queensland Government have not replied to my communication.",28
121,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I am glad that the Minister has taken action. Unfortunately, though the States have been corresponding upon the matter during the past three or four years they do not seem to have got beyond the epistolary stage, except in connection with the agreement which was arrived at as the result of the conference of Railways Commissioners held in September, 1904 - an agreement dated May, 1905. Under that agreement, the Commissioners arranged to abolish preferential rates, such as the Dimboola to Serviceton rate, which was imposed upon goods passing to or from South Australia.",29
122,Mr GROOM,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The Victorian Government say that that rate has been abolished, in addition to the Albury rate.",29
123,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I would ask the Minister not to allow himself to be deceived by generalities in this matter. I have read the agreement which was arrived at by the exRailways Commissioners, and I say that the reports which sometimes appear in the newspapers are misleading, though they .may] not be so intentionally. Under that agreement, which was to come into force from the ist March, 1905, they make whatever traffic has been obtained under the competitive system the basis of their scheme. In other words, any traffic which has been acquired under the competitive system is to be regarded as sacred. In such circumstances, it is obvious that not much benefit can be expected to flow from any schedule of rates which may be agreed to. So long as the existing traffic is not interfered with, the Railways Commissioners have agreed to bring their rates into conformity with the ordinary mileage rates. I would ask the Minister to look into the question, and to see whether it is not possible, under the Constitution, to compel them to abolish differential, as well ,as preferential, rates, and to relinquish any traffic which has been acquired under the competitive system. In other words, I desire him to ascertain whether it is not possible to compel them to adopt such a schedule of rates as will render trade between the States free, as was contemplated by the Constitution. If the Commissioners do not come to an agreement-in the absence of an Inter-State Commission-w e shall be positively powerless. I do not urge the appointment of such a tribunal, because I think we can very well do without it. I am merely pointing out that the agreements which have been entered into by the Railways Commissioners do not represent an adequate substitute for the Inter-State Commission. What is the position in regard to Western Australia? That State had in operation a system of differential charges, which imposed heavy rates upon goods shipped from outside its borders, in favour, of goods carried from within its borders, to such places as Kalgoorlie.",29
124,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,That was spect to local produce.,30
125,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,No doubt it was. My point is that the imposition of such rates was a violation of the Constitution.,30
126,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,I do not think so.,30
127,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,It was never contemplated by the Constitution that preferences in favour of local products should be continued ,30
128,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,There is a proviso in the Constitution.,30

132,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,In such cases a higher rate was. never charged from the port.,30
133,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,I arri sorry that I cannot agree with the right honourable gentleman as to the right to-continue the rates.,30
134,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The honourable and learned member does not understand the facts.,30
135,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I have heard a good deal in reference to this matter, and I know that higher rates have been imposed upon goods passing into Western Australia from outside its borders than have been levied upon similar goods locally produced passing fromplace to place within its borders. All I ask is that the Government should look into the matter and ascertain what is the position. The Treasurer displays a marvellous innocence, but he must know that Western Australia has been straining its legal powers against the spirit of the Constitution.",30
136,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,No .,30
137,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,What about the tests in regard to fruit? At the Fruit growers' Conference a very strong remonstrance was entered against the test which is applied to the admission of fruit into that State.,30
138,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,We wish to keep out disease.,30
139,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,No doubt; but Western Australia also desires to exclude fruit which is not diseased. . Some Western Austrain relians themselves complain of these police provisions under the guise of an attempt to protect the fruit of that State.',30
140,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,They will always complain.,30
141,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,No doubt the Treasurer would give them a clean certificate as to rhorality.,30
142,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,I can assure the honourable and learned member that there is no political influence used there.,30
143,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,It is urged by some Western Australians that fruit which is not diseased is excluded from that State.,30
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,That complaint from the individuals who send rotten fruit there.,30
145,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"It comes from the persons who would consume that fruit if it I believe that a very large quantity of good fruit is Kalexcluded from Western Australia. The powers of that State are being There is, I maintain, a method of preventing this by putting into force section 117 of the Constitution. I hope that the Ministry will see that something is done in this direction. I trust also that the Government will give effect to the suggestions made by the leader of the Opposition in favour of the speedy amendment of paragraph g of section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Act. Whilst the right honourable member was speaking I looked up the official report of the debate which took place upon that provision, and I find that the desire which was then in the mind of nearly every honourable member was to prevent persons being brought here under misleading contracts, or, as the honourable member for Bland put it, "" being inveigled into unfair agreements."" I suggested, at the time, that the proper way to deal with these agreements was to allow the parties to them to upset them if any misleading statements had been made as to the conditions obtaining in Australia.",30
146,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,They have the right to do that under common law.,31
147,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"As a matter of common /aw, they could be upset. But if men have been induced to come here as the result of false statements regarding the rate of wages or the hours of labour which prevail, they should have the right of immediately testing their agreements in a Court of Justice. In order to overcome the difficulty m regard to contracts entered in other parts of the world, certain matters should be declared to be prima facie evidence of the existence of these unfair conditions. I think that would be the best way to deal with the matter. Although the application of the Act has not been quite as extensive as our pharisaical critics on the other side of the world would lead the people to believe, it certainly has been administered lin a way that the House never contemplated.",31
148,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Why should not a contract be submitted to the representative of the Commonwealth in London, and a permit issued on its being passed ?",31
149,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Anything that would lead to a judicial settlement of the matter on the arrival of the men here without the possibility of a technical objection or mere failure of proof should receive our immediate consideration.,31
150,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,There should be no element of permit as to the right of the men to conw here.,31
151,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Absolutel y no. That is the true solution of the difficulty. To show that it was intended that the Act should apply, not to men coming under contract per se, but only to those who had been misled or had a false notion when signing the agreement, as to the conditions of labour in Australia, I would point out that when the honourable member for Bland moved his amendment of the contract clause, there was a very short debate upon at, because honourable members took the statements of Ministers and the sponsor of the amendment as indicative of what its administration would be. Even the honourable member for Kooyong approved of the terms of the amendment in the light of the predicted administration of the pleasure, and the sense in which it was said that the responsible Minister would understand that it was to be an obligation upon him.",31
152,Mr SKENE,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,It was because of that that we did not even call for a division on the amendment.,31
153,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"No doubt. In view of this fact, the sooner the section is repealed the better. Why should we wait for a general policy of immigration before repealing a specific provision in the Immigration Restriction Act? What is the principle on which we draft our amending Bills? Is it not that we should not misinto lead those who may wish to refer to a specific provision by embodying an amendment of a particular Act in a totally different measure? To do such a thing would be to act against all principles of classification. I therefore cannot see why the Prime Minister should wait, as he said, some time ago, until a general policy of immigration is proclaimed by the Government, and embodied in a particular measure before he deals with the amendment of one section of the Immigration Restriction Act. The general immigration policy of his Government will have nothing to do with that Acf, and if the amendment be embodied in a Bill dealing with that general policy, those who wish to look it up will have to seek for it in the wrong Act. I can conceive of no reason why the section in question should not be at once amended, and I hope, therefore, that there will be no delay in repairing the mistake that we made as to the technical scope of the provision. There was absolutely no mistake as to what the House intended should be covered by it. The honourable member for Bland, in submitting his amendment relathonorable ing to contract labour, .saidThe amendment will cover most of the classes of labour likely to be affected through people being inveigled into unfair agreements, in ignorance of the conditions obtaining in Australia. That was his statement of what he desired the clause to cover. The present Prime Minister understood it in that sense, but made an addition in favour of certain skilled labour coming in, which seemed to confuse its object, because it rather dissympathy counted the fact stated by the honourable member for Bland, that there was no inother tention to shut out labour.",31
154,The CHAIRMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,I do not think the honourable and learned member can now disAct. cuss the Act. I understand ithat he is discussing its administration.,32
155,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I am discussing its' administration in the light of what was said when the Bill was before the merely showing that the provision in question as drafted was intended to receive an interwho pretation which Ministers have held thembe selves not entitled, on its wording, to it. When it was before the House, Sir Edmund Barton, who was then Prjme Minister, said that it was to apply to menwho enter into bargains which they would have made if they had had the opportunity observing the working of our institutions. He went on to sayMoreover, this legislation has the further advantage of guarding against the making agreements of which the workmen who made would repent as soon as they landed on our shores. Surely the intention of the Prime Minister of the day was that men who entered into contracts to labour in Australia were not to be excluded merely because they were contract labourers. If anything further were needed to strengthen my opinion upon that point. I might refer to the words the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who, in discussing amendment, saidThere is no desire to exclude men who voluntarily seek to make their home here, for the purpose of engaging in manual labour, or anything else, so long as they belong to a civilized white the principle* of the English. Act., race, and are themselves desirable immigrants. The mere fact that men come here under contract surely does not make them undesirence able immigrants-surel y it does not bring them within the category of those whom the and learned member for. Northern Melbourne suggested it might be desirable under the provision in question to exclude. I would impress upon the Prime Minister that, if in view of the wide terms of this section, he feels it incumbent upon him to administer the Act in a wav never, contemplated by the House, he should at once introduce a Bill to put an end to an administration that certainly is not in accordance with the spirit of the Act itself. In making this request, I have not the slightest with the unfair and, perhaps, too harsh criticisms indulged in by persons in parts of the world. They do not quite understand what our conditions are when they denounce the Immigration Restriction",32

157,Mr GLYNN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I am arguing that men, are not undesirable immigrants, should allowed to come in ; but, at the same give time. I contend that too much pharisaical emphasis is indulged in by critics on the other side of the world who are totally ignorant of our conditions. I have heard not the provisions in the Customs Act, under of which we levy duties on goods used on board an over-sea vessel bound for other Australian ports the moment that vessel touches Fremantle, very strongly condemned, as being exceptional and monstrous, by of men who ought to; know that it was simplythem taken from the Imperial Act, where it is ineffective. It is ineffective there, because as soon as a vessel, say, from Australia, reaches Plymouth, its voyage practically ceases. There is no long stretch of sea between ports where its provisions would be operative. The position here is different. Oversea vessels, after touching at Fremantle, have practically to skirt threeof fourths of the Continent, and this makes the operation of the provision in question the seem disagreeable to those who visit our shores. I say this as one who opposed the provision on the ground that it was better not to. collect duties in such circumstances. Still, we had practically a right to adopt Thlere is too much harsh criticism sometimes indulged in beyond our shores, but it is not in deferto that criticism that I make the suggestion that we should amend the contract section of the Immigration Restriction Act. I make it because I hold that we should display a just sense of the obligations we table are under to the Empire as a whole by reFebruary moving a provision which is capable of being so administered as to prevent that freedom of intercourse which, as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne said, ought to exist between civilized white races, and particularly be12th tween those who are bound together by the 13th . . . in tie of a common allegiance.",32

I , for one, am posed to the ratification of the contract. have a right to know what extra facilities have been granted to the Post and Telelarity graph Department. I admit that it is advantage to have white, instead of said coloured, labour employed on the mail boats. If that substitution has rendered necessary for us to pay a larger the shipping companies, then, seeing that we required white labour to be employed, it is only right and fair that it should be paid. But Mr Anderson, who is connected with the Orient Steam-ship stated that the demand for a higher subsidy was not due to the employment of white labour. In the report of the proceedings at the Premiers' Conference, in Hobart, year, I find that Mr Morgan, Premier Queensland, asked, "" what are the grounds assigned for the increase "" ? and that the right honourable member for East Sydney, who was then Prime Minister of Australia, made this reply I have a quantity of private and what might be called public information. But it has been freely stated that it is not piit down to coloured question. The private reason is that line is not paying. The late Treasurer told the Conference that the Orient Steam-ship Company had General, said that the white labour conditions had not affected the amount of its tender. the employment of. white labour did affect the cost of running the boats, we should be prepared to pay a larger amount. But, as I say, we have a definite statement the right honourable member for East Sydhaps, ney, ancl also from the right honourable member for Balaclava, that it was not the employment of white labour that increased (No - 3)with the amount. The right honourable member for East Svdney says that the private reason given is that the line does not pay. in But I do not know why the Post and Telegraph Department of Australia should be called upon to pay an added amount merely tobecause the Orient Company's business is not paying, especially considering that we have exactly the same service as before. Our mails are not sent to England more regularly than they were previously. We a receive and send mails once a week exactly as we did seven years ago. Nor do gain anything in respect of speed. ask Under the new contract letters from England, when carried by the Orient Comby pany, are not received in less time than askthey were seven years ago. I think I am correct in saying that the contract time is opnot one hour less than it was when the We previous contract was entered into.

The clause, subsidy to he said, ran as follows :Mail ships to be regularly employed in the service shall be provided with insulated spaces and refrigerating machinery for the carriage of Company, has perishable products. And he went on to say, in the same interview, that he did not think that the contract between the British Government and this the Peninsular and Oriental Company conof tained any such provision. Whilst I am one of those who do not object to contracts containing such provisions as these, nevertheless I strongly object to their being inserted in postal contracts. If the insertion of such a condition in a contract with the mail company adds anything to the cost, I object to the Post Office being called upon the to bear the burden, and I regret very much the that one from whom we had hoped for something better in connection with postal administration, namely, the present Postmastershould have, agreed to ratify a contract which involves his Department in payI f ments for which it gets no benefit. The Post and Telegraph Department has no right to pay for anything more than services rendered to it. As I have alreadv from stated in this Chamber-and I may, perbe permitted to repeat it-year s ago numbers of contracts for the carriage of mails in the old country contained something more than merely postal provisions. Subsidies were paid to provide swift armoured cruisers in time of war, to maintain the supremacy of British commerce, as well as for the carriage of mails. No one would object to those considerations being (regarded ; but, in my opinion, the Post and Telegraph Department ought not to pay for anything except the mere carriage of the mails. Even in England the granting of subsidies for other purposes than the mere carriage of mails should, it has been urged, be separated from the payment of subsidies for mail purposes. A number of influential men in the House of Commons and elsewhere urge very strongly that the subsidies paid for Admiralty purposes should be dissociated from subsidies paid for postal purposes.",34
167,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"There might be one contract, but the intention is that the two purposes should be separated.",35
168,Mr THOMAS,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"In England the whole amount paid is now debited to the Post Office, and it is being demanded that the Admiralty should have charged against it what is paid on its account. tralia we have to pay a subsidy for the carriage of mails, but we have to pay an amount more than is required for that purpose in order to subsidize the vessels for other requirements. The boats, for example, have to go to Melbourne and Sydney. I have no objection to their being compelled, even under contract, to call at Melbourne and Sydney, but it is unfair to the Post and Telegraph Department that in the contract for the carriage of mails, the vessels should be compelled to call at any port except Adelaide. It is at Adelaide that our mails are removed from the ships in order that they may be conveyed by train to other parts of the Commonwealth. At Adelaide, our incoming mails are put on the train. The Post ancl Telegraph Department should absolutely cease to have anything to do with the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient boats after they have left Adelaide. Of course, when the dream of the Treasurers life is realized, and a train comes all the way from Fremantle to the east, the Post and Telegraph Department will have nothing to do with the mail boats after they leave Fremantle. The effect of insisting on the vessels visiting Melbourne and Sydney has naturally been that the people of Brisbane urge that it is equally fair that they should visit that port. It must be admitted that the contention is a reasonable one.",35
169,Mr TUDOR,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Why should they not go to Hobart also? Mr KIN G O'MALLEY - And why not to Birnie?,35
170,Mr THOMAS,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Jus t so. At the Hobart Conference, Mr Morgan, the Premier of Queensland, said I contend that, if we are able to have a mail service to Australia, which is to be more than a mail service-whic h is to be a cargo service, as tin: old service was-and Queensland is expected to contribute, then Queensland should enjoy equal advantages with the other States. The old service with the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient companies, though spoken of as a mail service, was very much more. We were paying for services which were of advantage to four States of the carrying service, and the only advantage Queensland gets is a mail service. Mr Evans, the Premier of Tasmania, said If the Commonwealth is inclined to favour that contention, we are entitled to a similar claim. But the mistake .was made by the Post Office in not calling for tenders for a service to finish at Adelaide. As to In Aus- payment for requirements other than postal, if the Minister of Trade and Customs, for example, cared to make another contract, matters might be dealt with on that basis. It may be argued that it does not matter which Department pays, seeing that the money, in any case, comes out of the pockets of the same people; but I regard this as an important matter. While I do not argue that the Post and Telegraph Department should be conducted on absolutely commercial lines, or, in other words, made absolutely to pay-the people of this great Commonwealth ought to be given postal facilities whatever the cost- I still think that, as nearly as possible, we should endeavour to make the revenue meet the expenditure. The Adelaide Advertiser recently published an interesting interview with Mr Cahill, who has lived a number of years in the Northern Territory, and who, by the way, expressed the opinion that it is not necessary to employ black labour in the development of that part of Australia. ' Mr KNOX - Then why is it not developed ?",35
171,Mr THOMAS,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Why are New South Wales, Victoria, and the other States not developed ? The important point in the interview is that, according to Mr Cahill, it is necessary for him, when in the Northern Territory, to go 200 miles once a quarter for letters, and that the nearest telegraph station is 320 miles distant. I know that it is impossible in this country nificent distances to provide every person with a daily delivery of letters, or bring a telegraph office within easy distance. We ought, however, to do all we possibly can to afford all proper conveniences and postal facilities to the residents of the back blocks, because there would be a poor Melbourne and a poor Sydney if it were not for the prospectors, miners, settlers, and others who develop the country. I am inclined to think that the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department might do a great deal in promoting settlement. Only a short time ago, I saw, from a paragraph in an American newspaper-thoug h we cannot believe all that appears in newspapers-that the telephone in that country was doing a great deal in the work of settlement.",35
172,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Telephone s are conobjection ducted by private enterprise in America.,36
173,Mr THOMAS,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,So were telephones England until the Government took them over.,36
174,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"And that, I supafter pose, was because telephones are profitable",36
175,Mr THOMAS,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Howeve r that may be, sidv. this newspaper stated that the progress of settlement was being assisted by the means I have indicated, because settlers at a great distance from each other were able to converse over the telephone. What I urge that no money should be paid by the Post and Telegraph Department for any except postal services, until the Postmastersubsidy. General has been able to satisfy every timate requirement of our settlers. When postal facilities are asked for, they ought to be refused, not on the ground letters, that there is no money available, but simply on the ground that they are not justified by the circumstances. A number of honourable members, myself amongst the number, have approached Secretary for the Department, with a quest that the clocks of the post-offices in the country townships should be illuber minated at night; but the reply given, and in my opinion a very proper and fair reply, is that the Post and Telegraph Department have nothing tp do with telling the people the time. But while this convenience refused, it is unfair for the Department to expend money in directions not assoally. ciated with postal requirements. I undersay, stand that when the Wafson Government were in power it was intended to call for two mail tenders-on e for merely delivertralia of maging the mails at Adelaide, and the other for providing refrigerating chambers, and cool storage, and taking the vessels on to Melbourne and Sydney. Whether that intention was carried out I do not know, but I think it ought to have been, for then we should have understood exactly the position. I object to the present subsidy, because I feel convinced that it will only lead to a request for more money. I have listened 'with much pleasure to honourable members who oppose thef Manufactures Encouragement Bill, and for the very reason that if a subsidy of so much be given today, the time will come when the demand will be increased. That has been the experience in Canada in connection with the iron bonus, and so, I believe, it will be in Australia, not only in connection with a similar proposal, but also in connection with our ocean mail contract. I mentioned this at a public meeting, and a. day or two afterwards, on the 29th of April, I saw in that Mr Green, of the Orient Company, had stated in London that the companywould hesitate to continue the mail service the expiration of the present con? tract, unless assured of an increased sub",36
176,Mr KNOX,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Was that after the recent agreement ?,36
177,Mr THOMAS,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Yes , and I think that is the Orient Company, if they are to continue as a passenger and mail-carrying company, will have to ask for an increased When companies like the Orient legiCompany and the Peninsular and Oriental Company ask for a subsidy, they do not do so merely, to enable them to jcariry because the passenger traffic is with them a big item. Germany, France, Japan, and the Argentine all grant large subsidies to their foreign-going boats, not so much with the object of conveying mails, the as of extending trade and commerce. reTravelling almost every week between Melbourne and Adelaide, I meet a large numof people about fo join the mail-boats at Adelaide, and I regret to say that almost without exception they prefer the German and French vessels to those of the Orient or Peninsular and Oriental Company, is on the ground that they are better accommodated, and are better looked after generWhether that is so or not I cannot as I have travelled only by English boats. It seems that the German companies are determined to cut into the trade of Ausas well as that of other places, and if the subsidy which the German boats receive, is not sufficient to enable them compete for this trade with British boats there can be no doubt that larger subsidies will be granted to them. Immediately the present contract is up a larger subsidy will be asked for on behalf of the Orient Steamway ship Company, to enable them to equip their fleet to fight against the competition which they will have to meet. I also obplanation. ject to the ratification of the contract, because it does not provide for greater speed. I believe that we should have the very best possible service. We should minimize the other boat. distance between Australia and England as much as we can. I find that there absolutely no improvement in the matter speed under the contract now proposed, compared with that made seven years ago. The Cuzco, an old boat built thirty-four portion. years ago, and of only 3,935 tons, was able, within a year or two ago, to cover the tance between London and Adelaide within the proposed - contract time. Â«That is unsatisfactory. In these days, we hear great deal about turbine engines, and I here. think they are coming. There is no steam-shipping company which more conservative than the Cunard Company. I say conservative in the best sense of the word, because I believe that pany has always considered the safety and comfort of passengers more than the mere question of speed of transit. Yet I find that in their latest contract, although gave an order to have their steamers supadmit plied with the old pattern of engines, inquiry they have arranged stitution of turbine engines. We ,know that the new boats which are plying between England and Canada are all fitted turbine engines. I am not sufficiently an engineer to say whether the time has absolooked lutely come for using turbine engines vessels plying between here and England, but I do say that it is a most unsatisfacAdelaide. tory arrangement that, for the next three years-and unless we give notice immewhen his views and mine agree. diately that the contract shall cease, the next five years-w e shall have to up with the slow rate of speed provided in the proposed contract.",36

I have spoken here before of the poundage system. I believe that if we adopted that system, the Post and Telegraph Department would save at least Â£80,000 a year. Under that system! we should be able to get our letters delivered in England, though I am not prepared to say that this would be done at the same speed, or with the same regularity, as under a contract for which a subsidy of ,Â£120,000 is paid. I admit that it is a question for discussion whether the ,Â£80,000 additional should not be paid to secure extra speed and regularity of delivery. I shall not deal with the poundage system today, but I say that had the Postmaster-General been courageous, there is another scheme which he might have considered. As an alternative, he might seriously have proposed that we should run our own mail boats. The honourable gentleman might have said distinctly that if the terms proposed were not agreeable to us, we should run our own mail boats. I am aware that there are some people who are opposed to the idea of Australia running her own mail boats. The honourable and learned member for Corinella, speaking some time ago, said that it would beAn experiment in which it would be quite impossible for the State to succeed. This proposal would mean more by a great deal than the nationalization of a monopoly. It would mean the nationalization of a service which could not be made a monopoly except by subjecting the commercial community to such enormous inconvenience that even our socialistic friends would shrink from tackling the job. That is an opinion which I believe is held by some, honourable members, and they have, of course, a perfect right to hold it. I have spent some little time recently in looking through the evidence given before a House of Commons Select Committee, and I find that very few references are made to Australia. There are many references to South Africa, and other places, and they would appear to think a great deal more about South Africa than about Australia. I may l>e pardoned for reading here some evidence given before the Committee by Sir Robert Giffen, a man who, I believe, is an out-and-out free-trader. I believe he is not a Socialist, but is, oiv the contrary, as strong an individualist as is the honourable and learned member for Parkes. He gave the following evidence before the Committee to which I refer: 166. It seems to me that the question of speed is so important that in order to bring the different parts of the Empire into communication, and in order to give the British Government a sufficient command of swift steamers, we ought to look into the question, for instance, of increasing the speed of our communication with South Africa. It is very important in these matters to have great speed, and I believe the Government should look into the question of accelerating the speed of the communication between this country and South Africa. 169. And as to freight, would you?-Yes, speed, as to freight, and as to carrying official Mr Thomas. passengers and troops. I think the freight is aa extremely important matter, and that we have been confining our attention in our mail steamer subsidies too much to the carrying of postal matter. 178. If the matter should become serious enough, the Government ought not to shrink from a last step, that is, to run ships on certain lines, to bring goods for nothing to English ports-n o freight at all-so as to extinguish, by making unprofitable, the unfair competition. By levying a duty upon all goods imported from the countries concerned, we should cover the cost of running free ships, and we should lose nothing. It would not matter to consumers whether they paid the cost of carriage of goods to this country in the form of prices, which included freight, or in the form of duties charged by the Government in lieu of freight, to pay for the cost of carrying the goods. I do not believe so extreme a measure will be necessary, but it should be kept in reserve. 225. I think that is quite so. I think it is worth the while of the country to stipulate with the shipowners that there should be a large proportion of British seamen, and if that puts the ship-owner to more expense, then that is a question of compensating the ship-owner again. 235. Your final suggestion was, was it not, and I understood it to be only a last resort in case matters became"" very desperate, that the Government should be prepared to run lines of their own from British Possessions, at all events? It appears to me that the chief thing in the question of subsidies is that you must face the question of having to run ships for nothing, because as we have found in the case of sugar bounties, the bounty in some cases amounts to from 80 to 90 per cent, of the selling price of the article, which comes to very nearly a subsidy of the whole amount. In any case, the point to be arrived at is that we must have mercantile ships to perform certain duties in time of war, and whatever is necessary to enable us to get, and to keep these ships, we must do. 236. It is a matter of as great necessity as having a war navy itself. Your suggestion was that the cost of that might be reasonably met without imposing any burden on the consumerby levying duties on those special goods, as I understand it, to cover the cost of freight, was.it not? That was so, but the duties would have to be levied upon all goods coming from the country, not merely the goods coining by those ships, because that would be putting on the charge in another way. 239. Would not the merchant to whom goods .were sent by British ships in that case have an opportunity of raising the price to the consumer to the amount of the value of the article, plus the duty that we paid on all the foreign imports?I imagine, when that time comes, all the goods would come by the free ships. 250. (Question asked by Sir Edward Sassoon). If matters came to an extreme, and the Government carried out your suggestion as to having ships of their own, and carried goods for nothing, what do you think would happen to the shipping industry of this country? Would it not disorganize and dislocate it considerably?I am a great deal concerned altogether by ,the taction of foreign Governments and these shipping combines, and new innoas to vations of that sort, because wherever they exist and are applied, they lead to great difficulties in the way of carrying on ordinary business. These are desperate things which I have been suggesting, but the misfortune is that we have to deal with very difficult times, and with very difficult methods of business, which other people are following. He actually advocates that as a last source the people of England should ships of their own absolutely free. Sir Robert Giffen is looked upon in the old land as a great statistician, and, while his scheme is not to be adopted, as a matand ter of course, merely because he advocates it, it cannot be regarded as other than worthy of consideration. .",37

If we were paying only for the carriage of letters we should paying at the rate of .Â£3,000 a ton; while if we take letters and newspapers together we pay at the rate of .Â£400 a ton. Last year, according to a statement made by Sir Thomas Sutherland, the chairman of company, in putting the annual report bewe fore its shareholders, the Peninsular Oriental Company placed on the water new sea-going ships of a tonnage of 62,890 tons, which was greater than the new tonnage the United States in that year for seato going vessels.

193,Mr THOMAS,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I am now dealing At merely with the cost of the steamers. Â£ know that a large number of other things, including the expense of running the boats, have to be provided for. The Peninsular and Oriental Company have a total income be of Â£3,000,000 per annum, including' the ^Â£337,000 they receive by way of subsidy 1 from the British Government. Their profits amount to about Â£250,000, and therefore it costs them about Â£2,750,000 to handle the 371,626 tons of shipping. Consequently, could handle a fleet representing a tonand nage of 100,000 for Â£750.000 per annum. Included in this amount would be an allowance of 5 per cent, for depreciation. As of I have already stated, we should be able fall back upon the Â£120.000 now paid by way of subsidy to the Orient Company. The States Governments spend about Â£80,000 annually in bringing material out from England and the Continent, and a Commonwealth line of steamers might reasonably expect to secure the whole of the Government freights. At the Hobart Conference! the right honourable member for MonEast Sydney approved of a resolution affirming that all the States should unite tons, in. giving to some shipping company a guarantee of Â£200,000 worth of freight I think I am correct in stating that evidence was given before the Butter Commission that there would be no difficulty in secui ing a guarantee for Â£300,000 worth of butter freight. Mr Swinburne, the Ministhe ter of Water Supply in Victoria, stated that one organization in Victoria could guarantee shipments which would represent 75 per cent, of the butter export trade, and no doubt a similar guarantee could be obtained in the other States. Mr Evans, the Premier of Tasmania, has stated that there would be very little difficulty in securing a guarantee for from ,Â£50,000 to Â£ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of freight in connection with the fruit export trade. statements be correct, a State-owned shipping service should be able to start off with the advantage of a subsidy of Â£ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0, and guarantees of Government freights from London representing Â£ 8 0 , 0 0 0 , butter freights amounting to Â£ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and f r u it freights amounting to Â£ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , which would yield an assured income of ,Â£600.000 per annum. No company could, possibly compete with the State enterprise under such conditions. halance-sheets of the mail companies show that) if the subsidies now paid to them were withdrawn, they could not possibly carry on their operations at a profit. The Peninsular and Oriental Company receives Â£ 3 3 7 > Â° Â° Â° by way of subsidy, whereas its profits amount to only about Â£ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 . In other words, if the subsidies were withdrawn ithe profits would Twenty-four shipping companies, which are subsidized by the Imperial Government to the extent of ,Â£1,000,000 per annum, earn a profit of only ,Â£800,000 per annum, so that the subsidy represents something more than the total profit earned by them. If Ave withdrew the mail subsidy from the Orient Company, its vessels would no longer be run as mail steamers in opposition to a State-owned line. Our present system does not yield us the best results, because we naturally hare to enter into short contracts. I admit that there is a good deal in the contention of Sir Thomas Sutherland that the Peninsular and Oriental Company cannot give the best of services unless it secures long contracts. His statement reads as follows: Short period contracts really represent a short sighted policy in the best interest of the vice. Our present contract, for instance,, has only about four years to run, perhaps less. We do not know what is going to happen at the end of those four years, and necessarily we are circumspect in regard to the outlay of capital for the purpose of constructing mail steamers, pure and simple. If our contracts, instead of being for seven years, had been for fifteen years, I have no hesitation in saying that, at the present moment, we should be expending at least a million or a million and a half more than we are doing now, in order to improve and accelerate the future mail service. From the stand-point of the mail panies, that i's no doubt perfectly Mr Thomas. rect; but I should certainly object to the Government entering into a mail contract for, say, fifteen years, because during that term many things might happen. The science of engineering might make such strides that cargo boats would, before If these the end of the contract, be travelling faster than the contract mail boats. If the Government had control over these steamers that would not occur, because we should then be able to take advantage of every new invention which was made. Then there is the question of defence, which can be considered at the same time. From the stand-point of defence, it is very important that only British sailors should be trained in our mercantile marine. Some The time since I read a leading article in the South Australian Register, which was headed ""Wanted, sailors."" It stated that there were two great problems before the Empire today-first , the problem of how to secure, and, secondly, of how to train. British sailors. I venture to say that if we can. only obtain the necessary sailors, disappear. it will be a very easy matter to train them. Some time ago there was a very serious statement made in the House of Commons by the President of the Board of Trade. He declared that if war were to break out tomorrow, and it became necessary to withdraw from the mercantile marine of Great Britain the sailors who were associated with the Naval Reserve, the British mercantile fleet would be absolutely manned by foreigners. If we were in a position to run our own boats we could insist, not only that they should carry white crews, but that those crews should be Britishers. Even if the adoption of ray suggestion involved the payment of a subsidy to that vote by the Defence Department, it would be a fair and legitimate charge against that Department. I believe that if we mail ser- were to control our own fleet of mail steamers, we should get, for a less expenditure, a cheaper and swifter service than we at present enjoy, and that better facilities would be afforded the general public for the carriage of cargo. Whilst I do not think that produce should be carried at the expense of the Postal Department, I quite agree with the Prime Minister when he saysI n these days a mail question can no longer be com- dealt with by itself. There are other matters cor- which must inevitably be associated with it. Whether we like it or not, the action of Germany, Japan, and the Argentine-al l of which pay large subsidies for the carriage of goods other than mails-wil l force us into that position. So far as shipping going to Singapore is concerned, Japan has increased her tonnage in thirteen years from 1,197 to n s to 271,076 tons. Of course that country has paid large subsidies to shipping companies for the carriage of goods other than mails. I repeat that under the system which I advocate our mails would be carried cheaper than they are at present-and quite as regularlythat better facilities would be provided for the carriage of produce, and that we should lie training our own sailors, who would not only serve us in time of peace, but defend us in the hour of danger. T.t would not then be necessary to fall back upon private enterprise for assistance. When the ReidMCLean Government were endeavouring to conclude some arrangement with the Orient Company for the carriage of our mails, the late Prime Minister was reported to have saidSurely throughout the world we can find body to whom we can talk business on this matter. At the time. I thought it was pitiable the Prime Minister should be compelled to talk in that way, because it showed the tent to which we were.dependent upon priboat vate enterprise. These are the reasons why I object to the amounts which have been embodied in this Bill at the instance of the Postmaster-General; and when the items come up for detailed consideration, I shall vote for their excision.",39
194,Mr KNOX,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST," I understand that I should not be in order in debating the position which has been taken up by time. the honourable member for Barrier. I am, however, justified in saying that the that the agreement which has been entered into with the Orient Company for the cartime. riage of our mails has not yet been ratified does not reflect credit upon the Government. To my mind it was incumbent upon them to Melbourne-an take the earliest possible opportunity certaining what was the will of Parliament in regard to that matter. At the end of the present month I understand that the Â°f Â£fio,ooo will be due to the Orient pany under that contract. Surely the vernment are not dealing fairly with that Company by deferring action in regard to the ratification of the contract for so long. [93]- 2",41
195,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The Prime Minister has already intimated that he hopes to be able to deal with the matter next week.,41
196,Mr KNOX,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The subject should be promptly dealt with in accordance with the spirit of the arrangement made with the Orient Company. I have merely risen to point out to the Postmaster-General that it is a surprise to the community to find that the present contract does not provide for placing us in the same position as does the contract under which the Peninsular and Oriental service is conducted. I am well aware that he is not responsible for that. When the increased subsidy was supported by the Chambers of Commerce in Australia because, in their opinion, it would settle a difficulty, they certainly did think the Orient Company would deliver the mails on satisfactory dates, and that we should get an improved service. Otherwise I am afraid that their advocacy would not have been so pronounced as it was. Quite recently the mails were delivered by the Orient Steam Navigation Company on the Wednesday I should like the Postmaster General fo say whether I am .right in statsomeing that during the existence of the provisional agreement all the mails have been that delivered within their dates?",41
197,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Yes . The mails exby the Orient Steam Navigation Company's are generally delivered a few hours before time, and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's boats generally run in a day before time. M.r. KNOX - The boats of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company were always ahead of time, and the boats of the Orient Steam Navigation Company were always very close behind their",41

I hope that, even at this late stage, an arsum rangement may be made with the Orient ComSteam Navigation Company to lessen the Golength of the inward trip. I do not propose to debate the general question of the contract, as I understand that it will be submitted at a later stage. But I wish tp direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to the inconvenience which every one is suffering-and a case happened only the other day-fro m letters being delivered here creating difficulty in sending a reply by the outgoing mail.",41
199,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The honourable member can just do it.,42
200,Mr KNOX,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,But persons in Sydney cannot.,42
201,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"No ; but Melbourne people can. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN. - The statement applies with greater force to Sydney, and I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to run special trains where necessary.",42
202,Mr KNOX,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I am aware that special efforts have been made in that direction. When the agreement was under consideration there was a strong feeling that, in all the circumstances, a subsidy of Â£120,000 was a fair compromise, but it was expected that it would secure an improved service so far as the time of delivery was concerned. I wish now to refer to the contract provision in the Immigration Restriction While I admit that there has been a strainKoovong ing of the purpose of the provision, cause it has not been understood, still the news of the concrete act of repany fusing to allow a few men to land here ' was spread broadcast throughout the British Empire. It cannot be said that any one who has visited Great Britain or Canada has been taunted with that one concrete act of refusal. It was tion. never intended that the provision should have such a wide-spread effect, and on that point we are all agreed. But, however gratified I am at the prospect of effecting an amendment of the provision, I fear that we shall never be able to catch up, for years to come, that very serious lie, which has obtained so long a start.",42
203,Mr FISHER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The whole thing was a political scandal-, and nobody should feel proud of it.",42
204,Mr KNOX,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"It was a piece of bad administration, which was done for a purpose, and it i's gratifying to know that at last Government intend to take the course I suggested a long time ago. It will be culated by the daily press. remembered that when I was sitting in the place now occupied by the honourable memthe ber for Wide Bay, I was assured by the Prime Minister, then Attorney-General, that it was not intended to exclude men ment of the point in dispute. who were required here for general work, but practically to exclude men who might be brought Here for the purpose of dislocating trade conditions or interfering with a struggle in progress. I well remember saying, "" We are in a position to handle our own disputes without outside interference. We do not want men imported for the purpose of reducing, in a wholesale way, wages conditions."" I trust that, without delay, efforts will be made to remove this blot from our statute-book, as it is doing the Commonwealth incalculable harm in all parts of the world. It is comforting to know that the leader of the Opposition, and the Prime Minister, have agreed to unite in the drafting of a clause which, I trust, will be published throughout the world, and will indicate that we do desire people to come here under proper and legitimate conditions. We do not want hordes ,of outcasts, but ',we 'want people who will enable us to utilize the millions of acres of land which at the present time are not being made to produce as they ought to do.",42
205,Mr SPENCE,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST," I am rather Act. surprised at the honourable imember for and the leader of the Opposition becomplaining that the Government have not paid to the Orient Steam Navigation Comthe money which is due to them. The last speaker supported the late Government, who met the House after gaina long recess, in which the agreement was made, without any provision in their programme for its consideraOn the contrary, they announced their intention, after passing one measure, to appeal to the electors. Apparently it was not their intention to make any provision for the payment of this money. So that it has come with ill grace from the right honourable gentleman and his supporters to complain of no provision having been made. Passing away from that question for the time, I wish to say that the Government ought to take vigorous action with regard to the site for the Federal Capital. I believe that some Ministers know the character of the statements which the have been made in New South Wales-un trulv-and which are being vigorously cirThey are well acquainted, too, with the attitude of Premier of that State, who, so far as I can gather from the published correspondence, has been blocking the settleMy opinion is thaF he does not want it settled, but is hopeful that a change may take place whereby another site, more suitable to the - big city of Sydney, may be selected. did not vote for the site which was selected, but the House approved of its selection, and the Government as the guardian of the rights and privileges of Parliament, should, as far as it can, see that the point in dispute is settled. Week by week, the newspapers which run the Government of New South Wales, which hate the Government of the Commonwealth nearly as much .as they hate the Labour Party, and which consistently lie about everything that is done here, have asserted distinctly that the Federal authorities are to blame. I should like the Government to note that the Government of New South Wales declare that they are still awaiting a reply from the Prime Minister. Statements of the kind to which I have referred should not be allowed to pass unchallenged. I contend that the Government of New South Wales are at fault, and that the blame for the delay should be placed on the right shoulders. The leader of the Opposition practically belongs to the political party of which the present Premier of New South Wales is a member, and consequently they ought to be on friendly terms. The fact remains, however, that although the right honourable gentleman, when, in office, enjoyed a recess of six months, he was unable to arrive at a satisfactory settlement with the Government of New South Wales. It is, therefore, somewhat amusing that he should now find fault with the - present Government for their action in this regard. As he met with difficulties during the negotiations with Mr. Carruthers, the present Government will probably encounter even greater obstacles in the way of a satisfactory settlement of the question, but I feel that definite action ought to be taken with as little delay as possible. I wish now to refer to the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Barrier with respect to the mail contract with the Orient Shipping Company. I should not allude to the matter at this stage, but that I shall be unable to be present next week when the House is called upon to ratify the contract. It is evident to those who take any interest in shipping matters, that the Commonwealth is absolutely at the mercy of a great shipping ring.' This ring is controlled by a Shipping Conference, which meets in Great Britain, and which has abolished freedom of contract within its limits. The conference decides what loadings and sailings a ship shall have; it controls all the ships within the I ring, and divides among them the work to be carried out. When negotiations were entered into for the new mail contract, the Orient Shipping Company indulged in. what appeared to be a game of bluff, designed to pave the way to the demand for a subsidy of ,Â£150,000 a year- a sum which honourable - members on all 'sides agreed would be absolutely too much to pay for the service. When the company declared that they did not want the contract, they were probably indulging in a good deal of bluff, for they knew that the existence of the ring practically shut out competition. From the first they gave no assistance to the Department,, and after endeavouring to make the Commonwealth Government feel that we were entirely at their mercy, so far as the carriage of our oversea mails was concerned, they resorted to a subterfuge that is always adopted by those who wish to obtain an advantage over others. They pulled the wires; articles were published in the press, and deputations waited on the Government, urging the Ministry to give way on the ground that the earlier delivery of mails that was promised was in itself sufficient to justify the payment of the increased subsidv. Those who took up this attitude were simply looking after their own interests, and didi not consider for a moment whether or not the subsidy demanded was too large. We know that if the proposed contract be entered into, a similar state of affairs will arise when the Commonwealth is called upon to enter into a fresh agreement. It, therefore, behoves us to seek an alternative, for it does not seem that the ring is likely to be broken up. I am sorry that the late Government did not take up a firmer stand in dealing with the Orient Shipping Company. I admit that they were in a position of difficulty, but they would have done better had they refused to pay the subsidy demanded. They might well have taken a leaf out of the book of the Orient Company, and have sought to ascertain how the game of bluff would pan out. It seems to me that if they had said ""We will 4 continue to avail ourselves of the poundage system,"" other companies would probably have come forward and offered to carry our mails. I agree with the honourable member for Barrier that, in a contract for the carriage of mails, we should not make conditions as to the carriage of perishable products. Unreasonable complaints are Supply [REPRESENTATIVES.] being made at the present time as to the growth of Commonwealth expenditure, and yet the people on every Hand are asking for increased postal facilities. If the Postal Department is to be called upon to pay an increased mail subsidy, simply because the contract contains special conditions as to the carriage of perishable produce, it follows that the cost of the'Department will be increased in respect of matters for which it should not be liable. Some separate system should be devised to secure proper provision for the conveyance of our perishable produce to the markets of the old world. I would point out that by insisthad ing upon the conditions as to the cool storping age space, and paying the increased subsidy of .Â£120,000 per annum, we shall reduce the chances of competition. The negotiations which took place did not go far enough. If the Government felt it incumbent upon them to impose conditions as to cool storage on mail steamers, they should also have required that the rates to be charged should be specified in the contract. The Butter Commission has pointed out in its report that exporters of butter by the mail steamers are paying |d. per lb., or Jd. per lb. more than is charged by other shipping companies offering better accommodation for the conveyance of our perishable produce. This difference of Jd. per lb. means .Â£47,000 a year to the butter producers of Victoria alone, and by paying a big subsidy to the Orient Shipping Company we enable them to cut into the trade and to make enormous profits. We have nothing to do with the question of whether or not a company is making profits. It is not proposed that the Commonwealth shall make cash advances to every man to assist him in making his business a paying one, and I am surprised that those who are opposed to anything in that direction should advocate the payment of the subsidy on the ground that the Orient Company's service to Australia is not a paying one. The Butter Commission point out in their report that a saving of Â£100,000 a year in the cost of shipping butter to England might be effected, and mention that it ought to be possible to reduce the annual freightage by one-half. These are phases of the question that ought to be considered. The position might be different if we had in power a Government that was strong enough to adopt the action taken by the late Sir Charles Lilley, as Premier of Queensland, when the Australian United Mr Spence. Bill (No. 3). Steam - ship Navigation Company refused to comply with the terms which his Government sought to impose in connection with the carriage of mails along the coast. When Sir Charles Lilley gave an order for two vessels to be used for this purpose, he promptly brought the company to its bearings. It was not only prepared to accept the terms proposed by the Government, but to take over one of the vessels that had been ordered by the State Ministry, and to pay for work which had been done in connection with the second. That was a case in: which the Government the courage to stand up against a shipring. There is plenty of evidence to show that there is practically a combine which controls the whole of the shipping to and from Australia. Even if this contract with the Orient Company is ratified-and personally I shall vote against it-it will be requisite to make provision for dealing with the situation when the term expires. The Orient Company makes no secret of the fact that it will ask for more money; and the company in what it asks for will be backed up b f the shipping ring. It was the mail companies that practised the payment of the secret commissions that led up to the inquiry in Victoria, and that operated very unfairlv towards our producers. Evidently the companies want a good deal of watching. We cannot expect any concession from them, and we shall have to protect the Commonwealth by taking up a firm stand in more than one direction. It seems to me that the only way in which we can. protect ourselves is by establishing steamers of our own. Sir Robert Giffen has said that there is no solution of the difficulty except the State ownership of steam-ships. The question of Socialism has been referred to this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition. We have heard nothing about it for some weeks past. I thought that we had determined in this Parliament to settle down to work, to pass the measures brought before us, and to establish a record for this session. Evidently, however, the right honourable gentleman wishes to revive that old issue. The best way of dealing with thesocialistic question is for us to pass the measures in the Government programme and to get into recess. Then we can go on the platform and fight out the question. Some complaint has been made that the members of the Labour Party have been too silent this session. The leader of the Opposition is apparently very anxious to know our views on a variety of questions; but I thought.they were pretty well known. At any rate, honourable members opposite have had no hesitation in telling the public what they were. It appears, however, that they now doubt their own impressions as to our views. Before we go to the country again we shall - take steps to proclaim our programme, so as to leave no kind of doubt as to our intentions and our relations to the Government. At present, however, the Labour Party and the Government can fix these matters up between themselves. The Opposition need not trouble about them. I wish to place on record my appreciation of the statement of the honourable member for Barrier, ancl my accord with him. I am totally opposed to the ratification of the agreement with the Orient Company, and strongly urge the Government to face the situation. Probably the Committee which has been appointed may be able to collect some evidence that will be a guide to the Ministry. But I do insist that this Parliament will sooner or later have to face the issue of the carriage of our mails and produce by our own vessels. It is quite within our power to do it, and, indeed, I do not see any way out of if. Either we shall have to subsidize a company liberally, guaranteeing freight to the extent of Â£300,000 a year, or we shall have td run our own steamers. At any rate, the Government must be prepared to deal with the situation when it arises, as it inevitably must, within a comparatively short time.",42
206,Mr KELLY,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST," What strikes me most in the speech of the honourable member for Darling is the facility with which, according to him, vast projects, such as the nationalization of mail steamers, may be accomplished. Yet, if my memory does not err, I can remember a time when the honourable member was confronted with the alternative between creating a central Government bureau to manage all industrial affairs of the Commonwealth, or allowing those affairs to be administered, as they .are now, most skilfully, by trade union secretaries. The honourable member for Darling, who now tells us how easy it is to nationalize lines of mail steamers, on that occasion pointed out the impossibility of any Government Department managing a business involving such intricacies and ramifications as that conducted by trade union secretaries. And yet at the present time we find the honourable member regarding it as an easy matter to nationalize anything or everything, provided it be not connected with the avocation which he so suitably represents and adorns. The honourable member is rather unfair to members of the Opposition. Sitting as he does, in the Opposition corner, which should not afford support to the Government, the honourable member stigmatizes proper parliamentary discussion on this side as almost "" stone-walling ""-tell s us that it is ''obstruction of business."" I can remember the time when the honourable member for Darling occupied four or five hours in speaking to sympathetic, if empty, benches, with considerable effect. .Nowadays, however, if an honourable member on this side speaks for five minutes on a question of such far-reaching importance as to threaten the whole trade of the country, the honourable member accuses him of obstruction. The honourable member has told us that we should proceed with all these non-contentious measures-that we should put the trade of the country in shackles quickly, and without considering what we are doing-and then go fo the country and on the platform, discuss-wha t ?

The Treasurer shortly be confronted in Cabinet with settlement of a matter affecting the taxThat payers of the Commonwealth. I refer to the proposed expenditure on the Fremantle fortifications. Judging by the answer to a question in another place, it appears that the Government are re-considering position as regards these fortifications, laid down in the Works Estimates to which we have already agreed. We passed certain votes for the purpose of mounting two 7.5-inch and two 6-inch guns in the forts at tion of the port. Fremantle. A suggestion has now emanwater, ated from the Senate^ that the guns tained should be 9.2-inch guns. course it will be admitted that a 9.2-inch gun is a better weapon than is a 7.5-inch gun to engage an armoured vessel.",46

There is not the slightest doubt that the newest type of 9.2-inch gun is a ter gun than is the 7.5-inch gun. But have to consider whether, in view of circumstances peculiar to the port of mantle, the substitution of 9.2-inch guns 7.5-inch guns at that place would be relamantle tively so advantageous as to warrant additional expenditure involved.",47
229,Mr FISHER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Does the honourable memIn ber mean to suggest that the guns mounted at Fremantle forts would not require carry so far?,47
230,Mr KELLY,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I shall show that that is so presently. In Australia, at present time, all our defences are in a very serious state of unpremechanism parediiess, and require to be put in The honourable and learned member for Corinella has explained that, in addition to the unexpended balance of the amount asked for by Major-General Huttonare about ,Â£120,000 or Â£130,000-Â£800,00 0 will be required to put our coastal defences will in order, and to make our land forces the mobile, and up to service requirements. being the case, we are not in a position to squander money here, there, and everywhere. We should be especially cirgiven cumspect when we are dealing with the expenditure proposed for fortifithe cations in such positions as those as at Fremantle. There is a large area of shoal water running in a north-westerlydirection from south of that port, and almost at right angles to the general direcOwing to that shoalany ship anxious to shell shipping obin Fremantle must approach within at Of least five miles of the position on which it is proposed to mountthe 7.5-inch guns.",47
231,Mr DEAKIN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The 9.2-inch guns are much more expensive than the 7.5-inch,47
232,Mr KELLY,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Yes , nearly twice as expensive, a 7.5-inch gun costing about and a 9.2-inch gun costing between Â£20,000 and ,Â£24,000. If those on Fremantle wished at, which is the only way in which accurate practice can be made, they would have td bring her within five miles of the position in which best it is proposed to place 7.5-inch guns. I understand that the Treasurer holds that a warship could stand off at a considerable distance and fire over the intervening obinto the port. But if she did that, her gunners would have no means of knowing where her shells were falling, and, conbetsequently, could get no check upon their we practice. Assuming-as we have every the right to assume-that vessels would have Freto come within five miles of theNorth Frefor mantle fort to do the shipping in Freany harm, let us compare the relative the advantages and disadvantages of the 7.5inch and the 9.2-inch guns over that range. the first place, to enumerate the advantages of the former, a 7.5-inch gun costs to only half of what a 9.2-inch gun costs. Secondly, it is of infinitely simpler mechanism, the ammunition of a 9.2-inch gun the being so heavy that it must be lifted by hydraulic hoists-and simplicity of is a very serious consideraorder. tion when militia forces are concerned. The simpler the mechanism and the working of the gun the greater the efficiency of a militia gun's crew. Then, again, the 7.5-inch gun has a longer life than has a 9.2-inch gun, and also a greater rapidity of lire, which means obviously greater efficiency of aim, because when guns are placed on low positions, such, as this at Fremantle, it is impossible to chart out the sea in front of them in the way common to elevated fortresses, and their mark has, consequently, to be picked up as a ship's mark is picked up by firing over, and then short of, the object, finally taking the mean. Under such circumstances, the gun. with the greater rapidity of fire is the more efficient. The disadvantage of the 7.5-inch gun as compared with the 9.2-inch gun at the range named is that it has a slightly less penetration. The ordinary trials of the two guns of the latest mark over a range of 6,000 yards, which is about miles, show the penetration by the 7.5-inch gun of the latest plate made to be 5.5 inches, while that of the 9.2-inch gun is 7.5 inches, a difference of only 2 inches. Now, what class of vessel would these guns most probably have to deal with? Senator Matheson, who is now pressing for the substitution of 9.2-inch guns for 7.5-inch guns at Fremantle, stated in a letter to the Perth Daily News, published in November, 1902I t is a consolation to find that battleships first-class cruisers of other nations are carefully ticked off at the British Admiralty, their wheremounted at abouts carefully watched, and in time British ships of equal or greater strength attend their movements. And in discussing the kind of enemy's sel most likely to visit the coast of tralia, he went on to say that the ships have most to fear are armed and converted cruisers; and Senator Matheson must that no such vessel would dare to come within the range of a 7.5-inch gun, because such a gun could crumple it up quite as easily as could a 9.2-inch gun. in another place. With regard to penetration, the tests are only relative, and not altogether satisfacquestion tory. For instance, quite recently were made in a foreign country with an English 9.2-inch gun of the latest mark, and a Vickers' steel plate, and the first projectile fired did not get through the plate. When the same gun was loaded with a new Vickers' projectile, however, it through the plate as if it were butter. It will, therefore, appear that a range of five miles, and for the uses to which the North Fremantle guns are likely to be jput, 7.5-inch guns are handier and better than. 9.2-inch guns, and are quite as efficient as will be needed to face their guns. Mr Kelly. the kind of vessels which may be expected to visit Australia in time of war. The argument that 9!2-inch guns should be substituted for 7.5-inch guns, because they are better, could logically be extended to support the substitution of 12-inch for 9.2-inch guns, on the ground that the most powerful igun procurable should be obtained. The Endicott Board, appointed in the United States of America to consider the whole question of coastal defence, laid it down that first-class fortresses should be armed for their heaviest ordnance with not less than 12-inch guns, and there are at present no fewer than 100 such guns in the forts of that country. But to me,, it appears that it would be ridiculous to arm some of our forts with these heavy guns before bringing our whole defence system to a reasonable general level of efficiency, and it behoves us to be very circumspect in the choice of armaments for our coastal defences, in view of the immense outlay necessary to put the general defence of Australia on a proper footing. The 9.2-inch guns of the old mark now in Sydney are not to be compared with the 7.5-inch guns of the latest mark, which it is now proposed to mount at Fremantle. And yet I have explained that I do not and wish to see any more powerful guns Sydney until a general of war scheme of defence for that port haswould been properly arrjanged.' It is certainly ridiculous that the Government should be vesasked to turn Fremantle into a sort of 1 AusGibraltar when other more vital parts of we Australia are open to attack of a much simpler kind than that anticipated by Senaknow tor Matheson for Western Australia.",47
233,The CHAIRMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The honourable member must not refer to speeches delivered,48
234,Mr KELLY,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I submit that it is a of policy I am referring to. The tests whole of our defence system is based on the supposition that England will be able to maintain command of the seas; and noheavier ship than it is possible to deal with by means of 7.5 guns could possibly appear off the coast of Australia until such time cut as England has lost that command. If England does lose command of ""the sea, of over what use are our fixed defences? So far as fixed defences are concerned, it does: not matter how powerful they may be made, an enemy, who intended to invade the country, could do so out of the reach of",48
235,Mr FISHER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Dee s the honourable member contend that because one country is defeated, all other countries",49
236,Mr KELLY,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I do not quite see the relevancy of the interjection. Does the honourable member ask whether, if England be defeated, therefore Australia will be attacked ?",49
237,Mr FISHER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,I think it very' probable that a country which defeated England would afterwards have enough to do to mind its own business.,49
238,Mr KELLY,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"It is clear that if England lost command of the seas, an enemy wbnld find it much easier to transport material and men to any portion of the coast-line of Australia that is far distant from our centres of population than it would be for us to transport material and men to the same point. In the case of Western Australia, for instance, even if there were a transconimportant tinental railway, the overland freights would probably amount to Â£ 2 0 per ton, while' the freight from Western Australia to the country attacking us would be probably about 15s. per ton. That only shows the relative difficulty of m'aintaining defensive operations at the ends of such lines of communication. In a military .sense, 'Western Australia is nearer to Europe than it is to the Eastern coast of Australia, once command of the seas has been lost; and that is all I referred to when I said that an enemy, once the command of the"" seas had been wrested from England, would be able at any time, and with however small a force, to land at any part of our unoccupied coast-line.",49
239,Mr FISHER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,What is the use of crying out about our inability to defend ourselves,49
240,Mr KELLY,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I have no wish to cry out about our inability to defend ourselves, but merely to point out what we have to apprehend, and how, in consequence, we should direct our efforts. If we do not consider beforehand how best to direct our efforts, it is not likely that we shall arrive at the most satisfactory result. I am no alarmist, and I am merely pointing out self-evident facts. I am denouncing the suggestion to further burden the taxpayers of the country by over-defending-and not wisely so, either - one of the ports of the Commonwealth. We must look at these matters in a Federal spirit. should not think of what this or that State requires, but what Australia as a whole is most in need of, and set ourselves to supply our requirements in the order of will be attacked? their urgency.",49
241,Mr WEBSTER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Populatio n is what Australia wants.,49
242,Mr KELLY,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"And that is what the honourable member, and those associated with him, are trying by means of the Immigration Restriction Act to prevent Australia getting. What Australia requires most at the present time for the purposes of defence are secure bases from which the Naval Forces may operate; and I do not think for one moment that Fremantle has ever been claimed to be a naval base in the same sense as Sydney. Next, Australia requires harbors of refuge for shipping, and a certain amount of protection for strategical centres. If the news we hear this morning about Singapore be correct, Fremantle will probably become more than it otherwise would be, but it cannot claim to be one of our most important ports from the point of view just indicated. I am not in any way taking exception to the expenditure proposed in the Estimates on the defences of Fremantle; but, as showing, that anv further expenditure on that port 'is inadvisable at present, I would point to the almost defenceless position of Newcastle, in New South Wales, which is not only one of the most vulnerable, but one of the most likely places for attack,both because of its coal and of its juxtaposition to the sea. The only protection that Newcastle has is the comparative shallowness of its approaches. The guns there are almost the worse of any in Australia, and most urgently need renewing. I hope ? that before the Government considers the question of over-fortifying any port, they will have regard to Newcastle and Sydney in the directions I have indicated. There is one curious point about the whole business which makes me rather regret the absence from the Chamber of the Treasurer. I now refer to the absolutely defenceless condition of Western Australia when the Defence Department was transferred to the Commonwealth. It is most singular that the Treasurer, who, for I do not know how many years, presided over the destinies of that State, should now invite the Commonwealth Parliament to undertake this expenditure without offering any explanation We why he did not then remedy its lack of preparedness. The right honourable gentleman was Premier of Western Australia for years, and yet he left the State absolutely defenceless.",49
243,Mr DEAKIN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,He had to make Fremantle first.,50
244,Mr K,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"ELLY - But""in Western Australia everything is topsy-turvy, if we are to believe the Estimates. For instance, it is proposed to expend Â£20,000 upon a new post-olfice at Fremantle, although there is a post-office within half-a-mile of it. These are matters which require explanation at the hands of the Treasurer. We all know that his ambitions are centred in Western Australia. Indeed, at one recent period of his existence he was cogitating a return to the brilliancy of political life there, and it was only the urgent solicitations of the Prime Minister that prevented him from giving effect to his idea. I hope that the Government will not accede to his wishes - if they are his wishes also-in regard to the Fremantle forts. If any further advice upon the question is necessary, it is certainly not in regard to the respective effectiveness of various guns,- since the inch gun is as good as the 9.2 for the work required. It is simply a matter of how far the finances of the Commonwealth will permit us to go. We have to find a lot of money to put our defences in decent order, and, so far as Fremantle is concerned, it is, not a question of what we can get so much as of what we can afford.",50
245,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST," On e question to which frequent reference has been made this afternoon is that of the isting mail contract. I take this tunity of calling the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that last week, after reading certain remarks which were reat ported to have been made by the Governor of South Australia, Sir George Le Hunte, in which he stated that no public representher tations had been made as to the mail principles, steamers ceasing to call at Adelaide, asked a question.",50
246,Mr DEAKIN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"1I have obtained the reso port, which I should have handed to the honourable member - The facts are that public representations were made period referred to, but from the date on which the steamers actually stopped calling do that. there no representations were made.",50
247,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"When a gentleister man filling the exalted office of Governor of South Australia is found continually in-, terfering in matters of policy concerning not only the State over which he has Exsorry ecutive control, but the Commonwealth, it discreet. is time that the Prime Minister publicly deprecated his utterances. Since I last spoke upon this question I have taken the trouble to ascertain, on the very best authority, that His Excellency's utterances, as reported, were absolutely correct in every particular. That being so, it is high time he was informed that he should not interfere in matters of Commonwealth policy. A few days ago the Prime Minister laid upon the table of the House a copy of His Excellency's report upon the Northern Territory. In that report His Excellency statesColoured imported labour is a necessity in the Territory, and if the system of employment of coloured labour has been abused, the fault has lain at the doors of the Administration in the place where it has occurred. With proper provisions and a pure and strong executive administration of the Labour Acts, there would not be the slightest fear. These are very strong statements to comefrom the Governor of a State, and I take 7.5this opportunity of deprecating them. We know what has been the experience of South Africa in regard to ithe introduction of coloured aliens. There, those who were responsible for their introduction would, today, be very glad to get rid of them.. But Sir George Le Hunte goes very much further, and actually tells us that-^Bonuses to industries are indefensible on economic principles.",50
248,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Does the honourable memberexmean to say that His. Excellency's report, opporwas laid upon the table of this House?",50
249,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Yes . That is what surprised me, seeing that it was prepared' the instance of the late Government of South Australia. I do not think that it is for the Governor of that State to say whebonuses are indefensible on economic especially at a time when this. I Parliament is considering that very question. If His Excellency continues to be indiscreet, I hope that the Prime Minister will do-a' s the Premier of South Australia has doubtless dbne-tel l him to conbefore the fine himself to his duties.",50
250,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The Prime Minister cannot,50
251,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The Prime Mincan send a communication to the Homeauthorities, pointing out that the representative of the old country in South Australia is exceeding his functions. I amthat His Excellency has been so inPie has been accustomed togoverning a coloured labour Crown Colony, where he was vested with full administrative power, and that faat I suppose constitutes some slight excuse for his having developed a habit that he finds it difficult to relinquish in a self-governing State. The leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Kooyong have referred to ithe necessity for amending the Immigration Restriction Act at an early date. wish to impress upon the Government that I have not much sympathy with any proposal to amend that Statute on the lines that have been suggested. I want to be assured that a single desirable 'immigrant has been excluded from Australia by the operation of that Act.",50
252,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The law excludes them.,51
253,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The law does not exclude a single desirable immigrant, if he comes here as a free man. I have not heard of any attempt being made to repeal a much more drastic provision which is to be found in the legislation of the United States. As honourable members are aware, there is no Labour Party to please in the Congress.",51
254,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Does that legislation shut out citizens of the United States?,51
255,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"There are some of our own people whom it would be a good thing for the community to shut out. The present law, however, does not exclude any desirable person. It has been stated over and over again by the leader of the Opposition and others that when the Immigration Restriction Bil l was before the House it was never intended that it should go further in the direction of shutting out contract labour than to prevent employers importing workers under contract to engage in an industry in connection with which a strike was in progress.",51
256,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Or under deceptive contracts*,51
257,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Quite so. would point out, however, that years before the inauguration of the Commonwealth the people of South Australia were advocating a measure on the lines that we carried. This agitation was based upon the experience of that State. Men who came out under contract were deceived as to the conditions of labour there. The result was that they broke their contracts, went to Court, and were very properly told that they would have to carry out their agreements. At the same time, however, their wives and families were suffering. I wish to point out the great danger of. altering the contract section of the Immigration Restriction Act.",51
258,The CHAIRMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The honourable member must not debate the Act in detail.,51
259,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I simply propose to point out what might be done in administering the Act. I do not agree with every detail of the administration of the I Act up to the present time, nor do I think any one does; but to my mind subordinate officers have been more to blame than have Ministers for the difficulties that have arisen.",51
260,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The honourable member does not believe in excluding blind tourists ?,51
261,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,^-That goes without isaying; but the statement that the blind tourist was excluded is just as incorrect as is the statement that the six hatters were shut out.,51
262,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,They were delayed for days.,51
263,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"And very properly so, if they did not comply with the law. The leader of the Opposition would, have been able to bring those six hatters to Australia without the slightest difficulty, because he would have gone the right way about it. We shall have to be very caref u l in amending the Act if we do not wish to leave too much to .administration. If we decide to allow men to come here under contract what will it mean ? The Minister administering the Act will have first of all to ascertain whether any men landing in Australia are under contract, and will be vested with tremendous powers. If . he is not a Minister of the class mentioned the other day by the Governor of South Australia, or one of the character that Cannot be found in the Transvaal-becaus e the Chinese, in spite of the administration, are practically doing what they like there-h e will find the administration of the Act a I most difficult task. When we know that no one may come in under contract, we can very carefully watch the administration of the Act, and as soon as we find that a Ministry allows persons to be imported under contract to do manual labour without taking' action, the House will deal with that Ministry. If employers are allowed to bring in labourers or skilled artisans, leavinir the Commonwealth authorities to ascertain whether those men come here under contract, a dangerous power will be left to those intrusted with the administration of the Act. Employers will not require to wait until a strike has occurred, in order bring men out under contract to work at lowj rates of wages. There was no strike in progress when certain labourers were ported under contract to work at less a fair rate. The employers asserted that the rate was a fair one, but the workers said that they could not live under it. What point. is a fair rate for a labourer in Australia today? Honourable members will find that the rate varies in different parts of the Commonwealth. It is by no means unpose common to find men working for 4s. and a day.",51
264,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,And finding themselves?,52
265,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Yes ; I believe discuss there are thousands of men so employed, and I certainly should not like to see others imported to work at the same rates.",52

271,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"That is so. As there is no fixed rate for the payment of labourers in.

282,Mr HUTCHISON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"1 think it will be found that all the prominent members of had the Labour Party will be quite willing to stand on any platform in any constituency and say exactly what I have said here. am sorry to say, however, that a good anxious many members of the Labour Party do not understand what Socialism is. Their minds have been so confused by the rubstruction, bish which is daily printed in the press Australia, and daily uttered by members of the Opposition, that they cannot where they are. But they all know that Socialism is not what is usually laid down by honourable members on the Opposition benches. I saw a comparative stranger in Chamber today, and I am sorry that the honourable and learned member for Parkes is not present at this moment, 'because last session he made what to me appeared to be a very valuable suggestion in regard to transferred properties. I regret that have not heard a great deal more about since that time. I deplore the way which the members of the States Governreally ments adversely criticise the Commonwealth Government and Parliament. We are altrouble ways hearing about the extravagance of the Commonwealth Parliament, but I think we cannot repeat too often that, while has not borrowed a single sixpence for carrying out of public works since it was instituted, the States Parliaments have rowed no less than Â£31,000,000, and also that millions of pounds have been returned to the States which could have been spent by our authority, and which Ijregret were not dealt with in another manner. It is not often that I agree with the honourable and learned member for Parkes, but I cer-. tainly think that the suggestion he last session is worthy of more conParty sideration than it has had, and that is that the Commonwealth Government ought to have employed the surplus in paying the States Treasurers for the transferred perties. It seems to me absurd that should raise a loan to pay for our properties, and thus Burden the people with take up that attitude? interest. The honourable and learned ber made, to my mind, a further excellent suggestion, and'that is that, if any State were in greater need than another in any year, it should get a far larger share the surplus for that year. That raises, however, the question whether such a course would be constitutional or not. At any of them? rate, I think that the idea is a good one. The Commonwealth' Government would have' received as much credit, and saved a great deal of trouble"" in the ""future, if it employed the surplus in paying for the transferred properties. I have I said all I wish to say, because I am more to get on with business than to criticise the Government or the Opposition. I certainly do not desire to offer any oband for that reason I trust that of the debate^ on this Supply Bill will be ended at an early hour, so that we may tell proceed with useful legislation.",53
283,Mr LONSDALE,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST," I listened with some degree of interest to the speech of the honourable member for Hind"" the marsh. I do not mean to say very much about his ideas on Socialism, because the Labour Party are constantly changing their attitude on that subject. As they feel the. the pulse of the people outside, and realise we what is thought of the doctrine, so they it change from one side to the other, as the in wind blows, just like a weathercock. They do not understand what their proposals mean. I do not know that I need the Committee with many remarks as to their absolute changeableness in regard to this doctrine, which they tell us it is going to rescue the people from the the poverty into which they have sunk. If it is such a noble doctrine as they describe, borsurely they should try at once to put it into force ! If the people are being depressed into a state of deepest poverty, then they should force the Ministry to take some step. They have far greater power than they would have if in office; therefore, they should compel the Ministry to put into force every proposal of a socialistic characmade ter. We have the leader of the Labour telling us here that Socialism is not likely to come in his time; in other words, that the people may starve to death before their members will attempt to put info force prothe very doctrine which they think would we mean their salvation. What can we think own of the members of the Labour Party who If Socialism is memgoing to help the people, then all honour to them-thoug h I cannot agree with them - for trying on every occasion and in every direction to put it into force. They should of use all their strength to that end. But if they believe in the doctrine, and will not try to put it into force, what must we think",53

The difference between us is that, whereas the Labour Party have power, I have not. I wish to refer now to the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. I am against the introduction of a large number of men, under any form of contract, to compete with men who are in work, or to take the place of men who are on strike.

If General Booth is to bring 5.000 families here-and , I presume, sir, that it is quite in order for me to discuss that project on this motionthen we should see that they come under such conditions that their introduction will not be injurious to the men who are here today.",54

Statements have been made by honourable members opposite about persons who have traduced and slandered the Commonwealth. I have heard no slandering, of the Commonwealth. I have heard statements of what is true, and if the truth slanders the Commonwealth we should alter the law that allows that to be done. It has been, for settled. instance, stated that there was some trouble about six hatters. Was there any trouble, or was there not? If there was no trouble about their landing in Australia, if they were not kept off our shores for a few days, the statement that they were kept off is a lie and a slander and traduces the Commonwealth. But if they were kept from landing for some days by reason of an Act of Parliament, the statement is true, and cannot be a slander.",55

Whilst I maybe supposed to be endeavouring to give information to the honourable member for Gwydir and other honourable members opposite, I cannot be supposed to give them intelligence to understand it. I say again, that if the six hatters were kept out of Australia for some days, as has been stated publicly here and in England, the statements to that effect are true; if 'they were not kept out the statements are slanders. But, as a matter of fact, no one can say that they were not kept on the ship for a week or so. Another case is that of a man who bad to get a permit to come here with horses. The Prime Minister has said that there was no need for the permit, but the need arose in this way: Ship-owners will not bring such persons without a permit. If they bring out a man who is under contract they are responsible for taking him away again. They are not foolish enough .to incur that responsibility. The Prime Minister's statement, that there is no need for permits, does not alter the law, and the ship-owners are advised by legal men that permits must be obtained. I have another case in my mind at the present moment. I do not wish to relate the circumstances, because they are not quite settled. The case has, however, occurred since the Prime Minister stated that it was not necessary for such people to get permits.",55
312,Mr WEBSTER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,What case is that?,55
313,Mr LONSDALE,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The honourable member has not heard of it, and I am not going to say any more about it until it is",55
314,Mr WEBSTER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The honourable member cannot prove his statement.,55
315,Mr LONSDALE,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Yes , I can. I have seen the man and spoken to him, and know all about the contract under which he came out here.",55
316,Mr TUDOR,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The authorities could not have properly administered the Act, or the man would not have been permitted to land.",55
317,Mr LONSDALE,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"He had a permit. Honourable members will probably remember the case of the six potters, in connection with which members of the Labour Party charged the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney with having given instructions lhat the persons concerned should be prosecuted. Who slandered the country on that occasion ? Was it not the members of the Labour Party? They accused the honourable member for East Sydney of having commenced proceedings against the six potters, or those who were responsible for their introduction here; but it transpired that the honourable and learned member for West Sydney initiated the prosecution. Those honourable members who have been complaining most loudly and most frequently of slanders have been the most guilty in that respect. The Immigration Restriction Act itself is a slander upon the country, and the sooner it is amended the better. The six potters were introduced here in order that a new industry might be established. The manager of a certain pottery works who had been brought out from England reported to his employer that he could not succeed in carrying out the work he was engaged to perform with the skilled assistance obtainable here, and upon his representations six men were brought out to establish a new industry, which, if properly developed, would afford employment for hundreds of other men. Yet ' it was proposed to punish the employer, and to send the men back to England. It happened, however, that no contracts had been signed prior to the arrival of the men in Australia. Verbal agreements only had been entered into, and proceedings could not be taken with any prospect of success.",55
318,Mr TUDOR,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,There is nothing in the Act with regard to written contracts.,56
319,Mr LONSDALE,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"At any rate the prosecution fell through, but not owing to any fault of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney.",56
320,Mr TUDOR,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Accordin g to the honourable member's statement the parties should? have been prosecuted.,56
321,Mr LONSDALE,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Those who have complained most loudly with regard to the slanders upon Australia are themselves trailing the name of the Commonwealth in the dirt. Every one now seems to desire that the Act should be amended, and I hope thlat prompt measures will be taken in that direction. I understand that it is intended to substitute 9.2-inch for 7.5-inch guns in the forts at Fremantle. From what I have heard regarding these forts and their situation, it would be best to arm them with pop-guns. I am informed that if the smallest guns were mounted in the forts the shock of their discharge would probably smash the windows of all the buildings in Fremantle. If 9.2-inch guns were mounted there they would do more damage than any hostile squadron that might attack the port. The forts are situated in the midst of the population, and it seems absurd to mount heavy guns in such a situation. If . money is to be spent in the purchase of 9.2-inch! guns, the weapons should be utilized for the defence of some of our principal ports, such as Sydney, Melbourne, or Newcastle, where the greatest danger is to be apprehended, and the greatest injury would be inflicted upon us by an attacking force. The right honourable member for Swan, although, he had control of Western Australia and its finances for many years, left that State absolutely undefended, and he now comes to the Commonwealth Parliament, and desires to get all the money he can out of the pockets of the people of the other States for its defence. I do not think that is fair. If we are to spend this money, it should be at some more important place.",56
322,Mr WEBSTER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Where would the honourable member spend it?,56
323,Mr LONSDALE,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I should leave that to those who possess the best knowledge of these matters, but I believe that the proper defence of Melbourne, Sydney, Newcastle, and such places should receive first attention. I hope that the Government will do something to bring about an amendment of the Immigration Restriction Act. In the case to which I have referred, a man who came here to establish in Melbourne a new industry, of which no one else in Australia has any knowledge, has been obliged to obtain a permit, which requires that he shall go back in six months' time. The Prime Minister must see that an exemption in this case should be allowed under the provision exempting persons possessing special skill. As I quite believe that the honourable and learned gentleman will do what I suggest, I shall not' dwell upon the matter. It has not got abroad so far, and I have no desire to assist' its publication? Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - I do hope that the Government will have the pluck to do awlay with all this military nonsense. Only in today's newspapers we read that the British Government is already preparing to defend this country by the establishment of a naval base at Singapore. We know that Japan, the country which every one appears to be frightened of, is England's 'friend. Both France and England withdrew their China fleets the moment Japan said, "" We will look after this country."" From American papers received today, I findi that the United States Government have such absolute confidence in Japan, that they are considering the wisdom of withdrawing their fleet from Manilla, although the Philippine Islands are practically within a day's sail of Japan.

This is a nation of peace, commerce, trade, and hope in a prosperous future. This nation is an integral portion of the great British Empire, and i would a hundred times prefer to shut up all our forts and military business, and give England Â£500,000 a year towards the upkeep of her Navy, if that were shown to be necessary. Let us not invite the nations of the Avorld to come here. Let us not be continually holding out the red flag to them, and asking them to fight. The Argentine Republic, Cosita Rica, and Mosquito Kingdom have all protected themselves for years, and no nation has invaded them. No nation can invade Australia Avithout attacking the Avhole British Empire. Canada has a common border line Will the United States for 3,500 miles. She has a population of a little over 5,000,000, and there is a population of 80,000,000 to the south in the United States, yet there is no talk of conquering Canada.",57
326,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"What has this to do with the Supply Bill? Mr KING O'MALLEY - It has to do with the talk we have heard here. In discussing these matters, it is essential to reply to these people who have gone mad on the military business.",57
327,The CHAIRMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Order ! The honourable member must not speak of honourable members as these people."" Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am not referring to members of this House, but to the plumed roosters outside. I have done with the military business, and I hope this House will soon have done with it also. I earnestly hope that half the money that it is proposed to spend on the military business Avill be put into immigration and irrigation. I haA'e heard the honourable member for New England discussing the Immigration Restriction Act, and Avhile I agree Will much that he said, I can tell honourable members that the Canadian Act is infinitely more stringent than ours, and the United States Act is a thousand times more stringent than ours. The United States received more immigrants last year than in any other year in her history. One million and fifty thousand persons entered the United States last year, and the Government of the country are endeaA'ouring to keep people out. This great country in the Southern Hemisphere Avas laid out by the Creator for the surplus British population when all other countries Would be filled; He preserved it, and Availed it up by the eternal seas for this purpose.

330,The CHAIRMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I do not think that the honourable member's remarks are in order. . Mr KING O'MALLEY - I quite agree with you, Mr Chairman. The trouble is that nearly everything we say here has nothing to do with the subject under discussion. I wish to congratulate the honourable member for Barrier on his splendid presentation of the people's rights this afternoon, in advocating the establishment of a Commonwealth steam-ship line. I listened to his words like a child listening to its mother, and was filled with joy. Amongst our friends opposite are some of the keenest and ablest intellects in the country. I suppose that the most towering intellect in the southern hemisphere sits on that side of the Chamber. If they were dealing with any commercial proposition on their own account, they would be studying very closely the possibilities of gain- because most of them are Scotch, or largely of Scotch extraction. But are they, or are we, showing any commercial ability or genius in our present mode of carrying on the business of the country? I do not blame any section in particular, because even if the Watson Administration had remained in power, the state of affairs to which I am about to allude would still have existed. We are throwing into the sea every year no less a sum than ^120,000 in the subsidy which we pay for the conveyance of foreign mails. I propose to look at this question from a Yankee stand-point. The other day, the United States wanted a few pounds, and they got the money for about 1.16 per cent. This Commonwealth is rich enough and powerful enough, and has sufficient assets to be able to borrow monev in New York for 3 per cent. TheTe may be a combination against us in London, but we could borrow on the New York market for 3 perl cent. The honourable member for Barrier has told us that the eight vessels which would be required to run a fortnightly mail service between Australia and England could be built for Â£1,500,000. To be on the safe side, I will increase the estimate to Â£2,000,000. That sum could be borrowed in New York at 3 per cent., which would make the interest bill Â£60,000 a year. A sinking fund. of 1 per cent, would redeem the loan in sixty-nine years, while a sinking fund of 2 per cent - o r Â£40,000 a year-woul d redeem it in thirtyfour years. Therefore, with an annual, outlay of ,Â£100,000 we could meet all interest charges and pay for our vessels in, thirty-four years, and would have a surplus of ,Â£2 0,000, which would enable us to borrow nearly Â£750,000 more if we required, the money.",58
331,Mr KELLY,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The honourable membermakes no provision for unprofitable journeys.,58
332,Mr LONSDALE,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"How much would the ships be worth at the end of thirty-four years ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Eve n if they were not then worth a penny they would have been paid for, and we should have had the use of them. How much will our houses and farms be worth in thirty-four years? How much will we ourselves be worth at the end of that time? There never was a country which had greateropportunities than we have, notwithstanding the commercial combinations and rings in London against our produce. We are able to send fruit there when California and other places have none to supply. If the rates of interest were low enough, and freights were cheap, produce could be placed on the markets in London, Sap Francisco, and New York, when not a bit of local fruit was to be had at any of those centres. I hope that the Government will have pluck enough to look intothis question. When I was discussing the Budget, I proposed that there should bea Commonwealth building in London, and people looked amazed, although Londonis the centre of the earth.",58
333,Mr KELLY,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I thought New York was the centre. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There are more Americans in London than in New York, where most of the Americans are Irishmen and Germans. There are morereal Australians than in Melbourne and more Canadians than in Montreal. I saw today from the newspapers how Mr Coghlan, the representative of New South Wales, had scored with his Guildhall exhibition. Mr. Coghlan is a man of brains and genius, who has not gone to sleep. The mistake is for Australia to send representatives toLondon when they are tired, instead of sending men who are full of business and determination. The honourable member forBarrier put the question of steamship communication in a new light today. The interest on ,Â£4,000,000 is .Â£120,000 a year, and with a redemption fund at 3 per cent., the indebtedness could be paid off in twenty four years, while at 4 per cent, it could be paid off in eighteen years.

"" The honoris able member for Barrier spoke about the mail steamers landing the mails at Adedeavour laide, and I should like to know whether those companies are paid merely to do that, or whether they are paid to carry mails right, through to Sydney. Is the money we pay for the carriage of the mails on the railways an extra payment? Are we paying double in order to have the mails carried from Adelaide to Brisbane? If we are, and everybody is having a hand this matter. 757 in the pockets of the people, I want Tasmania to have a share. I want the mails to be carried to Hobart, and to my own constituents at Burnie. On the grounds of economy I am opposed to this subsidy. We have no right, as the custodians of the moneys of the people, to pay a steam-ship company for carrying the mails from Adelaide to Sydney, and then to pay for the railway! carriage of the same mails. When I was in the United States fifteen or sixteen years ago, there was no idea of giving contract to a special company to carry at 7 the mails to England, all being conveyed We on the poundage system.

338,Mr REID,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"What was the systemMr KING O'MALLEY - The system was that when a subscriber rang the bell, he got an answer straight away. I verily believe the system now in vogue in Australia was that by which the warning was given that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrahwere to be destroyed. In all seriousness, I ask the Postmaster-General to endeavour to improve the present arrangements. It far better to run down the street and deliver a message personally than to ento get into communication with anyone by means of the telephone. Only a fewdays ago, we read of a man in the Western the district of Victoria, who sent a telegram a distance of forty miles, and then, got into his motor car, and reached the place, an hour and a half before the message.

363,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I cannof help what my leader has done. ""Every man on this Party at one time ? side is a free agent, and except in matters of principle, on which we were elected, we are not bound by the acts of our leader, or by those of each other on questions of this",62
364,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Does the"" honourable member wish to imply that the Treasurer been the Mr JOHNSON - Undoubtedly the Treasurer cannot be a free agent when he can only hold office by the consent of a If its support were withdrawn, he would be left stranded high and dry. I object to the Government holding been office and spending money, not only bethis cause they are under the domination of a third party, which is really controlit ling legislation without having any responsibility there for, but also because that party is the advocate of doctrines which, in my are most injurious and pernicious, and will most adversely affect the welfare of this country. I object to this domination the third party just as strongly as did the disTreasurer when he was opposed to it. I very fittingly quote one of his speeches if I wished to make a more effecto tive speech than I shall be likely to do, for no one has more strongly condemned that system of government than he did.",62
365,Mr CARPENTER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,He is sorry for it now.,62
366,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"It may be all right for obthe Treasurer, but at the same time his Gopresent position is not consistent with his former attitude to the third party. I can remember the time when he described the Bill. party which is now driving him as the Octopus Party. I object to the Govern* ment holding, the reins of power, because 7 the party which is controlling their legisI t is all very well for the honourable member for by Hindmarsh and other honourable members tell us that their Socialism is harmless, that there are certain aspects of it with which perhaps they do not agree. But we have had the objective of Socialism defined various States Conferences, and also at At these gatherings the Socialists agreed to a certain objective, which I think is absolutely injurious and hurtful to the best inupon terests of this country. When we see a controlled by a party which is pledged to that objective, we are justified into grant them two months' supply.",62
367,Mr THOMAS,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Was not the honourable membera pledged member of the Labour,62
368,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Not of a socialistic party. The honourable member will remember, as his leader has pointed out here, that the socialistic plank was not adopted until 1897, which was four years after I had terminated my connection with the Labour Party. If it had adhered to its original ideals, and had been controlling legislation, even from the cross benches, with those ideals steadilv retained, I do not think that the results would have been in any way hurtful to the country, but I hold that the system of a third party of any kind controlling; the Ministry is a bad one, because there should be no ministerial or legislative act without responsibility there for, and that responsibility can only exist when the Ministry has at its' back a direct majority.",63
369,Mr FISHER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,What an absurdity ?,63
370,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Unquestionabl y that is so.,63
371,Mr FISHER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The honourable member has never seen a Ministry which had a majority sitting behind it.,63
372,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"When there are only two parties in the House, how can the Ministry carry on unless it has a majority behind its back ?",63
373,Mr FISHER,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"There are always half-adozen men who can get their own way, even with a Ministry of that kind.",63
374,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Not necessarily. have seen a Ministry with a good, substantial majority behind it . That, however, is not the case here, and until another appeal is made to the electors the Ministry has no right to spend one penny of their money, or to occupy the Treasury bench. Apart from the fact of the Ministers being driven in the shafts by the occupants of the cross benches, I object to them being in office, because they are carrying out, bit by bit, the socialistic provisions p f the Labour Party's programme. There is not a Bill submitted, even of the most apparently simple and innocent-looking character, which is not loaded up to the hilt with Socialism, as the Treasurer knows perfectly well. I cannot conceive for a moment how he can occupy a seat on the Treasury bench, knowing, as he and everyone else must know, the objective of the Labour Party which controls his acts and those of his colleagues in the Ministry.",63
375,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The honourable member is quite mistaken.,63
376,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Honourable members have only to look at the Commerce Bill , the Trades Marks Bill, and the Manufactures Encouragement Bill to prove that what I say is correct. There is scarcely a Bill that has been submitted to Parliament by the present Government that has not the principles of Socialism embodied in it . The Treasurer knows that, indeed, these Bills are loaded with Socialism to a greater extent than would have been possible if the Labour Party had been occupying the Treasury bench.",63
377,Mr LONSDALE,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,I think we ought to have a quorum present to hear these remarks. [Quorum formed.],63
378,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I object to granting supply to this Government, because they have not a majority behind them to give them the necessary authority to spend the taxpayers' money. We ought to keep control over public expenditure as long as possible. That is a reason why Ave should not, at any rate, grant two months' supply. We ought to do everything we can to induce the Government to relinquish the false position they occupy, and to send this Parliament to the country, so that we may get a A'erdict of the electors, and possibly secure the return of a Ministry which will ha\ e a majority 7 behind it, and will be able to say conscientiously that it has the mandate of the country to carry on affairs. Some reference has been made to the Immigration I Restriction Act. I , for one, certainly raise a most strenuous objection to the manner in which that Act is being administered. It has turned the eyes of the world tOAvards Australia in such a manner as to advertise this country in the most injurious Avay as a country inhabited ancl controlled by selfish and inhumane barbarians. The impression has got abroad, rightlv or Avrongly, that British people are not wanted here. That impression has been deepened by the recent debate in the Trades Hall Council of Melbourne upon the proposal to bring out immigrants by arrangement Will General Booth. One of the reasons advanced by the supporters of the resolution was that they desired to build up a nation in Australia, ancl did not Avant families from the old country. The proposal of the Prime Minister to introduce a measure to make certain sections of the Immigration Restriction Act less objectionable has also been opposed by the members of the Trades Hall Council, and I suppose that it will be opposed by the party which is keeping the present Government in office, notAvithstanding the assurance of the honourable member for .Bland that he was willing to support an amendment of the Act. I should like to know what the Government is going to do about this matter. Probably the Prime Minister will forego his intention, and things will be allowed to drift as they have done before in relation lo other matters. The honourable member for Darwin has made reference to the problem of poverty which confronts us, and has said that we should set ourselves fo ameliorate that state of things. In reference to the - scheme for bringing 5,000 families to Australia, the proposal has been made, and has been viewed in a friendly spirit, even if it has not actually been agreed to by various States Governments, that there shall be set apart certain lands for the immigrants, so that they will not be burdens upon the rest of the community. We have many thousands of landless people here already, who would be glad of exactly similar facilities; and I should like to know whether some attempt is not to be made to settle those people upon the land on just as good terms as are proposed in the case of the settlers who are expected to be brought from the old country. I know that the Commonwealth cannot exercise absolute control over the land monopoly which has obtained such a hold in this country, without coming into probable conflict with the rights of the various States Governments.",63
379,Mr THOMAS,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Coul d we not impose a Federal land tax? Mr JOHNSON' - There seems to be some difference of opinion among the legal constitutional experts as to the extent of powers under the Constitution in that regard. At any rate, although I am heartily in accord with the principle of taxing unimproved land values as a substitute for taxing improvements and the results of industry, I shall be no party to imposing a land tax unless our industries are relieved of taxation to an equivalent extent. I do not believe in adding fo the burdens of the people; but, on the other hand, desire to, as far as possible, remove those which now'bave to be borne. I agree with the honourable member for Darwin that there is room for great improvement in connection with the settlement of people upon the land, and I hope that the Government will set themselves resolutely to arrange with the States to provide for our surplus population, and to absorb the large armies of unemployed to be found in all our cities. At the same time, I have no objection to the families proposed to be brought here under the Salvation Army scheme, so long as they are converted into producers, who will in their turn create a demand for the products of those who are now living in our cities. I should like to know what are the intentions of the Government in regard to the appointment of a High Commissioner. That is a matter upon which we are entitled to have some information before granting two months' supply.",64
380,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The Bill contains no reference to that subject.,64
381,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I am perfectly aware of that; but certain obligations in regard to the appointment of a High Commissioner might be entered into during the next two months which might not meet with the approval of honourable members, and I think we are entitled to know at this stage what the Government propose to do. I notice that it is proposed to appropriate ,Â£5,000 towards the expenses of the administration of New Guinea, and I should like to have some information with regard to that item.",64
382,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"That is merely a portion of the annual appropriation of ,Â£20,000 towards the expenses of the administration.",64
383,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Some mention was made of an improved mail service for New Guinea.,64
384,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,The proposed appropriation has no connection with that matter.,64
385,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I should Tike to know our when the Papua Bill is to be brought under our consideration. It is high time that something was done to make definite arrangements for the administration of the Possession. The Â£[20,000 which is now being spent annually is being to some extent wasted, owing to the fact that the residents of New Guinea are very unsettled, pending a decision as to the conditions under which they are to live. Some definite arrangements should be made to insure that the expenditure to wfiich we are committed in connection with the Possession is well applied. In regard to the proposed votes in connection with the Department of Trade and Customs, I desire to express my obiection to providing facilities for the Minister of Trade and Customs to frame regulations which may have the effect of reversing the taxation policy of the Commonwealth. I do not wish to apply my remarks especially to the present Minister of Trade arid Customs. The Minister has been granted extensive powers to make regulations under several Acts, and it is proposed by means of the Commerce Bill, which I regard as a most objectionable measure, and in other ways to largely extend his authority in that rection. I may mention the harvester case illustrating what may happen in connection with other articles of merchandise. 1I have already expressed my objection to the action taken by the Minister and his officers in that particular instance, and I very strongly tempted to reduce the proposed votes for salaries so far as they relate to the Comptroller-General of Customs, and the Collector of Customs in Victoria. The latter officer made most contradictory reports inconnexion with' the harvester case. After having indicated to the previous Minister that a certain firm of importers had established a reputation for exceptional honesty and fair-dealing, the Victorian Collector of Customs made statements to the present Minister which were entirely opposed to those contained in his first report. I think that some explanaserve tion is due from that officer. The papers which were laid upon the Library table failed to disclose the slightest evidence justify him in departing from his first report. As soon, however, as a new Minister came into office whose sympathies were apparently favourable to what I can only term the unreasonable persecution of importing firms, that system of persecution was entered upon, and is still proceeding. Whilst such things are possible in connection with the administration of the Customs Department, we should not vote supplies which would enable a Minister to exercise his powers in such a manner, as to call for condemnation. In view of the objectionable acts which may be committed by the Minister of Trade and Customs, ancl his officers, and which we ought by all means in our power to guard against, I feel very chary of voting one farthing by way of supply, although I know that the Government have a majority, and that, no matter how emphatic our protests may be, they will probably be disregarded. I come now to the Department of Defence, and I shouldi like to know what the Government propose in the way of expenditure on our coast, river, and harbour defences? In a previous speech on the subject, I said that I looked upon our coast, river, and harbour defences as our first line of defence. I regard them as of more importance than our land forces. While not under-estimating the value and importance of those forces, I look upon them as our last line of defence. I understand that the fortification of our harbors is more or less involved in military , di- expenditure, but so far as I have been as able to discover, the military expenditure proposed by the Government does not provide adequately for improvement toward efficiency in this branch of the military scheme, or for the line of defence which, feel in my opinion, is of most importance. In this connection, I wish to know what is to be done in the matter of the fortification of Fremantle? I understand that a proposal is now made to substitute 9.2-inch guns for the 7.5-inch guns which the Government at first proposed to mount at the entrance to the harbour of Fremantle. I believe that the matter is at present under the consideration of the Government, and I should like to know whether they seriously propose to substitute the more costly guns for the 7.5-incb guns. The 7.5-inch guns will adequately all purposes of defence for Fremantle. Honourable members who have visited Western Australia must be aware to that the harbour at Fremantle is not approachable in a direct line from the sea. A reef runs out for some miles in front of the harbour, so that vessels of war would not be able to bombard the port at Fremantle from any point opposite the mouth of the harbour, except at very close range, and within a distance of five miles, unless they did so from the seaward side of Rottnest Island, in which case they would have to fire over the intervening island. The reef extends for some considerable distance, and steamers leaving Fremantle to go to Adelaide have to make a considerable detour round Rottnest Island before they get into the open sea. No battleship would risk the dangers of the reef in order to get sufficiently close to Fremantle to bombard the place. In order to effectively bombard Fremantle, an attacking ship must come within a radius of five miles of the forts, and the 7.5-inch guns can cover that range as effectively as 9.2-inch guns. I understand that the cost of the 7.5-inch guns is ,Â£12,000, ancl the cost of 9.2-inch Â£24,000 each, so that the suggested alteration would involve the Commonwealth in a wholly unnecessary expenditure of Â£24,000. We are entitled to some information from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, as to whether the Government propose to adhere to the 7.5-inch guns, or to adopt the suggestion made by an honourable senator in another place?",64
386,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I have heard nothing about if. Mr EWING,-The matter is under inquiry now.",66
387,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"If it is under inquiry, it must be because there is some reasonable probability that ithe suggestion made will be adopted. I object to its adoption, because there is no necessity for 9.2-inch guns Fremantle, when we know that 7.5-inch guns will effectively cover the distance from which any hostile vessel could attack Fremantle. A hostile vessel to successconsulted fully bombard the harbour would have come within the reef, which is not more than five miles outside it .",66
388,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,There is a clear opening to the north.,66
389,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"A vessel could not fire into the harbour from the north, because of a protecting neck of land which juts there. For its fire to be effective, a tile vessel would have to come within five miles of the fort, and 7.5-inch guns would deal with it at that range.",66
390,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,A vessel could fire into Fremantle from a range of twelve miles.,66
391,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Yes ; but not with certainty of effect. As, to fire effectively, an enemy's ship would have to come within five miles of Fremantle, larger guns than 7.5-inch guns are not required there.",66
392,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Of course, if the honourable member says so, that settles the matter.",66
393,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The right honourable gentleman, with his large ideas on the subject offinance,may think that my contention can be disposed of by a flippant observaattention tion of that k in d ; but I shall require better answer to my objection before I shall withdraw my opposition to the proposed expenditure.",66
394,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,If honourable memlic bers do not know the locality it is not fault.,66
395,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The right honourable public gentleman cannot call into question the accuracy of the statements which I have made. There is in the Chamber, for the information of honourable members, a chart showing the entrance to the harbour and the island, and giving the depth of water on the reefs and elsewhere.",66
396,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Ship s do not come across the reefs.,66
397,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,If the right honourable gentleman were listening to my remarks he would not make an inane interjection of that sort.,66
398,Sir JOHN FORREST,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Some honourable members pretend to know a lot about a place to which they have not been.,66
399,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"The honourable member cannot say that I have never been to at Fremantle, because he himself piloted me through a great portion of Western Australia only recently, and I had visited the State on a previous occasion. Besides having all the information available to to any other honourable member, I have personally visited Fremantle, and am acquainted with the natural features of the harbour and the adjacent coast line. Coming now to the Postmaster-General's Department, I have several complaints to make. My first complaint has to do with the great out length of time occupied in obtaining anhosswers to letters sent to the Department.",66
400,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Does not the honourable member receive acknowledgments of his letters?,66
401,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,Not always.,66
402,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,What is the length of the delays referred to?,66
403,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,It is sometimes a week or two before even an acknowledgment is received.,66
404,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,I wish the honourable member would give me one single case.,66
405,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I know that these delays have frequently occurred, although I am unable to say exactly how long they have been.",66
406,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,I cannot pay to general complaints; I want a some .specific instance of delay.,66
407,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I had some correspondence with the Department recently in connection with the establishment of a pubtelephone at the new railway platform my at Oatley. A report by an officer of the Department had stated that there was a telephone in existence at Oatley, and that the revenue received from it was only 6d., and the secretary of the local Progress Association therefore wrote to me, denying the correctness of that statement, as he and a friend had made an attempt to be allowed to speak through the telephone in the old station-master's office, and had been informed that it was not a telephone for The use of the public, but a telephone for the use of the station-master himself. The report of the departmental inspector was intended to conveiy to the Postmaster-General the idea that no telephone is needed in the district, because one is already there, and is rarely used, although the fact is that the telephone referred to is not a telephone for public use. I sent the letter of the secretary of the local Progress Association on to the Postmaster-General, but I have not yet received an acknowledgment, of it, or any intimation as to the action the Department intends to take in connection with the matter. I handed the correspondence to the Postmaster-General myself, and he promised to look into the subject. I have also tried to obtain a telephone bureau for a place called Mi randa, and although it is a long time since I moved in the matter, since the rigime of the present Postmaster-General, I have not yet had word from the Department in regard to it. I know that a report will be called for, and that, the some officers will be sent to make the usual reports, on the usual Ted tape lines. But I am tired of this kind of treatment - It is about time that the Postmaster-General determined that, whenever there is a certain population in a district, and telephonic communication can be .given at a reasonable cost, no obstacles shall be placed in the way.",66

412,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"Does not. the honourable member think that places far back are entitled to consideration before everything has been given, to metropolitan centres ?",67
413,Mr JOHNSON,FRENCH AND ITALIA N POST,"I do not ask for everything. I have no objection to people in the back-blocks getting all, the conveniences they require, but at this particular place a large community, settled close to a great city, might as well be in Tiinbuctoo for all the advantages they get from the Post and Telegraph Department'.
