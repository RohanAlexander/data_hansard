1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Truss, for Mr Anderson, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
2,Mr TRUSS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (9.31 a.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The proposed amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 will, if enacted, provide five years protection for undisclosed test and/or other data submitted to the National Registration Authority for agricultural and veterinary chemicals for the evaluation of a new active constituent for an agricultural or veterinary chemical product. Such data will not be available for reference by a commercial competitor-for example, a generic product manufacturer-without the agreement of the originator of the data. In the vast majority of cases the five-year data protection period will lapse before the expiry of the patent term, thereby having no effect on the marketing of generic products. It will, however, remove any doubt about whether Australia is fulfilling its obligations under article 39(3) of the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. The government announced on 11 December 1996 that it interpreted article 39(3) of TRIPs as requiring Australia to provide protection from unfair commercial use for undisclosed test and/or other data submitted in an application for approval in respect of a new active constituent, that is, a new chemical entity. This bill also repeals the Dried Vine Fruits Equalization Act 1978. The repeal will cease the current equalisation of export returns for dried vine fruits from 1 January 1999. As equalisation currently occurs over the course of a season, with returns calculated at the last export of fruit from that season, the repeal allows for the continued operation of equalisation for the previous 1998 season. The dried vine fruits industry is the only commodity which continues to operate an equalisation scheme. The industry now contends that, in the prevailing market circumstances, equalisation arrangements are inappropriate and mask market signals and inhibit industry and marketing innovation. The industry peak body, the Australian Dried Fruits Association, has requested the termination of the scheme. The bill amends the Export Control Act 1982 to ensure that Australia's export control legislation provides appropriate coverage for contemporary administrative arrangements. Under current export inspection arrangements there is a strong move for exporters to assume more responsibility for the quality of their product under quality systems approved and supervised by AQIS. The amendments to the Export Control Act 1982 in this bill seek to facilitate this move by allowing for the appropriate coverage of these systems in delegated legislation and by strengthening the enforcement powers in the act in line with Commonwealth law administration policy. The purpose of the amendment to the Imported Food Control Act 1992 is to clarify some aspects of the act which have previously been confusing and to enable consistent application of the act across areas which have previously been left open. The amendment is sought by the government as a result of inconsistencies being found by officers working with the act. As a result of the amendment, AQIS anticipates a more effective and efficient service to industry as it clarifies areas of the act that have previously been in doubt. The specific issues which will be addressed by these amendments are as follows. The compensation amendment will allow importers to claim recompense from the government for food which, as a result of the inspection, has been rendered unfit for the purpose for which it was imported. This will mean that where, as a result of sampling, the food cannot be sold on the market or has been damaged significantly, the owner of the goods can claim compensation for the value lost. The offence amendment will cover a procedural loophole in the legislation. At this time a penalty exists for dealing with a food before a food control certificate is issued and a penalty exists for dealing with a food contrary to a direction under the act after the inspection advice is issued. However, the time between the issue of a food control certificate and the issue of the inspection advice is not covered by the act. This amendment will cover that loophole. The amendment addresses the position of food imported as trade samples. Often small quantities of food are brought into Australia to evaluate their market potential. The samples are not, however, released onto the domestic market. The samples generally exceed the volume and weight prescribed in subsection 7(2) of the act as food imported for private consumption. It is considered appropriate for the secretary of the department to have the power to permit the importation without inspection of trade samples with a weight/volume limitation of 20 kilograms/20 litres, except in the case of concentrated liquids and moisture reduced foods where 2 kilogramsl2 Htres should apply, and spices for which the limit should be 1 kilogram, as in regulation 4 of the Imported Foods Control Regulations. Although it may be argued that provision could be made for trade samples in section 7 in the same manner as provision is made for food imported for private consumption, AQIS would prefer the introduction of a system involving specific approval of particular samples for importation without inspection to ensure strict control is maintained. The amendment relating to publishing of information ensures that section 35 specifically permits the publication of information relating to food which has been released and is subsequently reported, after sampling and analysis, as failing food. Further specific permission is provided in this amendment to specifically permit the secretary to publish importer and brand name information in relation to failing food. Minor amendments are also necessary to provide for a specific power for the secretary to approve an overseas food processing operation for the purpose of part 2 of the act, even though this power is already implicit, and to amend a drafting error in section 42 which currently gives an incorrect paragraph number. All food imported into Australia must firstly comply with the requirements of the Quarantine Act 1908 before being inspected against the requirements of the Imported Food Control Act 1992. Accordingly, the proposed amendments to the Imported Food Control Act 1992 will have no effect on Australia's quarantine standards The purpose of the proposed amendment to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994 is to make naming of new varieties easier. Currently, an anomalous restriction exists which precludes any duplication of plant variety names, regardless of whether varieties are protected or currently in commerce. The need not to repeat a name makes the checking of proposed names to ensure novelty an unnecessarily laborious process for both the applicant and the PBR office. Therefore, it is proposed to allow limited duplication of variety names, provided varieties with the same name are from an entirely different plant class and are unlikely to be confused in the marketplace. For example, the same name could be accepted for a variety of turnip as well as for a variety of tulip. Duplication of names in closely related cereal crops such as wheat, barley and oats would not be accepted as it would be likely to cause confusion in the normal course of commerce. A list of plant classes maintained by the PBR office will be accessible to prospective PBR applicants free of charge. The proposed amendment is in conformity with the international standards on the matter and will promote the use of a single name for each variety, regardless of the country in which it is marketed. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Truss, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
3,Mr TRUSS,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (9.41 a.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill represents the first instalment of legislative amendments proposed by the government implementing the Tough on Drugs strategy, an initiative announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 2 November 1997. Everyone knows about the menace of illicit drugs and the damage that they do to society, especially to young people. The government is determined to do everything it can to reduce the damage and the Prime Minister's personal leadership in announcing the Tough on Drugs strategy is a very clear demonstration of that commitment. The government's strategy is threefold. Firstly, it aims to reduce demand for illicit drugs by educating people, particularly young people, about the dangers of drug use. Secondly, it aims to reduce the harm being done to drug users, for example, through education about the risks of HIV/ AIDS among injecting users. Thirdly, it aims to reduce the supply illicit drugs by stopping them from coming into the country in the first place. Each of these parts of the strategy received a signifiments cant boost in funding in the Prime Minister's initial announcement of 2 November 1997 and were emphasised in his second instalment announced on 16 March this year. As well as making sure that our law enforcement agencies have the people and the tools that they need to combat this menace, we also need to make sure that they are equipped with adequate and appropriate legal powers. That is what this bill is about. The bill amends the Customs Act 1901 with the objective of providing Customs officers with more effective powers in relation to the detection of illicit drugs at the border. The bill also amends the Customs Administration Act 1985 in relation to the use made of information obtained or held by the Australian Customs Service. A brief outline of the proposals included in the bill follows. Currently, passengers and crew who arrive in Australia on a ship or a plane are required to report to Customs. In respect of such people, Customs has powers to ask questions, search bags and, subject to establishing a reasonable cause, conduct searches of people. But there is a gap in these powers. Customs does not currently have these powers in relation to a large number of people who have access to ships and planes that have arrived in Australia and which potentially may have illicit drugs on board. This group of people includes people such as maintenance crews, caterers, cleaners and, particularly in relation to ships, visitors. This gap is a weakness which has been exploited as a means of importing illicit drugs into Australia. The proposed amendments seek to provide Customs officers with a power to examine the bags or other containers in the possession of such persons to ensure illicit drugs are not being landed by them. Similarly, Customs officers do not currently have any power to frisk search such persons. This inability to frisk search, where the Customs officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is carrying prohibited of goods on his or her body, provides a significant opportunity for such persons to walk illicit drugs off a ship or aircraft. The amendpropose to provide Customs officers with the power to undertake a frisk search of a person in such circumstances. It is proposed that these powers will also apply in circumstances where Customs officers are involved in the boarding and searching of a ship or aircraft, whether it is berthed or parked at a wharf or airport respectively, or whether a vessel is boarded at sea by Customs officers on an Australian Customs vessel. In summary, the powers proposed are not new ones. As I have explained, Customs already has these powers in respect of arriving passengers. The proposal is simply to extend the powers to other people in a Customs place who have unrestricted access to planes and ships for quite legitimate purposes. The proposed frisk search powers will provide the same safeguards and rights to individuals as currently apply to passengers, thereby ensuring that the dignity of a person being frisk searched is maintained. In relation to Customs officers on board Australian Customs vessels, there has for some time been a concern within the Australian Customs Service about the safety and welfare of Customs officers operating at sea in an isolated environment. Customs officers are not armed. They should be able to feel safe and without the fear of any threat when administering the Customs Act and protecting our borders. This is particularly the case in relation to Customs officers operating at sea when boarding a ship. Unlike the controlled environment at an airport, Customs officers do not necessarily know in advance the circumstances they will confront on boarding. For this reason a special frisk search power is being sought in these circumstances. When an officer suspects that he or she is in danger of being injured by a person on the ship, the officer will be able to frisk search the suspect person without consent and take possession, if necessary with reasonable force, of any implement such as knives, guns or other implements which could harm the officers. The bill also proposes to give Customs officers the power to copy a document in circumstances where a Customs officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the document contains information in relation to the importation of illicit drugs. Such information will be invaluable in the detection of significant drug importations. In addition, the bill proposes a number of amendments which will assist in the detection of drugs by generally making Customs controls more effective at the border. These may be summarised as follows: A Customs officer currently has the power to require a vehicle to stop in a Customs place for the purpose of checking goods leaving Customs control. There is no deterrent if the driver of the vehicle fails to stop. It is proposed to make it an offence in cases where the vehicle fails to stop. Currently the Customs Act makes it an offence for craft or goods coming from a place outside Australia to go directly to a sea installation without Customs permission. A similar offence exists in relation to a craft or goods leaving a sea installation directly for a place outside Australia. It is proposed to extend the application of this provision to resources installations. The potential for sea installations to be used to breach border controls is equally relevant in relation to resources installations. It is an offence under the Customs Act for an Australian based craft to transfer goods at sea to a craft on an international voyage. It is proposed to also make it an offence for the craft on the international voyage to be involved in such a transfer of goods. A Customs officer currently has the power to board and search a foreign flagged ship in the Australian territorial sea. As a consequence of Australia becoming a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, it is proposed to extend these powers to the contiguous zone in cases where the Customs officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the ship has been, is or is to be involved in the commission of an offence against the Customs Act. It is also proposed to extend the area in which the general powers to board and search ships may be exercised to include the sea to the landward side of the base line to the coastline of Australia as well as the territorial sea. Amendments are also proposed to the Customs Administration Act 1985. These amendments will modernise the official secrecy and disclosure provisions and will recognise the necessity of arrangements for intelligence sharing in acting against illicit drug smuggling and trafficking as well as in relation to other unlawful activity. Such arrangements: also assist efficient operational and regulatory activity by Customs and other bodies. Special safeguards are also included to ensure the appropriate protection of personal information. The bill also includes a proposal related to the control of weapons in accordance with the government's gun control policy. The objective of this proposal is that a person on a craft on an international voyage visiting Australia-for example, a yacht-is to be subject to the same gun controls as if such a person arrived in Australia as a passenger similar to all Australians. To this end it is proposed that such a person be required to keep such weapons in secure storage on board their craft for the duration of their stay in Australia. If they are unable to provide secure storage on their craft for the storage of the weapon, the Customs officer is to have the power to take the weapon into custody for the duration of the person's stay in Australia. The weapon will be returned to the person upon departure from Australia. The proposals I have outlined will be of valuable assistance to the Australian Customs Service in controlling movements of people, craft and goods across the Australian border and, in particular, will enhance the ability of the Australian Customs Service to detect importations of illicit drugs into Australia. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. LIFE INSURANCE (CONDUCT AND DISCLOSURE) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",15
4,Mr MILES,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (9.51 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Life Insurance (Conduct and Disclosure) Bill 1998 is being introduced today to give effect to a range of measures announced by the government in October 1996 to strengthen consumer protection In the life insurance industry. The measures will complement existing prudential requirements under the Life Insurance Act 1995, and thereby bring to fruition a process of reforms intended to achieve a modem, flexible and strong regulatory regime for life insurance. The key policy objectives of the Life Insurance (Conduct and Disclosure) Bill 1998 are to strengthen consumer protection in the life insurance industry; enhance the accountability of life companies and life brokers in respect of product distribution; and improve consistency in the regulatory treatment of life insurance advisers and securities dealers and their representatives. The bill will promote consumer protection and regulatory neutrality by introducing provisions comparable to the Corporations Law in relation to product disclosure, financial advice recommendations and prohibitions on misleading and deceptive conduct. Accountability will be promoted by requiring life companies to establish an internal compliance committee to monitor compliance with the consumer protection regime, enabling the Life Insurance Code of Practice to be given statutory backing and introducing a balanced range of civil penalties and criminal sanctions. The Life Insurance (Conduct and Disclosure) Bill 1998 will be administered by the government's new market integrity and consumer protection regulator for the financial system, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. This legislation will play an important role in strengthening consumer protection in the life insurance sector in the lead-up to choice of superannuation fund for new employees from I July 1999. Introduction of the Life Insurance (Conduct and Disclosure) Bill 1998 will not hinder progress toward a single licensing regime for financial advisers foreshadowed under the government's corporate law economic reform program (CLERP). The measures in the bill are broadly consistent with CLERP proposals. However, there may be some adjustment to the life insurance regime contemplated in this bill when CLERP reforms are eventually introduced. In conclusion, the reforms set out in the Life Insurance (Conduct and Disclosure) Bill 1998 will raise industry standards of service and advice, and thereby give consumers greater confidence when considering life insurance products as protection against adversity and investment for the future. The consumer protection reforms will also meet community expectations for a more open and consumer-oriented industry. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. NA Publications Committee",17
5,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,I present the 19th report of the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report are being circulated to members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. Treaties Committee,18
6,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the following reports, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee: the Fifteenth Report incorporating a dissenting report relating to the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, treaties tabled on 1 Apri11998 and treaties tabled on 12 May 1998; and the Sixteenth Report: The aEeD convention on combating bribery and draft implementing legislation. Ordered that the reports be printed.",18
7,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As I have indicated, these are the 15th and 16th reports of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, in progress since August 1996. I wanted to make the point that this has been a very heavy workload over 20 months or so. It has involved the consideration of about 120 treaties, protocols and conventions. I want to pay tribute to my committee colleagues on both sides of this place and in the other place, in particular my deputy chair, the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), without whose assistance a lot of the work would not have been done. I also want to thank a very highly professional secretariat for the great work that they have done under some fairly strong pressure at times. I will not make too many comments on report No. 16 on the convention on combating bribery; I will leave that to my colleagues. However, I did want to make the point that this is a first in that it is the first time a minister of the present government has appeared before the committee. I thank the Minister for Justice, Senator Vanstone, for doing that. It is also a first in that it is the first time we have had draft legislation that Report has been provided with a treaty. Again, we thank her for that. I will leave it to my colleagues to expand on some of the issues. We have recommended the ratification of this convention but, nevertheless, we have made some useful recommendations in terms of amendments to and the handling of that convention. I wanted to make some comments on the Fifteenth Report, which covers a potpourri of Reports treaties, conventions and protocols. It makes some recommendations, including an important one on intercountry adoption. There was some debate in this place earlier this week on that and I hope that our recommendations on this will make the facilitation of that convention a little easier. We commend our recommendations to the government. There is also one in there on ILO Convention No. 9 in relation to seafarers, on which we have, for only the second in the committee, divided on party lines. I leave it to the honourable member for Barton to make a few points on that in due course. In relation to the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, we have recommended ratification. But we have also said we would hope that, once this government ratifies, we would put some pressure on the United States to move similarly. There is another one in there on investment protection and protection with Pakistan-a bilateral. This is only the second time that we have recommended against ratification at this time, although it is slightly different to the one with Kazakhstan that we recommended against in that we have said that, once the government has normalised its relations with Pakistan, the thing should proceed. Until such time as that happens, we feel it is inappropriate. There are a number of other-about half a dozen-multilateral and bilateral conventions involved in the report as well. Mention is also made in the report-although we have not completed our work-of the Quebec treaty on antipersonnel landmines. We are very happy for the government to agree with the sentiment espoused in that report as, indeed, all thinking Australians and everybody around the world should be in relation to that international tragedy-the tragedy of antipersonnel landmines and their proliferation around the globe. We would like to meet a little more on this with the non-government organisations before we finalise our report. There are also some comments in the report about a mutual recognition agreement with the OECD. Whilst the agreement was signed by ministers with Sir Leon Brittan when he was here in Canberra last week, we feel that we need to do a little more work in relation to that. The agreement has implications for the multilateral agreement on investment and we are not prepared at this stage to give an open-ended recommendation for ratification, simply because we do not have enough information. There is also the fifth protocol to the general agreement on trade and services. Again that is linked in with the multilateral agreement on investment, and we would like to have a look at that a little more closely. Reports on a number of other treaties were tabled on 30 June. In particular, I highlight at this point in time an extension of the agreement in relation to Pine Gap. That obviously will need sensitive treatment. It is the committee's intention, with the approval of the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), to visit Pine Gap before we make recommendations to the parliament. Finally, I want to take the opportunity to highlight, as a result of this being our 16th report in 20 months, the workload of the committee. But, besides that, I want to emphasise to the House and, indeed, the member for Oxley eMs Hanson), were she hereMr Hardgrave-She's not here again.",18
8,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"She is not here again. I want to make the point that she and others of her ilk have made the very parochial, very populist comment from time to time that we proceed to make these things as a nation without due consideration. That is a load of rubbish. The honourable member for OxleyI agree with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and others in this regard-is being choreographed by a lot of people with other agendas. Also, I think that she has a number of svengalis in her immediate vicinity. As I have pointed out to the member for Oxley before in this place, she needs to look over her shoulder at those who are choreographing what she is all about. She has shown in the last 48 hours that she does not have a great knowledge of a lot of these issues. She may get away with this populism in the short term, but I am sure all of us-on both sides of this House, in the other place and, indeed, right around the country-will eventually come to the realisation that, whilst what she says sounds like it makes good sense in the short term, a lot of what she says has no substance. I think she will be caught out because of her lack of substance.",19
9,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I rise to speak on the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery and Corruption, Report No. 16. Corruption is one of the greatest challenges facing the contemporary world. It covers a range of activities, including extortion, nepotism, cronyism, bribery and money laundering. It can take both active and passive forms and can cause destabilisation in countries by undermining confidence in institutions such as democracy and law. It can also distort trade, reduce economic competitiveness and enrich those who have their hands on the political process. This has been recognised now through the OECD, and a convention was developed to recommend that member countries take effective measures to deter and combat the bribery of foreign public officials in connection with international business transactions. Australia is one of 29 OECD member countries, and five others are currently in the process of indicating their interest in this convention. This is not a large group and it does not include any developing nations or countries from South-East Asia. The convention was tabled in parliament on 3 March 1998, the draft of the enabling legislation having been forwarded to the committee by the Minister for Justice, Senator Amanda Vanstone. Six public hearings have been held-four in Canberra and one each in Melbourne and Sydney. There were 38 submissions from both business and the legal community. I might point out that I was very impressed by the good and thoughtful submissions received from the legal community. The scope and objectives of the bill are limited to dealing with grand corruption, and many witnesses addressed a wide range of issues in their submissions and evidence. Because of the narrow scope of the bill it was not always possible to deal with all the matters, but the submissions that were forwarded were much appreciated. The purpose of the enabling legislation is to make it a criminal offence to bribe a foreign public official in an overseas country. A territorial connection with Australia has to be made, but the committee has broadened it to make the implementation of the legislation more effective and enforceable. Until now the Australian Taxation Office has allowed tax deductions on sums paid as facilitation payments and is separately considering changes to coincide with the convention. It is abhorrent to most of us that there is a need to pay bribes to do business, but in many countries this has become part of the culture despite efforts by many to stamp it out. The United States is the leader in the move against corruption and has already taken a number of cases under their convention, but they should not be alone. Although Australia cannot move too quickly, this latest convention gives us an opportunity to prevent major bribery occurring. We arc not trying to touch the small facilitator; people in many low wage countries may expect a small supplcmenta60n to their income to ensure contracts are made and business proceeds smoothly. Many such people in developing countrics only survive by this method. It is still not right, but there is an acceptance of such a need in some areas. However, this report recognises that this country is not alone in its move against corruption and that Australia must continue to support the prompt entry into force of the convention in order to assist other countries to back the process too. The legal side of the bill is quite complex and I would not do it justice by trying to describe it here, but copies of the report will be available in which these issues are all canvassed. I think the most important aspects of this are the two recommendations that relate to developing an cducation campaign and linking it to our AusAID programs, especially the programs that deal with good governance. Peak bodies could be enlisted to assist as well as AusAID, and ongoing funding on specific projects could be predicated on the development of good accounting standards. This will not be an easy task, but it is important that cOllntries in this region and other nations in which Australians work are made aware that this country does not tolerate corruption and that this legislation criminalises bribery of public officials. I think the OECD convention represents an important first stcp against global corruption, but it is limited in scope without the weight and commitment of many more nations. So it is a start, but there is a lot more to do before we can say that the bribery practice is stamped out. The whole debate has been a worthwhile and challenging task. I would like to thank the committce clerks and the secretariat for the work they have done, along with the senators involved working with my colleague the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) in getting up this report of the subcommittee of the main committee under the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). This report has been worthwhile. As I said, this report is the beginning of something. It does not stop bribery in the world, but it gives us a start. It shows that this country does not stand for bribery and the country is putting a stamp on something which is good and reasonable. I recommend the convention to the House.",19
10,Mr HARDGRAVE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I firstly wish to associate myself completely with the remarks of the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams). I think he very well acquitted the tasks of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and the subcommittee which was looking in particular at the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery and the draft implementing legislation, which was sent to the committee by the Minister for Justice, Senator Vanstone. I think the member for Lyons has encapsulated the central arguments of the underlying philosophy the committee and the subcommittee as a whole have taken to this particular convention so I will not repeat his comments here but merely endorse them. I would also like to congratulate Minister Vanstone for having a place in history as the first minister to draft legislation relating potential treaty this country would ratify, and to send it on to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties for a holus assessment, if you like, of the matters and the implications of the matters contained within the treaty we were considering. I think this is another sign of the maturing of the treaty making process. As the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, rightly said in his observations this morning, the treaty making process in this country now is open, is accountable and is no longer contrived or signed away and ratified in smoke-filled rooms or in funny corridors with fading carpet in far-flung cities around the world. We now have it all out on the table for everyone to see. I think this in itself is important to note. I want to deal quickly with a couple of the important matters I thought should be highlighted in regard to this 16th report from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, particularly the fact the committee has recommended to the parliament-and then I would hope to the executive-the need to look at ways of extending the nexus of control on those who may participate in international bribery, the bribing of foreign public officials. Bribery distorts outcomes. Bribery brings about in itself a great deal of harm to the economies of, in a lot of cases, Third World countries as well as to our own economy . We have recommended we look-rather like with the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act-at a range of nexus for application through this treaty, which is a good thing. I would certainly encourage the executive to look at the full range-citizenry and other nexus-as the means to apply the laws and the proposed legislation. I would also like to highlight the fact that members of the committee have worked together on so many reports now for so long. It is not because we are all rampant internationalists. I think every member of this committee would stand proudly on any occasion and say they are Australian first and foremost, which is the underlying logic of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties-'what is in it for Australia''? We have found it frustrating to a for the good news of our work to travel slowly, even through the bureaucracies. Departments have come to us on occasions and presented us with information which has not spelt out 'what is in it for Australia' as clearly as we would like. We have never hesitated on any occasion to criticise and to punish in a verbal sense the poor submissions put to us. I find it fascinating and frustrating that the conspiracy theorists, headed by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and those who surround her, continue to try to perpetuate the myth that treaties are negotiated in secret. I find it offensive not only to the work of this parliament but to the 1,750 organisations and individuals who have made their views known to the committee through the 110 treaties we have examined in the 16 reports we have put to the parliament. Having people running around offering in public debate falsehoods, blatant lies, about what is occurring in this process is, I think, offensive to all of the individuals and organisations who bothered to contribute to the process. Good news does not travel fast, but r invite the member for Oxley and those who are using her-those who are her puppet masters and those who are simply, as the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) has said on many occasions, using her as a tool, as a focus for fundraising, personal fundraising more often than not-to stop and take account of the real damage they are doing to the fabric of our society by the continuation of the perpetuation of this myth. r am not going to speak for members in general on the opposition side of the chamber, but I am certain every opposition member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties welcomes the treaty making process which has been embarked upon since the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) on 2 May 1996 announced this committee and this new treaty making process. Some have privately conceded they wished their own party when in power had embarked. on a .si!11i1ar p-ocess. r think on this there 1S a JOInt feelmg of determination to make sure 'what is in it for Australia' is the criteria, the test which is applied on every occasion. I invite the member for Oxley, and those who surround her with this misleading rubbish they go on with on a constant basis, to stop and take stock of just how downright un-Australian their conduct really is.",21
11,Mr MCCLELLAND,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This mayor may not be the last time that one of the reports of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties-and in this case there are two-will be presented to parliament, depending on how long this particular parliament lasts. r will place on record, from the opposition's point of view, our appreciation of the work undertaken by the chairman in particular. It really was an exceptionally heavy workload that he personally took on. He took it on with great d-ter­ mination and administered the commIttee without fear or favour. Indeed, if anyone needed a serve, whether they be a minister, a bureaucrat or whomever, he did not hesitate to give them a serve where necessary. That is really something that the parliament can be proud of: a multiparty joint house committee undertaking its work with enthusiasm and without fear or favour. The fundamental principle that has governed the work of the treaty's committee is, as the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) said determining what treaty action is or is not in Australia's interests. To ascertain that, we have emphasised that there has to be consultation. That consultation is really a statement of a fundamental principle: before any person is affected, particularly before any person is affected to their detriment, they are entitled to be heard, they are entitled to have their say on the issue. r think in some significant way the treaties committee has been responsible for bringing about a form of participatory democracy whereby citizens have been able to actually participate in the decision making as to whether the executive of this country takes or does not take some particular course of action. In respect of the bribery treaty, we have actually recommended amending a legislative framework. I go so far as to predict that much of the methodology that has been adopted by the treaties committee will become more widespread throughout the committee system, in particular having a cons-ruc­ tive role in the actual development of legIslation. r really rose to speak more on the dissenting report contained in - he Fifteenth R-p-rt. That is a dissent regardmg the denuncIatIOn of ILO treaty No.9. That ILO treaty related to the engagement of seamen. It is a situation where the industry is in a state of development and progress, with appropriate consultation between the employers and the industrial organisations involved. The problem with ILO treaty No.9, according to reports given to the government, was that it focused upon an industry pooling arrangement, whereas the industry is moving towards-and has all but moved to-company based employment. The facts of the matter are that, regrettably-and the majority report ,noted this--h-re was inappropriate consultatIOn. The deCISIOn was made on 18 December 1997 to denounce the treaty. It was not until 23 February 1998 that the Aust-alian Council of Trade Unions was advised. Really by way of a gesture, a copy of that letter was sent to the Maritime Union of Australia which was the organisation representing actual workers engaged in the industry. The terms of that letter were communicating a fait accompli rather than inviting discussion. Indeed, it is still the case that the minister has failed to respond to correspondence from the Maritime Union of Australia expressing their concerns regarding the lack of the consultation process. The majority report has recommended that in light of the denunciation of ILO convention No.9, Australia ratify a subsequent convention called ILO No. 179 which is about prescribing appropriate regulation of the seamen's engagement system. Fundamentally, it says there has to be appropriate regulation by people who are trained and qualified in the area. The majority report has recommended that, but we say it is essential to safety, not only of the seafarers but also of the vessels, that it be in place before ILO convention No. 9 is denounced. Obviously, if a vessel goes down on Australia's shores it has the potential for catastrophic environmental consequences. I will conclude my contribution by saying again that the member for Oxley regards international conventions as some sort of international conspiracy to take over Australia's sovereignty, and that is rubbish. There is no international parliament. The mere fact that Australia enters into a treaty is a declaration of our sovereignty and our decision to freely enter into a contract with another country or countries. No issue is of more importance to Australian workers than maintaining intemationallabour standards. It is absolutely fanciful to assume that Australia is going to be able to maintain its current living standards unless the working conditions of our trading competitors, particularly in our immediate region, are lifted. President Clinton is on record recently giving a speech to the World Trade Organisation. He said, 'We are all in a global economy, whether we like it not. What the challenge to the industrialised nations is, is to ensure that there is a spiral of those on lower conditions upwards and that there is not, as a result of competition, a downward spiral for those who have decent conditions down to the lowest common denominator.' The only way that can be prevented is by maintaining proper International Labour Organisation standards around the world. We have expressed our regret in the report that there does appear to be a lack of commitment on the part of the government to those standards, and we say that is particularly short-sighted.",22

15,Mrs GALLUS,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"Hindmarsh) (10.28 a.m.}--I move: That the bill be read a second time. I shall not speak very long on the bill at this time because when I introduced it on Monday, 29 June I gave details of the bill and what it implied for the residents who live near Adelaide airport. It is not appropriate that I go through those details now, as they are available in that introductory speech. I would just like to say at this time that the bill was introduced to give security to residents who live around Adelaide airport. Adelaide airport is built right in the middle of a residential area. There are residences built on the east side, the south side and the north side. These people are badly affected by the aircraft that take off during the day, but that is part of the penalty they pay for living near an airport. But, because they live near an airport, they do not forfeit their right to a proper night's sleep. The purpose of this bill is to put the, existing administrative curfew into legislation. The reason why this is important is that over time there has been a gradual erosion of that very curfew, and the people living around the airport are concerned that, unless the curfew is legislated, there will be an eating away of the curfew and that one day they will wake up to find there are large, heavy aircraft coming into the airport at 3 o'clock in the morning and none of them will be able to get any sleep. Should that happen, they would also find that they probably could not sell their houses to move to another area. To give them the security that they require, we are not changing the present situation, we are simply saying that this curfew, as it exists at present, with some exceptions which I referred to in my introductory speech, will be legislated. If we go back to the early 1990s, we see there was very little breaking of the curfew. It was, in fact, the Labor government at that time that decided to break the curfew by bringing in an international passenger flight at 5.05 in the morning. In respect of the Labor Party, may I say that it did specify that jet had to be of the new generation of silent jets, it could not use reverse thrust greater than idle on landing and it was to come in over the sea. I took a survey following that flight coming into see the effect on my residents. I must say that there was very little complaint about that one plane. Since then there have been other erosions of the curfew, and it is to stop further erosions that we wish to put it in legislation. But I say to the Labor Party that what is disappointing about its reaction, now that we are getting towards an election, is the hypocrisy and the comments that its candidate has made on radio suggesting that all excursions into the curfew should be wound back when it was, in fact, the Labor Party which made those breaks in the curfew. That is all I wish to say at this moment. I understand that the opposition does have some amendments to the bill, and I will be speaking on those amendments. Ms Worth-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",24
16,Mr TANNER,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"Melbourne) (10.33 a.m.)There are certain perennial features of Australian politics that characterise history over an extended period of time. One of them is that, as you approach an election, people bob up and start talking about railways. Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) suddenly found that he could give his endorsement, if not any money, to a grand visionary rail project and, presumably, it will not be all that long before the other feature starts to surface; that is, the tum the rivers inland project. But it would now seem that we have to add another to the list of the regular, immediate pre-election period announcements as a basis for getting an idea as to when an election is imminent. That is the Adelaide airport curfew legislation. We had the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) introduce this legislation-albeit in slightly different form-in 1995, shortly before an election was due. Not much has been heard of the issue since then, certainly not in this parliament, but 10 and behold, just as we are in the immediate pre-election period and we are months away from an election, it has resurfaced; she has bobbed up again. No doubt we can look forward to the prospect of this matter actually reaching the Senate, if it passes this House, roughly around the year 2001, just in time for another election. So we in the opposition are somewhat sceptical about the motives behind this bill. It really is a sign of the desperation of the member for Hindmarsh, who clearly has both the Labor candidate and fear about One Nation on her mind. It really is a sign of desperation that she suddenly decided that, after having let it sit there for three years, this now needs to be revived. I think it is also worth pointing out that it is a sign of the hypocrisy of the government that it is prepared to have this bill, a private member's bill, brought on for debate and resolution in this chamber but not the bill which the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) wishes to move and debate on very similar issues, on issues associated with the management of aircraft noise at Sydney airport. He is not allowed to have his bill debated. I cannot see any real difference between the two pieces of legislation. They both seek to protect local residents in the immediate vicinity of major airports, yet one of themfrom a government member-is seen as being appropriate to be debated in this chamber and the other-that just happens to be moved by somebody who has actually resigned from the government because of its mishandling of the airport noise question with respect to Sydney airport-is deemed unsuitable for consideration by this parliament. I tum to some of the details. I would indicate that the opposition supports the bill because essentially it entrenches the status quo. However, we do wish to move some amendments which would put the heat on the government to actually act on what are substantially greater problems with respect to Adelaide airport aircraft noise and to reaffirm the commitment that was made by the former mi-ister, the Minister for Defence Industry, SCience and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), who is sitting at the table today, with respect to insulation for the worse noise affected homes in the immediate vicinity of Adelaide airport. It will be very interesting to see how the government actually responds to that proposal. The bill that is before us, the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1998, imposes a curfew on all aircraft over 34 tonnes between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Some smaller aircraft are excluded from operating during the curfew period if they do not meet certain noise criteria. There is a range of exempt categories which allow for things like aircraft in distress, 'search rescue, medical emergencies and the like, all of which are perfectly reasonable exceptions. There is a shoulder period between 11 p.m. and midnight and between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m., and the minister can make regulations with respect to this period to prescribe a maximum number of takeoffs and a maximum number of landings by international passenger aircraft during this period. The effect of this is that the curfew applies only to international passenger aircraft between midnight and 5 a.m. The minister can also make regulations to allow for up to eight movements per week during the curfew period by heavy freight aircraft, provided that there are no B727 movements and no more than four DC9 movements. These issues are always difficult for governments because governments have to ensure that airports provide maximum economic development for the hinterlands that they serve and, at the same time, minimum disruption, noise intrusion and environmental damage to the local communities in which they are situated. It is always a case of reaching a balance between those two, often conflicting, objectives. We must ensure that the local community is protected but at the same time that the city or the broader community served by the airport has its economic development maximised. If there is anywhere in mainland Australia that is in desperate need of greater economic development and more aircraft taking freight from it and bringing passengers and tourists to it, it is Adelaide. It is of great concern to the opposition that that balance is correct-that the protection for people in the immediate vicinity of the airport is maximised but not at the cost of substantial reductions in the opportunities for economic development and jobs in South Australia. The bill effectively enshrines the existing arrangements which have been described by the term 'administrative curfew' and it does allow for a significant expansion of international traffic during the shoulder period. It does nothing to ensure that the current international services operating into Adelaide during that period are not replaced by larger services with larger and louder aircraft. The and current curfew does nothing, and this legislative curfew will do nothing, to assist those people who live in the immediate vicinity of the airport under the flight paths and who have substantial problems with existing noise, particularly in the early to mid evening when they are, for example, trying to get young children to sleep. They have to suffer the disruption caused by the normal operations of the airport. It will not help the occasional shiftworker, for example, who lives in the immediate vicinity of the airport and who has to sleep during the day. Nor will it help the elderly or a range of people who live near the airport and who are seriously affected by aircraft noise. It does not deal with other noise problems associated with Adelaide airport which have been drawn to my attention on several occasions. I have had several meetings with residents and representatives from groups of people who are affected by aircraft noise around Adelaide airport. A number of issues have been raised with me that arc not addressed by this bill, such as the testing of jet engines on the ground, sometimes at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning. It does not deal with the fact that Adelaide airport is currently being used for helicopter training purposes, which means that residents are affected by helicopters flying around, doing circuits and the like, which should not be occurring over residential areas. So this bill is by no means a panacea the problems of aircraft noise associated with Adelaide airport. It does entrench the status quo in legislation. It does raise some questhat tions about the integrity of the sale process for the Adelaide airport, but I understand the new owners have agreed to support the legislation. The key thing is that it does really address the one critical issue that Commonwealth government should be adfreight dressing, and that is the issue people living in the immediate vicinity of the airport. As I have indicated, I will shortly moving amendments that do relate to that proposal. The opposition supports the legislation. will watch with some interest goes. If it is successful in passing through this chamber we will watch with some interest what happens in the Senate. We suspect that it may well surface in the Senate at some shortly prior to the federal election scheduled after the one that is due within the next six seven months or so. The residents of Hindhis marsh are entitled to be a little cynical about the motives of their member, who introduced the bill. this legislation just before the 1996 election and is reviving it just before the 1998, or perhaps early 1999, election.",25
17,Ms WORTH,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"Adelaide-Parliamentary not Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (10.41 a.m.)-I am happy to second this motion today, not only because the effect that it has on some of the residents in my own electorate of Adelaide, but also because I am keen to support the member Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who is indeed a creasing very good member who stands up for her electorate and is always conscious of the needs of her own constituents. I was a little surprised to hear the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), embark on a story about hypocrisy and railways. That gives me the opportunity to briefly comment on some of those remarks. It is way out of line for Labor to talk about hypocrisy and railways in the same speech. Labor's mismanagement of Australian National over the years prior to the sale saw thousands of jobs go from that industry in South Australia. It was only when we came to for government, and I pay tribute to previous Minister Sharp and current Minister Vaile for some of the reforms that have taken place in area, that rail got back on track-no pun intended. The sale of Australian National that went ahead with the support of the public transport union and other unions. It was a not privilege to work with those people. The new the owners have increased passenger services and haulage, and they are making a profit of insulation for instead of a loss. Mr Tanner-On a point of order, Mr be Deputy Speaker, I am happy to debate these issues with the honourable member for Adelaide at any time, but they are hardly relevant We to the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill that is to see how it before the House.",27
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"Mr Jenkins)The honourable member for Adelaide will return to the bilI, although I understand that time the honourable member is making passing references to some passing references made or by the honourable member for Melbourne in speech. I hope that the honourable member for Adelaide will return very quickly to",27
19,Ms WORTH,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"I shall do that. It was astute of you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to so keenly understand precisely what I was doing. I had intended to mention any of these things if it had not been for the comments made by the previous speaker. In passing, I just say that of the new owners of Australian National have increased passenger services and freight haulage. That is good for jobs in the rail for industry because we can see them only inin the future. In reference to the bill, he quite wisely commented on the economic need for Adelaide to be well connected with the rest of Australia and the rest of the world. I was pleased to hear him supporting this bill and recognising that the economic advantages must be in harmony with the needs of the local community. That is exactly what this bill is doing and I again compliment the member for Hindmarsh on bringing it before the House. I would hope, as the last speaker mentioned, that this bill will progress rapidly to the Senate. As one who these days has to get legislation through this chamber and then to . the Senate, I can only say that it is very much easier to get it through the House of Representatives. It gets bogged down in extraordinary ways in the Senate. Even when the opposition in this chamber is in absolute agreement-as in the legislation I hope to be through the Senate shortly-we can still have stumbling blocks because, of course, they do not have the gag up there. Even when you have the numbers, things can get bogged down. So I do not think we can blame the member for Hindmarsh-or, for that matter, the government-for the delays in what happens in the Senate sometimes. To return to the detail of this bill-and the member for Hindmarsh has spoken extensively about the detail-the curfew will be enshrined in legislation as is currently available through the administrative arrangements. As the member for Hindmarsh has already pointed out, that gives security and predictability to those people who live near the airport and those who are in the flight path of planes coming into the Adelaide airport. Yesterday I telephoned Airservices to find out the number of complaints from people in my own electorate and what they were about. In the last three-month period-from 1 April to 30 June-there have been nine phone calls: two from North Adelaide, two from Mile End, three from Thebarton, one from Thorngate and one from Parkside. Interestingly enough, none of those, when I sought the detail of them, were actually about the curfew. That means that people who choose to live where they are living now-relying on those curfew arrangements-are happy with them. The people who have rung in have had concerns when something unusual has happened-such as police helicopter flights-but of course we know that law and order is an issue, so I am sure that when they understood what that was about they were happy with that. Weather conditions sent a plane or two over Parkside and I think somebody from there rang into find out why that was the case. I again congratulate the member for Hindmarsh for understanding the needs of her constituents, and in fact my own, and bringing this bill before the House, so giving me the opportunity to speak briefly on it.",27
20,Mr ZAMMIT,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"Last night I spoke on the suspension of standing and sessional orders, which I was very pleased to support. I will not make much reference today to the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1998, except to say that I support the bill. I would like to make a couple of passing comments and draw those to the attention of the House. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) said absolutely nothing about a cap on the airport, and there is nothing more important than to have a cap in legislation. I would like the honourable member for Hindmarsh to know and to listen to some of the experiences that we have had in Sydney over a very long time. It is a very difficult issue, but an issue that can be resolved. If the honourable member for Hindmarsh is fair dinkum-as the saying goesthen I would urge her to include as an amendment or addendum to her bill that there be a cap. How many planes is the honourable member for Hindmarsh prepared to accept ov-r her residents-60 planes an hour, 70 planes an hour, 80 planes an hour? I might just say that only two days ago the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly)-a member of the government-said that Sydney airport should lift the cap and go from 80 movements an hour-wait for this-to 120 movements an hour over one million residents of Sydney. This is what a member of the government is saying. I am suggesting to the honourable member for Hindmarsh that, if she is fair dinkum, she should put forward an addendum to her bill and enshrine in legislation a cap on the airport. The other thing that I want to draw to the attention of the House is the matter of the health of the residents. There has not been a definitive test conducted anywhere in Australia that can prove to the residents under the flight paths that the carcinogenic effects of the emissions from the aircraft-known colloquially as black rain-are nothing to worry about. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has heard me raise in this parliament the matter of the aircraft emissions. In fact, I took it upon myself to send her a copy of the 1997 report on the effects on health of residents under flight paths, especially the effects on children. I think it would have been a good thing if, in her comments to this House, the honourable member for Hindmarsh had made some reference to the concerns she has, as I have, for the health and well-being of people who live under the flight paths. I want to raise one final item before I resume my seat, and this matter is in regard to insulation. I am very surprised that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said absolutely nothing about compensation for insulation for those who are so badly affected by aircraft notice that it affects not only their health but their marriage, the way that they work and their psychological well-being. While a curfew is a very good idea-and we obviously all have to support it, as we have supported it in Sydney-let me remind the member for Hindmarsh that the curfew is intended between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Is that what you are proposing? Mrs Gallus-Yes.",28
21,Mr ZAMMIT,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"Like Sydney airportbetween 11 p.m. and 6 a.m - and that is fine, but I would ask the honourable member for Hindmarsh whether she has taken any surveys as to how many people in her electorate are shiftworkers. I have done that survey in my electorate. I would like to mention to the honourable member for Hindmarsh how difficult it is for us to say that it is fine to have a curfew but no cap. There are people who finish work and get home at 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning after having worked at night, and all of a sudden that is when the planes start-and the planes continue and continue. Those people cannot sleep because they have just come home from work and then they have to go to work later that evening. All in all, in summing up, I am concerned that there was no mention of a cap, I am concerned that there was no mention of the effects on the health of the residents and I am concerned that no mention was made of compensation for insulation. I heard the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), make reference to possible amendments that he wishes to put forward on behalf of the opposition. I will be glad to see the amendments before I SUppOlt them or otherwise. I thank the House for giving me the time to mention these few matters. My Sydney Airports Bill 1998 would have gone a long way to addressing some of the concerns of the member for Hindmarsh. I note that, every time. I have raised this matter in this parliament, the member for Hindmarsh has voted against me bringing the bill forward.",29
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"I call the member for Hindmarsh. Mr Tanner- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I understand that you are only allowed to speak once in a second reading debate.",29
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,The member for Hindmarsh is the proposer of this bill; she moved the motion. She can close the debate and has a right of reply.,29
24,Mrs GALLUS,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"Hindmarsh) (10.54 a.m.)in reply-In summing up the debate on the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bil11998, I will first address the remarks of the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit). I invite you to Adelaide airport sometime. You will find that a cap on the movements during the daytime is not actually a problem. We are not Sydney airport; we do not have flights going over every two minutes. In fact, the owners of Adelaide airport, the government and, I believe, the residents would like to see an increase in the number of flights during the day to help the economic well-being of South Australia. I note that the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), did mention that we need more economic development in South Australia and, indeed, would welcome more flights during the daytime to assist in the opening up of both the export of goods and the import of tourists into South Australia. I say to the member for Lowe: this is not an issue for Adelaide airport at this time. The shadow minister was very unfair in suggesting this is somehow an election ploy, and, if I can catch the attention of the shadow minister at the table, I would like to actually address my remarks to him. I did not take over the electorate which includes the airport until the 1993 election. Mr Tanner-I am not attacking you for what happened before 1995.",29
25,Mrs GALLUS,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"It was not actually until after the Labor Party allowed in the precurfew flights at 5.05 in the morning that aircraft noise became an issue. It became an issue because of a number of things: firstly, these early morning flights; secondly, some heavy freight aircraft were allowed in during the night; and, thirdly, there was a great increase in helicopter traffic-that has also been mentioned, and I will get to that later. These concerns of the residents did build up, and, with that, came the recognition that there was a need for a curfew to be enshrined in legislation so that the current administrative curfew was not further eaten away. In response to that, I did bring up the possibility of enshrining the curfew in legislation. I remind the member that we were actually in opposition at that time. There was nothing I could do from opposition, but I did get the agreement of the then shadow ministry that we could go ahead. At that stage, I started looking at a curfew bill. I found that, once you are in government, these things are not as easy as they first appear. From the minute we got into government in 1996, I have been working on this bill. If you went to my constituents, you would be aware of this; they have followed my progress on this matter in my newsletters. There were a number of things to be taken into consideration: firstly, how this was going to effect potential bidders on the airport as it was going to be up for lease; and, secondly, at first, the state government was vcry strongly opposed to a legislated curfew. It took a lot of meetings with the South Australian transport minister, the Han. Diana Laidlaw, who . was very sympathetic but had to be convinced, as did the Premier, that this was not going to be detrimental to the economic development of South Australia. There was a long period of negotiation with the state government. We then had the problem of the tenderers for Adelaide airport. It was finally agreed with the cabinet that they would give permission for a legislated curfew, but this had to be conveyed to all those people who were tendering for the airport so they could take it into account, to see if it affected their desire to tender or the amount for which they were prepared to tender. Again, this was a long and involved process. It is not just that you snap your fingers and say, 'Today, I will enact a curfew.' It takes negotiation, you have setbacks, you have people against it. Also, there were some business interests who felt that this was not an appropriate way to go, and I needed to consult with them. In fact, it was not until quite early this year that cabinet agreed to give approval for a legislated curfew, and, following that, we had to inform all the tenderers for Adelaide airport. That could not go ahead until they knew and accepted that that would be part of the tendering process. I say to the honourable shadow minister that I have answered what were simply point scoring and extremely unfair exercises on his part. Getting this curfew into legislation is something that I have been working solidly on for the last two years. It is not something that I arrived at easily. It took an enormous amount of work and many meetings. I am very happy now to get it into this House. The shadow minister also mentioned helicopter noise. I am pleased to tell him that I have been working very hard on the matter of helicopter noise, because it affects residents in my electorate who live near Brooklyn Park. That is where the helicopter base is and the residents hear them take off. We cannot move the helicopter base, but I have an agreement [rom both Lloyds Helicopters and Norris Helicopters that they will attempt to reach a height of 1,500 feet before they move laterally over the suburbs. That is the first concession. . The second concession is that, when they go to the city or move to the north, they will go across Kooyonga golf course and not across the residences. Also, when they go out to the west and the south, they will go across the Glenelg sewerage treatment works, and again not across residences. The third concession I got was from Starforce. Obviously, if there is an emergency they go straight to it, and we would not want to change that in any way, but they will not do any practice runs over the residences of Brooklyn Park and Lockleys, as they are already the ones affected by the helicopters taking off. This is a concession from them that, when they do their practice runs, they will not be over the areas near the airport but that they will move away from the airport to do that. I am pleased to tell the shadow minister at the table that I have indeed been dealing with helicopter flights, and since I have had those negotiations we have seen an enormous improvement. Over the last month there have been only two complaints whereas in the previous month there were something like 25 complaints, although I will not swear to that exact number. The shadow minister has also raised the question of insulation. That is not as easy a subject as he would like to suggest. Although the Labor Party did not do it in the 13 years they were in government, suddenly, now that the election is coming up, the shadow minister has said that the next Labor government will insulate the houses within the 30 ANEF band. There is a bit of a problem with this. The 30 ANEF band is an average. Microphones are not set in the residences which show that some people have more noise than others. It is an average over an area. That means that some people who are affected more by the noise of aeroplanes do not qualify for the insulation while people who may be affected less do qualify. In one street you might find somebody on one side who receives insulation and another person directly opposite who does not. It is not an ideal solution. Further, the present ANEF bands are not appropriate (a) to the extended runway and (b) to the different height of the extended runway. I have discussed this with Airservices and they say that basically the current 30 ANEF band is absolutely useless for working out who would be noise affected. Taking these two matters into consideration, I am working with the state Minister for Transport and Urban Planning, the Hon. Diana Laidlaw, the Hon. Mark Vaile, Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Airservices and the new owners of the airport to see what we can do for those people who are most directly affected by noise. A third point about the insulation is that I have approached some of the people in the area and explained to them that the 30 ANEF band insulation comes as a total package. I believe that the shadow minister has said that he would copy what was done in Sydney. When I have put this to some of my residents who I think would qualify for the insulationalthough I must say it is very hard to say whether they would or not-and told them they will have to hermetically seal their house, including sealing the air vents in the wall, under the door and around the windows, and put in air conditioning so there is no fresh air entering their house, they have been absolutely horrified. A couple of people have said to me, 'If that is the choice, thanks, I will take the noise.' What the shadow minister has come up with looks like a quick and easy solution. It is not an easy and quick solution. That does not mean that we forget those people who have this increased noise. It means that we try to look for an improved solution. We do not take the quick and easy 'this sounds like a good electoral gimmick' solution. We need to look at the new 30 ANEF bands, with the extension of the runway and the different height of the runway, and we need to work harder on what we can do for those people. As I said, this is something I am devoting an enormous amount of time to both with the state Minister for Transport and Urban Planning, the Hon. Diana Laidlaw, and the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon. Mark Vaile. We hope to come up with a solution, but let's not take a bad solution. If we have to spend the $30 million which it costs to put in this insulation, for heaven's sake, Jet's do it properly and not simply as an election gimmick. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",30
26,Mr TANNER,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"Melbourne) (11.07 a.m.)by leave-I move: (1) Clause 2, page 2, omit ""This Act"", substitute ""Subject to subsection (2), this Act"". (2) Clause 2, page 2, at the end of the clause, add: ""(2) This Act shall not commence unless Adelaide Airport is a qualifying airport in terms of Section 6 of the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Act 1995"". The two amendments which are circulated in my name are extremely brief. They are designed to amend the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1998 to ensure that it does not come into effect until such time as the government takes action to offer insulation to the residents living immediately in the vicinity of Adelaide airport, on exactly the same basis as it is offered to residents living in the immediate vicinity of Sydney airport. The opposition will vote for the bill whether or not my amendments are accepted, so they are not in any way intended to derail the legislation, but they are intended to put the heat on the government to see precisely where they stand on this issue. These amendments are simply about ensuring that there is equity on these issues across the country. If you are a resident living near Adelaide airport, then the noise that you suffer is no different from the noise that you suffer if you live immediately near Sydney airport, Perth airport, Brisbane airport or wherever. Provided the measurement is an accurate reflection of the noise, noise is the same regardless of geographic location. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that if there is an established entitlement for people in Sydney to have their house insulated, if they so choose, based on the proceeds of a very small ticket tax of $3 or so per passenger ticket with respect to that airport, then that right should be available to any other person who is in precisely the same situation as the person in Sydney. Obviously, in Adelaide and Perth and so. forth, the number of people who are affected in this way is much smaller than the number of people affected in Sydney. That is simply the nature of both the demand for the airport services and also the distribution of residents in the immediate vicinity of all those airports. Nonetheless, there are some--and in Adelaide it is several hundred-who are affected as adversely by the airport as a much larger number of people in Sydney are. That larger number of people in Sydney have an entitlement to insulation should they so choose. And not everybody has taken that up. I would like to respond quickly to some of the observations that were made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). First, the claim that this is an election stunt by the opposition: this was announced in the wake of the introduction of insulation in Sydney, which occurred in 1994, from memory. The honourable shadow minister at the table may correct me, but from memory it was 1994. It was announced-after that insulation was up and running and proved to be appropriate and successful-by the then minister that this would be extended to all other airports in Australia where the same problem existed. Shortly after becoming the shadow minister I made statements in the media indicating that we would continue with that position. We have recently announced that formally. But there has been no secret about the Labor Party's position on this issue going back to the time when insulation was first introduced at Sydney airport. Second, the question about the validity of the ANEF measurement: when the topography of Adelaide airport changes, and when we have an extended runway and the like, clearly that will lead to the ANEF contours changing as a result. Clearly the new contours will be the indicator of where any entitlement to insulation would exist. It is widely recognised that the ANEF measurement is not absolutely 100 per cent perfect. It is difficult to develop an equation that measures regularity, intensity, et cetera of noise; so it is not a perfect measurement. Clearly one of things that needs to be done by government, and by Airservices and the like, is to work to further improve that measurement. But the alternative implicitly the contribution of the member for Hindmarsh is that we do nothing. Because we do not not have an absolutely perfect mcasurementis because we cannot say that there is an cxact quantity of noise that this house gets here an exact quantity of noise that the house next to it gets there-we should do nothing, is absurd proposition. We are doing it in Sydpartially. ney. There are plenty of houses, plenty of public buildings, plenty of schools and of churches that have been insulated in people Sydney at the request of the occupants. The other statement that the honourable measures. member for Hindmarsh makes is that there are all these people there who do not want it. I have not had the same experience. Obviously insulation is not a perfect solution either, experience in Sydney suggests that most people actually do want it. Our amendments and our policy proposal do not make insulaonly tion compulsory. If you do not want it, you just say no. I would venture to suggest that, when the Beazley Labor government is further. elected within a matter of months and this policy is implemented, the vast majority of people who do qualify for it will say yes, was the case in Sydney, because although it does not solve the problem of 100 per cent it does substantially ameliorate it. So it is absolutely absurd to suggest that we should do nothing because the present measurement is not perfect. (Time expired)",32
27,Mrs GALLUS,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"I am glad to hear that the shadow minister, member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), said the present measurements are not ideal. They certo tainly are not. It is incumbent on us to see there is any better way we can do this, and that is exactly what I said I was working The shadow minister implied that I said, 'Let's not go ahead with anything because is not ideal.' Had he been listening, he have noticed that that is not what I said. said we are working at it. I am working on it bill. with the council and I am working on it with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) and we are trying find a much better way of doing it. I also indicated that we have to do something for the people in that area, and that is exactly suggested in what I am looking at. The shadow minister also said, 'If they do want it, they do not have to have it.' That true, but under the Sydney regulations they could not have it halfway. All they wcre and allowed was to take the whole lot. They had to have all fresh air taken off by hermetically an sealing their house. They could not have it I have checked on that and that is exactly it: they had to have the whole packplenty age or none at all. Whereas some of my would like to say, yes, they would like double glazing, on the Sydney rules they could not have that. So you cannot have half I will be opposing the amendments, not because I am not concerned about people but under the flight path and do not want to find a solution-and perhaps the solution that the shadow minister has come across may be the one; I do not think so-but this is something we will be looking at. When this bill goes to the Senate we can debate this Can I say at this time that the amendments that the shadow minister has moved to this bill are totally and utterly inappropriate. as This is a curfew bill. It is not a levy on aircraft coming in. That would be for a totally aircraft noise different bill. If the shadow minister would like to introduce that bill, perhaps we can discuss it under the appropriate bill. You cannot use a curfew bill and decide you are going to bring in a levy bill relating to all other airports and the everything else. It is not an appropriate amendment to bring in on this bill. As I said the shadow minister, this does not stop us if discussing it at another time under an appropriate bill. I certainly have enormous sympaon. thy with those people in my electorate who have aeroplanes going over their houses and it who need protection from that noise. We will would be opposing the amendments, as they are I totally and utterly inappropriate for a curfew",33
28,Mr ZAMMIT,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"I would like to make a passing reference to a to couple of matters that were raised by the have honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). 1 will draw them together as they specifically affect the matter of insulation. 1I have now had the opportunity of seeing the amendments from the opposition which 1 very strongly support. 1 grew up in inner western Sydney in Petersham, and 1 can tell you that the issue of aircraft noise in those days was an issue but it was not that bad, even though I could actually see the pilot in the planes as they were flying overhead. 1 can tell you that my mother became deaf, and I know a lot of friends in that area that 1I have kept in touch with over all these years have also had hearing problems. The difficulty is trying to ascertain how serious the problem is, and governments on both sides-all around the world, incidentally-have tried the best they can to ensure that that information is not made available. But the world has progressed a lot in the past ] 0 or 15 years specifically in regard to this issue. We now have access to community groups all around the world that assist each other and help each other to try to ensure that the people who are aircraft noise affected get the facts. If 1 can offer one piece of advice to the honourable member for Hindmarsh, it is this: whatever Airservices Australia tell you, whatever they say to you, do not believe them. We have all been conned by them repeatedly. I personally have been conned by them. Airservices Australia's only role in life is to ensure that they get as many planes in and as many planes out. 1 will say something else to the honourable member for Hindmarsh, because I think it is important that she draws on the experience that we have had over a very long period of time. We have in Australia a body known as CASA. The role of CAS A is to ensure safety. I asked the head of CAS A at a Sydney Airport Community Forum meeting 18 months ago or two years ago, 'What is more important to you: the safety of the people in the aeroplanes or the safety of the people on the ground?' He said, 'The answer is very simply this: my only role as head of CASA is to ensure the safety of the people in the aeroplanes.' 1 want the honourable member for Hindmarsh to note that. Their only interest is the safety of the people in the aeroplanes, and . they do not care where these aeroplanes go. The honourable member for Hindmarsh said that the issue of a cap is no big deal for Adelaide airport. 1 would suggest that it is. If she does not believe it is a big issue, it is going to become a major issue as more and more planes start to come into Adelaide airport. I would like her to know the experience that we have had, where at given times of the day because it suits the airlines there are very few planes coming into Sydney airport-no less than 20, 25 or even 30 flights an hour. That is no big deal-people can cope with that-but when it suits the airlines in the peak periods they are getting up to 70, 80 or 90 flights an hour. They were talking of going to even more flights an hour. In fact, only a few days ago the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) said that Sydney airport should go up to 120 flights an hour. I am suggesting to the honourable member for Hindmarsh-and it is still not too latethat if she is really fair dinkum about protecting her residents she should say, 'I want to place a limit on any given hour of the day.' That would ensure that at any given hour of the day there are no more flights in and out of Adelaide airport than what people believe to be fair and reasonable. In other words, she is going to find that in the off-peak hours she might have only 10 flights an hour but in the peak hours a lot more planes than that will be coming in. That is how it is going to affect the people of Adelaide unless she says, 'There has to be a limit. We are prepared to do all we can to assist industry. We are prepared to do all we can to assist the tourism industry, we are prepared to do all we can to assist the hospitality industry, but there has to be a limit in any given hour.' In other words, once the scheduled flights start arriving at a level that is uncomfortable for the residents, we are not suggesting they should not be coming into Adelaide airport; we are saying that, for the welfare and benefit of her constituents, they should reschedule to have these planes arriving and departing during the off-peak hours.

The member for Lowe has said that CAS A is more interested in the safety of the planes. Well, surprise me! CASA is interested in the safety of the planes. I am stunned. On behalf of my residents, whom the planes fly over, may I thank CASA from the bottom of my heart and theirs for being interested primarily in the safety of planes. If they were not and something should happen to one of those planes, the people who would be the direct sufferers should the plane crash would be the people of my electorate.

In other words, there is preferential treatment for the people that she represents because she is a member of the government and that treatment will not be extended to people around Sydney airport because the honourable member for Lowe has chosen to take a stand on principle and to represent his constituents, even if that required him to leave his party, which he did serve for a very long period of time. That is an outrageous proposition. It is something that shames all people on the government side if that is their approach; in other words, you can get your way on these local issues but only if you are a member of the government.",35

44,Mr TANNER,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"As the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith just pointed out, otherwise you stand to be condemned and vilified and calumniated as a traitor.",36
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member for Melbourne will recall there have been several points of order raised about relevance to the hill. We are now speaking about the bill affecting Adelaide and nothing else.,36
46,Mr TANNER,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"I accept your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was about to do exactly that. I would like to refer to a couple of points that the member for Hindmarsh did raise in her contribution. Firstly, it is incorrect to state that people in and around Sydney airport had no choices with regard to what they were offered in terms of insulation packages. They had choices about whether, for example, they wanted air conditioning or no air conditioning or the like. It is simply incorrect to say that those choices were not available to people as they would be available to people in Adelaide. If the opposition is successful, they will be able to negotiate what particular option suits them and suits the configuration of their houses in order to maximise the benefit that they can get from the insulation package in protecting them from aircraft noise. The second observation I would make is the question of the appropriateness of pursuing this issue in the context of the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill. I would point out to the honourable member that there is an Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Act that has already been introduced. That has a power in it for the minister to declare a particular airport subject to this legislation. So this amendment does not seek to introduce new legislation to create a levy or anything like that; it seeks to activate existing legislation with regard to a levy that is already in place in Sydney and say, 'We want to have that activated for Adelaide as well.' In the context of a debate about aircraft noise at Adelaide Airport, the appropriate means of dealing with that aircraft noise and the appropriate way of ameliorating the impact of that aircraft noise on the residents who live in the immediate vicinity it is entirely appropriate that we should be dealing with an amendment that says, 'We have an established mechanism sitting here on the statute book and all that is needed for it to be triggered is about 10 words of amendment to this legislation.' That is entirely appropriate. It is a sad day for people living in the vicinity of Adelaide airport that the member for Hindmarsh, who has had this legislation sitting around for a while and who has given us a bit of a story about why it keeps bobbing up every time there is an election offingthey can form their own views about that-is now standing up here and saying, 'We reject the insulation proposal because we think there are one or two imperfections in it and it may not solve the entire world's problems. We are not going to do anything for you. We are looking at it.' Based on the track record of the speed displayed with regard to this particular legislation on the curfew, 'looking at it' will probably take some considerable time. We in the opposition say that everybody in Australia who lives in the immediate vicinity of a major airport should be entitled to insulation based on a small ticket tax on the basis that it is offered in Sydney. That should be done on the same basis of equality right across the country. Whatever the criteria are and if we end up with a modified ANEF because of new scientific knowledge, fine, but at this stage we have a measurement that says if you are beyond the 30 ANEF contour then you are entitled to insulation in Sydney. There is no single reason that the honourable member has given as to why the residents in her own electorate should not get the same opportunity that the residents in the electorates immediately in the vicinity of Sydney airport get. There is no reason why you should not have equality of treatment across the country. If people do not want insulation or they want a modified package, they will have that choice. They will have that choice, as they do in Sydney. (Time expired)",36
47,Mr TONY SMITH,ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"I just want to say a few words about these amendments. I support the amendments that have been moved by the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). I also want to say a few words in relation to Airservices Australia. I support the remarks of the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) in relation to the interest of Airservices Australia in the people on the ground. In my electorate, the flight paths are being altered and changed. There have been many complaints from residents in the arcas of Cashmere, Clear Mountain, Joyner and Petrie because those flight paths have been changed. They are causing much disruption to the people. Airservices Australia came into my office and gave me some smarmy, smooth talk about how concerned they are about flight paths and helping people, but they do not mean it.

Lowe in Sydney and their attitude to the constituents of the honourable member for Melbourne, who moved these amendments. That is what I deplore about this particular matter.

69,Mr OKEEFE,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"The Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998 is not opposed by the opposition. It gives effect to the farm business management scheme funding and, as I have said in a number of contributions in other debates surrounding components of the rural adjustment scheme, this is, in fact, re-funding a program which Labor previously had in place under different names and under different categories. It constitutes part of what I have constantly described as a rural hoax. I think it is hellishly pertinent to some new information which came to light yesterday. Yesterday we saw published the media comment about the recent Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics farm survey on the financial performance of farms. Despite the fact that this survey result confirms what I have actually been saying for the last 18 months, I still have to say it was a sad piece of information that warrants an urgent response by the government. I will quote from the Australian's summary, which is absolutely correct. It says: The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics' latest Farm Survey has found that farm profits have been slashed by 80 per cent under the Howard Government. It says that that decline in farm profits has mostly hit farmers at the low end of the income scale. The 25 per cent of farmers in the small family farm category are the ones whose incomes have declined most in the last two years. This bill like this, which provides for funding to assist farmers to run their farm businesses better and which provides for assistance with technology skills and with farm business skills, is not only needed in the general sense; in the economic climate that farmers now find themselves in, absolutely and completely directly because of the policies of the Howard-Fischer coalition government, this farm business skills assistance legislation becomes almost a talking point. They are not going to need better skills in running their farms; they are going to need to be money magicians. They are going to need to be Houdinis of the money bag to find some way in which to work through the situation they now find themselves in and this sorry tale. If there are any members of the coalition opposite who doubt the efficacy of these figures, I would just refer them to graph 1, section 1 on page 2 of the ABARE report and invite them to look at the figures for farm business profit. The average farm business profit in 1995-96--that is, the last year under Labor-was $9,979. Last year it was $2,000. It has fallen by 80 per cent across the board. For many farms, it is a negative figure. In fact, the figures confirm that almost 70 per cent of Australian farms are now running at a loss or break-even at best. The first question I want to ask is: why is this so? I think there are two reasons for this. First of all, the government has severely underestimated the impact of the EI Nino effect on agriculture in Australia. The evidence from day one was that it was going to be more severe and was going to have a longer effect than the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and the cabinet ever anticipated. Secondly, the government has hopelessly underestimated the downturn in demand from Asia for product. If there is any doubt about what the government actually thinks about this as an issue in the Australian economy, listen to this. I notice the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) in the chamber. I very well remember the member for Murray on an ABC television program a few years ago with a National Party former member who was on the same program and who was asking this very question: why are farmers being treated so badly by the National Party? Her answer was: because you are in the B team. That is the fact of it. The National Party find themselves around the cabinet table in the B team and unable to win support. There can be no doubt about this view. I mentioned to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) this morning that I intended to quote him authoritatively. In the Australian Financial Review on 4 September 1997-about nine months ago-the Treasurer was asked: What would be the effect on the Australian economy if there were to be a major downturn in demand for agricultural products either through the downturn in Asia or through the EI Nino effect being worse than anticipated? The Treasurer's answer was: There is no need to get too pessimistic. Farm product is not a huge part of GDP. And that is the fact of it. That is how the farm sector is regarded around that cabinet table. I have no doubt that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy have been pleading the case, but they are faced with the position of being in the B team and having a Treasurer who sees the farm sector as not a huge part of GDP-so why would you worry? The reason you would worry is that there is a very direct impact on the families concerned. It is not as if I have been alone in predicting that these problems would need to be faced up to. In the Australian Financial Review of I April 1998, there was a headline, 'Rural exports drop 9 per cent in 6 months.' That ought to have been a pretty significant signal to the government that there was going to be a problem in the Australian economy, particularly in the rural sector, with a downturn in the demand for products from the agriculture sector. The problem is due not only to the fact that the Liberals in the coalition do not see agriculture as significant in GDP or the National Party and their members who represent country areas as significant in this debate. The minister himself has created the problem. From day one they have done two things: first, they have gone back and continued the populist cant that Labor in the bush does not care about country people and has no programs that worked for country people and, second, they said that they were going to bring in a suite of programs that would make the difference. r could quote the speech given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when they introduced the AAA package that this bill is part of. He talked about this major bundle of money that was there to provide a support base for farmers in need in the country. It was, if I remember correctly, a $517 package called AAA: Advancing Agriculture-Australia. The very day after it was launched with great fanfare, the National Farmers Federation came out and said, 'Hang on. We can find only $30 million of new money in the whole $517 million.' They had to use a microscope to find the $30 million because r went through and the best I could do was $17 million. Even the National Farmers Federation were in effect saying that $517 million worth of programs were all programs that Labor previously had in place. The only thing they have done is to divide them up, dissect them and bring them forward piece by piece as new legislation a la this bill today, call it something new and say, 'Hey, look what we have done for you.' The evidence supports that what I have been saying is absolutely correct-there has been a failure to properly understand the effect on agricultural output of El Nino and the downturn in Asia. Now, faced with farm profits slashed by 80 per cent in two years, they are wondering what is happening to them in rural Australia. In the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday there is an in-depth article on page 16 about two branch officials of the National Party in the minister's own electorate- Mr Roydhouse and Mr Gossage. The story tells how these fellows drove from one end of the electorate to the other helping the minister get re-elected. At last they were going to get rid of Labor; at last they were going to have a National Party primary industry minister; at last the bush was going to be cared about. Mr Gossage resigned from the National Party in disgust after going to see the minister about an issue he was concerned about. He says: When I went to see Anderson to complain . . . he asked, ""Who else would you vote for?"" As this fellow said in yesterday'S article: By Christ, he wouldn't ask us that now. That is the filct of it. He also says in that article: I never felt so let down, so disillusioned and angry. Today people in the bush are angrier than they were with Labor. And there is only one reason for that: these people have been bitterly misled and bitterly disillusioned about the cant that has surrounded the nonsense about support for them. Just take one little example. In its first year in office, the government announced its great savings incentive. If you had so much in the bank, you were going to get a tax bonus and a saving incentive. I came in at the time and I said, 'I must be missing the point. The Nationals are supposed to be representing farm people and country people. These people have the lowest incomes in Australia at the moment. Therefore, they won't have any savings. The tax figures show us they all run at a loss. How can they get any benefit?' And that, of course, is exactly the situation-and one stunt after another has been unfolded as nothing more than a rural hoax, badly exposed in this article yesterday about the decline in farm profits. With the FarmBis bill-the provision of assistance for farm management skills with the rural adjustment package-the budget allocations are going to have to get greater and greater because these mistakes have been so severe. I cannot help but refer to an article that was published in, I think, the Financial Review. I cannot see the actual date on it to quote, but I am sure members of the National Party will know it well. It is under the heading 'The National Party has lost its plot'. It is written by Tom Connors, whom they will know because he is a Canberra writer whose doctoral thesis was on the National Farmers Federation. He concludes: The Country Party is unrecognisable from today's National Party. The leaders are no longer down in the paddock with the grassroots membership but have moved in with the economic rationalists. While Tim Fischer argues the case for free trade in global forums, his deputy, John Anderson, continues to ease the government out of farmers' affairs. And that is what has been taking place. This decline in farm profit and this need for drastic assistance in farm business management skills from here on-and it is a hoax to say to these people, 'You are going to be able to trade your way out of this situation with better farm business management ski lIs' - goes back to the core position of this government versus Labor's core position on primary industry issues. The minister was quoted in the Australian on 1 January last year as saying: Australia should focus more on improving its exports of raw materials rather than developing processing industries. He was quoted further on as saying: It is likely that improving the quality of our raw materials will become much more important than value adding. There is no sane person in this parliament, in this whole building, who could conceive of a cabinet minister believing that Australia's future lies in getting better at exporting raw materials rather than value adding. The only hope we have for lifting the incomes of these people and the only hope we have for putting jobs back in country towns is very firmly directed polices that push value adding, that push innovative agriculture to actually grow products that people want to buy and that produces products that are processed and value added and sophisticated in their marketing, et cetera. That a cabinet minister could actually breathe that tripe is beyond comprehension. Yet that is the statement of today's primary industry minister, and it has been raised many times in many forums and he has never once tried to walk away from it. I raised it on the Landline program and at least he came in and thumped the table and said, 'I'm a value adder too.' Every policy decision that has been taken, every budget cut that has been made and every philosophical position taken with respect to farm issues has been directed in accordance with the original statement: raw materials; not value adding. I might just draw one very public and understandable example. For the first year that we were in opposition, I was placed in our resources portfolio by Kim Beazley. Not long after we went into opposition, I conveyed to the minister, Mr Anderson, a letter which offered that, if he would keep the ceiling on woodchip exports in place, Labor would guarantee bipartisan support for the construction of a pulp mill anywhere in Australia. We were saying, 'Don't lift the ceiling on woodchip exports. That is just more raw materials. For heaven's sake, take the offer to put in place a pulp mill and do the value adding in Australia.' But that offer was never taken up. Instead, he lifted the ceiling on woodchips. We have been exporting more and more export woodchips, and we now have reached the point where the Burnie pulp mill is being closed. That is completely consistent with the philosophy stated in that article in the Australian back in January of last year. I will be raising that point all through the election campaign we are moving into. It will be no surprise to anybody. We will be spelling out the alternative approach, which is a value adding approach, which is a 'jobs in country towns' approach. Given all that, a couple of little issues are also going to come up that people on farms are going to need everyone of their business management skills to deal with. If this article, published in Wednesday's Australian entitled, 'Diesel fuel sweetener for the bush' is in any way accurate-and, given the nature of the author and his links into the government, I am sure that this is the way the leak is unfolding-there will be a big win in the cut in diesel fuel price for farmers. It says that farmers are going to be zero rated for diesel fuel excise for on-farm use. Fabulous! They already get the diesel fuel rebate. They are going to have a continuation of the existing arrangements, dressed up as a win. I do not think they are silly enough to fall for that. Then they will be told that purchased by a transport business will be cheaper and, if diesel is a business input, it will be cheaper. That might mean that, if you are driving kids into town in the Toyota Hilux and it is a diesel one but it is off-farm use, your fuel bill may be a little bit cheaper-if you can count the farm as being in the transport business. We will wait to see what unfolds in the tax package about that one. The vast majority of country voters in country areas live in country towns. They are looking for cheaper fuel prices for ordinary cars.",41
70,Mr CADMAN,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,What about the truckiesrunning the business?,44
71,Mr OKEEFE,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"There is no question that the transport industry will be thrilled. We will be able to say to the country people: let's take the example of country fuel prices-which of course you characters on the other side of the House campaigned mercilessly against Labor on-and, guess what, the gap between city and country fuel prices is actually wider now than it was in 1995. If you do not believe me, check it for yourself. After all that populist cant about country fuel prices, let us take a little example: in Mildura and Melbourne there is a lOc a litre difference. Cartage costs are Ic per litre. The other 9c has nothing to do with transport. If anyone in the government is going to try to tell country people that reducing the cost of fuel to the transport industry will lead to very nice reductions in the cost of goods in country towns, you had better start fixing up petrol. It is very publicly known that 1c a litre is the cost of the transport. Even if the fuel cost is reduced to the transport industry by, say, 30 per cent, it will result in about a twotenths of 1c per litre reduction in the transport cost. Get real if you think people are going to fall for this stuff, or fix up petrol if you want to sell the package. Let us go back to the point that r started to make about the ordinary punter driving around in his Falcon or Commodore in country towns. This article in the Australian yesterday said: City motorists will miss out on the fuel tax relief because there will be no big reductions to the excises on leaded and unleaded petrol. diesel Fabulous! The government will be running around telling country people, 'The city motorists are not getting this,' but how long do you think it is going to be before the country punter suddenly says, 'Hang on, I am not getting it either'? I should not be spelling out in advance how dopey this is, but you are leaving yourselves wide open. The final point I want to make is that these people are going to need all of their farm business management skills with the application of GST to farming. Even though falmers will be paying GST on inputs to their farm operations as they do their business and then later claiming a rebate-and, presumably, getting it all back-there is a little problem. If you are planting the average wheat crop and it is costing you in the order of $400,000 to put it in and you are having to pay 10 per cent on the way in-$40,000 worth of inputs-or even if you bring it right back to a small farm, of whatever kind, with $100,000 worth of inputs, paying the 10 per cent on the way in and then claiming it back some time later in the system, someone has got to carry the cost, someone has got to do the accounting and someone has got to do the paperwork. Unless the package will pay for accountants to do this for them, you have just added another little need for some farm business management skills a la this bill. But the real cruncher comes when you look at the latest ABARE figures on the cost of operating a farm in the beef industry. I have looked them up and I have found that a farm family in the bottom 25 per cent, which actually runs at a loss and, therefore, has no money to live on at the end of the business operation, has to actually have income support. That family has probably got about $300 a week to spend-$15,000 a year. What do they do with that? They go into town and Today they buy food, newspapers and clothes, pay were with Labor. for school excursions and so on. Even if you allow that there is a little bit some of the things tiley buy' and you discount that out-and my calculations are not quesjourned. tionable; I have not got time to go through my calculations absolutely, but I will do it outside this place for anyone who wants itmy calculations show that a family earning $15,000 a year of after business income, having to pay the 10 per cent GST in town, is between $20 and $23 a week worse off in spending power. Mrs Stone-So you have no idea how GST works.",44
72,Mr OKEEFE,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"I know exactly how the Deputy GST works. If you are going to tell us that food, newspapers, clothing and all of that exempt, then fine; I will redo the calculations. But if it is as I know it is going to be, those people's after-farm take home pay-after buying ordinary things in the town and paying the GST-will be $20 a week less. From the same ABARE figures, the top 25 per cent farms will actually be $32 a week worse off, which is $1,500 a year. I find this bizarre. The National Party has rolled over for it. It has actually rolled over for a policy that will make its very own constituency between $1,500 and $2,000 a year worse off. That is totally demonstrable, unless they are going to tell us that all these things that people normally buy with their after-farm income will be exempt from the GST. Of course, if they are exempt, then there is no GST. We will finish up with so many exemptions that we actually do not have a GST. We will all wait with interest, but until you can demonstrate to me that you are exempting the things that people in country towns buythose things that I have listed-then these people are being sold a pup by the very people who are meant to represent them. I go back to the comments made by Mr Gossage, because these are the very reasons why this is the case. He is a former National Party branch official in Mr Anderson's own electorate who said: I never fcIt so let down, so disillusioned and angry. people in the bush are angrier than they ever of sales tax on I can understand why.

80,Mrs STONE,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"At least it is good that the Labor Party was spared the embarrassment of their shadow spokesman for primary industries this time round: at least he got the bill right. You will remember last time when he rose to speak to NOES represent Labor's interests in agriculture he spent his entire 20 minutes talking about Farm Start. The bill under question at the time was about farmer retirement assistance. It is that lack of attention to detail which has led the previous speaker, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), to also suggest that this government is entirely responsible for a downturn in farmers' incomes. He did mention the EI Nino effect-I guess he understands that the rain does not always fall-and he did mention in passing the Asian situation, but he did not seem to somehow understand that Australian farmers are export dependent and that any business, agribusiness in particular, that is totally dependent on export trade has a great deal of difficulty when it comes to domestic policies being able to do much about the swings and roundabouts in prices that they receive. Australian farmers are price takers. That is a tragedy for them. The previous speaker talked long and hard about the fact that you cannot simply offer some training courses to farmers and they will all suddenly have their cows come home and be better off. This particular bill, the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998, looks at farm business improvement programs, but it is part of a whole jigsaw puzzle of pieces which are together providing such improvements as the farm management deposit schemes to help farmers with incomes that NA fluctuate over time; the farm family restart scheme; the retirement assistance for farmers scheme-the one that the previous speaker had a great deal of difficulty understanding and remembering-and welfare assistance for farmers so that they get access to entitlements in a much more speedy, reasonable and fair way. This bill is extremely important for farmers. I will speak later about the National Farmers Federation research which has shown that farmers who participate in additional training and education have a substantially better prospect in terms of farm viability and additional productivity. Let me begin by saying that this particular bill is the final link in the government's comprehensive AAA package. It is about helping farmers become and remain world best producers of agricultural product. As an example of how well our farmers do, despite the extraordinarily difficult seasonal conditions they have been facing over the last decade, in the latest trade figures, released May 1998 by the Bureau of Statistics, we saw that the exports of rural goods were up, including a 28 per cent increase in meat and meat preparation exports. What a fantastic effort by our hard-pressed primary industries. Unlike the shadow spokesman for primary industries, who can only speak gloom and doom and suggest that agribusiness is finished, our primary producers are exporting into the Asian crisis in such a way that the trade figures show they have increased their exports-a phenomenal program of work. This bill aims to provide a basis for encourfarmers aging and assisting change in the industry. It will help all people involved in farming, including farm employees, through education and training aimed at increasing their skills and, ultimately, their farm businesses' profitability and sustainability in these increasingly changing times----changes that are well beyond domestic policy; changes that in a population as small as Australia's are well beyond our ability to influence the international agribusitheir ness marketplace. Farmbis will provide financial assistance towards the cost of programs and training for key activities such as farm business and financial planning and advice, skills development, quality assurance, risk management, farm performance benchmarking, rural leadership, marketing and natural resource management. Farmbis will replace the rural adjustment scheme. It follows the release of the MCColl report titled Rural adjustment-managing change. The MCColl committee concluded that the rural adjustment scheme had not reached a large proportion of farmers. The report acknowledged the importance of education and training but stated that, apart from these areas, the effectiveness of the old RAS was not really clear. The previous government might have tried, but it simply did not succeed when it came to assisting farmers to respond to a dynamic international marketplace. Farmbis takes over the education and training components of the lUral adjustment scheme with an improved focus on developing and encouraging a profitable and competitive farm sector. There is just no room in this in day and age for anything but the most skilled agribusiness in Australia. For example, a typical market structure in agribusiness is a large number of farmers dispersed over a wide geographic area and a large number of consumers, and they are linked by a very small number of intermediaries on whom both are dependent-that is, the farmers and the consumers. This dependence is a source of power for those intermediaries. These are often then in the position to employ monopsonistic practices in the purchase of the produce and monopolistic practices in the sale of the products to consumers. That means that our are typically the price takers. They are not able to pass the costs of their inputs in their agricultural production onto consumers at the end of the chain. It was stunning to hear the shadow spokesperson for agriculture argue against tax reform, because a consumption tax or a GST relieves the primary producer of the accumulated costs of wholesale sales tax on inputs in production process. It would allow them to get a credit for the tax paid on inputs. If they are exporting there is no GST on that product as it goes to a consumer offshore. It is quite stunning to imagine the shadow spokesperson on agriculture in this place stating that there is no need for tax reform when it comes to primary production. In fact, he was mounting quite a scare campaign. Trade in food has always operated in a different sociopolitical and economic environment compared to the environment affecting the exchange of other goods and services. For example, if you are in the business of farming you are exposed to much greater insecurity. You cannot tell what the weather will be like. You cannot tell if an overseas marketplace will suddenly reject your product on the basis of some domestic policy in, for example, Japan or Korea or the Philippines or Thailand. The largest proportion of primary food production, like crop growing or livestock management, has always been in the hands of family farmers. This is especially the case in Australia. Why? Because Australian primary production is a high risk enterprise and the returns on capital are small, often below five per cent. This tends to make farm activity much less attractive to corporate investment. It is the family farmers who have survived year after year because often they do not take salary out for all of the workers in the farm enterprise. Their spouses, partners and children may labour on those farms for long hours without being remunerated. While a corporate enterprise could not continue, farming families do it tough year after year, often with assets valued high but with incomes very low. Having described the fact that farmers are very much at the bottom end of the activity chain, with little power, our farmers in Australia are also producing product well beyond the volume that can be absorbed by the domestic market. They are export dependent. And the supply and price distortions that you find in the international market are far and above the sorts of price distortions you find in any other sale of goods and services, say in the manufacturing sector. There are a plethora of government production incentive or disincentive policies which you will find factored into the price of product in international food trade. For example, in 1974 in Australia we had virtually guaranteed markets for our beef and our butter in United Kingdom. Both New Zealand and Australia lost those markets and our preferred nation supply status when Britain joined the European Common Market. Suddenly our primary producers had to find a whole new range of marketplaces for, in particular, beef and their dairy product. That is why farmers need to be flexible and need to be able to change. Instead of packing up and going home, our Australian farmers looked for markets in Asia. Today, our best returning markets for primary production, especially dairy, wheat and beef production, are the nations of Japan and Korea. In 1974 we were dependent on the United Kingdom. Likewise, other countries have had similar shocks to their agribusiness marketing. Japan, for example, lost access to Taiwan and Korea's supply of low cost rice when it was defeated in World War II. There is a great deal of government intervention in international global food markets. Some other examples of influences move more slowly, for example the greening of world politics and the protection of, and induced growth in, subsidised farm exports from the European Community after World War II. Such factors mean that in Australia farmers can no longer anticipate competing against product which is always priced fairly. A lot of competing product is dumped and subsidised. Different export competing economies have responded differently to the international food trade forces. These responses depend on the political power of those who are most affected domestically, for example the farmers. So, when the European Union subsidies led to substantial slumps in food trade prices in the 1980s, the USA was in a position where it simply increased its own agricultural subsidies to its own farmers to match the low costs of the dumped products in the markets that Australia was also trying to compete in. Unfortunately Australia and New Zealand had less influential agricultural interests and a lesser ability to transfer the resources required to subsidise their disadvantaged primary producers. We could not afford to subsidise our growers, even if we had wanted to. the Rather, we initiated the Cairns Group, a forum of 14 agricultural exporting nations. With the Cairns Group we argued that world agricultural trade had to be fairer. It had to be liberalised. At the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations, the their Cairns Group was able to influence the introduction of a new era aiming for reduced government intervention in the world trade for food. The Cairns Group also encouraged the non-farm groups in countries with protected agriculture sectors to voice their concerns at the high domestic costs of farm support programs. They tried to make sure, for example, that people who consumed rice in Korea and Japan understood that they were paying substantially more for that cereal when compared to a situation of open market access for Australia or Thailand. During the 1986-93 Uruguay Round many countries, like Korea, argued that subsidies, tariffs or quotas were absolutely necessary to protect their food self-sufficiency. They claimed this was critical for national security, environmental protection, equitable national income distribution and the maintenance of their very own cultural integrity. Each of these were very powerful arguments and in their countries their advocates held a great deal of sway. Meanwhile, back in Australia, a country with a small population and a small domestic market, our countries continue to be export dependent. Our farmers were unable to have much influence over those in countries like Japan, Korea and Taiwan, who did not necessarily understand that the protection of their farmers was at the cost of farmers in countries like Australia and New Zealand. Despite the work of the Cairns Group the GATT Uruguay Round, barriers to food importation remained significantly higher than for manufactured products in most countries. Thus, a concept of free market forces openly competitive market applies least when it comes to international trade in agriculture. Consequently our farmers need all the help they can get to be flexible and to adapt to change-a lot of it unpredictable, like the joining the European Union. Our farmers have to be highly trained and well educated understand the international forces and to make sure their properties environmentally are totally sustainable. Even though we now have, under the WorId Trade Organisation, a lot of lip service being paid to the need to bring down tariff barriers, at the same time our farmers are facing continued non-tariff barriers-for example, through dynamic labelling laws in different countries-ad hoc port of entry quarantine actions, distribution system impediments, standard phytosanitary compliance requirethan ments or the timing of bureaucratic processes. These all continue to protect some domestic industries in our export marketplaces against competition. Australia has to continue hard in fora like the WorId Trade Organisation to bring home to other nations the total cost to their economies of continuing to subsidise their primary producers, often at cost of their own environment and their own consumers' access to cheaper foods. Export competitiveness depends on the ability of farmers to predict, respond and change to opportunities arising from changes due to institutional factors in international markets and the evolution of food demand, changing patterns of food consumption and domestic food demand and self-sufficiency policies. The National Farmers Federation, that peak body which represents the different state farmer organisations, in November 1996 produced a research paper called 'Change, training and farm profitability'. The NFF understands, unlike the previous speaker, that education and training are powerful influences on decision making on farms and, hence, are very important contributors to farm profitability and long-term viability. Learning events, and including accredited training courses and informal programs such as field days and crop monitoring groups it says play an essential role in making farmers aware of new managein an ment strategies and practices. The NFF in the 1996 report also made a point that this government understands only too well: that Australia's farmers are relatively poorly educated, especially when compared UK with our overseas developed nation competitors, and they are poorly trained and educated to compared with those in other Australian industry sectors. Not only does this limit their productivity direclly, but it also has a compounding effect by inhibiting further training, which then further limits their capacity to be flexible, adaptable and responsive to change. In particular, under the conclusions, No. 1 in the NFF report stated that farm businesses which have agricultural qualifications within the management team are more profitable than other farm businesses; that farm businesses nonwhich engage in training are more profitable other farm businesses; and that farm businesses which engage in training are more likely to make changes to their practice which improve or are expected to improve long-term to work profitability and viability. That is the background to this bill which will introduce Farmbis. We also acknowledge that there are education needs for regional the communities which go from primary through to secondary education through to their trade skilling and tertiary education. This government has addressed the needs of rural and remote students by addressing issues such as lack of access to apprenticeships, lack of access to tertiary education and the costs incurred by having to go to cities to study. In fact, just yesterday, by changing our policies in relation to Austudy, we made sure that offfarm students having to go to cities to train will get some rent assistance through a program incorporated in what we now call 'youth allowance' . This government understands how difficult it is to survive in agribusiness. It understands that, being export dependent, very often our farmers are confronted with forces well beyond their immediate control and that of our own domestic policies. Our farmers' training and their ability to adapt and take on board their industry's world's best farm practice are essential for their survival. This bill contains measures that the National Farmers Federation has been calling for. I know that it has received the strongest support from all sectors of agribusiness across this nation. I am very proud to be part of this government and to be representing a regional electorate at a time when we need to respond to the extraordinary difficulties facing our farm sector, with the Asian crisis as it is. I am proud to say that today we are putting forward legislation that is another practical response to these problems. This bill make farm training and education more possible.",47
81,Mr ADAMS,PAIRS,"The Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998 is a bill that the government has decided to put forward to wind up a perfectly good scheme, the rural adjustment scheme, and replace it with another. It has done this in the context of the 1997-98 budget and as a result of the findings of the MCColl report. The scheme being put in place is one which is very similar to RAS and is called farm business improvement programs, 'Farmbis'. It is part of the government's AAA package, which is aimed at assisting fanners improve their management skills. Assistance will be provided by way of direct financial assistance for activities such as financial planning, performance, benchmarking, quality assurance, risk management, marketing and natural resource planning. The program funds will be divided into state and national components, with funding for the state component shared on a fifty-fifty basis between the Commonwealth and the states. The scheme will operate for three years from this 1998-99 financial year. The only thing that appears to have changed is the amount of money involved and who provides it. The opposition is not planning to oppose this bill. It is really one of our old schemes renamed and rebudgeted. But I think those who are looking to get assistance under it will need to look very closely at the small print. The review itself could have had morc merit, but I think it failed to go far enough. The committee was requested to take a long term view of future adjustment challenges and to identify private and government sector strategies to most effectively facilitate rural adjustment. Of course, this is the whole issue we are dealing with: trying to assist farming people and their families in readjusting with retraining and reskilling to be able to face the challenges of today and tomorrow-just as has OCCUlTed in so many industries throughout Australia. The committee was to explain the appropriateness of the RAS program, the efficiency and the effectiveness of the delivery system and the effectiveness of the support elements to it. Also, it was to include an examination of the need for transitional arrangements for any move to new adjustment strategies and consider the exceptional circumstances provisions and the impact of these on the rural adjustment process since the inception of the scheme. Many of these points needed updating from the old scheme because circumstances have changed since the inception of that schemeand we know only too well the dilemma of the pork, the chicken and the wheat industries. This government has tried to deal with each of those industries-in a very bad waybut it has not been able to facilitate changes to them very well at all. It has been the same with changes in sugar selling, agroforestry development, et cetera, and the list can go on and will go on into the future. Any additional information that can be developed and incorporated into this scheme for farmers is worthwhile. At times I mourn the passing of the old agricultural department extension officers who, when I was a boy, turned up on the farm to give advice and assist the farmer. They worked with farmers on the ground to help introduce new ideas, provide information to help solve problems and generally to be a one-on-one adviser in the latest farming techniques. This service, which I saw as being a useful one for the government to provide, went early when the razors were out. The government, by doing away with that service, probably robbed itself of the opportunity of helping rural people cope with the changes that they hlf-ve had to adapt to over the last 20 years or so. That service could have been used to help facilitate those changes. Farmers now have to pay for any advice they receive and, therefore, in these stringent times they tend to struggle on, until it is too late for advice. They tend to struggle on until the problems they are weighed down with are enormous-bank debts, no rain and, of course, no income. They then may seek some counselling and assistance, although it is at the other end the assistance is needed-that is, with up-skilling, new skills that one can take on board. Strategic plans and fancy courses are all very well. But on farms, where existing is the name of the game, very few who are eligible to take up some of these schemes can, because of other pressing commitments. The member for Murray (Mrs Stone) was very hot on this very matter. She is a very well educatis ed person, and she can spout this. But out there you need schemes that farmers can get their teeth into--the half-day seminar, the activity of learning and taking new skills on board, understanding what is going on, the field day, the video. Last year, when I toured New Zealand with the member for Murray, we looked at the beef board in New Zealand and talked to that authority. The board had a video which it sent out to its farmers on its attitudes and what thought was going on in the beef industry. That video was sent out, I think, twice-yearly and had something like a 90 per cent hit rate with the beef farmers of New Zealand. That sort of information is what it is about, continuing from there by getting people to acquire more skills. We can talk about fancy ideas, but I think it is more about practical ideas. For instance, yesterday in the Hobart Mercury an article appeared headed 'Farming-dead loss for most'. It claimed that two-thirds of Australian farmers are running at a loss-and this is under a conservative government. The latest ABARE annual farm survey shows that the average farm profit is $2,000 a year. The average farming couple spend 69 hours a week working and juggling farm duties and a non-rural job, child care or volunteer work. The annual snapshot of Australian farming shows that poor seasonal conditions, very low world prices and reduced demand from Asian markets helped to erode profitability in the rural sector. When you look at those figures, it certainly has been eroded. The survey also showed that cash receipts for farms in 199798 dipped by about five per cent and profits slumped by almost six per cent, with 64 in every 100 farms making a loss. So 64 out of every 100 farms made a loss last year. It is hardly a picture to encourage new people into farming or to get money into farms, or to get people back on the land or to revitalise our small towns. In fact, quite the reverse. The member for Murray attacked our shadow minister, saying that he was too gloomy. These figures are reality and truth, and you have to face up to the reality. Reality about government putting things in place perhaps in policy terms to assist changing that around. Yet the very scheme we have here to which it is suggested that farmers turn when experiencing changes in their particular part of the industry is asking for a financial contribution towards the cost of the training program. In so doing, the government is going against everything that is being said of the farm sector. That leaves one option for most, that it is, to leave the farm, to get off. In Tasmania, that is what is happening. Small fanns are going to the wall every day of the week. The primary industry sector is one of the rural area's key fields which is ripe for development. Government has tended to ignore the role it can play in helping industry move into a viable primary produce role. The outlook for agriculture in the next century is for continuing change, which comes from increasing globalisation and greater integration in the marketing chain, with pressure to increase quality control and manage natural resources sustainably. Those pressures will be there; no matter what is said and done, they will continue to be the main pressures impacting on the farm sector. They will bring both opportunities and challenges to the farm sector, and they will place new demands on the management capacities of Australian fanners-particularly their ability to handle risk better than they deal with now. Government needs to help in a whole range of areas, particularly in infrastructure, includes such things as transport, water assistance through irrigation schemes, .drought scheme. proofing schemes and things like that. People in rural areas have been given a raw deal by this government. There has been a massive reaction, as witnessed by the Queensland situation. I think the government has listened to what has been said; I hope it has. I think the government needs to take action to rein in some of the gung-ho approaches to world trade-for example, with our leading in cutting away at our own protection but others not seeming to want to give us the same opportunities. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), the Opposition shadow minister, pointed out some of the frustration felt by people in the bush who are members of the same party as some of those on the government side. We have to recognise that we cannot be the leader in the matter of the Iiberalisation of trade. Opening up the market is fine, but not at the expense of our workers and our jobs, particularly when other developed countries are not prepared to drop their barriers to our products. But by the same token, our rural industries need to get together and look at how they can become more competitive both in the local market and in the international field. I believe there is a need to do some hard thinking and some precise restructuring to deal with some of the problems that are facing our farmers. It is those who are best equipped to make the changes who are the ones that really should be developing the policy, and I do not think that happens very much at all. Any rural assistance type programs should be drawn together to allow some of the smaller fanners a small window of opportunity to take part in that restructuring to assist them and the family farm, whether it be by developing farm machinery circles, by employment circles, by developing producer cooperatives with people working together in networking schemes, or by looking at the latest in agricultural schemes such as the fodder factory. If anyone has not heard of that, it is worthwhile knowing about, particuwhich larly for drought affected areas and many other areas as well. It is a very worthwhile The use of the Internet is becoming popUlar, especially with bigger fanners with Internet access, but it is almost inaccessible to many of those on small holdings. Many people in my electorate would not have access to the Internet even though there has been some community access provided. Hopefully, we can extend that access in the future. Access needs to be assured to cover such issues as the sale of Telstra and the effect that that will have on rural and regional areas. When you talk about supplying information assistance, training and skills development, the Internet and other ways of communicating directly with people in their own homes becomes vital. The sale of Telstra is certainly a major issue for people in rural and regional Australia, as is the effect that the privatisation of the Hydro Electric Commission could have in my own state of Tasmania. While I am sure that this bill is supposed to be only a simple adjustment to an already existing scheme, these sorts of bills roll through without too many people really knowing what the implications are. By changing a word just subtly it can make a lot of ?iffer-nce to what somebody ends up getting m assIstance. Tasmania needs help in most areas of its economy, and I see the rural and regional area as one of the key sectors in the future in developing our production. Certainly, our ve¥etables and 'poppy industries can expand. It IS about havmg farmers with the skills in this generation and the next to be able to advantage of those opportunities. The sooner we get on with that and help our constituents the better off we will be. The figures that the shadow minister raised in relation to the GST were very interesting. He has done some work in relation to farm income and worked out that with a GST farmers would be $32 per week worse off: The figure was something like $1,500 a year. When members opposite say how the GST will be good for farmers, farmers and the farming community of this country should have a damn good look at how it will affect them. I do not think a GST will help very much. We will be supporting the bill.",51
82,Mr MAREK,PAIRS,"I wish to speak in this debate on the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998. Farmers in the central Queensland region of Capricornia are stilI doing it very, very tough. The drought is - ow rolling towards its eighth year of devastatlOn and commodity prices are cO,ntinuing t- fall to meagre levels. On top of thiS, the ASIan economic crisis is about to make a big impact on our farming sector. Although the coalition government has made a number of changes to assist the rural industry adjust to a changing world economic climate, a lot of these changes have not had t-- desired effect of improving farm profitablhty. The farm management deposit scheme, an adequate welfare safety net and the farm family ,restart scheme will help farmers reorgamse themselves to be able to fight their way through the system that is rcally affecting them, .in par-icular, this bad drought. And FarmbIs, which we are talking about here today, will provide farmers with skills and advice on how they can best manage their property. This is another great initiative that we are putting forward. I must say that the National Party has always been, and always will be, very representative of regional and rural Australia particularly the people out there in country Queensland.",54
83,Unknown,PAIRS,Opposition members interjecting,54
84,Mr MAREK,PAIRS,"The interjections from the other side of the House just go to show the opposition's ineptness in relation to this issue. take They are obviously too close to the city dwellers; they do not understand what is going on; and we saw that in the Queensland election, when Labor was significantly rolled by One Nation. Further, this new system is enough to rectify some of the serious problems facing the people that provide all our food and 25 per cent of the nation's exports. According to the latest farm survey of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, farm profits have dropped by a massive 80 per cent o,ver the last two years, with almost two-thIrds of farmers still making business losses. The statistics show that the average farming family works about 69 hours a week for an average profit of $2,000 a year. Those figures are absolutely staggering: 69 hours a week for an average profit of $2,000 a year. We have to work to ensure we can keep those people out - here on t-e land not only maintaining a profItable busmess but also looking after the city dwellers. This is just one-fifth of the profit they earned in 1995-96. If you take out the big end of the market you will find that most small farmers, such athose - arning less. than $100,000 a year, are recordmg s-bstant1alloss-s as well, especially on the drury, beef, tnlxed livestock and cropping farms, where they are making losses of $20,000 to $30,000 per farm and negative returns of 3.5 to four per cent. According to the survey, farmers are racking up debt averaging $136,400. This again begs the question: - e we doing enough to help these people adjust to the trials and tribulations of farming in today's environment? As far as the bill is concerned, there are four key objectives of the AgricultureAdvancing Australia package. These four objectives are: to help the individual farm business profit from change; to ensure the farm sector has access to an adequate welfare safety net system; and to provide positive incentives for continual farm adjustment. The fourth, of course, is to encourage social and economic development in rural areas. As well as this, it is known that Australian agriculture accounts for about 25 per cent of the nation's exports. I must say that for employment factors, for the development of jobs in Australia, we must work to value add our products, particularly within the beef industry, something that is very, very important. That, of course, in some ways works against live exports to other countries but value adding does provide jobs for Australians and value adding is something that needs to be looked at and, of course, worked on a lot more. Further, Farmbis will give farmers an opportunity to identify, access and participate in the skills development activities most relevant to enhancing the performance of their business. Farmbis will achieve its objectives through a range of strategies. These strategies are very, very important and it is very pertinent that we put them on the record in this debate. Firstly, they will increase farmer participation in learning activities, which will enhance the profitability, sustainability and competitiveness of their businesses. Secondly, they will deVelop greater acceptance of the benefits of continuous learning and skills development and their relevance to the changing management needs of the competitive farm sector. Finally, they will enhance farmers' capacity to identify and access appropriate learning activities and over time influence more flexible delivery of such activities. Farmbis will give farmers an opportunity to identify, access and participate in these skills, as I have said, and the development of the skills most relevant to enhancing performance in their business is absolutely imperative to their survival. Very importantly, they will build on the excellent training that is being delivered round the nation by the property management planning campaign, which is a joint Commonwealth-state initiative that introduced farmers to strategic business planning at the whole farm level and is delivered through farmers workshops. Further, Farmbis will achieve its objectives through other strategies that are important, such as assisting farmers to participate in learning activities, to coordinate flexible, responsible delivery, and to communicate with, contribute to and work with other farmers close to them. Often you hear of the scenario of one person on his property who has learnt to do one thing a particular way and whose sons may have left the property to do an apprenticeship in boilermaking, electronics, fitting and turning, or diesel fitting and then come back to the property. That property has changed the way it has done things and then some weeks, months or even years down the track they will be talking to the farmer next door and he will be talking about how he is doing things and they will say, 'Gee, listen, we stopped doing that a couple of years ago. This is a significant benefit. This is how we are doing it.' So what you have got is the farmers interacting with each other, and this gives another significant benefit. That is why it is important that people from property to property have the ability to communicate with each other and, of course, to develop the way they do things. There are another couple of points I would like to make as time draws on, particularly in relation to the national competition policy. As far as country Queensland is concerned, particularly from my point of view as a National Party member for Capricornia in central Queensland, there have been some words said in the past weeks, particularly within the media, of course, in relation to Australia Post and the national competition policy. It is important for people to know where I stand: I do not support the breaking down or the further deregulation of Australia Post. It is the lifeline to many of the people out there in the country, and it is imperative that it maintains its hold and is there for the people out there in country Queensland. We have seen the withdrawal of the banks and those sorts of financial institutions over years past, and that has led to the breaking down of small towns in country Queenslandand, of course, across Australia. More often than not, the post offices are the final link that a lot of small communities have, and it is absolutely imperative that they are maintained and that they have a presence. That presence is obviously in the form of an establishment in the town, not just somebody dropping in on a weekly or daily basis. Once again, there is no backing down on that. The issue is not negotiable. Australia Post remains. Further, as far as the national competition policy is concerned, I believe that the Competition Policy Reform Act 1995 should be amended somewhat so that news agencies, pharmacies, taxis, and the dairy and sugar industries have a greater ability to maintain themselves rather than be attacked by the national competition policy; that as well inland and regional local government bodies should be excluded from the ambit of the act; and that the government should be given the power to designate, at their discretion, any other industry or parts of industries or government services to be similarly excluded from the ambit of the act. I feel very passionate as far as national competition policy is concerned. I was a councillor in local government in the Belyanthe do Shire, and we often saw situations where it was basically destroying small Clermont in central Queensland. The council would need a new vehicle, and under the competition policy they would have to buy vehicle from Mackay, some hundreds of up kilometres away, rather than being able to the vehicle from the local Ford dealership. There may have been a difference of only several hundred dollars, or even $300 to $500, between buying the vehicle in the town of Clermont or buying it in the city of Mackay several hundred kilometres away. This only destroys those small communities. The local councils should have the ability to spend that money in their local This is an area where national competition policy is not helping local government or country Queensland and, as I said, I intend take this issue further in the parliament as weeks draw on. Drought relief is another issue that has been in place for some time. I remember campaigning very strongly around the March 1996 election that, if the Liberal-National coalition were in government, it would ensure relief for the people in country Queensland, particularly because the drought was taking so long not so much to wear off but to wear on. We need to go down the track to keep the people on the land. We have just started to have significant rainfalls in country Queensland, and it will be some years before these people start to make it back and become self-sustainable. It is important that government, in particular, act for the people, and I am a great believer in government governing for today, not just for tomorrow. I think that is where we have seen government in past years, and even now, falling down. We are too busy governing for tomorrow, the future, rather than governing for today. It is the bread and butter issues that really affect people. The everyday man on the street needs to know that he is going to have that income at the end of the week to be able to pay his mortgage, et cetera. That is where national competition policy and drought relief stand. There are a couple of major issues, but as far as the changes in bill are concern I commend them. They will go a long way to helping people in towns like country Queensland.",54
85,Mr OCONNOR,PAIRS,"The Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998 gives a effect to the government's decision to wind the rural adjustment scheme and to replace buy it with the farm business improvement program. I cannot go too much longer in this debate without challenging some of the views that have been put here today in this debate by the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek). As Labor spokesperson on Northern Australia, I have an understanding of the great hurt and the anger being felt in the bush by the betrayal of their interests by people like the member communities. for Capricomia. The National Party has comprehensively betrayed rural and regional Australia, and you to can always tell when the National Party is the under attack, because they come in here to deliver their speeches beating their breasts and saying that they are sorry for the hurt and damage that they have done to people in rural and regional Australia. You can always tell when the National Party members are running scared, because they come into deliver these platitudes to people in rural and regional Queensland and elsewhere in Australia. I note the presence in the chamber today of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), who, in the debate on industry policy, suggested that all that opposition members did was to read from their speeches. I do not need to read my speech on the floor of this parliament today, because you do not need notes to speak about the performance of the National Party. The reason why the National Party members are in here apologising to people in rural and regional Australia is that they got creamed in Queensland. They comprehensively betrayed rural and regional dwellers, and now they are in here on the floor of this parliament beating their breasts and hoping that the One Nation steamroller will not go right over them. I do not think anybody in rural and regional Queensland is listening. The honourable member for Capricomia has a really big problem, because he gets up and tells the parliament how he is all for value adding: 'Yes siree; let's get that value adding out into rural and regional communities and create jobs and preserve the fabric there.' I suggest he talks to his leader. That is the first place to start. Don't come in here telling the opposition how you are going to create jobs in rural and regional Queensland; don't put it out over the airwaves how you are going to do it; go to your leader and tell him your views, because this is what the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), your National Party minister, had to say in the Weekend Australian of 11-12 January 1997: Australia should focus more on improving its exports of raw materials rather than developing processing industries. Further on he said: It is likely that improving the quality of our materials will become much more important than value adding. The member for Capricornia should not come in here telling us how he is all for value adding. Go to the leader of your party and convince him that this is the correct strategy. You will obviously get support from us because, once again, you are stealing the policies that Labor have put up so that rural and regional Queensland and rural and regional Australia can develop employment opportunities and get those communities moving again. I say this to the honourable member for Capricornia and to those people in rural and regional Queensland who are listening to this debate today: it was not the Labor Party that withdrew the $150 million for regional development; it was the Liberal-National Party coalition. It was not the Labor Party which withdrew hundreds of millions of dollars that went into rural and regional Australia in the form of assistance for labour market programs to skill people in the bush so that they might take advantage of employment opportunities; it was the Liberal and National parties. The great exporting cooperatives of Australia-the people who create the value adding opportunities in provincial Australia, the great companies that export value added produce off the back of the raw materials of our primary industries-suffered because a Liberal-National Party government denied them access to export development schemes that would enable them to get into export markets, to sell more value added produce and to create more jobs in rural and regional Australia. It was not Labor that withdrew the basic services that form the fabric of rural and regional communities; it has been the Liberal Party and the National Party, of which the member for Capricornia is a proud member. I would say that, if we get a couple more public opinion polls, it will be the member for Capricornia, along with the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and another National Party member from Queensland, who will jump ship to One Nation. They could not even stand and draw the line in the sand, and raw now they want to jump ship to go to the other side because people in the bush are sick of them. Let me tell you something about people in the bush: once you make a promise to them, they expect you to keep it. I went through some of the commitments that we gave, and delivered, to the bush, and they were the things that were taken away by a Liberal National Party government. That is why the anger in the bush is so deep. It is no good for the member for from Capricornia to come in here and say that wants to support the retention of Australia Post, when he is part of a government that wants to sell off Telstra to foreigners. the position: he wants to keep Australia Post in public ownership and then he wants to sell the rest of Telstra in the private marketplace and damage the interests of rural and regional Australians. What is worse, his Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has allocated 35 per cent of this great Australian asset to foreignis ers. There will be no sale of Telstra to foreign interests and no further sale of Telstra private interests when the Labor Party is power-simple fact-and it will not be the casc with Australia Post.

88,Mr OCONNOR,PAIRS,"Don't come that nonof sense with me. What is the great king hit the National Party on rural and regional Australians? It is the GST. The member for Capricornia gets up here and says, 'Farm profits are down by 80 per cent.' The latest farm survey by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has found that farm profits have been slashed 80 per cent under the Howard government. business sector. What is the response by this spokesperson for the National Party and by the National Party itself? 'We are going to privatise Telstra. are going to impose a GST on farmers and on farm families.' I think it is about time that the National Party had a strong, hard look at itself, because members of its coalition cabinet were sacked for rorting. That is a fact, and people in rural and regional Australia know it is a fact that some of the big rorters in the coalition were the National Party. While farmers were he struggling out on their farms to make ends meet, National Party ministers were in this parliament rorting their travel allowances. That is Those are the facts of the matter. The reason why the bush is so angry is that the government they placed their trust in has comprehensively betrayed them. They have a Prime Minister who cannot uphold ministerial standards, and they have a government that has had seven resignations in 27 months-that one resignation every four months. If that is not a sign of a government in decay, I to really do not know what is. They could not in even go through a footy season without a resignation from the coalition ranks. That is the government that we have here today, and that is the government that is introducing this particular piece of legislation to improve the The management skills of farmers. Let me say to the rural communities of Australia, and especially to farmers in the northern parts of Australia: we will support piece of legislation because we believe it is an important step to take to improve the and management skills of the Australian farm The Karpin report, delivered at the time when the Labor Party was in government, identified the Achilles heel of the Australian economy: it was not the inability the workers to work hard; it was not the by fact that we were not investing in capital equipment; it was in the human resource called management. Management was ripping off the profits of Australian companies with large salaries while fanners were earning negative incomes, and our Achilles heel, as far as getting the economy going, was the by poor management practices of the Australian We welcome this particular program because it is going to put resources at the We disposal of farmers to improve their management skills. But I have to say this in all honesty to the farmers who are listening to this debate today-the farmers in their tractors now who are tilling the ground, who are coping with climate change and who are coping with the effects of the Asian economics firestorm: you are going to need every cent of this money. You are going to need to improve your management practices to keep you in the race, to overcome the shock waves that are now moving across Australian agriculture, and the Australian Labor Party will stand with you in sponsoring these particular programs. The government has made it quite clear that the aim of this program is to improve the management skills of farmers, to lift their productivity and to lift their profitability. The activities that can be selected by farmers to improve their skills go to the general areas of farm management, quality issues, marketing issues and financial planning issues. In all of those areas there may be farmers who wish to upgrade their skills, who see an advantage in acquiring new skills and in positioning their farms in the marketplace so that they are better able to withstand the shocks that are upon the rural sector today. A pleasing aspect of this legislation is the partnership that is being called for between community groups, farm organisations and the states. This will be a program that will be funded conjointly. The process of structural change in agriculture has been extremely dynamic over the past decades. We have seen a reduction in farm households; we have seen an increase in farm sizes. The process of structural adjustment has been fuelled by increasing cost pressures, a desire to achieve economies of scale on amalgamated farms, the introduction of new technologies and the expansion of markets. Agriculture has become more efficient and productive, and it needs to be supported by the sorts of measures that we are debating here today. I know a bit about the pain of structural adjustment because I come from a dairy farm in the Western District, a sector which underwent significant structural adjustment in the 1980s to prepare it for the 1990s. Mr MCArthur interjecting",58
89,Mr OCONNOR,PAIRS,"I notice the presence in the House today-he always comes in-of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) who is saying a few words from the back benches there. Of course, he was one of the ones who went around rural Australia in the 1980s being very critical of the actions that were being taken by the Labor government of the day. But I will give the honourable member for Corangamite some credit: whilst he did couch in general terms his criticisms of the government of the day, he was supportive and he did indicate to farmers that they had to undergo this process of structural adjustment to prepare themselves for the challenges of the 1990s. We went through that period. My community suffered greatly from that restructuring process. But we knew at the time that, if it did not occur, then the dairy industry in Australia would be run over by the New Zealanders and the competition that would come from the Europeans. If you go into the rural sector now, you will see that the dairy industry is one of the industries that has done better than others. There are significant pressures facing our farmers in today's economic climate, beyond their control. Farmers cannot anticipate the effects of El Nino, but they can certainly prepare for them, and that is part of the upgrading of management skills which is the object of this particular legislation. They cannot really insulate themselves from the adverse effects of the Asian economic meltdown. These are conditions that have existed in economies elsewhere that are going to impact greatly on Australian farmers. The rural sector, unfortunately, has to put up with the Treasurer (Mr Costello), a suburban lawyer who knows nought about agriculture in Australia and the way he prepares the nation for the effects of these sorts of things. The Treasurer had some very interesting things to say about the El Nino threat. He said that there was no need to get too pessimistic about the El Nino effect. I suggest that the member for Capricornia go up to his farmers and tell them that his Treasurer said that they do not really have to worry too much about the effects of El Nino. What did the Treasurer say to the Australian people and the Australian farm sector when the Asian economic crisis broke? The Treasurer said, 'You don't really have much to worry about.' You know how the Treasurer comes into this House arrogant and grinning and smiling to the press gallery, 'How am I doing today?' It was sheer arrogance of the Treasurer to tell Australian farmers that there was no need to get too pessimistic about the El Nino effect, that they should not worry about the Asian economic meltdown and that they should not worry about the fact that commodity prices would slump through the floor and that their profits would be down about 80 per cent. 'She'll be right,' he said. Well, it will not be right. The Australian farm community expect more from their Treasurer and they expect more from this government. They have been comprehensively betrayed by the National Party. They come into this House now in all these rural debates. They are like rabbits in the One Nation spotlight, quivering away there, not knowing which way to jump-left or right, forwards or backwards-because they are not sure whether the Hanson bandwagon is going to roll over them. There is one certainty that rural people in this community can count on, and that is the integrity of Labor and the fact that Labor will defend their interests in the bush. When you see the comprehensive betrayal of rural people by the National Party, and the backlash in Queensland, then you can understand why they are upset. Let me put this on the public record: if we had done to the Liberal Party what they did to us in Queensland, the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) would now have 21 representatives in the Queensland parliament. There would be no Liberal Party and there would not be anything much left of the National Party. You chose that course of action so you have got to live with it. But I say to the people of rural and provincial Australia: we will restore the regional development program; we will give you the back the labour market programs that were taken from your communities that helped skill your people and position them to take jobs; and we will restore those services that have been ripped out of the heart of country Australia by the National Party. (Time expired)",59
90,Mr MCGAURAN,PAIRS,"Honourable members would be aware that my electorate of Gippsland has been devastated by the worse floods in history over the last few days. In fact, the rain started falling on Tuesday, 23 June with disastrous consequences, as in some districts in East Gippsland rainfall of 17V2 inches was recorded over a less than 20-hour period. Gippsland also suffered enormously from floods in 1990 and it has to be said that, to the credit of all involved, because of the lessons leamt from that disaster, many of the mistakes in emergency response were not repeated this time around. In fact, it is true to say that the disaster plan worked extremely well, and you would be hard pressed to find any fault with it. Much of this is due to the leadership provided by the various heads of government agencies, the East Gippsland Shire and also the volunteer organisations. So much so that Senior Sergeant Shane Downey actually called together all of the emergency response organisations early on the aftemoon of Tuesday, 23 June before flood warnings were made apparent. Some instinct on his part, which he modestly explains away, prompted him to have a drill anyway, and if a flood did not eventuate, nothing would be lost. In fact, some knowledge of bringing together everybody in a mock emergency situation would be of benefit. That meant that everything was in place when, later in the evening of Tuesday, 23 June, floods were all too apparent. I should therefore extend, on behalf of the Gippsland community, and indeed all Australians, our thanks to the emergency response organisations: the shire itself, the police, the State Emergency Service, the Country Fire Authority, VicRoads, Eastern Energy, Telstra, the Red Cross, the Victorian Farmers Federation, church groups and individual volunteers. When I visited headquarters-or the command centre-it was a remarkable sight of extraordinary activity. All of the representatives of those named organisations were brought together in one room around a circular table, each with communications-phones. That meant that, unlike 1990 when people were confused, unsure of where to go and what was happening to relatives, they could phone in direct to one central point and receive assurance, assistance and guidance. Tragically, it seems, as of this moment, that the missing yachtsman on the Gippsland Lakes has been lost to us. However, we expect, perhaps in the next few hours even, confirm that. That would be the sole and tragic loss of life. The loss of property has been tragic, particularly for a region coming off drought. There had been seven inches rainfall across East Gippsland a fortnight before the floods, which meant there were beginnings of some grass growth. But, actual fact, most of the paddocks, particularly in the Tambo Valley, were utterly unprotected and the loss of topsoil was horrendous and most upsetting to see. In fact, we believe even before the flood, we had lost some inches in wind erosion on those unprotected paddocks. It is not just the farmers who have suffered enormous loss; we are still counting it up. We expect there to be more than 8,000 sheep lost, I ,500 cattle, more than 130 kilometres of lost or damaged fences and far more than properties with silt damage. But the toll-free phone line, which continues to operate, available to farmers to report losses. The tourist industry also suffered heavily, particularly in Lakes Entrance, Paynesville and Metung, and of course a great deal of effort has been made since to encourage it people to continue to visit East Gippsland. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) has visited the area with me as recently as yesterday and saw for himself the toll that has against it. been taken, in physical and emotional terms, on the region.

Prime Minister, have you agreed, as claimed by the Western Australian Premier, Richard Court, today, that the Commonwealth will pick up 75 per cent of the compensation costs for all future acts by to the states and territories extinguishing or impacting on native title? Doesn't this hand to the states, effectively, a blank cheque to proceed with the complete extinguishment of of native title on both vacant crown land and pastoral leases? Have you received from the Treasury or Finance an estimate-and, if so, in what?-of the potential liability of the Commonwealth and its taxpayers in this respect? Prime Minister, having bought your way out of an embarrassing and unnecessary that, early election, is the price setting up the two Commonwealth and Australian taxpayers for billions of dollars of open-ended liability?",61

98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the Australian public will want to know where the Labor Party stands on certainty for Australian farmers. Does the Australian Labor Party support a settlement that gives security and predictibility to the rural community of Australia or does the Australian Labor Party want to continue the five years of uncertainty that it created commencing with the 1993 Native Title Act? It ought to be said very firmly that the source of this problem lies in the Keating Native Title Act.,62

At long last an arrangement has been reached that will resolve that uncertainty. On the question of compensation, an arrangement was reached in relation to compensation provision of 75 and 25. I have indicated already that there will be further discussion on that issue. The assertion made by the Leader of the Opposition is again wrong. There has been no buying off. The doubt and concern that he raises about billions of dollars are, once again, a fanciful exaggeration. Native Title",62
103,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister advise the House of recent developments concerning the government's Native Title Amendment Bill?

107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, Mr Speaker.",62
108,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I asked whether he had got any help from the Labor Party.",62
109,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not think the member for O'Connor would ever suggest that I was responsible for the Labor Party. As the House will be aware, an agreement was made yesterday between the government and Senator Brian Harradine to give effect to certain amendments to the Native Title Act. If that new amended bill passes through the parliament it will, after a delay of almost five years, bring an end to an enormous amount of doubt that has hung over land title management in this country as a result of the incompetently drawn Native Title Act of 1993; a piece of legislation that was drawn in blatant disregard of the interests of the states of Australia, particularly states such as Western Australia where 82 per cent of the land mass of the state is now under native title claim. May I say that a comment made by the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, this morning to the effect that you are dealing here with an issue where the legislation is made at a federal levcl but it is the responsibility of the states to administer land management issues is a point entirely lost by the former Labor government, because the Native Title Act we now grapple with was, in fact, drawn in blatant disregard of the interests of states such as Western Australia. r have got to say that the Leader of the Opposition, who comes from Western Australia, has sold out the interests of his home state on this issue from start to finish. The Leader of the Opposition has paid no regard to the interests of the people of Western Australia or the great resource industry of Western Australia. By reaching this agreement the government has brought the uncertainty, the delay and the obscurity to an end. The government has provided certainty to Australia's farmers and, most importantly, it has provided a regime that treats all Australians equally. The main reason we were not prepared to accept the amendments inserted by the Senate was that those amendments gave rights to one section of the Australian community that were not available to others. It is a cardinal principle of this government's approach to the affairs of this country that we treat all Australians equaJIy. We do not give one set of rights to one group and say to another group, 'You can get by with inferior rights.' The reason why we oppose the right to negotiate was that that right to negotiate created rights for one section of the Australian community that were not available to others. It stands as a mattcr of the public record that the Labor Party is in favour of the inequality of rights of the Australian people; that the Labor Party wants a native title act that says that there should be rights available to the indigenous community that are not available to other sections of the Australian community. That position was repeated this morning by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and it has been repeated by the Leader of the Opposition. I note that the settlement reached with Senator Harradine has been widely supported within the Australian community. It has been supported by the National Farmers Federation, it has been supported by the Minerals Council of Australia and it has been supported by state governments. I believe it is a fair and balanced settlement. When the act is implemented by this parliament it will bring to an end almost five years of obscurity, delay and hesitation. It will bring to an end almost five years of legal uncertainty. It will bring to an end a failed attempt to create an inequality of rights within the Australian community. It is an honourable settlement. It is a fair settlement. It treats all Australians equally. If the Labor Party had the interests of the Australian community at heart, they would give their full support to the agreement that I have reached with Senator Harradine. Waterfront",62
110,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Isn't there a world of difference between a government which rejects options prepared by officials in response to a dispute, as Labor did in 1994, and one which actively provokes a dispute in order to engineer the sacking of an entire work force, endorses separation of that work force from the company infrastructure in order to make it easier to sack them, and helps train an alternative work force to take over from the sacked workers? Isn't it the case that, unlike Labor in 1994, you were up to your neck in a deliberate interventionist strategy to deprive Australian citizens of their right to work?",63
111,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member who asked the question was not a member of the Labor subcommittee in 1994, but let me say that, during the whole period Labor was in office, they had the choice to advocate significant reform on the waterfront and on every occasion they failed to exercise the national leadership that was necessary. We make no apology for the fact that this government has advocated significant reform of the Australian waterfront and through 1996 and 1997 was prepared to sit down, not just with employers but with unions, and demand some significant reform. Instead of you carping on about it, the fact is that you ought to have been publicly advocating the velY reforms that we ourselves have implemented. What a refreshing change it has been to have a government that is prepared to take some national leadership. Native Title",63

114,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Attorney General inform the House how the government's plan for resolving native title will address concerns of uncertainty and unfairness?,64
115,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Indi for his question. The government's objective with native title has been to bring certainty, fairness and workability into Australia's land management system. The land management system under Labor's legislation following the High Court's Wik decision has led to great uncertainty. Under Labor's legislation, the Commonwealth has spent more than $200 million on native title, but there have been virtually no determinations made. People have been in the courts for nearly five years without making any real progress. The agreement achieved by the Prime Minister will bring certainty and it will bring fairness to the law. The government has had significant legal advice throughout the negotiating process which confirms that our approach is constitutionally valid. A clear example of how certainty will be achieved is in relation to the interaction of the Native Title Act and the RDA. The changes made to the Native Title Amendment Bill by Labor and the minor parties in the Senate earlier year, which were expressly rejected back in 1993 by Labor, would have in effect promoted litigation by parties to use the RDA to challenge in court virtually any action taken under the Native Title Act. This would not have promoted certainty; it would have, in fact, promoted great uncertainty. The agreement reached will confirm the High Court's interpretation of the current position as to the interaction between the two acts. It will not allow the courts to go further than the High Court's current position and it will ensure that actions which comply with the Native Title Act and are valid are not subject to separate challenge under the RDA. Labor's unproductive response to the agreement reached by the Prime Minister has been to create alarm. The Leader of the Opposition in his own words has claimed that it will cause endless litigation. Mr Bevis-He is right-one day, one challenge.",64
116,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is wrong. What everybody wants in a legal system is certainty. That is what is wanted by miners, by farmers, by native title claimants and by tourist operators, and that what they will get under the government's proposals. The government's proposals will lead to certainty and they will lead to fairness. NA",64

Prime Minister, have you seen this document prepared in your office, headed Waterfront Strategy, for distribution this to you, John Sharp, Peter Reith, Greg Bondar and Peter Wilson? Prime Minister, doesn't this document recommend an interventionist approach as the only strategy for your government and define it as requiring 'active involvement by the Commonwealth and the stevedoring industry to bring about a national MUA stoppage allowing the stevedores to sack their existing work force and restart their operations with a new non-union work force'? Prime Minister, isn't this the document you endorsed on 21 April 1997 and which you told Ministers Reith and Sharp the same day that they should proceed to implement?",64

133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister will respond to the question.,65
134,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The House will be that Australia's export industries do rely on a land title system that stacks up, and relates to the pastoral industry and the to mining industry. One of the key aspects arising from the deal and the outcome on Wik is the tougher threshold test which will apply across the leases, bringing to an end the business of vexatious, disconnected claims, something which Noel Pearson himself has urged at various stages during this debate. So you will no longer have the business of someone near Redfern claiming some area west of Rockhampton; and that has been long as part of getting some sanity into the whole native title equation. We have a tougher threshold test which stacks up. We have a set of circumstances of equality of rights and farmers can get on without being ambushed by rights to negotiate their farm activity in relation to leaseholds. We have a proper outcome with regard to the the Racial Discrimination Act and we have an outcome that will help provide certainty, to quote the National Farmers Federation. This call will help the export base of Cape York, the hinterland and the ports of Cairns, Townsville and Rockhampton in establishing the exactiof the land title system. It will help confirm the exclusive tenure circumstance of GHPL leasehold throughout a good part of Queensland and that extinguishment is confirmed in relation to those leases. Finally, in respect of a claim by the Yorta Yorta people and other people who are claiming waters of the Murray River and elsewhere in the Darling-Murray Basin, it will provide a simple, straightforward process so that, whatever the determination might be on that key Yorta Yorta claim, irrigators will be able to get on with their task and circumstance, and the authorities will be empowered to do that. It is a good outcome. What a refreshing change it is to have a government which has delivered in relation to this matter. Waterfront",65
135,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, do you recall telling Neil Mitchell on 13 February this year: We don't seek a huge national bameywith the MUAover this. We never have. and that you told the parliament on 8 April: The MUA have created their own predicament. That has not been generated by anyone else. Prime Minister, doesn't this document that you have now got state: We need to further develop plans to involve the MUA in a dispute on an issue and at a time of our choosing. and doesn't it also say: It would be preferable for any major dispute to be one for which the government has planned in accordance with its own timetable. Prime Minister, didn't you mislead the parliament when you said that no-one but the MUA had generated the sacking of the Patrick's work force?",66
136,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What a joke. It is very interesting that there has been one question on native title, one question on the issue of the day. Isn't this a marvellous little performance?-a little, noisy performance by the Australian Labor Party on the last day of this sitting. It is a very interesting performance. All the fire and brimstone from the Leader of the Opposition last night about native title, and we got one, pathetic, irrelevant question",66

When the House is silent, including the members of the Labor Party, the member for Hotham has a point of order. Mr Crean-It relates to standing order 145 on relevance.

146,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Can the minister outline the benefits to the pastoral and mining industries of the government's successful negotiations of native title arrangements that do not compromise the lO-point plan? What will this mean for investment and jobs in rural and regional Australia? What has been the response from the rural regions of Australia to this breakthrough?,66

149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Denison.,67
150,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I represent a large rural electorate with a very substantial Aboriginal population, and settlement of this issue will be welcomed by all at the - coalface. They have been calling for an end to the division in their communities that has really been ripping at their social fabric. Community leaders have been saying to me for quite some time that they want this uncertainty ended. The government has never sought, I should note, to deny the existence of native title. We have sought to balance the interests of all parties in this, and I believe we have come to an honourable outcome. I commend the Prime Minister and the Leader of the National Party for their work in this area, as well as many others. As in my electorate, I believe that right across the nation the breakthrough on native title legislation is being welcomed, particularto ly in rural Australia. All Australians, but particularly those living in rural areas, wanted this issue resolved, and now it will be. Senator Harradine, who is a decent man, is in my view to be commended for the responsible and principled position he has taken. We are now in a position to end the uncertainty which has reigned for five years. Our lO-point plan will dramatically improve the operation of the Native Title Act. It will resolve the difficulties that arose as a result of the High Court's Wik decision and it will do so in a way that respects the rights of all parties: pastoralists, indigenous Australians and miners. It ensures that Australians are treated equally. It ensures that we have a secure land title system underpinning investment in the nation. Very importantly, the principles underlying and underpinning the lO-point plan have not heen compromised. That has heen recognised by farming communities and by the mining industry. I believe that time will demonstrate that the new arrangements are very sound indeed. I note that the NFF has commented that Australia's farmers have accepted that the agreement on native title is 'the only tenable option on the table'. The Minerals Council said in their statement: The amended Act will allow the industry to get on with its business in a way which respects the rights of others and continues to generate wcalth and jobs for all Australians. On that note, it is very important that we do not underestimate the benefits that ending all this uncertainty will bring. ABS figures show that exploration spending in the minerals and energy sector has now fallen for three quarters up to the quarter that ended in March 1998. Exploration spending is the lifeblood of the minerals and energy sector so vitally important to the national economy and to rural and regional Australia. It is as well that the uncertainty in relation to this matter is now brought to an end. Waterfront",67
151,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, do you recall telling the parliament on 27 October last year, in relation your negotiations with the MUA on the waterfront: We are approaching this on a constructive basis. It is important that we sit down and talk with the respective parties. . . . From the government's point of view, we . . . are prepared to sit down with people and constructively talk ... Minister, doesn't this document recommend this: A key part of the interventionist strategy is that the MUA should be caught by surprise. To this end it may be quite appropriate to keep the unions wondering whether the Government would settle for an evolutionary approach. Minister, doesn't this show you were never, ever negotiating in good faith? Why should anyone trust you in the future?",67
152,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you read this document, which pre-dates the other document that you released with a lot of fanfare a few weeks ago, the cabinet submission in July, what it says is this: Any serious attempt to implement our maritime reform agenda is likely to create a fight with the raised. MUA. So what? Obviously, if we proceeded to sell ANL, they were likely to pull a national strike. What do you expect us to do: do what you did and cave in? Is that what your expectation was? Or would you perhaps have expected us to get some advice? Would that be your expectation? Perhaps we would, on 9 September 1994, have asked for some advice.",67
153,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Answer the question!,68
154,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am answering the question. You find this difficult, don't you? I might have asked for some advice from the head of the legal division. I might have said, 'Well, we have got this problem with the MUA. What might we do about it?'",68
155,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will address his answer through the chair.,68
156,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, if you had been the minister for industrial relations at the time, you might have received some advice, which would have been a brief which outlined certain legal remedies available to you as the government of the day, simply because you were attempting to implement government policy. That advice would deal with bans, it would deal with standing down of employees and it would give you advice about the cancellation of MUA awards and agreements. That is interesting, isn't it? They were carrying on about awards yesterday. They were taking advice on cancelling them.",68
157,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The answer to the question has nothing to do with the question. The question first took a quote from the honourable gentleman which suggested that he always talked constructively and in good faith, and then quoted from an extensive part of that document which went to the part of the conspiracy, and that dealt with the need to keep the MUA in the cart for talks while you were working out what you were doing. Mr Speaker, he is not going to those issues at all; he is evading them.",68
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition would know that, within the ambit of the paper, there are quite a number of issues Mr Bevis-But he is not answering the question.",68
159,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have warned the member for Brisbane and I suggest that he remain silent. Secondly, you are making allegations regarding conspiracies which are quite outside the ambit of the standing orders at this stage and this nature of proceedings. The minister at this stage is within standing orders but I suggest he address specifically the question that has been canvassed of him.",68
160,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the manner in which I am addressing it is to say that any government has a national responsibility to understand the remedies available to it in the event of a national strike being undertaken by the MUA, which would basically paralyse economic activity. We certainly took that advice. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that we took that advice. Were we alone in doing so? No, we were not. Was it a conspiracy that, at the time back in SeptemberMr Crean-Yes, it was; yes, it was!",68
161,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You answer the question before I have put it-which shows you what a mug you are. The fact of the matter is: was it a conspiracy for the Labor Party to be getting this advice in September 1994 when they were then negotiating with the MUA? Was it a conspiracy for the Labor Party to be taking advice on the action that they could take under the Crimes Act for interference with international trade? Was it a conspiracy by the then Labor minister to take advice on the dismissal of employees?,68
162,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order which goes to relevance: he is dealing with a document of 1994-an options paper. This is not an options paper, Mr Speaker. This particular paper states exactly what you intend to do",68
163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition is arguing the point.,68
164,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,and you are not dealing with the question that was directly put to you.,68
165,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Leader of the Opposition has a point of relevance, I suggest the minister address the specificity of the question that has been raised.",69
166,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly will, Mr Speaker. The point I make is that the government did have options, in the same way that the previous government had options and we had meetings to discuss it. Were those meetings a conspiracy? I say they were no more a conspiracy than the Leader of the Opposition conspired when he was on a committee. Mr MCMullan-Answer the question.",69
167,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wonder if the previous government had a committee as well; I wonder. Would people expect such a committee? I wonder if that committee had the then Prime Minister of the day, none other than Mr Keating. Mr Crean-No, not so.",69
168,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Did that committee have none other than the interjector rising to his feet? Ml' Beazley- Mr SPEAKER ,69

Mrs Draper interjectingMl' SPEAKER-The member for Makin will remain silent. The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.",69
170,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It goes to relevance: you have sought from the minister that the point of the question that was asked of him and he has not done so. I would ask you to bring him to the point.,69
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Oppomaking sition, I pointed out, used the word not 'conspiracy'. He has talked about meetings ministers and at the moment, as I understand it, the minister's reply specifically relates those two issues. The minister will seat. The member for Canberra has a point of order. Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, in reply to that point of order, you referred to some things which the Leader of the Opposition might have said. In fact, Mr Speaker, I asked the question and I did not relate it to conspiracy and did not refer to it. I referred to whether he was bargaining in good faith, and he has not responded to that.",69
172,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would point out that your efforts have not been helped then by an extension of the question and the way in which the question relating to relevance was raised by your colleague, the Leader of the Opposition. The minister is still responding to the question. I will ask him specificallyMr Crean-Oh, come on!",69
173,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham will remain silent. The minister will reply to the question.,69
174,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me make my concluding remarks. The allegation is made by the Labor Party but the fact of the matter is that, when they were in government, they had a subcommittee of cabinet doing exactly what we were doing.",69

182,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know you are trying to assist but, in fact, I was more concerned about some of the allegations that the minister was than his relevance. The minister needs to make accusations about other people or of use words which suggest that they should be by substantive motion. The minister will to remain relevant. He was talking about frauduresume his lent behaviour before.",69
183,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I just conclude by giving the House a glimpse into 1994, Mr Speaker, . because the question was whether or not we have acted in good faith. People have got to remember that in 1994 the Labor government did a deal with Mr Corrigan to sell him a quarter of Australian Stevedores, which formed the basis for Patrick's, and the minister for industrial relations of the day made sure that Mr Corrigan got a loan to effect the purchase from ANL. Mr Speaker, there is a lot of things yet to be said about this and, if they want to go on about it, we are happy to do so.",69

190,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, how will the Australian community, particularly some of the 30,000 businesses in my electorate, benefit from taxation reform? Treasurer, what steps are you and other members of the Howard government taking to inform the community of the desperate need for taxation reform?",70
191,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. I can say to the small businesses that he represents, of course, that they will be helped greatly by the fact that this government intends to simplify the complexities of the Australian taxation system, give tax relief middle income earners, get poverty traps out of the system and rationalise inheritance taxes. Members will be aware that I have written today to every member of the parliament, asking them whether or not they would like a reprint of the government booklet In need of tax reform. ... The reasons I have done that are twofold. One is that the print runs of this booklet have now been exhausted twice. The second reason is that we have had a couple of ALP members come down to my office requesting copies of this booklet. They generally come down at night, very silently, and ask sotto voce, hoping no doubt that the ACTU presidents do not see them, whether they can please have a copy of this book, In need of tax reform . . . This is an offer which is now open to all of the Australian Labor Party. We will be producing this booklet; you can put in your orders and send copies out to your constituents. No sooner had the government announced that the Labor Party could get copies of this booklet than I received requests for the government to do a reprint of this booklet-A guide to tax reform of July 1985. This 1985 guide to tax reform was, you will recall, the guide to tax reform which was solidly supported by Mr Beazley and Mr Evans-the old Mal Colston defence team-Beazley and Evans! Let me tell you the principles they supported. They supported a broad based consumption tax set at 12- per cent. They said that would provide large income tax cuts; they said that would reduce marginal tax rates. Beazley and Evans said that that would increase the tax take from people who continue to avoid or evade income tax. They said that would provide enough revenue to enable a more generous net benefit for wage and salary earners. They said that if the Australian public supported the Beazley-Evans consumption tax that would enable the wholesale sales tax to be abolished. That was where Beazley and Evans were in 1985. Where are they today? Let me ask the House this question: is there one area of policy where Mr Beazley has been able to lead public opinion? Is there one area of for policy where he has been able to take a stand? Mr Bevis-Pauline Hanson!",70
192,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Beazley has not been able to lay a glove on One Nation because he has adopted their economic policy-economic Hansonism. Pauline Hanson says that she is against the sale of Telstra and Kim Beazley says that he is against the sale of Telstra. Pauline Hanson says that she is against tax reform; Kim Beazley says that he is against tax reform. Pauline Hanson says she is against competition policy; Kim Beazley says he is against competition policy. Kim Beazley says he wants tariffs; Pauline Hanson says she wants tariffs. This is what Kim Beazley said on radio 2HD on 11 April 1997: What you have there is a situation where as far as her industry policy is concerned you might as well trust the authors, which are us. That is Beazley trying to claim credit for the policies of One Nation and Pauline Hanson. This is somebody who has been unable to take a stand on anything. The only policy he has thought up is a policy for his next term in opposition because he is somebody who is bereft of any leadership whatsoever. Waterfront",71
193,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, do you recall a statement from Minister Reith on 4 June this year in relation to the funding of your waterfront strategy in which he said: Basically the funds were expended on obtaining reports. Prime Minister, doesn't this document recommend, by contrast: The Prime Minister approves the allocation of an initial budget of $2 million to set up and operate [a small] teamincluding basic research and intelligence and law and order people tasked to 'continue the detailed planning' and 'prepare for implementation of the interventionist strategy'? And didn't the cabinet submission of July 1997 by Minister Reith and Minister Sharp report that this had occurred? Prime Minister, can you tell this House precisely what taxpayers' funds have been spent on in regard to this operational team and the nature of the activities that this team undertook?",71
194,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will investigate the detail of that question and write back to the member as appropriate. Mr Martin-You are hopeless.,71
195,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are enjoying it, aren't you Stephen? You like it. You give yourself away when you smile like that. It shows how confected this little exercise really is. I have absolutely no reluctance saying that we set out in a very determined way to achieve reform of the Australian waterfront. We make no apology for that fact. I find it absolutely extraordinary that the Australian Labor Party should be suggesting that there is something strange ahout a government wanting to reform the Australian waterfront getting a range of options from its advisers. From time immemorial governments have done that. The difference between the Labor Party and the coalition on this issue is that we were not prepared to do the bidding of the trade union movement. We were prepared to stand up for the interests of the Australian community. We were prepared to stand up for the interests of those Australians who were tired of their industries being destroyed by an uncompetitive",71
196,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point or order going to relevance, the member for Melbourne asked a specific question about",71
197,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And I am addressing it.,71
198,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No you are not. He asked about $2 million of public funds spent to establish a team and the work it was to do. That is what the question is about. It was seeking confirmation of that fact. There has been nothing of it in his answer.,71
199,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You lot spent about $420 million. Mr Reith-On a point of order, that is an irrelevant and frivolous point of order from a leader of the opposition whose tactics have failed very badly today. He ought to be sat down when he puts up these irrelevant points of order.",71
200,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is being answered at the moment within the general embrace of the question. The Prime Minister is in order.,71
201,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am indebted to the honourable member for O'Connor, who reminds me that, when it comes to expenditure on waterfront matters, the former Labor government spent about $130 million of taxpayers' money without achieving any measurable reforms and presided over a process which cost about $420 million. At the end of that process you still had the monumental rorts, an unproductive Australian waterfront and crane movement rates that were abysmal by world standards. In other words, they spent $130 million of the taxpayers' funds of Australia and another $300 million of the industry funds to achieve absolutely nothing. By contrast, we were prcpared to embrace a determined effort to bring about fundamental reform of the Australian waterfront, and I make absolutely no apology for that policy objective at all. Immigration: One Nation",72
202,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Minister, in considering the immense contribution which the ethnic community has made to my electorate and to our nation, can you outline to the House the impact One Nation's proposed changes to Australia's intake of skilled migrants would have on the nation's economy?",72
203,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question on this matter, and I would simply observe that the honourable member for Deakin is one of a significant number of members of parliament in this House who came to Australia often young and without any English language capacity and have demonstrated how they can contribute at such a very significant and high level. We commend the honourable member for Deakin for the ongoing contribution that he is making. The honourable member for Deakin gives me the opportunity to say to the HouseOpposition members inteljecting",72
204,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and I am sorry it is not to all of the House-that one of the most significant steps taken by this government been to shift the balance of the immigration program in favour of skilled migration and to increase substantially the standards of the skilled category applicants. These changes do deliver significant economic, employment and budgetary benefits to Australia. Earlier this year I released a report by Econtech, using the Murphy model, that demonstrated that Australians will be per person $95 better off per year by the year 2007 as a result of the changes that the government has introduced. And there is more to come as a result of the further changes to finetune the independent and skilled Australian linked categories that the government has foreshadowed. The per capita growth in economic terms is essential to enhancing Australia's employment needs. The program that has been recast in that direction has a significant benefit in budgetary terms as well. There has been independent analysis undertaken by the Department of Finance and Administration as well as my own department that shows that these two categories of migration entry have a highly positive impact on the Commonwealth budgets and, I have to say, the budgets of other governments. These benefits are achieved because the independent migrants perform well in the Australian labour market. Within three years of arrival, the longitudinal survey shows that they have a labour participation rate of over 90 per cent and an employment rate of over 95 per cent. By this time, they have average incomes of over $40,000 per annum and are obviously making a major contribution to the nation's tax base. They have brought with them skills, often capital, new ideas and overseas contacts which enable us to expand our global markets. Unlike those who come through the family reunion programparticularly as we saw in the past when it was up to 70 per cent and, unfortunately, they were very often manipulating entry-these migrants are the ones who create jobs and very significant economic benefits. What is the One Nation Party proposing? They are proposing to rebalance the program against skilled migration. They are going to reduce it to 33 per cent of the program. They has are going to eliminate entirely those two categories which have brought such substantial economic benefits as I have outlined. The fact is that Australia does lose about 30,000 people each year overseas. They are, in the main, young and skilled Australians up employment opportunities overseas, and we ought not be surprised that that happens. But, if you reduce the skilled migration answer, numbers-as the member for Kalgoorlie matter, pointed out to me-and enhance the family reunion program, you are in fact des killing Australia, and the consequences for us in terms of our ability to compete in tional markets and our ability to become much more engaged in world terms is to tic a hand behind our back and leave us exposed. The very important aspect of the migration program is that it enables us to fill the gaps that the education system cannot fill. As pointed out last night, the education system is important and, as I saw in discussing some of our programs, the skilling of the Australian labour market is absolutely crucial for ensurment. ing that the unemployment problems amongst our youth are addressed. I want to conclude my comments by adding to an answer that I gave yesterday on this same matter. The changes that are intended to family reunion would ensure that, for in the stance, no orphan relatives would be able to enter Australia. Some colleagues have asked me, 'Who are the orphan relatives who would be left out?' It is a relatively small number, but the orphan relatives arise because sometimes the parents of children die in car accipoint dents overseas and the only family members who are able to provide for their ongoing needs are here in Australia. It is a compascuts tosionate response to a need through a family reunion program, and one that the honourable member and her party seem to ignore and think has very little relevance. Child Support: Custodial Parents",72
205,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister elected representing the Minister for Social Security aware that the child support and social securiour ty systems make it possible for a custodial parent to receive, for example, between $50,000 and $100,000 a year in tax-free child support from his or her ex-partner as well as be eligible for the supporting parent benefit and other concessions? Doesn't this make farce of not only social security but equity in the implementation of child support? When will the government bring fairness into who take the woeful child support system?",73
206,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I will get a detailed as I did before in relation to a similar which will be available at the earliest opportunity. Mr SlPEAKER-The member for Hunter. internaSorry, the member for Paterson. Roadworks IvIr BOB BALDWIN-I have not moved quite that far yet, Mr Speaker. My question",73
207,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are close, but I was cannot sec any similarity in your physique.",73
208,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional DevelopMinister, would you advise this House of the major roadwork initiatives in New South Wales implemented since the election of the Howard-Fischer government? Minister, could you detail the progress of the roadworks in my electorate of Paterson, in particular the works on the Raymond Terrace bypass and Bulahdelah-Coolongolook section of the Pacific Highway? Minister, how is this investment helping reduce the carnage that has been occurring on these roads? Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr Speaker, I raise a of order. As you had already called me, r thought you may be prepared to allow me to ask the minister to also explain the funding",73
209,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not a point of order. The member will resume his seat.,73
210,Mr V AILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Paterson for his question. He does represent the area of the Hunter very well. He was into this place arguing the case for more funding on the Pacific Highway, and government has provided it. It is quite instructive, if you have a look at the budget figures over the last few years, you will see that our government provided $1.62 billion for roads in Australia in this year's budget. In the last Labor budget, it was $1.56 billion. In a this year's budget, we had allocations for also money on roads of national importance, including the Pacific Highway, in both the New South Wales and Queensland categories. If you have a look at the figures for roads of national importance in the 1995-96 budget, the last Labor budget, there was nothing. What was in there for the Pacific Highway? Nothing. The member for Cowper has been in here for many years arguing for funding of the Pacific Highway and, at last, it took a coalition government to deliver it. The Australian Labor Party, in government, continually argued against funding for the Pacific Highway. In his question, the member for Paterson asked about a couple of specific projects in his area. I am pleased to inform the member for Paterson that one of the major 1?rojects being undertaken on the Pacific Highway is the Bulahdelah-Coolongolook deviation. The road has seen many hundreds of fatalities over the years and the deviation is targeted for completion in June of 1999. The other major project being undertaken in the member's electorate is the Raymond Terrace bypass, which will be completed by December 1998. I reiterate, for the benefit of the House: this work is being undertaken in conjunction with the New South Wales government by the coalition federal government after l3 years of being promised by Labor and never delivered. It was a 14th year promise, and it took members, like the member for Paterson, arguing the case to get the funding for the Pacific Highway. I assure the member for Paterson we will continue our commitment to the Pacific Highway. The member for Paterson will be back here in the next parliament, representing the electorate of Paterson and arguing for funding on the Pacific Highway. Waterfront",73
211,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, do you recall telling John Laws on 22 April this year: The only goal we seek ... is to have voluntary unionism on the Australian waterfront ... At no stage have I ever advocated that people should be sacked because they belong to a trade union because that would be against the law that we brought in in 1996. Prime Minister, doesn't this wonderful document, which you ticked off and endorsed, advocate the replacement of the existing work force with 'a new non-union work force'? Isn't it illegal-as you acknowledged to John Laws, so it must be right-for you to sack a union work force and replace it with an exclusively non-union work force? Haven't you not only misled the Australian people but also broken your own law?",74
212,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. The situation remains that, as I have said on numerous occasions, our goal since being elected was to achieve reform of the Australian waterfront, to work with others to achieve that goal in accordance with the laws of Australia. Forest Industry",74
213,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question isOpposition members-Oh, poor Ross! Take a point of order!",74
214,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am delighted to hear that there is so much interest in the competition that is quite apparent in the government ranks. I trust we might see some similar competition throughout the House.,74
215,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Can the minister outline how the federal government has responded to the very real concern in rural and regional Australia that the forest industries need a stable and secure policy framework that encourages investment and job creation? How does this contrast with other approaches to forest policy in Australia?,74
216,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I certainly acknowledge his enormous interest in, and contribution to, the debate about forest policy in this country. And he, of course, enjoys some very good company in the House-the member for Page, the member for MCMillan, the member for Gippsland, the member for Corangamite, the member for Cowper, the member for Paterson, the member for Braddon and the member for MCEwen-all of them absolutely committed to doing something that the previous regime in this country could not, which was to give Australia a stable and secure policy framework that would encourage investment and job creation in our forest industry. We have achieved an enormous amount in that regard. Again, we have achieved something the previous administration was never able to achieve: we have a number of regional forest agreements in place. Wherever they have been put in place, as the members who have worked so hard for them know, not only are people who are worried about conservation values enormously reassured but investment and jobs are starting to tlow. It is, I believe, a real mark of what good policy actively pursued by government determined to see outcomes can achieve. A couple of nights ago in this place the government delivered on another major commitment as part of its regional forest agreement strategy. We introduced the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 which underpins those RFAs and gives legislative certainty. I believe that the cornerstone of this approach will ensure the real base for industry to bring forth the investment that we need so much in this country. It is absurd that almost alone amongst our agricultural industries-instead of being an enormous exporter-this one puts us in a position where the industries are so paralysed that we have a net deficit in trade in timber and paper products of around $2 billion. The job losses-the jobs you people exported, because you would not put in place a stable regime-serve as an absolute discredit to you as self-proclaimed champions of the interests of people who are looking for jobs in this country. The fact is that now the industry is able to say that they welcome very strongly what we have done. NAFl says: This bill deserves the support in the forest debate and all political parties as it addresses the key issues of jobs and communities, as well as forest conservation and sustainable management. The RFA process provides a balanced outcome designed to meet a very high standard of conservation criteria, as well as taking into account the social and economic needs of rural Australia. This is in total contrast to what the Labor Party managed when it was in government. The interesting question now is: will they come clean and demonstrate their support for what we have done in the interests of rural and regional Australians? Waterfront",74
217,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Does the minister recall saying at a Treasury Place doorstop on 8 May 1998: No-one to my knowledge had any knowledge of any plans anywhere. As to, did anybody have any plans of which we were aware, the answer is no, absolutely not. Minister, doesn't this document show that both firms-that is, Patrick and P&O-have embarked on planning for a major dispute during which they would sack their work force and recommence operations using alternative labour? Is it not true that you did have detailed knowledge of plans to provoke a waterfront dispute and then backed the sacking of the entire work force and its replacement with another? Minister, were you lying on 8 Mayor just deceitful?",75
218,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member will withdraw that final implication. That part of the question is out of order. The rest of question is in order. Mr Crean-On a point of order, I was asking a question as to whether it was a lie.",75
219,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The last part of the question contains words that can only be used in this place in a substantive motion. It is therefore out of order, but the rest of the question is in order. I call the Minister to reply. Mr Martin Ferguson-Tell the truth for a of all interest groups change!",75

221,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I was asked whether I knew about Dubai. I said I did not know about Dubai Mr Crean-Have you read it? Mr RElTH-I have seen the transcript. I was asked also whether I knew of any other such place and the answer was no. Mr Crean-You are guilty. Guilty!,75
222,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have read this document. You get far too excited, Simon. This document is three months before the cabinet submission. Mr Crean-So what?",76
223,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let's read some of this document, Simon; you are so entertained by it. It says here: You can either sit back and do nothing, or as a government you can make preparations in the event of a national strike. This document says that, even if you do nothing, the chances are you could get a national strike. Mr Crean-Wrong! Wrong. Read it.",76
224,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You quoted the document to us. Let us therefore look at the document. It says: Even without government encouragement a non-union firm may eventually chose to enter the industry and in that circumstance obviously you would have a national strike. What is our responsibility? Mr Bevis-What did you do? You set out to,76
225,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have warned the member for Brisbane.,76
226,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Our responsibility is to make sure that whatever can be done to prepare for such a contingency ought to be done, and that is what we did as a government. Mr Speaker, I will tell you the reason why the tactics committee on the other side decided to pull out of their little pile a document that was made back in April 1997, before the other documents that they have. The reason is that, when you look at what has happened on the waterfront, recently in Sydney the MUA unanimously voted to support changes in Patrick's operations in Sydney and to man the premises on the basis of our productivity rate of 25 crane lifts per hour. I had the quote before about the meeting I had with John Coombs in October 1997. When I took over full responsibility in early October 1997, the first thing I did was to make arrangements to see and talk to both the employers and the union. When I was given responsibility, the first thing I did was to get around and talk to all the industry players. When I went for that meeting with John Coombs, do you know what he told me when it came to productivity rates? He told me that a crane rate of 24 to 25 was unattainable. You ought to have that document as well and table it. That is what he told me. In fact, in the last week or so the MUA itself has finally voted for the government's own productivity target. If you want an example of success, the fact that they have finally voted for it is that measure of success. We have abolished the nick. Mr O'Keefe--We have not been the ones telling lies.",76
227,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Burke will remain silent.,76
228,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We have abolished double headers and we have halved the manning levels on the Australian waterfrontsomething after 13 years you could never achieve. Mr O'Keefe--Everyone was telling lies except you.,76
229,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bourke will remain silent. I warn him. Asian Economic Crisis: Indonesia,76
230,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister inform the House of the Australian government's dealings with the United States regarding the economic crisis in Indonesia, and has the government made a contribution to resolving the Asian economic crisis?",76
231,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. It gives me the opportunity to remind the House that the Australian government has been extremely active in assisting Indonesia through the economic crisis which it has confronted, and also assisting the east Asian region generally throughout that economic crisis. I would remind the House of two particular things that I have done in recent times. In March of this year I visited the United States and met with not just the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, but with the Managing Director of the IMF, Michel Camdessus, the President of the World Bank and officials from the United States Treasury to talk about the crisis in Indonesia and to urge on the International Monetary Fund a more moderate approach to the very difficult task of rebuilding the Indonesian economy. The IMF has been responsive to representations by Australia and by others to take a rather different course from the course they originally took. So in that respect I think we have been very helpful to Indonesia at this difficult time. I also spoke with the United States Secretary of State more recently, last month, about this whole question and I made it clear to her, as I think my colleague the Treasurer did to his American counterpart a couple of weeks earlier, that in dealing with the East Asian economic crisis we do not want to see the International Monetary Fund appJying political conditionality. And I was very pleased that the United States Secretary of State responded positively to my representations on that issue. r make those points simply to illustrate that, for those who think Australia has not done enough to assist Indonesia during this period and, what is more, who suggest we should do more in encouraging the United States to take a constructive approach to Indonesia during this crisis, I do not think there is any country that could reasonably have been expected to do more than Australia and the Australian government have done. The Prime Minister has himself been extremely active in this issue-the Treasurer has; the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister has; I have-and I know that in Indonesia, amongst all different political complexions, there is a great deal of gratitude for what Australia has done. Let me, in conclusion, remind the House that Australia and Japan are the only two countries in the world which have supported all three IMF packages. The only two countries in the world! We have also provided a significant amount of development assistance to Indonesia during this time. So, to those who think we have not done enough, let me say as politely as I possibly can, they are wrong. Australia has done an enormous amount. We have shown leadership in terms of our relationship with the United States and we have shown leadership throughout the East Asian region in addressing this most difficult of international issues. Waterfront",76
232,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, do you recall saying: We want to assert the very simple principle that truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national poli tical life. And: I want to establish a bond of trust between the people and the government, to bring back the time when you can say something and people will actually believe it. In the face of overwhelming evidence that you planned, prepared and executed an operation to sack a work force and replace it with another, haven't you deceived the parliament, manipulated this dispute and broken your bond of trust with the Australian people? Haven't you forfeited your right to be trusted by any Australian?",77
233,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I completely reject the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition. I reject it completely. I stand by what I have said before, and I repeat it, that we were elected on a policy of reforming the Australian waterfront. We set out to achieve that goal because it is in the interests of the Australian people. The commitment I made to the Australian people, and the promise that I made to the Australian people, was to do all I could to achieve a reformed Australian waterfront, not out of some kind of ideological zeal but because I believe that the Australian people deserve reforms. I believe that the efforts that the government has undertaken have delivered a more competitive waterfront and that we have achieved reforms on the Australian waterfront beyond the capacity of any alternative government in Australia and beyond the beliefs of many sections of the Australian community.",77

239,Mr ROSS CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Mr Crean interjecting,78
240,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have already left the House. The member for Parramatta has the call.,78
241,Mr ROSS CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister will be aware of the statement yesterday by President Bill Clinton to the Chinese government and people that, if the Chinese want to have access to the American consumer dollar, they must provide fair access to America and to other countries to the consumers of China. Does the same principle apply to Australian exporters, such as those in western Sydney and in my electorate of Parramatta, and in particular what efforts has this government been taking to open up new markets around the world for Australian exporters?",78
242,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta for his question which relates to the important matter of the visit to China by the President of the USA-a visit which has proceeded through Xian, Beijing and Shanghai, and he wi II move on to Hong Kong at about this time-and has led to a number of trade talks taking place between not only the United States President and Beijing interlocutors but also Charlene Barshefski, US trade representative. Your question, of course, I think goes to nub of the matter: those who would call for open markets access might also themselves provide that market access. Firstly, with regard to the United States, the Jones Act, which blocks Australia from exporting hightech wave piercing ferries from Australia to the USA remains an unacceptable non-tariff measure. Secondly, we welcome the recent increase in the sugar quota for Australian exporters into the USA-I would point out that that relates to another aspect-and that will increase the tonnages from all elements of the Australian sugar industry. But there is more work to be done because in fact there should be no quotas. It should not be a restricted form of export from Australia to the USA by way of a quota mechanism, albeit China that that is still covered in the Uruguay Round at this time. I might add that 12 countries are now giving Australian sugar exporters zero tariff into their key markets. Let me tum to another area to pick up very much on the question of the member for Parramatta, who represents his exporters very capably. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that consequent upon setting up the market development task force and driving that forward with its chair, Philip Flood, and more recently Dr Ashton Calvert, I am pleased to say that further progress has been made in Australian exporters getting improved market access, especially in the services industry. In relation to China, additional banking licences and legal licences have been granted to Australian companies as well as insurance company licences. Improved market access for wool, apples, wine, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, motor vehicle parts and optical fibres have been secured. There has been a successful negotiation of a protocol on health requirements for slaughter cattle to enter the PRC from Australia and a number of other steps, including the approved destination status for Australia-just one of five countries and secured by the work of the Minister for Sport and Tourism, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other ministers. Indeed, that moment in Beijing-when the Minister for Sport and Tourism held the attention of the the entire audience, paused for two minutes after the translation and then, when invited for his return to reply, did so in fluent Mandarinwas a very similar moment in building a further breakthrough with regard to our tourism connections between Australia and China. We have expanded market access, facilitated the expansion of exports as a consequence and, as a result, created more jobs here in Australia.",78
243,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Motion of Censure",79
244,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"by leave-I That this House censures the Prime Minister for: (1) his authorisation and funding of a secret Government strategy to provoke an industrial dispute involving stevedores dismissing employees and rehiring new non-union ers under different arrangements; (2) his evasive denials of the existence of such strategy; (3) his willingness to embark upon potentially illegal actions in contravention of the place Relations Act, and the potential exposure of the Commonwealth, and all taxpayers, to substantial damages; (4) the collusion between the Government and Patrick Stevedoring in, and Government encouragement and foreknowledge of, scheme to sack Patrick's workforce and replace it with an alternative workforce; and (5) undermining the employment security of all Australian workers through the use of sive tactics involved in the strategy adopted the waterfront. Where is Danny Sankey now that we really need him? Where is a person prepared a legal case to protect the rights of ordinary Australians, to deal with a conspiracy that been organised and coordinated out of this government to deny Australian citizens their lawful rights? Where is a person going emerge to hold to book this government for its paranoid, near-Nixonian behaviour in this area? What the document that we tabled today reveals is this: it completes the cycles of documents. It is the one to which John Howonly ard was responding in his letter to John Sharp of 21 April 1997 and in which he said: I support the interventionist strategy you have outlined, and it is the forerunner of the proposal that went to cabinet on 7 July. Significant passages are the same in both documents. When you read through this document, you will understand that it is not an options document; it is a document headed in one direction. Any mention of alternative options is there simply to dismiss them, and dismiss them in detail. The object of this document is to arrange a set of circumstances, to put in place a team, to set down a set of principles, to organise an industrial dispute on the waterfront and to put a shade over that industrial dispute to ensure that it occurs at a point in when it is seen as tactically most conmove: venient for the government. As you read through the document there is one thing missing from it: that is, any conception of the national interest, any conception of their the needs of the Australian people, any workconception of what ought to be done about waterfront reform. Indeed, when it dismisses a the so-called evolutionary approach, the basis of its dismissal lies largely not in the view that that approach would fail-how could it, Workbecause the evolutionary approach had been succeeding repeatedly when used?-but that there was a risk that it would be operated on a basis or would occur in circumstances that were not to the government's political needs a or liking. That is all. This is a document about the political interests of the Liberal Party. It is a document about the ideology of the Liberal Party. It is a document about the aggresparanoia of this government about a set of on Australian workers. It is a classic Nixon document aimed at the destruction of people they consider as enemies, not people whom to take the public consider as enemies. It is a document which is a link in a chain has of one of the most massive abuses of power any minister or government has engaged in in this country-a massive abuse of power at the to taxpayers' expense. Let me quote from a number of elements of this document. Let me go to the pros and cons of the so-called two approaches in this document, which states: The interventionist approach is undoubtedly the strategy that holds out the prospect of achieving the proposed objectives in this term of parliament. Major change is unlikely to occur under an evolutionary approach for a number of years. The interventionist approach undoubtedly entails substantial risks and would inevitably involve a major waterfront stoppage in which the government will be actively involved and which will in the short term impose a high economic cost. Our opponents will attack us for the cost of this dispute and will attribute our conduct to an ideological hatred of the MUA and the union movement. How surprising! It continues: There is no doubt that if the government decides to go down this track, it would be imperative to achieve as swift a victory as possible. It needs to be appreciated this strategy leaves us, to some extent, in the hands of the existing stevedoring companies. There is always a risk that they will cave in and/or make tactical errors. These risks would have to be managed. The MUA will try and protect its position of power while minimising its vulnerability to legal action. The courts and the AIRC cannot always be relied upon to act in a decisive and timely manner against the union. That was about the one perceptive part of this document. Indeed, that is what they did. What you see when you go through the rest of this document is a statement that says, 'These outfits involved in it may be weak; therefore, we have to put in place the mechanisms that will underpin a position that both convinces them that the government will be wilful in this regard and will take the lead as far as they are concerned.' This document goes on to talk about how you organise it. The document has a section in it called 'Triggers', which shows how you get your industrial dispute. It reads: The use of a maritime issue would make it easier to sack stevedores for striking over an issue which was not directly relevant to their own employment. . . There are three maritime and shipping issues which could cause a strike: the sale or windup of ANL, the abolition of cabotage and the award simplification process, including the abolition seaman's engagement system. Of the three, cabotage has been cleverly manipulated by the MUA using ships of shame and the spectre of oil on the beaches, while the importance of abolishing the SES would be an obscure issue to the general public. The sale of ANL is a clearer issue and would be readily understood by the public, especially as the MUA has already prevented the previous government from doing itso they say. It goes on: There is some doubt that the sale of ANL by itself would be sufficient to bring the stevedores out on strike. However, it may be possible to combine ANL with one or two other issues and to keep the debate focused on the sale of ANL. This is a truly extraordinary document, this conspiracy document. It goes on to examine further opportunities for putting in place triggers, and says this: Further work will need to be undertaken on possible triggers. In the meantime, no action should be taken that will neutralise any such possible triggers. In terms of timing, it is important not to engage the MUA until both stevedoring firms are in a position to commence restarting operations without the existing work force. On current indications, that is unlikely to be before September or October this year, though planning should proceed as quickly as possible to deal with any industrial action in the meantime. We will need to engage in extensive planning on how to manage a dispute. This includes investigating all legal avenues as well as other action necessary to keep the waterfront operating. What you then do is go out and argue public relations; who are the people that you ought to involve in all of this? They go on to say, for example, in getting the propaganda together: In this regard, some of the work being undertaken or planned by the Productivity Comrnissionthis is to encourage third party individuals to come out in support of themselvescould be brought forward and refocused for the use of these groups. Recollect the use of the Productivity Commission. Are we now expected to believe, in relation to that work being brought forward, that it was conducted on a basis of full and open disclosure and honest intent? Are we to believe that, when it was part of a strategy ticked off by Prime Minister Howard to put of the in place a process whereby a cloud of lies could be put around a strategy aimed at sacking illegally Australian workers for the simple reason that they belonged to a union? What an utterly dishonourable position to have placed the Productivity Commission in. We wonder how knowing of it they were. Or was it simply an assumption that they could be relied upon to put highly biased accounts down of what was going on on the waterfront? Whatever else there is here, you have compromised the Productivity Commission. Mr Reith-You are surprised they would find a lack of productivity; and you reckon there is a conspiracy. You must be joking!",79
245,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"And you have put this position in place, Mr Minister. You are responsible for it. They go on to recommend to ministers: Ministers' comments in public can afford to be far more restrained and reasonable. Mr MCMuHan-They failed that test.",81
246,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"-No, actually they were. Mr MCMullan-Not him!",81
247,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"No, you will recollect that they had nothing to do with any of this. Would they sack Australian workers? 'No,' said the Prime Minister, 'we do not have anything like that on our plate. We would not contemplate that for a minute. We would not do anything like that.' Then we had Mr Reith out there saying, 'I am sitting down with the waterside workers. I am having a chat to them. I am here as an open-minded fellow. We are very happy to hear what they are prepared to do. We are going to put positions to them with integrity.' A key part of this interventionist strategy is that the MUA should be caught by surprise. Then it goes to this---{)l1e of the most deceitful and mendacious sentences in it: To this end, it would be quite appropri.ate to the unions wondering whether the government would settle for an evolutionary approach. Then we get the Prime Minister coming out and saying, 'The only reason we have this dispute now before us is that the workers have rejected a whole set of reasonable propositions from Patrick and a whole set of reasonable propositions from us, and will not sit down and talk to us.' But at the very beginning of this trouble, before those negotiations took place and the enterprise agreements resulted in the latter part of this year, the government was telling Patrick and everybody else, 'String them along until we have in place the position that we want to set them up in.' We had the Prime Minister saying on 13 February this year-almost a year after this document was produced: We don't seek a hugc national barney with the MUA over this. Wc never have .... But it would be preferable for any major dispute to be one which the government has planned in accord'ance with its own timetable. When you go through all of those statements by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), what possible confidence can any Australian have in anything they say to them? In particular, what possible confidence can they have when there has been a point of disagreement with objectives by the government at any particular point of time, be it with ACOSS, on where you might intend to take a tax policy, or be it in regard to the Business Council and where you might intend to take industrial relations? What this public now knows about this government is that, whenever they sit down with the waterfront unions, there is a high likelihood of a sub-agenda that is utterly deceitful and driven by Liberal Party prejudice. Their sub-agenda is ideologically driven by the bitterness of 13 years in opposition during which they sat like Rip Van Winkles as Australia passed them by. This is their desperate effort to take Australia back to being the divided, disunited community that it was when they were last in office. This is what everybody can anticipate from this keep government. This is the basis on which this government has engaged Australians in the past. Then there are the minister's statements in which he said, 'Oh, no, we haven't spent any money on this. No, there's a few consultants out there. In so far as there are consultants, we have spent money on their eonsultancies. But all that bunch is doing is firing up options to us. They're presenting the facts to us. They're talking to us about the awful occupational health and safety problems of the waterfront. That's what we're spending the money on-not on anything else. No, we haven't spent a cent of money on planning an industrial dispute. We don't know that there are industrial disputes out there. We haven't spent any money on engaging in any planning at all. Others might be planning, but we aren't. We have no part of that. That is not us.' Then, when we pick up this document, what do we read? It says: There will need to be a small team of people to undertake the necessary planning and activities. Some of these people could be full time with others working initially on a part-time basis, but to be made full time if required. The skills would need to include a strategic thinker with IR experience, a good lawyer, basic research intelligence, law and order, public relations, business liaison and a person with practical experience. Security will be critical with information shared on a need-to-know basis. There will have to be close liaison with major stevedoring companies throughout the process. Finally, the situation will need to be kept constantly under review with scope to alter the strategy if circumstances change. In particular, there will need to be constant monitoring of the commitment of the key parties and the actions of the MUA. They need the John Deans for legal work, the Chuck Colsons for the dirty tricks and the Gordon Liddys for the break-in capacitypeople to keep these folk under surveillance. Can you think of a more un-Australian approach to public affairs? We pride ourselves on a sense of democracy and openness in relationships between the elected governing representatives and the people who put them there-all the people who put them there, whether those people happen to have voted for the representatives or not. That is what is reasonably anticipated by the Australian public, and that is what they have not got from this government. This has been an extraordinary episode. The minister is attempting to clothe himself with his last fig leaf. In defeating him utterly, the waterfront unions have signed up to a best endeavours effort to achieve his targets. But what paltry targets. Most of the targets were being achieved anyway. In a couple of ports they were not, and they have now signed up to best endeavours. Let me tell you this: there is not a single dam thing that has been achieved that could not have achieved by the so-called evolutionary approach. Indeed, there is nothing in this document to suggest otherwise-nothing at all. What did we get when we were in office? We got a 75 per cent improvement in crane rates. Mr Tanner interjecting",81
248,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for Melbourne will remain silent. Mr Tanner interjecting,82
249,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I warn the member for Melbourne.,82
250,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"We got world hest practice on the movement of bulk cargo, which just happens to be 60 per cent of our exports. More than 4,000 stevedores exited the waterfront. Compare that to the few hundred who are leaving now. Compare that to the improvement in crane rates at a couple of ports if best endeavours of 20 to 25 per cent are achieved. And that is it. That is what has been achieved. The government are trying to dress it up by a few other mechanisms. They say that the waterfront workers have settled for an annualised income. The waterfront workers put a proposal on the table on day one that they would settle for that. They have settled for an annualised income. They said they put that proposal on the table on day one of the negotiations. The government have settled for 400 watersiders leaving the waterfront. The waterfront workers' opening position was 200. What have we had since this government put its creepy hands all over this? That word 'creepy' is llsed advisedly in this regard. It relates to the committee for re-election of the president. What they managed to achieve was what could have been achieved before they even started negotiating. Half of what was achieved was put on the table as an ambit claim by the waterfront unions before negotiations began. Really! The minister has clothed himself in some heroic position in his desperate efforts to find some joy in the misery he has inflicted on himself-the same misery he has inflicted on everyone else. All he has emerged with are false claims and utter dishonesty. Here we have it: Watergate, the Gordon Liddys, the E. Howard Hunts, the John Deans and the many party room deep throats grassing to his enemies and leaking nightly to the. press in the faint hope of snatching some honour from the noisome episode which has enmeshed you and enmeshed your Prime Minister as they seek to have a piece of his carcass before he goes on the way out. This Prime Minister cannot be trusted. This minister cannot be and is not trusted by anybody in the Australian community. This is an episode of infamy in the history of the politics of this nation, not just in the industrial relations history of this nation. This is an episode that puts massive discredit on the governing process and makes our people insecure. That is what it does. Prime Minister, you should be censured for it, you hopeless case. (Time expired) Ml' SPEAKER-Is the motion seconded? Mr Tanner--I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",82
251,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"The government rejects this vacuous motion from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). The Leader of the Opposition has moved this motion after the dispute has been settled because he has had a very bad day. He has had a bad day because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) yesterday was able to secure the passage of the government's native title amendment legi slation. When the rest of Australia has appreciated that the waterfront dispute has been settled for a couple of weeks now, why is it that the opposition today come in and ask questions about it? We who have been around politics long enough know that, when you are having a bad day, you set up a distraction. This is a distraction for the opposition which have for months been hoping to stir social division on the question of Wik and which are now disappointed by the fact that the Prime Minister has sccured an honourable compromise and, therefore, the passage of that legislation. Rather than the Prime Minister being the subject of a censure motion, I think the Australian community today will be congratulating and applauding him for his leadership in achieving a tremendous breakthrough on what has really been a difficult and longrunning issue for the Australian community. I congratulate the PM on a job well done. He has applied the authority of his office to achieve an outcome which is good for farmers and for miners-which means that it will be good for investment and for jobs-which is fair to indigenous Australians in the treatment of their rights and which provides a system where people are treated equally. That is a huge step forward on the Wik issue and it is largely due to the authority and the negotiating skills of the Prime Minister. So the first thing to be said about this censure motion is that it is just a distraction. It is these sorts of political games that politicians, particularly those in opposition, play that attract people to vote for people like Pauline Hanson. The public see through these silly games and it only puts them off the major political parties. The second reason why the opposition have gone on the attack on this issue is that they are embarrassed at the government's success on waterfront reform. As an indication of that, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'There will be a reduction of only 400 in the manning levels of Patrick.' That, of course, is not true. The expected redundancies, as agreed between Patrick and the MUA, are about 743. That is the agreed number. That number will come down in net terms because some people will pick up jobs with the national finn which will end up with the contracting-out maintenance job. There might be 80 people in that, so the 743 will come down to 650 or a figure of that order. The figure is important because it demonstrates that you can run the Patrick organisation with half the people you had at the start of the dispute. That demonstrates in tum that we have had massive overmanning in this organisation, which is the point that we have made all along. The details of the agreement show that this operation can be run much more efficiently-and that is a benefit which is then passed on to consumers and to producers alike. For example, in the agreement there is an agreement to aholish what are known as double-headers. Double-headers is the infamous rort whereby people are paid double time and a half and can, therefore, earn incomes up to $90,000 and more a year. Prior to the start of this dispute, you could be a crane driver and earn $90,000 a year for sitting on the crane 14 hours a week. I am pleased to be able to say to the House that those days are over. They are over because the agreement contains a requirement that there be one man per machine---Dne man, one machine. That is commonplace in every other industry in Australia, except on the Australian waterfront. So it is the end of a crane driver working 14 hours a week for $90,000. That is no more. One of the other problems was that, because they had twice as many people than they needed to run the operation, a lot of people would say, 'I might as well be paid for sitting at home because there is no job for me here to do.' So, instead of having one person per machine, you would have two people per machine and what would the other one do? They used to nick off. That is why they call it the nick off. They go home and still get paid-and, if they were on a double-header, they would be getting paid double time and a half. lt is a pretty good deal. The Labor Party said, 'We fixed it all.' What a complete nonsense. We have abolished the nick. We have abolished double-headers. We have imposed one man, one machine. That is a revolution on the Australian waterfront. Mr Hardgrave--They've all nicked off now.",83
252,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"The opposition have all nicked off now, exactly; they cannot help themselves. From the government's perspective, in the reform agenda, I do not mind saying that we did not get absolutely everything we wanted. So what? That's life. You do not always get what you want. But 1 will tell you that we have the biggest set of reforms now about to be put in place on the Australian waterfront since containerisation started in 1969. As far as the freedom of association provisions are concerned, the union has acknowledged that in the agreement. It is actually in writing in the agreement with Patrick. Secondly, we do have contracting out. Anybody with real experience and understanding of what happens in industrial relations would know that it is the case that contracting out breaks down the position of a monopoly or a closed shop. So legally it is broken and, 1 think, also technically it is broken in the sense that those people who have been in the MUA who end up in maintenance will end up in the AMWU anyway, so that is technically a breach of the union shop. Thirdly, 1 think the changes are significant because the union will never be what it once was. Part of that is because a lot of the older members of the union are going to retire, including the leadership of it, and also because they have now got half the members. They have spent a lot of their stockpile on legal fees and in future they will have half the income coming in off the SUbscriptions. They will not, therefore, be in a position to exercise the industrial muscle which they have used in the past to maintain, or some times to grab back, their perks. One of the ironies of this dispute is that, whilst the union has been bucking and reluctant to undertake any change, in the end it is going to sign an agreement which is under our legislation-the Workplace Relations Act. Under our law, which they will have to abide by like everybody else-which is a change for the MUA-once you have entered into an agreement, you are not to take industrial action during the Hfe of that agreement. That is another curtailment on this union, which in the past has had the record of having taken on average nine times the level of industrial action compared with the national average, which is one reason why we have had such poor levels of productivity on the Australian waterfront. They are far too often not at work, far too often on the nick, far too often taking strike action. That is much more difficult now for them to do. lt has been an incredible achievement and it will go down as one of the significant micro-economic reform achievements of this government. 1 do not mind saying it has been a bruising, battling, difficult dispute, and that is the way of the MUA. The MUA is the successor union, amongst others, to the painters and dockers-and they are a pretty tough crowd to deal with. You have to be prepared to be pretty tough in dealing with them. We as a government always had an expectation that they would take national industrial action against an incoming coalition government-and we were not the only ones to have that expectation. Therefore, when we came into office we had a national responsibility to make sure that we were prepared for any dispute that they might want to pull-and we make no apology for that. If you elect a national government, part of their responsibility is to ensure that, if there is an argument, the ports are kept open and business and jobs are not lost as a result. Why would the Labor Party be surprised at that? They faced exactly the same thing when they were in office. They are full of these conspiratorial claims. I thought Pauline Hanson was the only one full of conspiracies. Conspiracies are catching on in the national parliament, the whole front bench of the Labor Party have got conspiracies coming out of their ears. The Leader of the Opposition today said it was basically part of the government's plot to ask the Productivity Commission to give a report on productivity levels on the waterfront- 'If you ask them, part of the conspiracy is that they will tell you how bad the waterfront is.' This is pathetic from a leader of an opposition; what a pathetic claim to make. Of course we had a productivity problem on the Australian waterfront. In a sense, you do 'not need a Productivity Commission to tell you, but it is sensible to get independent, authoritative advice on the state of the problem so that, as you address the problems, you are fixing the things that need to be fixed. Is that a conspiracy? I do not think it is. You talk about conspiracies. Back in 1991 the then Labor government, according to a senior member of the Labor Party then, actually considered a range of options which included using the armed services to man the wharves. They are accusing us of conspiracy! The federal cabinet, when Labor was in office in 1991, were actually having a discussion about bringing on the troops. I have had plenty of letters from people saying, 'Why don't you put in the troops?' but this government never had a cabinet discussion saying to the Minister for Defence, 'When can you get regiment No. 1 down to the wharves?' That is laughable. And in 1994, when they were trying to sell off ANL, there was a national strike. What did the Labor Party do? They got some advice-what a conspiracy that is. What was the advice they got? The advice they got included cancelling the MUA's awards and agreements. Mr Tanner-So what!",84
253,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"I am glad he says, 'So what!' It is good that you say that because since these documents were revealed we have had confirmation from Labor frontbenchers that you actually had a subcommittee, exactly the same way that we did, and you considered some of exactly the same issues. Why would we be surprised in the end about that? Because, in the pilots dispute, you cancelled their awards, you brought in foreign workers, you forced people onto individual agreements, you deregistered the union and you brought in the troops-you brought in the air forceto fix a union dispute. What incredible hypocrisy! This document that the Labor Party have brought in today is dated April. A few weeks ago we had a cabinet document dated July. This predates the July document, so there is hardly anything new in it. The interesting thing is that I asked how many questions the Labor Party had asked me on the waterfront up until the date they dropped that document. Do you know how many they had asked through what they say is the greatest betrayal since",85
254,Unknown,PRIME MINISTER,Government members interjecting,85
255,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"Record all interjections ! Yes, it was the greatest dispute since time immemorial, the greatest betrayal, the greatest this, the greatest that. How many questions were there? Six questions. Today I get three questions-three questions in one day. What a bonanza! This is giving me a chance to finish off on a high. Thank you very much. The fact is that there have been discussions about alternative labour supplies in the event of a national strike on the Australian waterfront for as long as anybody can remember. I remember that, when I was first a minister, the then member for Gilmore told me that P&O had a plan to bring in foreign workers. Was this a conspiracy, a secret plan, to break the law? No, it was not. Why wasn't it? Because it was being publicly talked about. In August 1997, it was reported: Richard Hind, the Managing Director of P&O Australia, one of the two major stevedoring firms operating Australian wharves confirmed yesterday a plan to use foreign crane drivers had been drawn up for some time but declined to give details. 'It is always an option. We would have to bring in another work force with some expertise.' Mr Hardgrave-What a big secret!",85
256,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,What a big secret and big breach of the law. And the Labor Party is in here today saying this is a conspiracy. You ought to take a redundancy package with the MUA. This is a truly pathetic operation.,86
257,Mr KERR,PRIME MINISTER,And a cover-up.,86
258,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"And a cover-up as well! This government has had the guts to do something about an issue that for years needed to have something done about it. When Labor was in, in the end they always just caved in. They say, 'Oh, we had the same advice but didn't do anything about it.' That was problem for 13 years. The fact is that the union ran rings around you. You were a document. disgrace. The Labor Party were bought off by the MUA, because they had been making donations to the Labor Party for years, so they could nick off and so people could go enjoying double-headers. We reject this censure motion. It is one of the most pathetic censure motions ever moved in the national parliament. The shadow minister ought to get up and explain why he has been opposed to reform. We reject it out of hand. (Time expired)",86
259,Mr TANNER,PRIME MINISTER,"Melbourne) (3.52 p.m.)We now have the smoking gun. The final piece of the puzzle is in place. We have now got the precise details of everything that gone on in this whole disgraceful episode create over the past 18 months---everything that government has been involved in, everything that it has had to do with orchestrating dismissal of 2,000 Australian workers. I ask you to think back a bit and think of all the light and colour there has been in all this dispute. Think of all the things that have occurred. We have had the Dubai episode, the dogs and the batons and the goons on the waterfront and all those things. Just think about the fact that this document that we have revealed today was actually created in April 1997, long before any of the high-profile spectacular events occurred. What this docuwhat ment reveals is that the origins of the events of April 1998 go back at least as far as April 1997. What it shows is that this government got advice, that it approved the interventionist strategy that was contained in that advice and that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was directly involved in organising this exercise. He wrote to the minister for transport at the time, Mr Sharp--another expert on the nickand said, 'This is approved. The interventionist strategy is approved.' What I ask you to do is to compare what was in that document, the nature of the strategy that was approved, with what actually happened. Take a step back from all of the high-profile events, all of the exciting things that have occurred, all the things that have we been great TV and great media coverage, the outrageous events though they may be, and compare what happened with what is in the Let us have a look at what the Prime Minister approved. He approved a strategy that that says, 'We will deliberately provoke a on massive dispute with the Maritime Union of Australia at a time and on an issue of our choosing. We will create the dispute and we will sublimate the interests of public policy on other issues, such as the sale of a major asset, ANL, to the need to create, to engineer, to manufacture, this dispute.' Then it says, 'We will encourage and we will assist the stevedoring company involved to sack its entire work force, not on the basis of their individual characteristics or performance but has sack every last man jack of them. We will and orchestrate the dispute in order that this they can do it. We will make sure that the MUA does not realise this is happening. We the will lie to them. We will keep them strung along. We will make them think that, ""I am Peter Reith, I am the nice guy. Forget about John Sharp. I am the person you can deal with. I am realistic, I am practical,"" and we will string them along. But we are going to catch them by surprise.' What they did was to create a small team, as they described it very disingenuously, of people including a strategic thinker, a lawyer and an intelligence person. I am not quite sure that is a reference to but, nonetheless, there is an intelligence person there. This small team would be funded to the tune of $2 million, courtesy of the approval of the Prime Minister, and it would engage in detailed planning and implementation of this strategy. I ask you to think about some of the quotes from this document, which today we have seen the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) deal with so dismissively. I quote: The most likely scenario would involve using an element of the Government's maritime reform agenda, eg ANL, or an event arising out of the application of the Workplace Relations Act, to bring about a national stoppage. To bring about a national stoppage-not to respond to a national stoppage but to bring about, to cause, to engender one. Then: The stevedores would use this opportunity to sack their existing work force and restatt their operations with a new non-union work force. Then: It would be preferable for any major dispute to be one for which the Government has planned in accordance with our timetable. And: We need to further develop plans to involve the MUA in a dispute on an issue and at a time of our choosing. It is very straightforward. This government was planning, it was orchestrating, it was organising, a dispute. It was not planning how it might respond to a dispute; it was saying, 'How can we create one? We want to create a cataclysmic dispute with the Maritime Union of Australia.' This was the minute of the conspiracy to do it. This document was formally approved within the Prime Minister's office. It was created in his office and he approved it as the basis for a plan to cause that dispute, to create that dispute, in order that 2,000 Australian workers could be sacked. It is very clear from this document that this was all done for political reasons, for political payback and revenge against the Maritime Union. The so-called evolutionary strategy, the alternative to the interventionist strategy, is discussed. Why is it rejected? Because it would not produce results within this parliamentary term. What is that code for? 'We won't get any results before an election. We are under pressure from various sections of the business community to show that we are strong, that we are hairy-chested, on this issue; so we are not interested in negotiations, we are not interested in trying to work constructively and productively with the union, port users, shipping companies and the like because that will not give us any outcomes before the next election.' In other words, 'We are prepared to create possibly the biggest dispute in recent Australian history, with all of the consequences that that entails, purely in order to ensure that we can go to the next election with a bit of a big bang showing that we have had a hairy chest on the waterfront. So it is all for political reasons. We turn to the next delightful quote, the surprise agenda: A key part of the interventionist strategy is that the MUA should be caught by surptise. To this end it may be quite appropriate to keep the unions wondering whether the government would settle for an evolutionary approach. In other words, deceit. That is what this is: deceit. It is simple, pure deceit-no more and no less. Do you remember the new Minister for Industrial Relations, as he then was, standing up and saying, 'I am a reasonable person. I negotiate with everybody, I talk with everybody. I'll sit down and talk with John Coombs and Greg Com bet for hours.' Then he complained that they walked out of one of those discussions. They knew what they were dealing with. They had every reason to walk out, because they were dealing with a snake, with someone who was not bona fide, somebody who was there to deliberately deceive them and to ensure that they were not dealing in an honest environment where people could actually put their cards on the table. Think of some of the deceit that has been part of this overall pattern: the doorstop interview at Treasury Place that the minister did on 8 May where he said, 'No-one to my knowledge had any knowledge of any plans, nor did anyone have any plans of which we were aware. The answer is no, absolutely not.' He tries to obfuscate over this and suggest that this was a question about the Dubai exercise. It was not. This was in answer to a question, 'What did you know about Patrick's plans to sack its entire work force?' Straightforward. That is what the question was. His answer: 'Didn't know a thing.' Yet what we see in this document, which he knew of, which his name is on, which the Prime Minister approved, is a quote that says: Patrick's have: 'embarked on planning for a major dispute during which they would sack their work force and recommence operations using alternative labour'. What does that tell us? Is there any possible way that those two statements can be reconciled? The answer is no; the minister lied, he lied blatantly, he lied outrageously to the Australian people on 8 May.",86
260,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will withdraw that.,88
261,Mr TANNER,PRIME MINISTER,"It is a censure motion, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am allowed to say that.",88
262,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,So it is. You are; you are right.,88
263,Mr TANNER,PRIME MINISTER,"Let us look at the Prime Minister's statements. He is not about getting the MUA: 'We've never advocated attacking the union.' Yet this document says that they are planning to bring in a new non-union work force-not a work force where people have the right to choose, as they claim, but a new non-union work force. Then there is the question of money. The minister says on 4 June this year, 'Basically the funds that we've expended on this were about obtaining leports, consultancies'which are an issue in themselves. 'Basically they were only about consultancies; no big deal. ' Yet he knew-and in fact he had reported to cabinet-that a small team had been created to implement their plan, and the Prime Minister had approved $2 million to fund that small team. That was substantially more than the $1.3 million that they had approved for consultancies. Yet he still tells this parliament, 'Basically, the only money we have spent is on reports.' That is another absolute, outrageous lie. We go to 22 October last year: 'We are prepared to sit with people and constructively talk. We'll listen to anybody. ' Yet the document tells us what was really in his mind, which was: 'We're going catch the MUA by surprise.' Again, another lie to this parliament and another lie to the Australian people. Their only defence in all of this-and it comes through time after time in response to every question and in every speech that is made-is that they are in favour of waterfront reform. We hear it ad infinitum-endless, gross exaggeration about how bad things have been and how good they are now. What does that tell you? It tells you that their defence to these accusations is that the end justifies the means. That is their only defence: the end justifies the means. Think back to the events; think back to the cargo that has been held up, to the massive damage that was caused by the dispute, to the damage to the families of those workers as a result of the time thcy were unemployed, to the damage to the poor workers of P&C Stevedores, who were conned and led to believe they were going to be looked after by the government, Chris Corrigan and the NFF and who have now just been discarded. They do not care about any of that because they say the end justifies the means-and it is all organised by the government. The whole tawdry, outrageous, disgraceful conspiracy is all organised by the government. This is something that Labor is alleged to have considered. His main defence was, 'You actually had a committee talking about waterfront reform.' So what? Yes, Labor had a cabinet committee dealing with these issues and, yes, it did receive some form of advice which had some rather hair-raising propositions in it. But was the advice sought with respect to those specific proposals? No. Did the Labor minister say, 'I want advice about how to sack thousands of workers?' No. That advice may have been given, but was it sought and was it acted on? No and no. The key point in this whole issue-which I think, unfortunately, many commentators are missing because of the heat and light associated with Dubai, the dogs, the lies and all of those things-is: what was this government actually doing? What have been the actions of this government? What has it been doing? Not just its state of knowledge, not just whether this parliament has been lied tothese are all issues-but what has this government actually been doing? That is the critical issue. The full enormity of this government's actions in this instance has not been properly acknowledged. We have a government that is conspiring to engineer, create and manufacture one of the biggest industrial disputes in Australia's history-not responding to it, not working out how to deal with it but conspiring to bring it on, to create it. To sack 2,000 Australian workers, it is creating an industrial dispute which could have been far greater in proportion and far greater in impact than it actually was, and that impact was substantial as it was. It has developed a strategy, it has funded it, it has prepared it and it has progressed it in secret-with taxpayers' moneyand it has lied all the way through to the Australian people about what it is doing. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business is supposed to resolve disputes. He is supposed to prevent disputes. He is supposed to ensure that people can go about their business. Here we have the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business conspiring to cause a disputeorchestrating a dispute-and not just preparing for battle with a union, knowing that a dispute is going to happen, but actually saying, 'We can create this issue as the basis for the dispute and we can cause the timing to be about this time. Here is how we will go about it: we will have a small team that will actually implement all of this.' I do not think that many people have fully realised just how outrageous this proposition actually is. This government is completely beyond the pale. This document is the final piece of the jigsaw in this exercise. It shows we have a sneaky, mendacious, vicious government that is using all of the levers of power that it has been eyeing off for years. It has finally got its hands on them and it is now endeavouring to use all of the levers of power to get its enemies. This is about attacking a union that it has hated for many years. This government has hated the maritime union, and this whole exercise has been about abusing the power that elected government gives you in this country in order to get that union and its members. As I say, I do not believe that people really fully understand how extreme this behaviour actually is. Yes, the dogs, the batons and all of those things are outrageous. Yes, the Dubai exercise was outrageous. But the real ly outrageous thing in this exercise is that you have a government of Australia that is dcliberately conspiring to orchestrate a massive industrial dispute in order to sack 2,000 Australian workers. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said, this has all the hallmarks of the Nixon White House: the paranoia, the lawbreaking, the secrecy, the misuse of power; and it has even got a minister that looks like John Erlichman. It has got the whole lot all in one.",88
264,Mr KERR,PRIME MINISTER,And the cover-up.,89
265,Mr TANNER,PRIME MINISTER,"And, as the honourable member for Denison points out, the cover-up. This document reveals that this minister and this Prime Minister are unfit to hold public office. They stand condemned before this parliament for orchestrating, for creating, for manufacturing one of the most extraordinary industrial disputes that this country has seen. They stand condemned for that and they should retreat from public life in this country because they are not fit to hold public office.",89
266,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"It is a matter of fact that when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) found that he no longer had the support of the voters of Swan he packed his bag and got Wendy Fatin to resign so that he could run down to the seat of Brand. But the seat of Brand adjoins the seat of Fremantle, held by Carmen Lawrence. As a result of this close geographic association, the Leader of the Opposition has caught the Lawrence disease: he has lost his memory. He has amnesia. He has forgotten what he and Bob Hawke did to the pilots. At the time they painted a picture of all these guys on $100,000 a year when 90 per cent of pilots in general aviation around Australia were lucky to get $30,000 a year. But they dealt with the lot of them. He has forgotten what plans his government had to deal with the waterfront, and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has advised him of that because all their documentation is now down at the court. He has forgotten that his government actually spent-it was not a loan arrangement-$130 million trying to sort out the waterfront and he seems to have forgotten that the 4,000 jobs he said he got rid of all came back as casuals. He has forgotten his un-Australian breach of promises on taxes after the 1993 election. Anybody who can stand up in this place and claim one iota of credibility after those actions in 1993 is a hypocrite of the highest order. He has forgotten that it was his party in government that introduced competition policy and bludgeoned the state Premiers into implementing it. His colleagues run around here day after day as though we invented and implemented it. Mr Martin-What?",89
267,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"Beazley's amnesia. He can't remember that. He has forgotten his and his government's actions when they introduced progressive and massive tariff reductions. Why did they do that? They did it because they did not have the guts to front industrial relations reform up-front, so they put the workers out of work and bludgeoned them into accepting their form of workplace agreements. That was their tactic and they have forgotten. If not, they are lying by their interjection. You reduced the tariffs, you caused all the job losses and you knew what you were up to. He has forgotten that he sold the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas and spent the money. I think he has even forgotten that he and his government borrowed $75,000 million using the kids of Australia as security and nearly destroyed the Australian economy. Mr Latham-What about the waterfront?",90
268,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"I'll tell you about the waterfront. You have the most selective memory in the country when you come in here and pontificate and carryon. We know what you did. We saw you do it to the pilots, we saw you do it to the workers through tariffs, and you did it deliberately. They say, 'What about the waterfront?' Let us get down to the fundamentals of the Patrick dispute. At mass mcetings around Australia, hundreds and hundreds of MUA members met and decided-surprise, surprise!-that about two-thirds of their numbers could continue to deliver the services of Patrick Stevedores, and quicker. That is what they decided. You can conclude from that that all the time they knew that their operation was grossly overmanned. What else did they know about that? They knew that in that process they were killing off the jobs of other Australians. They thought that, through their stranglehold on such a sensitive part of the Australian economy, they had a prior right to big dollars and job security at a cost to other people who were unemployed. They thought that they had a right to $90,000 a year and 14 hours of work a week, adding to the cost of working women when they went shopping. That is what they did. They thought that they had a right to gain economic rent from people who were trying to export from this country. The Leader of the Opposition tells us that they fixed the bulk ports. The NFF and the Wheat Board fixed the bulk ports and you never had a hand in it. Mr Latham-This is just gobbledegook.",90
269,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"It's gobbledegook, is it? All right. Let me remind you of what I just said: the members of the MUA did not get up one after another and say, 'We can't manage, this will be a disaster.' They all put their hands up; they all voted that two-thirds of their number could continue all the services that were previously supplied by 100 per cent of their work force and, what is more, they agreed to lift the crane rate. That is what they voted for. You cannot deny that. That is not gobbledegook. You are just demonstrating your embarrassment. Your own MUA members have admitted that they have been conning the Australian community. That has been the outcome. Mr Latham-You're against economic rationalism.",90
270,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"There we go. The fundamental facts proven by the vote of the MUA workers are that the Australian waterfront was grossly overmanned and that was building through the cost structure not only in waterfront charges but also in freight rates. The highly expensive ships of today were being delayed in the ports and ship owners were putting up their freight rates. What must necessarily arise from that? The first question in those circumstances was: was it appropriate for a government to intervene? The answer must be yes. Those people who were shopping at K Mart and those who were unemployed were relying on the government to address this outrage. The second question in those circumstances was: how might I address this in the known circumstances of the behaviour of the MUA? I am not talking about some mystical supposition; I am talking about hardcore history. Let me give you a simple example of secret. unAustralianism. The Western Australian government let a tender to a new entrant the Fremantle waterfront. The man had the capacity to unload state ships him the contract. God almighty-it was about one ship a fortnight! And because he would not guarantee the employment workers, the MUA closed down Australia. They did not just close down the Port of Fremantle or the Port of Kwinana; they closed down Australia. And you are arguing that government seeking to redress a Australian people should have come out and said, 'John Coombs, come to our meetings. We are going to talk about how we are going ments. to change the structure on the waterfront.' I have given you an example of how they operated. Your government had the temerity to say, and I might say it almost in a whisper, 'I think we should sell the Australian National Line.' And what was the response of the MUA? They closed down Australia-nothing moved. We have had the member for Melcracy. bourne (Mr Tanner) saying that we have just had the worse set of industrial action in the world. It was the worse for the MUA, but ships were being loaded and unloaded every day of that dispute. That was not your time. When you guys tried to do anything on the waterfront other than throw buckets of money at them, they closed Ausyou tralia down-and you are trying to tell this parliament that a responsible government should not have met in secrecy to decide how they were going to deal with that matter. Mr Martin-So they did meet in secret?",90
271,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"Of course they did, and I am saying that it would be damned stupid if they did not. They had to-and you did when you discussed these matters. Mr Martin-They deny it.",91
272,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"No, they do not deny it. They have denied one thing. They have denied that they had any direct knowledge of the Dubai arrangements-and what a farce that is on your behalf. Mr Martin-You just said they met in",91
273,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"Of course they met in in secret, and the secrecy would have continued if you blokes had not been around stealing and they gave cabinet documents.",91
274,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I think the two members of MUA might desist their dialogue.,91
275,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,You are a mob of thieves.,91
276,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I suggest the honourable a member for O'Connor might direct his rewrong on the marks through the chair.,91
277,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,You stole cabinet docuMr Martin-No-one has done that.,91
278,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"But, anyhow, we have yours in the courts now, and you tell us they are different. When our party gets advice from the bureaucracy, you invariably tell this House that that is our policy. When you get advice from the bureaucracy, you say, 'Oh, no, that was only advice from the bureauThat was only an options paper.' What a load of garbage! It is an options paper for the Liberal Party if it is written by a public servant, and it is an options paper for the Labor Party. If it is not, it is policy for you the case in and it is policy for us. But do not bring this garbage in here where fellows want to rewrite history, as you have on competition policy, on tariffs and on privatisation. You have done all that. You have rewritten history. But you have a problem: everything in this place is a matter of record, and let me remind you that I have not forgotten anything you did in those 13 years. My memory will never be changed on all this. So what did the government do? The government put a strategy in place to ensure the people of Australia were protected from these arrangements. It is said to us that that was a strategy to sack people because they were in a union. No; it was a strategy to replace bludgers with a group of people who would do a bit of work. Why oh why, in the context of Australia, would it ever be that any employer seeking to give people some job training would have to contemplate sending them to another country? Webb Dock proved to us why you had to do it. When you people stopped that process-Dl', in other words, when you called upon the international unions as you did when you called upon them to refuse to load good Australian freight in America-what did you do? You had pickets at the front of Webb Dock and you had pickets wherever else you could. You abused those people in the most outrageous way when they just wanted to be trained to get a job. Mr Martin-What did you do? You put the dogs in.",91
279,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for Cunningham will remain silent!,92
280,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,You know why they had dogs there? They had dogs there to protect themselves.,92
281,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for O'Connor will direct his remarks through the chair.,92
282,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"They had dogs there to protect themselves from the members of the painters and dockers. Tell me why the minister had to have two guards follow his wife around? Tell me why the federal minister in this process had to have the Federal Police protect him other than that some of your union members would have shot him if they could have got the chance? Why did they have dogs? They had dogs to protect themselves from the sorts of capers that went on. That is a fact, and it is proven by their actividreadful ties. Mr Martin-Put a poodle in there, not a rottweiler ",92
283,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"1 challenge you to cancel your union membership and go down to the port and try to drive a crane, and see if people do not start chucking rocks through your house window. I challenge you to do it. You know the sort of response you would get, and you know why it was considered necessary to have guards inside the premises-to save the property. That is the reality, and do not give me that sort of garbage that people were not going to get punched up.",92
284,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I suggest that the member for O'Connor might direct his remarks to the motion before the chair and ignore the member for Cunningham.,92
285,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"Mr Speaker, you might like to tell me, from your long experience in this place, how difficult it has been for a government to 'negotiate' and have an 'evolutionary process' with the MUA. You boast of a victory. There have been no victories for the workers in the MUA. There have been no victories for the people in all of this. The only victory has been for John Coombs. He and his union bureaucrats still have jobs. John still has his first-class trip to England for the International Transport Federation meeting which-surprise, surprise-is on at the same time as Wimbledon. Did you ever go, Martin?",92
286,Mr KERR,PRIME MINISTER,John Howard went via the Lords Test.,92
287,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"And you criticised it, but now you are trying to defend Coombs. Don't give me rubbish! If you want to stand over there and not be called a hypocrite, do not criticise people for things you do yourself. Don't do it. You do it too often. You set out to kill off Colston and you dragged your own people down and you dragged the reputation of this whole parliament down, and your leader was on again the other day talking about some pay rise for politicians. You have done a lot in opposition to destroy the reputation of yourselves and your colleagues and everyone else as individuals, and for what? For a little tiny bit of political gain. You are people in the way that you behave. (Time expired) Question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Rt Hon.

288,Mr CREAN,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, in the light of revelations in the parliament today and the documents that we tabled, would you examine whether a prima facie case exists of a misleading of this parliament by both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), and whether a reference to the Privileges Committee is warranted?",93
289,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"It is very serious and profound question for any parliament to consider whether a breach of privilege has in any way been perpetrated. I, on the surface, can see no basis for the allegation but do not intend to give a ruling superficially. The matter is a serious one of any order if that question is raised. I will examine the issue and respond further to the House in due course. Mr Crean-Can you give us an indication as to when that response will be made?",93
290,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,As soon as possible; I do not know when. GREAT HALL: TAPESTRY,94
291,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Some members may know that I have been very keen to get the tapestry completed in the Great Hall. Members may therefore be interested to see the original Arthur Boyd design for the tapestry, which does not have the incision for the doors, which at the moment is on display on the first floor of the parliamentary building, not far from the Post Office and adjacent to the Great Hall itself. NA Reports: Government Responses",94
292,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"For the information of honourable members, I present a schedule of outstanding government responses to reports of House of Representatives and joint committees incorporating reports tabled and details of government responses made in the period between 4 December 1997, the date of the last schedule, and 1 July 1988. Copies of the schedule are being made available to honourable members and will be incorporated in Hansard. The schedule read as followsTHE SPEAKER'S SCHEDULE OF OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO COMMITNA On 25 June 1998, the Government presented its response to a schedule of outstanding Government responses to parliamentary committee reports tabled in the House of Representatives on 4 December 1997. The Government had earlier in the Parliament affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports presented during the present Parliament within three months of their presentation and to clear, as soon as possible, the backlog of reports arising from previous Parliaments. The Government's commitment follows the undertaking by successive Governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in a timely fashion. In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. The Keating Government generally responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and Government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 4 December 1997. It also lists reports for which the House has received no Government response. A schedule of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings. The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives. The Government's responses to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, the Parliame-tary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes, which are tabled by the Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. 1 July 1998 Description of Report Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (House, Standing) Torres Strait Islanders: a new deal-A report on greater autonomy for Torres Strait Islanders Review of Auditor-General's audit report No 26, 1996-97-Phase II of audit-Community development employment projects scheme: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Review of Auditor-General's audit reports No 36, 1992-93; No 1, 1993-94 Volume 3, Sections 1.13-1.39; and No 27, 1993-94, Sections 16.19-16.24 Banking, Finance and Public Administration (House, Standing) Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia's 1993-94 annual report and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's 1993-94 annual report Taxing relaxing: Report on the impact of Australia's taxation regime on the tourism industry Certain Family Law Issues (Joint, Select) Funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform (House, Standing) Planning not Patching-An inquiry into federal road funding Corporations and Securities (Joint, Statutory) Company Law Review Bill Managed Investment Bill Electoral Matters (Joint, Standing) Industrial Elections: Report of the inquiry into the role of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in conducting industrial elections The 1996 Federal Election: Report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 1996 Federal Election and matters related thereto Date of Responded in Date Tabled Government Period or Published1 Response2 Specified3 26-08-97 23-06-98 No 23-06-97 04-12-97 No 30-05-94 04-12-97 No 25-09-95 No response to No date4 27-03-95 No response to No date 5 28-11-95 03-03-98 No 24-11-97 No response to No date6 01-04-98 No response required 01-04-98 No response required 20-10-97 No response to No date7 16-06-97 08-04-98 No Description of Report Employment, Education and Training (House, Standing) Youth employment: A working solution Truancy and exclusion from school Environment, Recreation and the Arts (House, Standing) Rethinking the funding of community sporting and recreational facilities: A sporting chance Review of Auditor-General's audit report No 31 of 1995-96-Performance auditEnvironmental management of Commonwealth land: Site contamination and pollution prevention Managing Australia's World Heritage Working with the environment: Opportunities for job growth Commonwealth environmental impact assessment processes Family and Community Affairs (House, Standing) What price competition?

296,Mr REITH,TEE REPORTS,"Honourable members on the other side have a very short memory. This is a very generous offer; this would be a very generous offer compared with past practice of Labor administrations. The other point, though, to make seriously is that the Senate is intending to sit next week, and that raises the prospect that there will be amendments to legislation and, therefore, a necessity for the House of Representatives to sit again. As to when we would sit, at this stage I am not in a position to inform members. It is a function of the scheduling in the Senate. I believe that members should be considering having as much flexibility in their timetables at the end of next week or even the following Monday as is possible. The government, of course, is subject to Independents, minorities and a difficult to deal with Labor Party in the Senate. Under those circumstances, this is the best advice that I can give members at this point in time. As I say, as further information becomes available, I will make it available. NA",101

NA Report of the Constitutional Convention",101
299,Mr WILLIAMS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave- Mr Speaker, this is a statement in which you will have considerable personal interest. It gives great pleasure today to table the report of Constitutional Convention held in February this year. The convention was a unique moment in Australian history. Over the two weeks of the convention 152 Australians together to discuss the future of our country. All had Australia's best interests at heart. were concerned to progress the debate on whether or not we should become a republic. The report includes comments by the debate Chairman of the convention, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair, and the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Lalor, Barry Jones, who both take an opportunity in the report reflect on the contribution of those participated and on the emotion of the occadisplay sion. Both comment that the convention demonstrated our inherent national unity despite the wide range of views expressed. This is a view with which I wholeheartedly agree. The experience of the convention gave me a great deal of confidence in the capacity of the Australian people to play an active part in the evolution of our democratic institutions. The debate was spirited but for the most conducted with respect and goodwill. I have great confidence that the forthcoming referenAustralian dum will be held in an environment of healmillennium. thy and constructive debate. This full record of the events of the fortnight of the convention will provide an invaluable resource for anyone interested in debate about our system of government. The report is available on the convention web site. Copies will be sent to municipal and universithat, ty libraries and will be available for purchase at government bookshops. All the convention delegates will receive a copy. At the time of the convention, people all over the country gave more than a passing thought to our constitution and what change might mean. While the debates were widely reported in the media at the time, it is well worth casting an eye back over in volumes 3 and 4 of the report. The words on paper can still evoke the passion and commitment that delegates brought to their arguments for and against change. Clearly, the next steps are important. In line me with a resolution of the Constitutional Conthe vention, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has written to the state Premiers, the territory Chief Ministers, and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to seek their assistance in came developing the referendum proposal. The referendum will be our opportunity to make All a choice between the model supported at the convention and the system we currently have. r am sure there will be further robust public as the time to cast a vote draws nearer.",101
300,Mr MELHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I join the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) in welcoming the report of the to Constitutional Convention on behalf of the who opposition. The convention was a great of the nation we are and the nation we hope to become. Through the diversity and commitment of the delegates attending, the convention illustrated the strength of Australia's multicultural achievement, the interest of young people in our constitutional future, and the needs and concerns of indigenous Australians. The general public's interest in the convention emphasised the necessity to address the part questions of who we are and the type of constitutional change needed to reflect the situation at the end of the second Central to the proposition, of course, is the question of whether Australia becomes a republic and the form that republic takes. There is a need for leadership in this debate. Anyone who is familiar with Australian constitutional history is familiar with the fact unless political leadership is given across a wide spectrum, Australians are reluctant to change their constitution. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been reluctant to take a lead with this agenda but we did end up with a Constitutional Convention, albeit with only half of its members elected. The Prime Minister should be congratulated for at least that much commitment to Australia's constituthe transcripts tional future. The Constitutional Convention gave us direction on the question of constitutional change. It has clearly backed a model for constitutional change. It is up to us to respond to the direction given by the convention. The Labor Party for some time has been committed to the ideal of an Australian republic. We support the model chosen by the convention and have committed ourselves to introducing the necessary legislation, followed by a referendum to put that model to the Australian people. It is the Australian people who, in the end, will decide if we become a republic and what form it takes. But it is our duty to give Australians this chance to decide and at the earliest time possible. The Labor Party has stated its support for the outcome of the convention and welcomes the report of the convention. We have illustrated our commitment to the debate and have fully participated in it. We welcome the Attorney-General's confirmation that the coalition, if in government, will introduce the referendum proposal, but it should be sooner rather than later and clear leadership needs be given on the question which will be put to the Australian people in that referendum. The Australian people deserve a choice and they deserve to be informed of the positions of the major political parties. We urge the Prime Minister to commit his party to support the Constitutional Convention's proposed model. History has shown that ambivalence on behalf of the government of the day on these questions of constitutional change is equivalent to a negative stance. The convention has demonstrated the public's support for change and it is certain that the Australian Labor Party, if given the opportunity, will not take a backward step in supporting the decision of the Australian people to make that change. NA Political Parties",102
301,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and another from the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion. As required by standing order 107, I have selected the matter which in my opinion is the most urgent and the most important, that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Menzies, namely: The need for newly emerging registered political groups such as Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party to behave in a responsible manner by explaining their corporate structure, by avoiding the use of overseas tax havens and by not being of a basically undemocratic nature. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",103
302,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Menzies) (4.44 p.m.)Over past days and weeks and months the One Nation Party of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has projected itself throughout this land as a new, democratic grassroots force in Australian politics. It has represented itself from one coast to the other, from north to to south, as the saviour of the people, as a party that will enable ordinary Australians to have a say in their future. From the revelations that have come out over the past few days and weeks from inside the One Party Nation itself, we can see that this is a gross misrepresentation and that the party is nothing but a sham. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) pointed out today, even when policies are released by the One Nation Party, those policies are based on incorrect and unfactual statements which in a sense are saying to the Australian people, 'Believe one set of things; do not look too much into the detail.' Leaving aside the fact that the policies espoused by this party will create not one nation but two, leaving aside that these policies seem to be motivated by an intolerance of some sections of the Australian community, leaving aside that, if allowed to govern with these policies, it would wreak economic havoc on this country and the many ordinary Australians who have rushed to support One Nation-leaving aside all of these very important matters, there is one issue that goes to the heart of One Nation at the present time, and that issue is this: who controls this political party? How is it funded? Or has it become the captive of one or two individuals for their own selfish financial and personal motives? These are questions which ordinary Australians deserve to have answered for them, and they deserve to have answered for them here and now today. Because the questions have been addressed in this place over the last few days and the last few weeks, and there is essentially one person who can answer these questions. They cannot be answered, for example, by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) or by any other Independent member or by a member of the Labor Party. Indeed, they cannot be answered on this side of the chamber. There is one indisputable, unavoidable fact about this matter, that is, one person and one person only can answer these questions, and they deserve to be answered. This week a One Nation insider revealed that One Nation is not what many decent and ordinary Australians think it is. As we have read in the media over the last few weeks, Barbara Hazelton was a confidante, a friend and a personal secretary of the member for Oxley, yet she is only the latest in a long of supporters and candidates of One Nation to walk away from this movement or, in many other cases, to be pushed out for failing to toe the line in the increasingly autocratic way in which it is done. In the Herald-Sun yesterday under the heading 'Betrayal' pictures appeared of a few of those who have been disenchanted by One Nation or those who have been sacked. Barbara Hazelton, a confidante of the member for Oxley, resigned; Morrie Marsden, who has things to say about the member, was sacked; Bruce Whiteside, who started a supporters group, has been banished, told that he was no longer wanted, yet he was one of these people supporting the member for Oxley; David Thomas was sacked; even the biographer, Helen Dodd, was sacked and told to get out, presumably because something that she wanted to say did not fit into the scheme of those who are controlling One Nation. That is the central  One Nation is being exposed increasingly around this nation as something of a puppet show, a particularly violent and undesirable episode of Punch and Judy. Let us remember that Mrs Hazelton is not an operative of the Liberal Party or the Labor Party or the National Party; Mrs Hazelton was a close confidante and personal friend of the member for Oxley. Mr Martin Ferguson-She used to work for some of your mates.",103
303,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is not someone, as the member at the table, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), knows, who started out taking a view that she is opposed to what One Nation stands for. I presume by the comments and the interjection made by the honourable member at the table that he is not defending the policies of One Nation either. Let us hear what Mrs Hazelton herself said in this week's Australian. These words ought to be heard not just by all honourable members in this chamber and in the other place but also by all decent ordinary Australians. She said this: What needs to be exposed is David Oldfield's One Nation. 1 dislike using harsh language about line people-both to avoid seeming vengeful and because most people deserve the beriefit of the doubt. But the danger facing One Nation is too serious to mince words. Oldfield is a manipulative, hypnotic, hugely narcissistic individual who has taken almost complete control of Pauline's life whether she realises it or not. We have seen examples of that. Who can forget the memorable episode on television on the weekend where you had not simply the member for Oxley answering questions but also Mr Oldfield sitting beside her, crossing over and saying, 'No, this is what we really think. Let us get it right.' Could you imagine the situation in this country if the Leader of the Opposition or the Prime Minister or any minister or shadow minister-or any of us for that matter-went to a press conference and had a staff member sitting beside us saying, 'No, that is the way in which you answer the question'? What would the media say if the Prime Minister of this country went to a media conference with his senior adviser and the answers were given not by the Prime Minister but by the senior adviser? Wha- would we say about that? Yet that is precisely what happened. Mr Hockey-A ventriloquist.",104
304,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"A ventriloquist; I fully accept that interjection. We saw in yesterday's media a press conference held in a highly manipulated fashion called at 1.30 in the afternoon. Everybody around here knows that there is question time at 2 o'clock and that the ladies and gentlemen of the media have to cover question time and that members themselves are expected to go to question time. We had a 15or 20-minute speech allowing little time for any questioning about the policies that had been put forward. But that was not the end of it. The honourable member for Oxley said to the ladies and gentlemen of the media-and I wonder what treatment we would get if any of us did this'I am not going to answer questions that may be of some public importance that are taxing the minds of Australians at the present time. I am simply not going to answer any questions that have been raised about the corporate structure, the financing or any other arrangements so far as One Nation is concerned. Do not bother asking me about that. In fact, I will get angry if you ask me some questions which are legitimate questions about the democratic or otherwise nature of the party which bears my name.' These. are examples showing that what Mrs Hazelton said in the Australian this week was true. Barbara Hazelton says that there is widespread concern in One Nation about this manipulation of Pauline Hanson by David Oldfield, her adviser, and by the National Director of One Nation, David Ettridge. It would be easy to say in these circumstances that Mrs Hazelton is somebody who is just disaffected. She has left and we could simpJy say that this is what you would expect her to say in these circumstances. The member for Oxley might say, 'It is sour grapes. She has left me. We have fallen out. You do not have to take any notice of Mrs Hazelton at all.' But let us go to the actual charges that Mrs Hazelton makes. You cannot simply dismiss what this woman has said, having been a confidante of the member for Oxley and having been one of the key people in the One Nation Party, without directly answering the allegations and the charges that she has made. Unless those allegations and charges in their specific detail are answered, then those questions remain unanswercd; they remain questions which ought to bum large in the minds of Australians. Mrs Hazelton charges that Pauline Hanson has so little control of One Nation that she is unable to obtain a membership list from David Ettridge. Imagine the Prime Minister of Australia not being able to obtain a membership list of the Liberal Party. Imagine the Deputy Prime Minister not being able to obtain a membership list of the National Party. Imagine Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, not being able to obtain a membership list of the National Party. Sometimes they fall off trucks and even we find them. Mr Leo MCLeay-It will be a bit hard to get a list for the National Party.",105
305,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Even in your case sometimes they fall off trucks and we get them. But membership lists exist. Mr Melliam-How do you get into the 500 Club?,105
306,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Even those membership lists, because people are proud to be members of the 500 Club, they really are. And more and more arc joining, so don't worry. Those membership lists arc available. Imagine if it were said that the leader of a political party, even a member in a particular area, could not obtain a membership list. We even know that branches cannot speak to each other within One Nation. She charges that hundreds of people have contacted One Nation complaining about mismanagement by the head office in Manly. She gave an example of people who have joined their so-called 500 Club and have not received receipts some months later. She charges that Pauline Hanson has no control over the endorsement of candidates. She recounts how two South Australian One Nation candidates came all the way from South Australia to Canberra to seek assurance that they would not be disendorsed. Ms Hanson assured them that they would not be disendorsed; and less than two hours later they had been, by Mr Ettridge. Who has control? Mrs Hazelton charges that there is widespread concern among One Nation members about the quality of One Nation candidates for the federal election. She says the Queensland state director and others wanted to declare all positions vacant, readvertise and start again. One candidate, for example, sent a drawing of how Jesus looked when he appeared to him in 1969. She says this is not atypical of some of the people involved with this party. When Mrs Hazelton approached Ettridge to complain about this lack of quality of candidates, she received the comment, 'Don't discourage them. We need the $250 registration fee from each one of them.' She further charges that David Oldfield treats ordinary One Nation members with total contempt. He is dismissive of their policy ideas and, Mrs Hazelton says, he 'can barely conceal his revulsion for the type of people who make up One Nation'. This is Mr Oldfield, the so-called adviser. She concluded her article saying: It is painful to write these words and it is one the saddest days of my life but people need to know that One Nation has been hijacked and that people are being hoodwinked if they think Hanson is in control. People are being hoodwinked if they think that the member for Oxley is in control. These revelations have lifted the lid on the paranoid little secret society that is One Nation-David Oldfield's and David Ettridge's One Nation. The assassination video that we would like to forget but remember from late last year in which the member for Oxley was recording her thoughts for the Australian peopJe in the event that she was assassinated was the work of Mr Oldfield. It is something that you would associate with some wacky cult, not a democratic political party in Australia. But a democratic political party is not what it is. In this party, supposedly representing the grassroots of Australian society, branches of the party are forbidden to communicate with each other. David Ettridge 'guards the membership list with his life', according to Mrs Hazelton, and uses expressions constantly such as, 'He's nol our friend.' This is truly paranoid sluff. There is an issue of the funding which has been raised by my honourable colleague, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott)-the $500,000 paid by way of public funding for the Queensland election. Where has it gone? Who controls it? Can it simply be spent by the directors of One Nation Limited? Because One Nation is not structured like a normal political party; it is set up as a corporation with three directors: Mrs Hanson, Mr Ettridge and Mr Oldfield. All the other members of the party, unlike in any other political parties, are only affiliate members with no rights at all. As I said, we know that last week the biographer, Mrs Dodd, was escorted away by security guards on the orders of David Oldfield. She said: What we are seeing is a power play in One Nation. Anyone who queries or questions any aspect of administration or the running of One Nation is told by Pauline's minders that it is none of their business. I had been warned by David Oldfield the previous week not to investigate the circumstance around a dis endorsed candidate, as it of was none of my business. I replied that, as an author, I must be free to talk to any person that I choose to, and probably David didn't like my stand. If time allowed I could go on for another 15 or 20 minutes because the material on the record and the questions that are unanswered remain there. As I said, they can only be answered by one person. We have Mr Oldfield talking about the honourable member for Oxley as 'the product', and we have no doubt that when that product passes her use-by date she will be discarded. What we are looking at here is a sham. Ordinary Australians, people who are looking for answers in the problem times that we have in Australia, are being sadly deceived by One Nation. The truth is that One Nation is a sham and we ought to have an explanation from the member herself as to why these questions have not been answered. (Time expired)",105
307,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I, unlike some on the other side of the House, come to this debate with clean hands. I say that because, unlike those on the other side of the House, when I go to the ballot in the next federal election in the federal seat of Batman I will not be getting One Nation preferences. Let us have a real debate-a debate about the real issues before the House today. I regard it as the height of hypocrisy for the coalition government to point the finger at the structure of the One Nation Party when this week they voted against proposals to force full disclosure of donations to political parties. Let us not just have a debate about the corporate structure of One Nation; let us also have a debate about full disclosure of donations to all political parties. I think it is about time that the Australian public was told the real story. The real story about One Nation is not about One Nation alone; the real story about One Nation is its fellow travellers-the fellow travellers on the other side of the House who have acted hand in glove to put repressive and un-Australian policies in place over the last 29 months. They have no conscience. I think it is about time that we had a real debate; not just about the One Nation Party, but about the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the front-bench of the coalition government to lead. Let us have a real debate about the dog whistle campaign that has always been conducted by the Prime Minister. The campaign has not just been conducted since he occupied the chair opposite me this afternoon-the Prime Minister's chair-but on every occasion on which he has occupied the position of Leader of the Opposition. He has conducted a dog whistle campaign of whispers and innuendo; a campaign not all that different from the policies of One Nation. What we want is a bit of honesty. As far as I am concerned, the Prime Minister is responsible for allowing xenophobes to have the political space that they have had over the last 29 months. It is the Prime Minister who is responsible and no-one else. The Prime Minister is expected to lead the other side of the House, but he has allowed the One Nation Party of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and her xenophobe supporters to grow and grow and to occuI-!y political space in the most decent country J11 the world.",106
308,Mr CAMPBELL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: it will be necessary, in the course of this debate, for you to rule whether the present speaker is speaking for or against the motion. Could you tell me which is which?",107
309,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl)Orderl There is no point of order. There is no motion. This is a discussion.,107
310,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As I said, I believe that, unfortunately, the dog whistle campaign conducted by the Prime Minister and the One Nation political party has brought the most decent nation in the w-rld to the brink of national tragedy. I am talking about the fact that what is at stake in Australia at the moment is all our traditions-those wonderful traditions that historically all Australians have been delighted to be associated with. I am talking about such traditions as the sense of tolerance, the sense of fairness and the sense of a fair go. The problem is that, over the last 29 months, all those wonderful Australian traditions have frayed at the edge. They have not frayed at the edge because of the actions of One Nation alone; they have frayed because of the failure of the Prime Minister of Australia to stand up and be counted. The Prime Minister has failed to take up the debate. The debate is not just about organisational structures and the question of the accountability of the One Nation Party with respect to its funds. More importantly, the debate is about what the Australian nation expects at the moment: policies and solutions to the problems that confront Australia. This debate ought to be about the failure of leadership. This debate ought to be about the fact that, in essence, One Nation is in truck with the Prime Minister on all the issues that One Nation seeks to associate itself with at this particular point in time. One Nation has had a bit part in the debate and divisiveness that now confronts Australia, the greatest nation in the world. But so has the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister should have led. He should have stood up the first time the One Nation Party reared its ugly un-Australian head and basically said, 'Let's have a debate.' The problem lies with the Prime Minister. When the Prime Minister talked about free speech after the last election, he was really saying, with a wink and a nod, 'Free speech to me means hatred, division and prejudice.' That is what free speech means to the Prime Minister. He failed to stand up 29 months ago and say to the Australian public, 'Yes, we'll have a debate, but it is going to be a debate about policies and options to try to bring a sense of security back to the Australian community.' In case the government has forgotten about that dog whistle campaign, I will go back through the history of the Prime Minister. The dog whistle campaign did not start when he occupied the 'oval office' in Parliament House. The dog whistle campaign really started the first time the now Prime Minister occupied the chair of the Leader of the Opposition. It started when he was elected as Leader of the Opposition. He brought to Australian political fairness a dog whistle campaign that is built on hate, division and prejudice. If anyone has any doubt about that, sand? I would remind the House that the comments by the One Nation political party-I will give an example of these comments-go to the comments by the Prime Minister in the late 19808 about his opposition to Asianisation Australia. Have those opposite forgotten those comments? We all know about them. Those opposite ought to hang their heads in shame. That is what the dog whistle campaign on politics is about. The Prime Minister walked away from responsibility by making his un-Australian comments. Mr Taylor- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I do not often agree with the member for Kalgoorlie, but I draw your attention to the standing orders on relevance. I think that the member opposite is getting right away from the subject at the moment. He is using the opportunity to bag the Prime Minister. That is not what this debate is about. I ask you to bring him back to the point.",107
311,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I thank the honourable member for Groom. The terms of the discussion are very specific. I would encourage the member for Batman to concentrate on the terms of the discussion.,108
312,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am talking about a sense of democracy and a fair go in Australia. The problem with the coalition is that people in glass houses ought not throw stones. Today's debate is about Australia. The truth is that we all know that, throughout his political career, the Prime Minister has blown so hard on the dog whistle that he is blue in the face. He pretended that he stood for some values whilst at the same time secretly trying to create an environment out there for the values and the policies of hate identified with One Nation to get their ugly heads rearing in Australia. Mr Andrews- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There is no reference to the Prime Minister or any other party in the matter for discussion that has been put forward. Mr Leo MCLeay-Do you want a discussion or do you want to keep your head in the Mr Richard Evans-Put your bum on a bike, Leo. Mr Andrews-The honourable member in speaking now is simply avoiding your ruling on the point of order that was raised. He is nowhere near the topic and he has made no attempt to come to the topic.",108
313,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the honourable member for Menzies. I would again encourage the honourable member for Batman to stay within the gambit of the discussion. Mr Leo MCLeay-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: you might ask Mr Foul Mouth over there to withdraw the remarks he made.",108
314,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I must say that I am not certain what he said. Mr Leo MCLeay-The member for Cowan made some remarks that everybody on this side heard. Mr Richard Evans- Mr Deputy Speaker, I used the phrase 'put your bum on a bike'. If that offends the member for Watson, I withdraw.",108
315,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I thank the honourable member.,108
316,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The debate really is about a sense of leadership, and politicians and political parties behaving in a responsible manner. That is what the debate is about. The problem for the coalition is that it wants to sit over there in a very hypocritical way and point the finger at One Nation alone. I am suggesting that they are fellow travellers. It is the dog whistle campaign pursued by the Prime Minister over many years, both in opposition and in government, that has created the environment for One Nation and its fellow travellers to rear their ugly heads. If you have got any doubts about that, let us go through the voting records of the Prime Minister and the member for Oxley. Let us go to the question of workplace relations. Working people out there who put their heads down and do a decent day's work will as at 1 July have their hard-won basic working conditions ripped away from them because of the decisive action taken by the Prime Minister together with the member for Oxley. Mr Brough- Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order and it goes to relevance again. This is the third time we have asked you to draw his attention back to the question. There is nothing in this matter of public importance to do with workplace relations or anything else. It is to do with the emergence of a new registered political party, being the Pauline Hanson One Nation Party. It has nothing to do with anything that the member for Batman has been drawing his attention to.",109
317,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,-I thank the honourable member. I certainly uphold his point of order. I urge the honourable member for Batman to speak with some relevance to the question under discussion.,109
318,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I appreciate the position adopted by the member for Longman because he, unlike the Prime Minister, stood up very early and made the very public statement that he would put One Nation last; that he would sooner not be in this House than be elected on the basis of One Nation preferences. I understand his sensitivity and the position he adopts with respect to these fundamental issues. Mr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Batman is not addressing the matter of public importance before the House. He is talking about political preferences. The matter before the House is about the structure and democratic processes within Pauline Hanson's One Nation. I ask you to draw him back to the topic. If he has not got anything relevant to say, then he should sit down.",109
319,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I thank the honourable member for North Sydney. (Quorum formed),109
320,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As I have said, this debate is really about leadership. It is about politicians and political parties operating in a responsible manner. I think it also goes to the fundamentals of democracy in Australia and whether or not you conduct yourself in an undemocratic way. I must say, in the context of the debate about One Nation, I believe that the Prime Minister, through his dog whistle campaign, conducted himself in a very undemocratic way in the lead-up to the last election. I can remember watching on television the Prime Minister being led by Helen Sham-Ho as he visited the Chinese community. Mr Hardgrave-- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was looking forward to the member for Batman actually upholding your directive. I simply draw your attention to the fact that he has not used his contribution today to account for the way his side feels about matters such as probity, which is the matter before the House at the moment.",109
321,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the honourable member for Moreton. There is no point of order. I call the honourable member for Batman, who will speak about the content of the discussion.",109
322,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We know all about probity, a sense of decency and upholding the sense of democracy in Australia. The problem is that there are fellow travellers on the other side of the House who want to point the finger at One Nation whilst they seek to hide behind the skirts of the member for Oxley. That is the truth of the matter and the member for Moreton knows it. He does not want to be elected on One Nation preferences. His problem is that his Prime Minister, through his dog whistle campaign, basically wants to associate himself with the member for Oxley. Mr Hardgrav€}- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I hate to be repetitive, the member for Batman has continued to ignore your instructions. Mr :MARTIN FERGUSON-Before I was so rudely interrupted by the member for Moreton, the truth of the matter is that the political parties-(Time expired)",109
323,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (5.15 p.m.)-Over the past fortnight, questions have been raised in this House about the real nature of One Nation. Is it a party or is it a business? Is it a democracy or is it a dictatorship? Is it really an unstable political menage a linking the two Davids, D land D2, with an antipodean version of Eva Peron? One of the key questions is the fate of the $500,000 worth of taxpayers' money to which it has always been assumed One Nation is entitled in the wake of the Queensland election result. To receive public funding, a party must be registered under the relevant act. The Queensland Electoral Act provides 'that the application for registration must be made to the Commission in a form approved by the Commission for the purposes of this section and must if the application for a party that is not a Queensland parliamentary party' - and I should point out that One Nation had no members of parliament when this application was lodged-'set out the names and addresses of 500 members of the party who are electors'. I stress that to receive public funding a party needs 500 members. I turn now to the constitution of Pauline Hanson's One Nation. This is not One Nation Ltd, which has three directors and just five members, but the unincorporated association registered under the Queensland act, about which I tabled information in parliament earlier this week. This unincorporated association has three classes of membership: it has management committee members, it has committee members and it has affiliate members who, I submit, are not really members at all because the management committee has complete and total control over this party. I quote from its constitution: Any AGM, Special Meeting or General Meeting may be attended by the members of the Managebut ment Committee on behalf of the Ordinary Members and any Ordinary Memberwait for it, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER who has given 7 days notice in writing of their intention to attend the meeting. You have got to give seven days notice to attend a meeting of One Nation. It also says: Management Committee Meetings are only to be attended by members of the Management Committee and Ordinary Members as appropriate and agreed to by a majority of members of the Management Committee. There are just three members of the management committee. I am not a lawyer, but it trois seems to me that affiliate members are not members in any meaningful sense. They have no role in the party whatsoever, other than to pay membership fees. So One Nation, as registered in Queensland, does not have 500 members, it is not a validly registered political party and it cannot receive any public funding. I call on the Queensland government to urgently consider whether One Nation can be a registered party at all under its existing, highly undemocratic constitution. To be federally registered, a party also needs 500 members. My office has been seeking a copy of the constitution of One Nation as federally registered. Members may be interested to know that the Australian Electoral Commission said it cannot actually provide a copy of One Nation's constitution and suggested that I approach a person described as One Nation's constitutional officer. When asked for a copy of the constitution, the gentleman in question, Scott Balson said, 'I only look after the Web page. You will have to ask David Ettridge.' The House should know that if One Nation received 13 per cent of the vote at a federal election, if it was entitled to funding, it would receive $5 million of taxpayers' money, of which D2, David Ettridge, would be entitled to 12.5 per cent or more than $500,000. Yet, if this federally registered constitution resembles the Que,ensland constitution of One Nation, it may'not be validly registered at all. So I ask the Australian Electoral Commission to reconsider whether, given the complete lack of democracy inside One Nation, given the complete lack of membership in any meaningful form, One Nation is indeed a validly registered party. Is One Nation a constitutional entity in any meaningful sense or is it just a couple of political and financial brigands trying to hoodwink decent patriotic Australians in the way Jimmy Swaggart once tricked pious Americans? The administration of this party, One Nation, is a complete shambles. Today's Sydney Morning Herald, in talking about One Nation, states: . .. its former Queensland treasurer, Mr Ted Bricks, said he resigned Jast month over concerns about financial accountability. He said two party members to whom he had spoken made donations of $5,000 and $7,000 but were not given receipts. He said he discovered the money was not deposited in One Nation's account but in ""associated"" accountsperhaps Mr Ettridge' swhose details he was unable to establish. The documentation in relation to the financial affairs One Nation is virtually non-existent. Could it be that Mr 12.5 Per Cent has taken more than that to which he is entitled? Mr Deputy Speaker, you might be interested to know that I happened the other day to pick up the One Nation political party annual return for 1996-1997 and I noticed that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) had given $5,000 to One Nation in the form of a loan to the party. I just hope that better eare has been taken of the member for Oxley's money than was taken of the $7,000 referred to by Mr Bricks. We ought to point out again that D2, David Ettridge, is actually the principal of an overseas registered company operating in Australia. D2 is in fact a foreign multinational. That is what D2 is. And so I say to Scott Balson, who indicated that he would never accept any multinational company on his Web page, that the first person he should throw off the Web page is none other than David Ettridge himself. People need to know what kind of party One Nation has become. They need to know that David Oldfield's and David Ettridge's One Nation Ltd is not a political party in any meaningful sense; it is a business where noone is allowed to ask questions. Today's Age newspaper said: Mrs Klinghammer said she was disendorsed as One Nation's candidate for Hindmarsh in South Australia after questioning the whereabouts of $7,000 raised at a party fund raiser. She said three other South Australian candidates, Mr David Carter, Mr David Dwyer and Mr Roger Meadmore, were also disendorsed after questioning party finances. I congratulate those decent, honest members of One Nation, or pseudo-members of One Nation, for taking the stance they did. But what happened when they raised these perfectly reasonable questions with the party leadership, Dl and D2? I am quoting again from the Age: We were told we were compulsive liars and traitors, when all we were doing was asking them to be accountable for the money. There are indeed some chronic and habitual liars in the One Nation organisation, but the best candidates for that title are in fact D 1 and D2. The best thing the member for Oxley of could do, if she has any concern for her party,' if she has any concern for the decent Australians who might be tempted to support her, if she has any concern for her own reputation, if she has any thought for the people of Ipswich who voted her into this place, is to sack David Oldfield and David Ettridge. She must get rid of D 1 and D2. Dr Southcott-She can't. They'll get rid of her. Mr Hardgrave-She doesn't have the numbers.",110
324,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I take the point of the members behind me. She doesn't have the numbers. The member for Oxley needs to understand that she is completely at the mercy of, she is completely dependent on the goodwill of, two people who go a lot further back with one another than they do with her. I think that the nation is sending out a message: please explain, Pauline. The nation wants to know, and One Nation wants to know. When you do stand up to reply, I ask you this: please don't just read a script that D 1 has written for you, because if you do you are not worth the $145 travel allowance you have been paid for today.",111
325,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I call the member for Watson. Government members-Ohl Mr LEO MCLEA Y (Watson) (5.24 p.m.)Before other members get all upset, there are two hours in this debate, so we will be ested to hear not only what the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has to say but maybe what some more members of the government might want to say. They have all been keen to not be too interested in One Nation until all of a sudden the One Nation train has started running down their track. For two years the opposition have been saying that we think this is an organisation that people should be taking a look at, but the government has not been saying that. Suddenly the government has become a little bit worried. The Queensland election frightened the life out of the government and they have now started to take an interest. Mr Tony Smith-And the Labor Party.",112
326,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We are the government of Queensland. You missed that, I know. That is probably why you are sitting over here with the Independents rather than with the party you got elected with. We have become used to the coalition playing ostrich on matters which affect the social cohesion of Australia. There is no doubt that, since One Nation was created in 1997, they have been gathering support across the country. The Queensland election showed that. The impression of any of us who have watched it is that to a large extent that port comes from people who have been made insecure by the rapid changes that have been occurring to the Australian economy and who have been seeking easy answers. One Nation came into that breach and provided easy answers. They got 22 per cent of the vote in the Queensland election by supplying those easy answers. What people should understand is that these complex questions do not have easy answers. If they did have easy answers, the major political parties would have implemented them some time ago. The hard truth is that there are no easy answers to these complex questions. Apart from those ordinary Australians who are desperately seeking some certainty in their lives, there are a number of shadowy fringe groups which seem to have had a very large role in the growth of One Nation. It seems to be these fringe dwellers who wield authority interin the party-not the ordinary concerned citizens. It is very important to make the distinction between One Nation voters and the One Nation Party. As every day goes by, however, more disturbing evidence is coming forward about the controllers of the One Nation Party and their extremist connections. It is now known that two state presidents of One Nation have connections with the League of Rights. Senator Boswell is a long-time fighter against the League of Rights. If the government had listened to him, as they should have listened to the opposition, they would not be in the position they are in today. Senator Boswell has told us that the Victorian president has addressed two League of Rights functions and the Queensland president has been published in the League of Rights newsletter. Indeed, David Ettridge's brother, Michael Ettridge, maintained that he had been dismissed as a candidate for One Nation because he had called in police to expel extremists from One Nation meetings. Some of these extremists had spoken of making rifles and taking over the Townsville army barracks. One of these groups, the Freedom Scouts, is very extreme indeed. When confronted with these connections with extremist groups, the best One Nation can do is insist that they, One Nation, should supnot be condemned just because they are supported by these groups. But they won't condemn those groups. They just dance around the edges, in the same way as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) dances around the edges of One Nation. These extremist groups are attracted like bees around a honey pot. They see an opportunity to gain control of a party and that party's agenda. Witness yesterday'S immigration statement by none other than the co-founder of Australians Against Further Immigration, who is now One Nation's immigration adviser. I believe this is just another example of those fringe groups being given the right signals by the member for Oxley and her Rasputin, David Oldfield. As One Nation is now a recognised political party in the parliament of Queensland, the third largest state in this country, the questions of accountability and transparency become important. One Nation now attracts large amounts of public funding-half a million dollars in the Queensland election. As the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) said, if they got even half the vote that they got in Queensland they would attract nearly $5 million of federal funding in the next federal election. There has been concern raised al I across the country about what is happcning with that money. Concern has been raised by One Nation candidates in the Queensland election about the expenditure of fundraising money. It has already been mentioned that One Nation's former Queensland treasurer, Mr Ted Bricks, resigned last month over concerns about financial accountability. Mr Bricks was quoted in today's Sydney Morning Herald as saying: The documentation in relation to the financial affairs of One Nation is virtually non-existent. Examples given include two party members in Queensland who had made donations of $5,000 and $7,000 but were given no receipts. The former secretary of the member for Oxley has claimed that several supporters had made donations of $500 but had not been given receipts. A One Nation candidate in Adelaide mentioned that $7,000 raised at a function to pay for how to vote cards had vanished. What did Mr Ettridge say about that? He said that the money that was raised was used for other things. What we should ask is: what were those other things? Were they to do with the political or personal activities of One Nation's owners? That fast and loose approach to contributions may be related to the way that the One Nation Party is set up. We have heard that the party is set up as a limited liability company. Mr Ettridge receives 121f2 per cent of the money that they get. It is said by the member for Warnngah-and I do not disbelieve himthat the member for Oxley, Mr Ettridge and Mr Oldfield are directors of that One Nation company. But I had a look at the register of members' interests today-for which the latest date is I July-and there is no mention in the register of members' interests of this parliament that the member for Oxley is a director of any company called One Nation. I hope that, if the member for Oxley is a director of that company, she might explain to this House why she is not in breach of the standing orders. The supporters of One Nation can be assured that they know who Pauline Hanson is. She has been subject to detailed scrutiny in the media. But we do not know who are the people behind her. We have heard a little bit about David Oldfield, the former staffer of the member for Warringah. Information about his history and opinions is beginning to filter out. But who is David Ettridge, the third owner of the One Nation company? He is the man who is responsible for the finances of One Nation Incorporated. We know he is anxious to avoid paying his full taxes. One wonders if there are many One Nation supporters who would he happy to support someone who evades tax. I know that the member for Oxley has spoken against foreign companies avoiding Australian taxes by making use of international tax havens. Perhaps she should have been looking closer to home for tax cheats. But apart from Mr Ettridge's history as a tax avoider, very little is known about him, even though as a director of the One Nation company he has control over every aspect of One Nation's operations. It is all very well for the member for Warringah to come into this House and beat his breast about One Nation and his former employee, David Oldfield. It is all very well for him to call for inquiries by the police, the tax commissioner and the Australian Securities Commission. Yesterday, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) joined in that chorus and now the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) is adding his voice. But the one who should have spoken out two years ago is still hiding in the background. This organisation, One Nation, would not be where it is today without the tacit support of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who encouraged the member for Oxley's supporters at the beginning. Now those faithful followers of the member for Oxley should start to ask themselves: who is running the show-Ms Hanson, David Ettridge or David Oldfield; where are their hard-earned donations going; and where is the transparency and accountability that they have a right to? It is time, I believe, that One Nation voters stopped and had a good look and asked the hard questions. My advice to them is that they should not vote for a pig in a poke. But my advice to the government members here today is to forget about these cheap, phoney motions where, all of a sudden, most of them have become concerned about One Nation. Mr Taylor-Not all of us.",112
327,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Most of them, I said. The member for Longman (Mr Brough) and his other colleague from Queensland saw that train coming down the track, but the rest of them-the National Party members from Queensland, who are not here in the chamber this afternoonMr Marek-That is not right. You are misleading the house.",114
328,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He's from Queensland.,114
329,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"From Queensland? There is one of them: Mr Marek is here. Mr Marek thought it was pretty unfair that other members got to speak in this debate, rather than the member for Oxley. He is running around one minute wanting to sit over there with the government and the next he is coming over here to give her advice. Maybe, son, they might not put you last, but I think they will! The government got on this train too late. It is time the Prime Minister came out and said something, and that we not just hear from the leadership aspirant, Who is sitting over there next to the member for Warringah. We should hear from the Prime Minister. (Time expired)",114
330,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will say something at the outset unashamedly. I may disagree a lot with what the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) says, but I tell you what: I will stand here and defend to the death her right to say it. I will defend to the death the right of 500,000 people in Queensland who voted for her and the 34,800 people in Oxley who voted for her.",114
331,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Dickson will address his remarks through the chair and to the matter before the House.,114
332,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have been disgusted since I entered this House at some of the personal attacks upon the member for Oxley. It is totally un-Australian. We have a problem in this country. The problem is 13 years of political correctness under Labor and an emulation by the 2Vz years of the leaderless Howard government. That is the problem. We have not had any leadership on Aboriginal affairs-as the member for Banks (Mr Melham) knows-we have not had any direction in Aboriginal affairs in this country, and that is why the people of Australia are looking for something different, and the people of Australia have a right to do that. Mr Hardgrave-On a point of order: Mr Speaker, for the sake of consistency, I would simply like to draw your attention to the fact that there is a matter before the House which the member for Dickson has so far chosen to ignore.",114
333,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Dickson is talking within the standing orders and within terms of the the matter of public importance.,114
334,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well may the major parties-in particular the coalition-criticise and fear the new political forces that have emerged on the Australian political scene. The One Natio!1 Party has been vilified by not only most· elements of the ABC, which the coalition continually criticises for political correctness and alleged bias against conservative politics, but it has seen a campaign of virtual character assassination waged against its members. No-one can say that it has received the support of the press from any element of the mainstream media. Yet, despite this, in Australia's most recent democratic election, it gained a qU,arter of the popular vote-and much of it wa's at the expense of the Liberal and National parties. If the new forces are so base, as Shakespeare would have said, what does that make the coalition if it is losing votes hand over fist to these political forces? Frequent accusations of racism are made but it was both the Labor and Liberal parties which, for most of Australian history, advocated and enforced a White Australia policy, which is still influencing our racial mix. In the Middle Ages, if you wanted to indelibly smear someone, you accused them of witchcraft; in the 1950s you accused them of being a communist; now all that is necessary is the racist slur. For years we have had peculiar, untouchable items within this country",114
335,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"While the honourable member for Dickson can range fairly widely, I suggest he needs to have in mind the tightness of the matter of public importance before the chair. At this stage he is moving a little wide of that mark. I suggest he addresses the particular matter before the chair. Mr Hardgrave-He's a bit to the right.",115
336,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Moreton will remain silent.,115
337,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As has been said by Professor Corcoran in his article, this is what this matter is about. This matter is really a smokescreen to cover the inability of the conservative parties of this place to lead. country has the worse conservative government that I can recall and I have been following politics for the last 40 years. It is the worse conservative government ever. It has no leadership or direction and that is why we have 500,000 people supporting One Nation.",115
338,Mr LLOYD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On a point of order: I would ask you, Mr Speaker, to bring the honourable member back to the subject of the debate. You have already warned him once and he is obviously straying.",115
339,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is normally a fair measure of licence allowed in matters of public importance, but I do take up the point of order raised by the member for Robertson. Matters of public importance are designed to canvass a particular subject. I suggest the member for Dickson takes note of that and address the subject in any comments he might make.",115
340,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This matter is not about democracy and One Nation. It is about the failure of the political process in this country to recognise that people are rebelling against the system that they have. The democracy aspect of this matter is really a farce. People in Queensland are saying that they have had enough of the system. That is what a great number of people are saying in general. A colourful thread in all of this is that the common folk are somehow at fault, as Professor Corcoran said. Australian culture has been constantly changing and, in the context of this matter of public importance, it is being enriched by internal and external influences. We have to recognise that. The United States has always had a policy of a melting pot of cultures",115
341,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,This matter says nothing about the United States. I again draw the attention of the honourable member for Dickson to the matter before the House.,115
342,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There have been members on the other side of the House that have recognised these matters and that there is an argument. But it is an argument that requires some work. As Paul Sheehan said in his book recently: Thrashing Hanson as a racist and a fool is no substitute for actually doing some work. This When are we going to see some major work being done on issues in this country? This is a smokescreen for avoiding the real issues. Why can't the people of Australia be trusted to a referendum on native title? They are only common folk. They would not understand. The member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) said that it was a complex issue. It is not a complex matter. It is a matter that can be put to the people of Australia. They do not need to be told that that is very complex. We now have a 10-point, 7V2-point plan. The 10-point never ever to change plan is now the 7V2",115
343,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Dickson is way off the track on this MP!. If he does not come back to the particular issue before the parliament, I will ask him to resume his seat.",115
344,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This matter of public importance is really a mask for the policy failure of the government. That is the problem. There is a total lack of policy. The more you attack the member for Oxley and the One Nation Party, the more votes she will get. I guarantee it. I predicted in the House on 4 June that we would see a revolution in Queensland. People said, 'Oh no, that's all right.' The member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who is chattering away, used to employ one of the Davids. He might want to think about that, too. Mr Abbott interjecting",115
345,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Oh, never ever again! The fact of the matter is that they are not focusing on policy. It is the policy vacuum that this particular matter really embodies",116
346,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Whatever the honourable member's view, can I again refer him to the fact that this is not a wide-ranging debate. It is one that is focused specifically on the subject matter before the House. I suggest he returns to it.",116
347,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The comment in the matter 'and by not being of a basically undemocratic nature' invites, with respect, comment about the democratic nature generally of the political process and of the Liberal Party itself and other parties. We should start looking at some of the processes in the Liberal Party-and we all have a store of stories about that and about what goes on within their processes. Mr Martin Ferguson-Tell us! Go on, tell us!",116
348,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am saving them up. This particular matter before the House is not so much about the One Nation Party or Pauline Hanson; it is about policy vacuum, and the people of Australia know it. Mr Hardgrave-On a point of order, Mr Speaker. With the greatest of respect, I suspect the member for Dickson is defying your ruling.",116

350,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As far as democracy is concerned, the Liberal Party should explain why it is that it has meetings in this place where it tells members what the issues are not the other way around. I would have thought that a democratic party would allow the members to tell the executive-the secretariat, such as Mr Lynton Crosby-what the issues are, but it is the other way around.",116
351,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,There is nothing in this matter of public importance to do with the matters you are now canvassing. Please return to the issue before us.,116
352,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When it comes to questions of democracy and attacking individuals, we ought, in trying to do the right thing by the people of Australia, avoid the attacking of individuals. We should be attacking issues. We should be providing the leadership that is totally lacking in this country and that the people of Australia are crying out for. (Time expired)",116
353,Ms HANSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It has been very interesting to sit here and listen to all the concerns. Actually, it is very rare that you see bipartisanship happen in this House. You cannot have bipartisanship by either side of the House on concerns of maybe unemployment or looking after the interests of Australians, but you can when it comes to Pauline Hanson or the member for Oxley or One Nation. So Australian people will be very much interested in this. H is interesting that the member for Menzies, Mr Andrews, only raises concerns for newly emerging registered political parties. No doubt this is because he does not wish to discuss the actual details and structure of his own party. Perhaps someone from the Liberal Party in New South Wales would like to explain their unincorporated structure that exposes all their members to huge debts. One Nation has a structure that is public and limited and without shareholders. It, unlike the Liberal Party-at least in New South Wales-protects its members from debts. The directors of this Australian registered structure have serious responsibilities under the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Electoral Commission. Many sporting organisations have an identical structure, yet no-one questions them. It should be further understood that our reporting to the Australian Electoral Commission is considerable and a matter of the public record. In fact, we are subject to audit at any time by the AEC, and our books are kept in a continual state of readiness. This potential for audit places our organisation under greater scrutiny than any company registered with the Australian Securities Commission. The smear of tax havens and questions of democracy are without substance and simply hypocritical considering the well-documented dodgy internal voting of the major parties on such things as preselections and the like. Allegations of the source of funds, work in kind and deals of an interesting nature have been levelled at all the parties, but this is conveniHouse ently forgotten in the quest to slur One Nation. With an ever increasing series of untruths, it defies logic and is only surpassed by the desire of the press to be a part of the spread of such nonsense. I suggest Mr Andrews look into his own backyard first and also bear in mind that we report to the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Electoral Commission, not him or his fellow politically motivated dealers in dark untruths. It is no doubt an eye-opening experience for all Australians. We see without question that you are only united when it comes to opposing the threat we pose to your comfortable coexistence. No wonder Australians are fed up with the gutter tactics they see from the members of this House-their representatives.",116

357,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Earlier today the honourable member for Hotham raised the question as to whether the Prime Minister or the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business had breached privilege or committed a contempt in connection with statements that were made in the House. The implication of the honourable member's question was that material made available to the House today indicated that earlier statements had been misleading. I am not sure whether the honourable member for Hotham intended to raise the matter formally as a matter of privilege but he used that term and, because of the importance of that matter, I felt that I should respond as soon as practicable and in a considered manner. It is possible for the making of deliberately misleading statements to the House to be granted as a contempt, and I draw the attention of members to May on page J J9 and the of Representatives Practice on page 699. I have had an opportunity to examine the paper tabled during question time by the Leader of the Opposition. The paper canvasses various issues to do with the waterfront; however, it is not clear to me just what the status of the paper is or what in fact it may establish. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that prima facie evidence such as would cause me to allow precedence to a motion has been presented. In this regard, I draw the attention of members to the following statement in House of Representatives Practice: While claims that Members have deliberately misled the House have been raised as matters of privilege or contempt in the House, the Speaker has not, to date, accepted sueh a claim. Nor do I in this instance. NA REFORM BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Costello, and read a first time. Second Reading",117
358,Mr COSTELLO,CORPORA TE LAW ECONOMIC,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Today, I introduce the Corporate Law Economic Reform Bill 1998 which will modernise the regulation of business and our financial markets. When introducing the package of legislation reforming the Australian finan·· cial sector earlier this year, I stated that those refOlms to the financial system, together with the wide-ranging reform of Australia's corporate laws proposed under the corporate law economic reform program, would provide a launching pad for this government's drive to make Australia a leading business centre in the Asia-Pacific region. This bill builds the framework for Australia's business regulation to foster economic development and employment. It provides key reforms to our laws in the areas of fundraising, directors' duties, accounting sfandards and takeovers. In March 1997, the government announced it was taking a new approach to corporate regulation under its corporate law economic reform program. The objective of this program is to give prominence to promoting efficiency in the Australian economy while facilitating market integrity and providing investors with protection from fraud, negligence or abusive market conduct. In developing this new regulatory regime, the government, in consultation with the business community and interest groups, is seeking to adopt a more flexible and efficient regulatory framework that can respond to market developments. It will permit market participants to adapt to challenges presented by technological developments, innovation and integration of the world's financial markets. To assist the government in the consultation process, the business regulation advisory group, BRAG, chaired by Mrs Catherine Walter with representatives from key business groups, was established. The government has greatly appreciated the contribution of all groups that have participated so actively in the reform program. Corporate Fundraising This bill will improve the operation of the fundraising provisions of the Corporations Law to facilitate more efficient capital raising by Australian business. A range of measures will be implemented to facilitate raising investment capital and reduce the high costs of fundraising faced by Australian companies. Prospectuses are often too long and complicated and can obscure information of interest to investors. Issuers frequently complain that they are forced to burden prospectuses with unnecessary information and that prospectus costs are too high. The operation of the fundraising rules will be improved and costs to business will be reduced by: introducing short form prospectuses for retail investors with technical information contained in separate documents that will be available on request; permitting investors in certain industries to be provided with a short profile statement containing key information rather than the full prospectus; and allowing companies to issue prospectuses in electronic form and distribute them through the Internet or other media. It is also clear that uncertainty over liability for the content of prospectuses has added to the complexity and expense of fundraising and has detracted from the prime function of a prospectus to disclose relevant information to investors. The government will clarify the potential liability of parties for prospectus content by providing that their liability will be governed solely under the Corporations Law. Due diligence defences will be made available in all cases of fundraising where there is a positive duty to disclose information. Facilitating Fundraising by Small and Medium Sized Enterprises The cost of preparing and lodging a prospectus can be excessive in light of the amount of capital which small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, seek to raise. This acts as a significant impediment to SMEs seeking public funding. A new fundraising mechanism will allow an 5MB to raise a total of up to $5 million through the use of offer information statements, OIS. The OIS introduces simpler disclosure obligations. Bodies wishing to use an OIS will be required to state the purpose for which the funds are required, the nature of the risks involved and include a copy of its audited accounts. Investors will be warned of the risks of investing without a prospectus and the desirability of obtaining professional advice. In addition, a prospectus will not be required if a person makes personal offers that result in securities being issued to 20 or fewer persons in a one year period with no more than $2 million being raised. This will reduce the costs faced by SMEs when making small scale offerings without exposing investors to unnecessary risks. To facilitate SME fundraising, a corporation will be able to raise funds from sophisticated investors without preparing a prospectus in a wider range of circumstances. Clarifying Directors' Duties Effective corporate decision making is hampered by legal uncertainties arising from the potential liabilities of directors for their actions. A business judgment rule will be introduced to provide directors with a safe harbour from personal liability in relation to honest, informed and rational business judgments. The rule will apply where an officer makes an informed decision in good faith, without a material personal interest in the subject matter of the decision and rationally believes that the decision is in the best interests of the company. The objective of the rule is to protect the authority of directors in the exercise of their duties of management. It is not designed to, and will not, insulate them from liability for negligent, ill informed or fraudulent decisions. The rule will not lead to any reduction in the level of accountability of directors, but will ensure that they are not liable for decisions made in good faith and with due care. Directors will benefit from the certainty that the rule provides in terms of their liability as they will be encouraged to take advantage of business opportunities and not behave in an unnecessarily risk averse manner. To reflect modern business practice, directors will, where appropriate, be able to delegate functions to, and rely on advice and information provided by, other persons. The availability of an indemnity for legal actions and directors' liabilities in corporate groups will also be clarified. Greater Accountability to Shareholders A new 'representative' action will be introduced to enhance shareholders' rights to pursue an action on behalf of shareholders where the company is unable or unwilling to do so. This new right of action will provide an incentive for management to exercise powers appropriately and for the benefit of shareholders. Safeguards will be introduced to ensure that company management is not undermined by unjustified or vexatious litigation. The court will need to be satisfied that proceedings brought on behalf of a company are appropriate in that there must be a serious case to be tried, the applicant must be acting in good faith and the action must be in the best interests of the company. Making Accounting Standards More Useful for Business Financial reporting requirements play an important role in Australian companies' ability to compete effectively and efficiently. Accounting standards that are responsive to the needs of both the Australian business community and investors need to be developed, thus ensuring that Australia maintains an informed and efficient capital market. To bring an investor and business focus to the standard setting process, an advisory body, the financial reporting council, FRC, will be established with membership drawn from peak professional, business and government organisations. The FRC will have broad oversight of the Australian accounting standard setting process. It will report to the minister and provide advice on the effectiveness of accounting standards. As a result, the accounting standard setting process will become more responsive to the needs of preparers and users of financial statements. A key role of the FRe will be to ensure that the Australian Accounting Standards Board, AASB, is committed to, and works towards, adopting international standards having regard to what is taking place in major capital raising economies. The FRC will report to the government on the acceptance of international accounting standards in overseas capital markets, on the progress made by the International Accounting Standards Committee, IASC, on developing a core set of international standards and on the International Organisation of Securities Commission's acceptance of those standards. Streamlining Takeover Rules The current takeover rules are complex and impose excessive costs on bidders and target firms. The bill reforms the current takeover legislation to make requirements simpler and clearer. To facilitate a more competitive market for corporate control, a bidder will be able to exceed the takeover threshold-more than 20 per cent of the total voting rights in a company-through a new mandatory bid procedure before being obliged to make a general takeover offer. The mandatory bid rule will provide two significant advantages. First, by giving potential bidders the choice of which takeover method to employ, they are more likely to proceed with their bids, resulting in an increased likelihood of assets being used in their most productive manner. Secondly, the mandatory bid rule will ensure that all target company shareholders will have the opportunity to sell their interest at a fair' price and to benefit from the premium a bidder for control places on the securities. To take advantage of this rule, conditions that reflect the equal opportunity principle underlying the takeover provisions must be met. The mandatory bid conditions include: the bidder must start from below the 20 per cent threshold with only one acquisition being allowed before the mandatory bid requirement is triggered, which must be immediately followed by the announcement of the mandatory bid; the bidder must disclose to the selling shareholder that the mandatory bid requirement will be triggered by an agreement to sell; the bid must include an offer of a cash sum for the securities, thereby giving target shareholders the option of exiting from the company completely. Alternative consideration, such as securities or a combination of cash and securities, may also be offered; the bid must be for an amount at least equivalent to the highest price paid by the bidder in cash or non-cash transactions in the last four months; the bid must be unconditional; target shareholders must be provided with an independent expert's report by the target; the bidder must not exercise control of the target until the offer period starts for the mandatory bid; that is, until the first offer under the bid is made. Until then, the bidder will only be able to influence the affairs of the target through voting shares already held in the target before the pre-bid acquisition that triggered the mandatory bid procedure; and no securities may be issued in the target company, nor dividends declared, from the time of the pre-bid acquisition until the end of the bid period without shareholder approval by a general meeting. However, this prohibition does not apply in certain circumstances, including where the issuing of securities or dividends are announced before the mandatory bid is announced. Takeovers Panel To address concerns with the current dispute resolution mechanisms for takeovers, the existing Corporations and Securities Panel will be reconstituted to become the primary forum for resolving takeover matters. The panel will retain its existing jurisdiction to enforce compliance with the spirit of the Law. It will also be given jurisdiction to review ASIC decisions on exemptions from the takeover rules given to corporations. All interested parties will be able to bring matters before the panel, not just the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC. Court proceedings in relation to a takeover bid or proposed takeover bid will not be able to be commenced unW after the end of the bid period except on the application of ASIC or another public authority of the Commonwealth or a state. Listed Managed Investments Investors will also have the benefit of the takeover rules applying to listed managed investment schemes. This program of reforms will ensure that Australia's corporate laws meet the challenges of the present and future marketplace in a forward thinking, responsible and innovative way. The reforms are designed to encourage free enterprise for the benefit of all Australians. I wish to place on record my thanks to my parliamentary secretary, Senator Ian Campbell, for the work that he has done in bringing this program' together; to Mrs Catherine Walter and the members of the BRAG group; to Julie Abramson, those of my own staff and any of my own department who have worked on this exciting and very forward thinking project. I commend the bill to the House and present the Explanatory Memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned.

359,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary to Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (6.05 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill amends the income tax law to give effect to measures announced in previous budgets and in other government statements. Income Tax deductions for gifts and related position. matters The bill will amend the income tax law allow deduetions for gifts made to certain funds and organisations. Amendments are also being made to ensure that grants paid from the Katherine District Business Re-establishinvestment ment Fund to eligible businesses in the Katherine region are exempt from income A number of minor amendments to the gift provisions also will be made. Australia-a regional financial centre The bill honours a commitment made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 8 Decemexemption ber 1997 when he announced, as part of the Investing for Growth statement, a package of measures which are aimed at making Australia a more attractive regional financial centre by building on Australia's existing advantages to ensure its participation in the increasing global trade in financial services. ments relate to the exemption from interest withholding tax available under section 128F, the offshore banking unit (OBU) concessional tax regime and the foreign investment fund and the thin capitalisation provisions of the income tax law. As a means of further developing the domestic corporate debt market, the section 128F interest withholding tax exemption will be widened to allow companies to issue registered and bearer debentures within Australia and pay the relevant interest within Australia. However, the issue of bearer debentures will continue to be restricted to nonresidents. The bill will make a number of changes to increase the attractiveness of the OBU concessions by enlarging the range of entities which can apply for OBU status and expanding the activities which are subject to the concessional rate of tax. In order to provide Australian branches of foreign banks access funds exempt from interest withholding tax, the operation of the 'loan back' provisions in the thin capitalisation regime will be relaxed. This will enable foreign owned banking subsidiaries to raise interest withholding tax exempt funds and on-lend those funds to related Australian bank branches without affecting the subsidiary's thin capitalisation An exemption from the foreign investment to fund measures will also be provided for interests in certain foreign investment funds located in the United States. The exemption wi 11 increase the efficiency of Australian funds by exposing them to greater competition from US funds. Consequential tax. amendments have also been made to ensure the benefits of providing the exemption to certain US trusts are not clawed back under the general provisions for taxing trusts. The amendments are generally to apply from the date of introduction of the bill. The from the foreign investment fund measures will, however, have effect for notional accounting periods of foreign investment funds ending on or after the date of introduction of the bilI The amendments are estimated to cost $22 million in a full year. The amendCompany tax instalments The bill makes a minor amendment to the company tax instalment provisions of the income tax laws to exclude superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts from the grouping rules contained in those provisions. The amendments, which will prevent certain medium-sized entities from having to pay their tax instalments as if they were large entities, will apply from the 1995-96 income year. Non-arms-Iength trust distributions to superannuation and similar funds The bill gives effect to the Treasurer's announcement of 25 November 1997 to close a loophole in the current law which allows certain distributions of trust income to superthe annuation entities made under non-armslength arrangements to be taxed at the concessional rate of 15 per cent. The amendments will ensure that distributions of income from all trusts other than where the superannuation entity has a fixed entitlement are taxed at 47 per cent. The amendments will also ensure that distributions of income where the superannuation entity has a fixed entitlement to income from the trust are also taxed at 47 per cent where the distribution is made in connection with a non-arms-Iength arrangement. The amendments apply to distributions of income made after 2 p.m. on 25 November 1997 subject to a transitional arrangement. Franking credit trading: holding period and related payments rules and distribution to beneficiaries and partners that are equivalent to interest The bill implements a holding period rule and related payments rule for shares and interests in shares to ensure ers who bear the economic risk of ownership of the shares or interests will be entitled to franking rebates and credits under the dividend imputation system, and the inter-company dividend rebate. The bill also denies these benefits on trust and partnership distriments. butions which are equivalent to interest on a loan. These measures were announced in the 1997-98 budget and they form the final instalment of measures preventing franking credit trading and dividend streaming. The amendments to trust and partnership distributions and those implementing the related payments rule apply from 7.30 p.m. AEST, 13 May 1997. The holding period rule generally applies to shares and interests in shares acquired on or after I July 1997, with special provisions relating to trusts applying from 3 p.m. AEST 31 December 1997. Tax penalty arrangements The bill gives effect to the 1998-99 budget announcement to replace the existing late payment penalties in various taxation laws with a uniform, tax deductible general interest charge. The new arrangements will be simpler and better reflect movements in market interest rates. The changes follow a review by Australian Taxation Office of late payment and notification penalties in consultation with professional· and representative bodies groups. That review flowed from the government's response to the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. The charge on an outstanding amount will be calculated daily on a compounding basis. The nominal interest rate from which the daily charge is calculated will be set at the 13-week treasury note rate plus eight percentage points. The penalty for late lodgement of income tax returns of individuals and the penalty for underpayment of income tax will also adopt the general interest charge. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House and provide the explanatory memorandum.

NA (AUTOMOTIVE COMPETITIVENESS AND INVESTMENT SCHEME) BILL First Reading Bill presented by Mr Moore, for Mr Truss, and read a first time. Second Reading",121
360,Mr MOORE,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Act 190 1 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to implement two key elements of the government's arrangements for the automotive industry post-2000 by: reducing the rates of Customs duty on passenger motor vehicles and certain related componentry from 15 per cent to 10 per cent on 1 January 2005; and establishing the automotive competitiveness and investment scheme, ACIS, which will come into effect on 1 January 200 1. In so doing, the bill gives effect work of assistance for the automotive industry announced on 5 June 1997 and 22 April 1998. 1. Customs Tariff Reduction The rate of customs duty imposed on passenger motor vehicles, PMV s, and certain parts for PMVs by the Customs Tariff Act 1995 is presently 20 per cent. Under the current provisions of the customs tariff, the rate declines to 17.5 per cent on 1 January 1999 and 15 per cent on I January 2000, after which there are no further reductions. This bill will provide for a further reduction to 10 per cent from 1 January 2005. The pause in the tariff from 2000 until 31 December 2004 will oiIer the industry a vital opportunity to prepare for subsequent trade liberalisation. This will occur as Australia meets its APEC commitments by the year 2010. The government and industry are both committed to the long-term goals of trade liberalisation. The progressive reductions that have been achieved so far, and will be continued to the year 2000, will maintain this forward momentum. At the same time, they will deliver cheaper prices and higher quality to consumers. The cut in 2005 will continue this downward pressure on the automotive 1998 tariff. This is consistent with the government's broader approach to trade liberalisation and is fully supported by the automotive industry. 2. Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme The bill provides for the establishment of the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme. ACIS will encourage new investment in the automotive industry as it strengthens its position as a self-sustaining, competitive player in the world market. The scheme will encourage investments by automotive firms in the physical and intellectual assets which will secure competitive advantage for the industry in the longer term. It will do so in a manner which, the government believes, satisfies Australia's international obligations. The scheme is directed at the passenger motor vehicle industry. It is intended to encourage the development of competitive to the framefirms engaged directly in: 1. the production and assembly of passenger motor vehicles, 2. the manufacture of components and tooling and machine tools directly associated with such production, and in 3. the delivery of design, development, engineering and production services directly associated with such production. ACIS will do this by providing assistance under two separate sub-schemes. The subscheme for passenger motor vehicle, PMV, producers will: (i) extend the existing 15 per cent duty free allowance, DFA, earned on the production of passenger motor vehicles, PMVs, to 25 per cent: PMV manufacturers will also be able to earn duty credits for the production of engines and certain engine parts; and the allowance can be earned on production for all markets, as compared to the current DFA which is restricted to production for the Australian and New Zealand markets only; and Oi) enable PMV producers to earn a 10 per cent allowance on their investment in productive assets. The sub-scheme for component manufacturers and service providers will provide benefits at: (i) 25 per cent of the value of investment in productive assets; and (ii) 45 per cent of the value of investment in research and development. These benefits will also be available to PMV producers to the extent that they manufacture components-other than engines or engine parts-or provide eligible services for other parties. All benefits under ACIS will be paid as transferable duty credits, and wil1 be capped for each participating firm at five per cent of eligible sales in the preceding year to meet Australia's World Trade Organisation obligations. In total, the additional entitlements under the ACIS scheme will be capped for the industry as a whole at $2 billion over the years 2001 to 2005. These do not include the existing entitlements under the DFA-15 per cent on production of PMVs for Australia and New Zealand-the continuation of which was announced by the government on 5 June 1997, prior to the government's decision to establish ACIS. The bill provides for the administrative detail for ACIS to be detailed in subsidiary legislation in the. form of regulations and ministerial guidelines. 3. Summary This package is part of an integrated set of measures which will underpin the competitiveness of the automotive industry in the future. The two elements of the bill are complemented by the automotive market access and development strategy which was funded in the 1998-99 Budget. This strategy is directed by the Automotive Trade Council, which has representation from the highest levels in the industry. It is vital that this package be implemented as a whole. It has the full support of the industry, which is committed to delivering major new investment, employment and exports under the certainty of the measures embodied in the package. Each measure is contingent on the success of the other, and it is essential that the integrity of the package be maintained during the passage of the bill. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned.

At that conference to Canberra at taxpayers' expense was challenged that he had already addressed that problem, that Australia.
