48,Mr SPEAKER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I understand it is the wish of the House to debate the Grape Research Levy Amendment Bill concurrently with the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill. There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",18
49,Mr LLOYD,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The legislation concerns the wine section of the broader grape industry· of Australia. The grape industry is very complex because it has different elements. There are grapes for dried vine fruit-raisins, sultanas, et cetera-there are grapes for wine, particularly the premium varieties which are for wine only, and some of the other varieties which can have one of a number of ultimate uses-dried fruit, fresh fruit or wine-and then there is the fresh table grapes section, which has had some volatility in its rapid development but which generally has great potential for exports and is second to the packham pear as a fresh fruit export of this country. In addition to that complexity and volatility that there is in this movement of certain grapes from one end use to another, the report of the Industries Assistance Commission has caused considerable concern in the dried vine fruit section of the industry. If the report is adopted by the Government, more grapes of certain varieties could be forced into wine production but at the bulk end of the wine production scale, which is the declining sector. It is not the way for the Australian wine industry to go in the future and it is not the way the industry itself wants to go. The production for wine adds to the total volatile mix. In the season just completed, production of grapes for wine making reached 554,000 tonnes, an increase of over 20 per cent on the previous year. That dramatic increase in production comes at a time when domestic sales have declined by almost 7 per cent. BILL 1989 Increased costs have led to higher prices and the demand for lower priced soft-pack wine has decreased, as has the demand for brandy, fortified wine, and some other types of wine, 1989) but generally bottled wine sales have increased. The dramatic increase in exports evident in 1986-87 and 1987-88 has slowed this year when our total exports of 40 million litres are worth $1l3m. However, the value of those exports has increased from $97m to $1l3m, or 15 per cent, even though the increase in volume was only 3 per cent. The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation believes that export markets hold the key to future industry growth and prosperity and the Corporation is undertaking a detailed and intense analysis to help with future promotion and market development. Substantial production increases are projected for a number of premium varieties over the next couple of years, .some of which are as high as 40 per cent. Everyone connected with the industry acknowledges that there is considerable potential to increase exports from the one per cent share of the world export market that Australia now has. That potential exists because of the high and stable quality of Australian wine and its relatively low cost. The industry acknowledges that the export promotion program for wine was materially assisted with a grant of $100,000 from Austrade. The ongoing objective for the industry and the Corporation is the protection and further development of the good name of Australian wine. The Bills which we are debating today, and which the Opposition parties support, are a progressive step in ensuring that the good name and further development of Australian wine are enhanced. The Grape Research Levy Collection Act 1986 allows for a collection of research levies and the industry has agreed that the current rate should be increased. At the moment the maximum rate of the levy is SOc a tonne on grape!! and grape juice. The Grape Research Levy Amendment Bill proposes to lift the levy to $2 a tonne. This will allow a phased increase in the operative level-that is, actual level-of the levy by regulation. That will be done at the request of and in consulwill tation with the industry. That is part of the Government's program of approving the doltage, lar for dollar research arrangements with various primary industries up to a level of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of that commodity and it is in line with the policy which the previous coalition Governconsumer ment had and which the next coalition govlabel ernment will have. Therefore it is a very stable policy which will encourage further research and development in the very imporlabels tant primary industries of Australia and will encourage them to develop their export potential. The Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill will will allow the levy which provides the for the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation to be restructured to make it fairer and to provide more funds for marketing. Hunter. The levy is imposed on a range of grapes and grape juice used for wine manufacture and it has two components: a marketing amount to finance the Corporation and a discussions research amount for wine research. The levy is payable by winery proprietors using the equivalent of 20 tonnes or more of fresh grapes a year. It is proposed that this amount be reduced to 10 tonnes. At the moment the marketing component is a flat rate of $4 a tonne with a cap, maximum, of $20,000 per levy payer. This has led to smaller and medium sized wineries paying more than their share. For example, a winery crushing 5,000 tonnes pays $20,000 and a bigger winery crushing 80,000 tonnes also pays $20,000. The ceiling has also led to corporate amalgamations to reduce the levy. The ceiling is to be abolished and a gether. tiered levy system introduced with a sliding scale of rates with progressively lower rates as tonnage increases. The levy to fund Corporation will be a flat $200 for each levy payer plus an additional amount depending on the tonnage of grapes used in wine makThis ing. The new arrangements will raise about $750,000 this year and about $1.15m theretimes after. The most interesting concept of the package of legislation is the wine label integrity program that will be introduced by way of the the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill. The integrity program require wine manufacturers to keep records to support labelling claims of the vinvariety or region of origin of wine and to make those records and the stocks to which they relate available for audit by the Corporation. The reason for auditing is to ensure truth in labelling which will increase confidence in the reliability of wine claims. Sometimes when one visits wine areas or attends certain functions one hears the statements: 'There are more chardonnay on bottles than there are chardonnay it grapes capable of producing chardonnay' and 'More wine is claimed to have been produced in the Hunter Valley than it is possible to produce'. I guarantee that those things never be said in the future; those claims finance will not be able to be supported. Mr Andrew-You've got to watch the",18
50,Mr LLOYD,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Wine made anywhere in Australia is very good. Therefore, I will not enter into any of the parochial debates and that take place from time to time. The integrity program will increase consumer confidence, whether on the domestic market or on the export market. This program was developed by the Corporation in conjunction with the wine industry. It has the support of each of the three national or wine maker organisations. Its adoption was supported by a substantial majority of votes cast at the Corporation's annual meeting early this year. I believe that in total we have a positive package. I commend various elements of the wine industry for developing and proposing this package, and the Government and the Department for putting it toI will make one comment on taxation and the wine industry. Over the years the wine the industry has suffered from changes to the taxation regime relating to wine for maturation, excise versus sales tax and so forth. has created an understandable feeling of insecurity in the industry, and at various an inability to plan properly for the type of wine, particularly the better quality wine. There has been a continuing debate within the industry, between the industry and the Government and, for that matter, within the Opposition parties as to what is a correct and stable taxation regime for the wine industry. The point that the wine industry makes above all other aspects of the debate is that it wants stability in taxation so that it knows what it has to face and can plan accordingly. Many people in the industry would make that plea about taxation to the Government. The industry would like to know whether the present taxation regime will continue so that it can make investment plans accordingly. Two particular aspects of taxation of the wine industry have caused concern: one is the taxing on stock valuation, which has had a negative impact on the premium end of the market, and the other is an inappropriate designation by the Australian Taxation Office of depreciation on oak casks. The industry has been lobbying-the Opposition has been helping with this lobbying-the Government to look again at the depreciation allowance for oak casks. At present, they depreciate over a lO-year period. The wine industry maintains that the effective life of an oak cask for imparting the unique flavour to quality wines is less than three years. Because the depreciation for taxation is over 10 years, vignerons are reluctant to put more wine into oak to produce top quality wine. They also say that oak casks are used not merely for storage; they are used to affect the flavour and aroma by imparting oak flavour and tannin to it. After about three years, that cask will not impart these flavours. The casks can then be used only for storage rather than as an ingredient for wine making. At that stage, they are not even an effective storage system because of their size, so many are sold as flower pots. I am pleased that the lobbying by the industry, and by the Opposition, to the Tax Office has meant that----'-'-",19
51,Mr LLOYD,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,And by South Australians; 1 take that point. Mr Hand-The South Australian Government.,20
52,Mr LLOYD,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is just trying to get in for a Grand Prix at the moment. The Taxation Office has made the right decision and has accepted that depreciation should be allowed at the 25 per cent rate but in the complete calculation, because of certain other factors, it is closer to 30 per cent. 1 understand that is very close to what the industry wants. If I am not right, 1 would be pleased to be corrected. It is important that the industry know exactly the true position. That has been in place since the start of this financial year- If that is so, 1 commend all-if that helps the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand)-who have been associated with this legislation. The coalition supports the legislation.",20
53,Mr FITZGIBBON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"1 thank the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), for a quite reasonable summation of some of the major points contained in the Grape Research Levy Amendment Bill, the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill. 1 comment on only two points that he made. The tax on wine held for maturation has been looked at very closely by the Government. The country task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) visited the Hunter Valley. We talked to vignerons regarding this and we made some representations to the Cabinet. However, there are two sides to that story and the situation will be continually looked at. The honourable member for Murray also mentioned the depreciation allowance for wine casks. He said correctly that that matter has now been rectified. 1 do not want to be unfair to the honourable member, but when he was recently in my electorate he said that the Opposition would change the taxation processes on wine held for maturation. When 1 looked closely at the Opposition's economic policy recently brought down by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) 1 was unable to find any allowance for that promise. Mr L1oyd- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 1 made no such claim. 1 said the Opposition would review the taxation. We have already been successful in getting the depreciation-",20
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! There is no point of order.,21
55,Mr FITZGIBBON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am not trying to pick an argument with the Deputy Leader of the National Party. I do not know what he said when he was in the Hunter because I did not have the opportunity to hear him. But if my memory serves me correctly-and I have a fairly reasonable memory-a press release in one of the local papers in my electorate gave some promises to vignerons, saying that their appeals to him would be granted. But of course, as we would all be aware, many promises are made leading up to an election. I digress for one moment to say that there are 80 children from my electorate of Hunter in the gallery. We have a bus load of children from St Patrick's School in Cessnock. I am delighted that they are here. I am rather sorry that the Deputy Principal, who happens to be my wife, is not with them. We also have a bus load of children from Martindale School near Denman, which is a very beautiful part of my electorate. I welcome those visitors from my electorate to the House today. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this important package of Bills for the wine industry. (Quorum formed) I am glad that there are so many members of the Government in the House to hear my speech on the wine industry. I am disappointed that there is virtually no-one on the other !\ide of the House. I am proud to represent the prestigious Hunter Valley wine industry areas located in my electoratePokolbin, Branxton and Broke in the lower Hunter and in the upper Hunter at Jerrys Plains, .Denman, Hollydeen, Wybong, Sandy Hollow and Muswellbrook. As well . new vineyards are being established in the Gungal area just south of Merriwa. I refer to my area as prestigious because there is no doubt that some of the premium wines in Australia are produced in my electorate. Perhaps I am biased; I do not wish to enter into an argument with the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), but I believe the superb Hunter wines are unparalleled. My claim is supported by the number of awards won by my Hunter electorate vignerons, not only in Australia but also, on an increasing scale, in international wine judging events. Our beautiful Hunter Valley and its vineyards are a major tourist attraction and contribute significantly to our local economy. Yesterday the town planning departmerit of the Cessnock Council faxed me information on the value of tourist developments either taking place or proposed for the Pokolbin region of Cessnock. The figure was an amazing $315m. These developments totalling $315m are taking place in the city of Cessnock alone. Other major tourist developments are taking place in Maitland and Singleton and the upper Hunter areas. That indicates a staggering degree of tourist development. . As all honourable members would be aware, the wine industry is a most exciting industry. If honourable members are not familiar with the wine industry in the Hunter-if they live in Sydney, for eXll.mpie-they should not worry about flight problems; they should take the car out for a leisurely It hour drive to the Hunter Valley and taste its wines. They will never want to leave the area. Because of the disruption caused by the calling of a quorum, I will have to cut short my speech. I emphasise that, of all the wine varieties that are· found in Aus-ralia, the beautiful Hunter Valley has wines to please every palate. It is the fastest growing wine area in the world. A drive through the valley at the moment is particularly bracing; it is an exhilarating experience. The vines were recently pruned and now the canopies, the vine leaves, are beginning to appear on the fruiting wires. Spraying to protect the vines against disease is also taking place before raison begins. Turning to the Bills before the House, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill provides the legisl-tive basis for the implementation of the wine label integrity program. With a widely expanding domestic demand for premium wines, and because Australia is now a fast growing ex.porter of premium wines, it. is not only desirable but also an inherent necessity to protect the integrity of our Australian wine industry. Overseas experience has shown that it takes only one producer to act irresponsibly for the whole country's industry to suffer loss of export markets that are difficult to regain. The legislation before the House clearly sets out the requirement for our wine producers to keep records to support labelling claims of. the vintage, variety or region of origin of wine and to make those records and the stock to which they relate available for audit upon request by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. Because of time constraints it was not possible for me t() contact every vigneron in the Hunter Valley, but I did contact quite a few. MrSharp-M- Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I seek your ruling on whether it is appropriate for a member of the House to engage in debate with people other than those within the forum of the House. Just a short while ago we saw the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs engaging in what was quite obviously a conversation with people other than members of this Parliament. I wonder whether that is appropriate. In light of that, I seek a ruUng from you so that we can determine these matters in the future.",21
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,I thank the honourable member for drawing my attention to that breach of decorum. I think it is a breach of decorum of the rules of the House.,22
57,Mr FITZGIBBON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As I was saying, I contacted as many vignerons in my electorate as I possibly could and asked their opinion about the various matters which this legislation covers. In the main I found that they were very supportive of the legislation. We know that Murray and Bruce Tyrrell produce great wines. People who admire Murray's contribution to the wine industry, as we all do, will not be surprised by his frank and individual view. Murray believes that so long as the word 'Australian' is placed on our bottles that is sufficient for labelling purposes. Mr John Drayton was most appreciative of the chance to comment on the label integrity program. He gave that his strong support, as he did the wine grape levy. Mr Drayton said that the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill goes a long way towards improving the funding imbalance'that has existed in the past. He feels it is a fine step in the right direction. Mr Barry Shields, Secretary of the Hunter Valley Vineyard Association, supported Mr Drayton strongly. He pointed out that the Vineyard Association last year had lengthy talks with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) on a number of matters associated with the wine industry. They discussed this particular matter and were in agreement with it. The Hunter Valley Vineyard Association supports the label integrity program. Mr Chris Barnes, a grape grower and the owner of Blaxlands Barn restaurant, was most supportive of the Bill. He expressed some doubts, however, as Murray Tyrrell did. They hope that it does not lead to a labour-intensive and bureaucratic administrative board, which it will not. Murray Tyrrell was also a bit worried about the bookkeeping. But that certainly will not be excessive. I think most vignerons comply with the current legislation.  maker at Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd, faxed me comments on the three Bills. He agreed with the basic thrust of the three Bills and was most supportive of them. He concluded by saying of the Grape Research Levy Amendment Bill: . .' . the health of our industry will rely on a viable and active research program. He wished us every success in the implementation of the three important Bills which are before the House. Rosemount is a: very important exporter. It exports to 24 countries. It has established offices in Europe and San Francisco. As well as having a large share of the domestic market, Wyndham Estate at Branxton is a major exporter of premium wines. Wyndham's Export Director, Mrs Fay MCGuigan, wife of the Managing Director, Mr Brian MCGuigan, has been extremely successful in exporting the Wyndham group wines to 26 countries, including Japan: In Japan, Californian wine, which is not a patch on Australian wine, sells for up to $Al,OOO per bottle. I believe that Australian wines have unlimited prospects in Japan, Thailand, Malaysia and other Asian countries as well as on the European market. We have been doing rather well with our wine exports. There have been some minor fluctuations but it seems that this year will be quite a fair one. Everyone who is involved in the wine industry is of one mind-that these three Bills are the right way to go. The industry supports the legislation that is being enacted here today. One of the smaller winemakers in my electorate, Mr Don Francois of Pokolbin, presently crushes 18 tonnes of grapes and was previously exempt from the levy. Now he will have to pay, of course. But he is not too worried about that. He accepts the change to the levy exemption as being good for the industry. Don makes some excellent wines. His Chateau Francois was, and is,a great drop, which Don has superbly labelled. Mr f=""rancois raised with me the question of sales tax on wine that is used for wine tastings. Small wine producers use a high percentage of their wines at tastings at the cellar door and, while this does not impact to any large extent on the major producers, some of the small producers would like, say, up to 5 per cent of the wine which they give away to be tax exempt. Many of the vignerons in my electorate, whenever a charitable function is held, provide the wine free of charge. I feel that such an arrangement would be more equitable for small wine producers. My time is just about up, but I must extend my appreciation to all the grape growers and wine producers in my electorate. I particularly appreciate the support given to me by a most respected wine merchant-one of the most respected wine merchants in Australia-and a wonderful guy,  express my appreciation to the Hunter Valley wine producers for their cooperation, their friendship and their marvellous hospitality over the years. All the vignerons in the Hunter Valley have been very generous in their hospitality to visiting Ministers. Before concluding, I quote anachronistically from Louis Pasteur, who said: 'A meal without Hunter wine is like a day without sunshine'. I congratulate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. My vignerons, as do all the farmers in my electorate, acclaim him as the best primary industry Minister ever. I commend the Bills to the House.",22
58,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,23
59,Mr ANDREW,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"ln this debate on the Grape Research Levy Amendment Bill, the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill, I am sure that we can all forgive the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) for the measure of parochialism he has shown, particularly in view of the fact that we are told that he has an audience in the gallery from his electorate. In fact, I suspect that within this House one would find that there are members around who claim to represent wine-making electorates and who claim to represent winemakers whose wine is without peer. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Hand) shakes his head. I am not sure whether he does so to indicate that he does not have any wine manufacturers in his electorate or whether he regrets the fact that he does not have any whom he is able to represent. But I have no doubt that whether a member comes from the electorate of Hunter, Mayo, Barker, MCEwen, Casey, Indi, Wakefield, Adelaide, Gilmore or Curtin he would have an opinion about which is or is not the appropriate wine for a particular meal. The legislation before the House deals very much with the reputation of the Australian wine industry. I acknowledge the wine industry's role in ensuring that it has a reputation as a quality winemaker and its enthusiasm in getting the Government to put into place legislation that would underscore what the industry is already trying to achieve itself. For example, 18 months ago the industry set up a wine industry forum under the chairmanship of Mr Brian Croser, a-South Australian, who happens to live in the electorate of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). Mr Croser, commenting on the forum and writing an article in July 1988, expressed his concern that, in labelling integrity, the Australian wine industry should have a higher profile. The wine industry forum-this body of which Mr Croser is the president-was set up entirely by the industry to ensure that the industry's image was enhanced. The industry is as concerned as any other Australian primary industry, more so than many, about the risk of being blamed for the quite intolerable alcohol abuse in our community. It is not in the interest of the wine industry nor in the interest of society for alcohol abuse to continue. The wine industry forum has been anxious to ensure that the question of integrity can be applied to the wine industry across the spectrum of its activities. I note, for example, that while Australians are regarded by world standards as being relatively high consumers of alcoholic beverages, we consume only 25 per cent per capita of the wine that the French, the Italians and the Portuguese consume. So it is probably fair for the forum and for the wine industry generally to endeavour to separate wine and its impact in the community from the impact in the community of other alcoholic beverages. Mr Croser and his forum have endeavoured to emphasise advantages that the community may find from the responsible consumption of wine. The legislation before the House this morning fits in with the objectives of the wine industry forum. The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill is set up, as the honourable member for Hunter and the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) have stressed, to look at integrity in wine labelling, to ensure some form of real consumer protection. We are dealing with two other Bills at the same time: one allows for the equitable collection of a levy to fund the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and the other allows for the collection of additional research funds to enable effective research into grape growing and winemaking in Australia. The wine industry has seen some dramatic, changes over the past six or eight years. In 1988-89, domestic sales of wine were down by 22.3 million litres on the figures for the previous year-a fall of 8.8 per cent. Conversely, export sales of wine were up by 1.3 million litres-an increase of 3.2 per cent. This resulted in a 5.7 per cent fall overall in export and domestic markets for Australian wine. A great deal of optimism has been placed in the export industry as to the direction for Australian winemakers to take, and as a technique by which winemakers may play a role in addressing our present disastrous balance of payments deficit. In 198687 and 1987-88 the export of Australian wine increased by 84 per cent. In 1988-89, possibly because of our rising dollar, there has been a restricted increase of only 3.4 per cent. The most dramatic increase, because it comes from a very narrow base, has, been in the export of Australian champagne. The overall growth in that sector has been 109 per cent, although, as I said, it is from a very small base, which means that champagne still accounts for only 3.5 per cent of total wine industry exports. Of all Australian export industries-and it is probably fair to say, of all Australian primary export industries-the wine industry relies most on consumer confidence and on the faith the consumer places in the labelling on the bottle. The industry is built entirely on reputation. Whether in Australia or overseas, if a wine purchaser chooses a bottle of wine, he or she invariably chooses it with a view to cellaring it. So, it may well be f04r, five or six years before that bottle of wine, particularly in the case of red wine, is consumed. When after five or six years they take the cork out of the bottle, they cannot very well rush back to the wine wholesaler and claim their money back if they are dissatisfied. Consumers depend very much on the wine industry's reputation when they purchase a bottle of wine, whether it is for immediate consumption or for cellaring. For this reason the Opposition supports the Government, as does the wine industry, in the introduction of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill. This Bill is designed entirely to enhance the reputation of the Australian wine industry. When I was preparing my comments for this morning 1 noted that one James Russell Lowell, reflecting on the word 'reputation', ,said that a man's-and, I suppose, an industry's-reputation is only a candle, of a wavering and uncertain flame, and easily blown out. But it is the light by which the world looks for and finds merit. I think the Governmentrecognises that the reputatiori of any industry is very fragile, but that same fragile reputation is, in marketing terms, the light by which a market may be opened up. In his second reading contribution the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) made the point that the introduction of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill is principally to increase consumer confidence in the reliability of the claims made on a wine label and enhance the reputation for quality and value of Australian wine in domestic and export markets. The Opposition believes that this enhanced reputation is the key to a successful future for the Australian wine industry, so we are pleased to support the legislation. The other point that needs to be made is that the Australian wine industry currently holds 97 per cent of the domestic market for wine. We will continue to hold that proportion of the domestic market only while we continue to hold the confidence of Australian domestic consumers. Every consumer knows that the price which a winemaker can command for a premium domestic wine makes it attractive for unscrupulous people to be less than honest in their labelling. In fact, so concerned is the industry about this it has been prepared to put in place some form of self-regulation. The knowledge that this self-regulation is now being backed by government legislation, which will allow detection of breaches, will be a strong deterrent to anyone who chooses to abuse the present system. ' There are two other Bil1s before the House: the Grape Research Levy Amendment Bill and a Bill to allow for the financing of the Australian Wine Corporation in a more equitable manner. I believe that the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill, which provides the funds that the Corporation needs, fits in very much with the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill, which will provide for integrity in labelling and ensure that winemakers and purchasers can be sure that the labelling on a bottle of wine reflects its contents. What must be appreciated about the Corporation, which will be funded principally by the legislation before the House, is that it has been largely responsible for servicing the increase in exports and in providing facilities for the promotion of Australian wine overseas. Australian wine exports have increased from $20.5m in 1985-86 to an estimated $133m in export earnings this financial year. This is a five-fold increase in the export earnings of Australian wine. The Corporation, which has helped to foster this increase in export earnings, has also been concerned to see that the legislation before the House ensuring that labelling is accurate is in _place. The Corporation has had a real interest in promoting accurate labelling, and one of the Bills we are debating this morning will provide the funds for the Corporation to do its job and promote export earnings. As the honourable member for Murray said, the Corporation is currently funded by a flat rate of $4 a tonne with a cap of $20,000 per levy payer. The Bill before the House allows this to be changed because, under the present legislation; a winery crushing 5,000 tonnes pays $20,000 in levy fees and a larger winery crushing 80,000 tonnes also pays $20,000 in levy fees. The ceiling is to be abolished to ensure that the contribution that wineries make to the Corporation-and the contribution that the Corporation can therefore make to export earnings-reflects more accurately the tonnage crushed by the winery. We endorse that because ,we believe it is a more equitable way to go about raising funds for the Corporation. The third Bill before the House is the Grape Research Levy Amendment Bill, which would increase the maximum rate of levy that may be imposed for grape research. As has been the case with a number of other Bills debated in the House this week, this is part of the Government's objective to increase the contribution that industries make towards their own research, by matching the government dollar for dollar up to 0.5 per cent of the total income of that industry. Currently, the maximum rate of levy that the wine grapes industry makes to grape research is 50¢ per tonne. The legislation before the House would increase this to $2 per tonne, which would mean that, whereas in the financial year 1987-88 something like $270,000 was made available for wine grapes research, in the current year up to $520,000 could be made available for wine grapes research. The wine grape industry is a complex industry. It covers wine grapes, dried grapes, fresh grapes and grape juice. The honourable member for Murray has alluded to its complexity. But it has an additional complication; any grapes used specifically for drying, grape juice, wine and as fresh grapes, can also be used for anyone of the other purposes. Any impact of the Government's legislation on the wine grape industry will also have repercussions for the dried fruit and fresh fruit industries. It is, therefore, a complex exercise to find legislation that is appropriate for the grape industry because, if the wine industry is down, the dried fruit industry will be similarly affected. As every wine grape grower can tell us, if the dried fruit industry is adversely affected-for example by the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission report currently being considered by the Government-the fall in dried vine fruit prices will have repercussions for wine grape growers. I conclude by echoing some of the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Murray. He expressed the concern that the Opposition-and, I believe, the Government-has had to ensure that the Treasury applies a tax rate on maturing stocks of wine that does not deter people from maturing wine. I opened my speech by referring to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill; a Bill designed to ensure that the reputation of the Australian wine industry is enhanced. Unless we encourage winemakers to lay down stocks and mature wines and to make a quality product, our well-intentioned exercise in ensuring that belling reflects what is in the bottle will largely be wasted. In order to enhance the integrity of the Australian wine industry we must also encourage winemakers to make a quality product. The Opposition will always support the Government when its objective is to ensure that what Australians are exporting will do their reputation good.",23
60,Mr CLEELAND,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"1 welcome the constructive comments of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and I find myself in agreement with the majority of what he has said. I note his support for a progressive levy on the wine industry and I hope that he follows that through to a progressive taxation system and continues to support a progressive taxation system. It is appropriate that I join the debate today, as the Victorian Wine Show was held in Seymour only last Saturday. This is the ninth year of the Victorian Wine Show, which was started by the Seymour Agricultural Society to promote Victorian wine. As most people realise, Victoria was the . largest ducer of wine in Australia until the grapes were devastated by phyloxia at the end of the nineteenth century, and the industry was then devastated. Over the years the Hunter Valley and the Barossa Valley have grown at a much faster rate than the Victorian industry could. Now Victoria is again claiming its rightful place among the grape producing areas of the country as a major wine producer. Victoria has now become one of the great boutique wine producers, particularly of varietal wines. For many years the shiraz grape was one of the great premium grapes, producing great red wines. With the advent of the cabernet, merlot, malbec and pinot, among others, shiraz died away as a very popular wine, but it is pleasing to. note that the major winners of the wine show last Saturday were shiraz grapes. Any member who has an interest in red wine should now look very closely at Victorian shiraz. The wines are back at their peak again and the small Victorian producers specialising in shiraz are now producing wines of great complexity, with a great flavour of grape and great cellaring potential. In my electorate, particularly in the Heathcote area, la- many small vineyards are producing great varietal grapes, particularly in the shiraz and chardonnay areas. I do not want to get into a debate about which electorate or State has the best wine because, like the honourable member for Wakefield, I say that Australia, generally, produces some of the great wines in the world. It is interesting to note within the total industry the varietal characteristics that each area can produce. The varietal distinctions-different areas producing from different soils and different climatic conditionshave produced the great variety of wines for which the country is so famous. It is a great thrill for me to note that Australian wines are now winning awards throughout the world. It is interesting to note also that overseas producers, particularly the French, are now coming into Australia and investing heavily in our wine industry because they realise that we are leading the world in many fermentation techniques. Australia has developed some interesting fermentation techniques, particuprolarly the cold fermentation process, which other countries are now trying to emulate. We have a most exciting and technologically advanced industry, largely because our small producers are prepared to put their money where their mouths are and experiment with a whole variety of production techniques and grape varieties. It would be remiss of me if I did not give credit to the producers in my electorate, including Peter Touley and his wife at the MCIvor Creek Winery in Heathcote. They produce primarily shiraz, with some white wine production. In the area there is an association of wine producers, headed by Ron and Elva Laughton, who run the Jasper Hill Winery, and I recommend their wines. These wines are not often found in shops. The variety of wines available from each district is not readily available in shops. This is of a tragedy, because most of the larger brand producers, which sell in large volumes, manage to keep the wines of most of our smaller producers off the major bottle shop shelves. Yet the smaller producers' wines sell well, mostly from their own vineyards. The Victorian wine producing districts are increasingly moving into cold climate wines. It may surprise people to know that, even on the lower slopes of Mount Buller, which is a well-renowned ski area, the Delatite vineyard is producing some of the great pinot noirs produced in this country and its rhine riesling is a wine that must be experienced to appreciate both the beauty of the wine and the quality of the production. On the Strathbogie Ranges, which is quite miserable during winter and is a very cold area-(Quorum formed) Before I was interrupted I was going through the major vineyards in my electorate and extolling the virtues not only of my own electorate wines but of Australian wines generally. I was referring to the cold climate wine production in the Strathbogie Ranges. If honourable members want to taste cold climate wine, particularly the chardonnay variety, I can certainly recommend the Tisdale Mount Helen, which is grown in my electorate in very cold climate conditions. It is pleasing to note that there is now a major increase in production occurring in the Strathbogie Ranges. I have mentioned those various areas just to give an indication of the depth of variety and the innovation occurring amongst wine producers. At the show last Saturday night a large audience at the major function of the evening sat back and enjoyed some excellent Victorian wines and some very good Tasmanian sea trout. Australia is becoming a producer of quality foods and quality wine. I think this is what this legislation is all about. However, there are great problems. This is not to suggest that Australia is suddenly going to increase its export production easily. There are major tariff barriers in many places in the world which discriminate against the fine wines we are producing. An example very close to home is Thailand, where there is a 60 per cent tariff barrier against Australian wines. I have stressed on my visits to Thailand as Chairman of the Australian-Thai a bit Parliamentary Friendship Group that a country such as Thailand, which relies so heavily on tourism, should be removing the tariff barriers to allow greater access of Australian wines to their market. We are together in the Cairns trading group. We are both suffering as nations from distorted trading practices. It is appropriate that Thailand look very closely at removing that barrier to Australian wines. When I have travelled to Thailand I have found the price of wine prohibitive. A bottle of good Australian wine is frankly beyond the reach of most tourists. European wines are cheaper and more readily available. I would urge Thai Airways, who fly into this country, to get rid of their French wines and buy good Australian wines. We sell cheaper and better quality wines than most other places in the world. Very close to our own front door are areas of discrimination against this country's wine production and wine producers. The discrimination we face really makes us wonder. Yet one can travel to Europe, and even in England at Harrods, and buy Australian winesat a price that I could not afford, I might add. They are grossly overpriced, in my view, but nevertheless they are in the British market and in most European markets. One must give credit to the Wynyard Group in the Hunter, who have led the export market, for the way. they have broken down many export barriers and are now making Australian wines popular throughout the world. I understand now that the Californian market is opening up to Australian wines and I look forward to an increased presence of Australian producers there. I see that Penfolds has purchased a producer in California, where it will introduce into wine production Australian techniques and will be using that as a major base for the introduction of Australian wines, through its control of that wine production area, into California. That all augurs well for the future. It is an indication of quality win-s we have. I think the proposal to introduce some appellation controls-not full appellation, I might add-is to be encouraged. In the past there have been some unfortunate incidents where Australian producers have breached wine standards. The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation has investigated three instances lately of breaches of Australian wine standards. For example, in November 1988 sorbitol, a sugar naturally present in some fruits but not permitted in winemaking, was found in Tyrrells' wines. Tyrrells' export licence was suspended on 3 November 1988 and was not reinstated until 8 December 1988. The Health Department of New South Wales prosecuted Tyrrells and it was fined $120. In November 1988 there were indicators of apple juice present in Miranda wines. These are two examples of how an enormous market potential for Australia could be damaged by quite careless marketing techniques to change poorer quality wines to better tasting wines. I agree totally with the honourable member for Wakefield that if Australia is going to become a major exporter and increase its exports it is essential that we maintain integrity, that there be truth in labelling and that the wine be described by type and method of production and by area. As we go down the track I think we will see greater integrity in our wines and in our labelling processes. As I have indicated, the overall future is bright. The Grape Research Levy Amendment Bill is to vary the rate of levy-not so that the levy rate per se changes but rather so that the method of collection based upon tonnage pressed will change. The honourable member for Wakefield mentioned that the large producers have paid the same amount as smaller producers. As I have said, this is a progressive levy. It spreads the burden of the levy between the rate of production of grapes, which will spread the burden of the levy more fairly between small and large producers. The Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill has the wide support of the industry, as does all the legislation before the House now. We have an exciting industry in this country. I am a great lover of Australian wines and I occasionally taste foreign wines. I be the lieve that we are fortunate in the price we pay for our wines. The amount of wine sold in this country has reduced but it is interesting to note that the reduction has been in chateau cardboard, the major bulk wines that go into the container in the cardboard pack, and there has been an increase in the sale of bottled wine. That indicates that there is an increasing sophistication in the Australian wine market. It is no longer the case, as when I was a young man, that wine isrefe!red to as a 'sixpenny dark'. No longer are wme cellars the places they used to be in my youth where deros, as they were called, and other less savoury characters would sneak in, come out with a brown paper bag with a bottle of some unknown alcohol in it, and sidle off down the street drinking out of the bag. Those days have gone. Today Australia has a sophisticated wine market, a sophisticated consumer market and a sophisticated Australia-wide group of producers which deserve the total support of this House and this Parliament. I commend the Bills to the House.",26
61,Mr EWEN CAMERON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Indi) (12.10)Very few honourable members in this place would not have some commercial wine production in their electorates. Of course, all of them are proud of their wine producers and the wine produced by them. I agree with the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland), who said that this must be looked upon as a national industry, and our pride spreads right across the nation. I was very impressed by the comments made by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). I know that some very fine wine is produced in his electorate and that the honourable member is very knowledgeable about the industry. I have had the pleasure of travelling to many States with the honourable member for Wakefield and other members of the Opposition, and talking to people involved in the Australian wine industry and discussing their problems. The three Bills before us today are the Grape Research Levy Amendment Bill 1989 the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill 1989: and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 1989, all of which are important pieces of legislation which will affect the Australian wine industry. I would like to confine my few remarks to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill. It provides the legislative basis for the implementation by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation of a wine label integrity program. It is not an appellation scheme; it is an identification scheme to identify the product within the bottle or under the label. As the honourable member for MCEwen pointed out, this is a particularly important step forward in the industry because some other matters have intruded into those stated on the label and there have been some unfortunate experiences within the wine industry. The legislation requires that all wine facturers engaged in the process of wine production for commercial purposes keep a record of the vintage, variety, region of origin, source of supply and quantity of grape product received for use in making the wine. This will enable the Corporation to monitor claims made on the label by the manufacturers as to vintage, variety, region of origin and so on. Winemakers making these claims on labelswill also have to keep records relating to production, sales and disposal of the wine so that the Corporation may check the authenticity of claims made on wine labels. This program is a significant step forward in the remarkable progress made by the Australian wine industry in the production of quality wines. The honourable member for MCEwen referred to sixpenny dark, which was a port-styled fortified wine used by some people after the war. It was not drunk at the table or by the refined drinker. I must admit that I remember it as twopenny dark. That gives an indication of the inflation in those times. The days are long past when that was a favoured drink by some people. We now have world class table wines and world class fortified wines, and the industry has made enormous strides since those days. The controlled identification program will assist in creating even further confidence' in the consumer. The confidence that has been building up over the years will be taken further by this program. The program was overwhelmingly approved by the wine industry when it was put to the vote at the second annual general meeting of the Australian wine industry in Adelaide on 8 February this year. It was not a unanimous vote, but by far the largest number of producers welcomed the scheme. I am sure that those who did not vote for it will eventually see the merit of the scheme. At the meeting, the Corporation was asked to have the label integrity program in place for the start of the 1990 vintage. The confidence generated in the consumer market will enhance our export markets, which have enormous potentiaL They are very tough and competitive markets, but Australian producers of quality wine have made a real impact, a real dent, in those markets. We export to such countries as the United States of America, Canada, Japan, manu- the United Kingdom, Denmark, the Netherlands, the Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland and New Zealand, and to countries in South East Asia, and there is potential to export to many other countries. These markets will only be retained and expanded by maintaining our reputation for producing and delivering top quality wines. Another area in which the Government could assist the industry greatly in the production of top quality wines is taxation. I refer in particular to section 31A of the Act, which requires the winemaker to value and pay tax on wine at the time of manufacture. This, of course, creates liquidity problems and the manufacturer is often under financial pressure to sell his product well before it has had enough maturation time to become' a top quality wine. It would be of enormous value to the industry in its endeavours to further develop and expand export markets if the manufacturer could pay the tax at the time of sale rather than at the time of manufacture. The Government should take a hard look at these proposals. All three Bills have great merit. We as an Opposition support them, and I commend them to the House.  me pleasure to have the opportunity to enter this debate. The Bills have had great support from both sides of the House. They deal with a very important Australian industry, and it is only when one evaluates its impact upon Australia's image that one understands how great the wine industry is. For that reason I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Grape Research Levy Amendment Bill and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill. This debate has given honourable members the opportunity to identify with their own areas and I, too, intend to become regional in my remarks. The legislation is of special significance to South Australia because that State is promoted as the Wine State. A grand prix starts in Adelaide at the end of this week and among its attractions are the wine growing areas in the regional and peripheral areas of Adelaide. From the time when wine was used for medicinal purposes, the humble grape has had a huge impact on society. This is demonstrated in the religious sacraments in the Christian As we take communion we hear the words 'And after He gave thanks He took the cup and said, ""Drink ye all of this"".' Wine has had a huge impact down through the ages and more particularly at present. In the colonial days of settlement, the names of Gramp, Seppelt, Penfold, Lehmann and Hardy were synonymous with wine development in Australia, and particularly South Australia. They have been joined by the other great names of Wolf Blass, the Hill--mith Yalumba family, Grant Burge, Brian Croser and many other emerging and great winemakers and oenologists. Certainly Roseworthy College in South Australia has had a good deal to do with the wine industry in Australia. Several other regional winemakers have been plying their craft in the regional areas from Coonawarra to the Riverland, the Southern Vales, the Adelaide Hills, Barossa Valley and Clare Valley and other pockets of wine production. We have heard other Government and Opposition colleagues speak of the Hunter area of New South Wales and the Victorian wine-growing areas. We should also mention the Leeuwin and Margaret River estates in Western Australia. The wine industry is huge. To protect this multimillion dollar industry, it is tant that its credibility be maintained and that is why it is important that the consumer be aware of the contents of a bottle. The main purpose of this Bill is to provide the basis for a wine label integrity program. Probably the most famous name in red wine is Penfold's Grange Hermitage. The father of Grange, the great winemaker, Max Schubert, AM, had to battle with his peers when he laid down the first bottle of his world famous red in the early 1950s. He was up against an industry that said that the wine would not survive, that it was an uncharacteristic red that had no quality and that it had to mature in the bottle. I am certainly grateful to members from both sides of the House who referred to Section 31A of the taxation Act, which I will close on eventually. But, if Max Schubert had been prevented from persisting with his skill and craft in developing that Magill grape into Penfold's Grange Hermitage, which is id-ntified by its label as being of excellent quality and characteristic of the grape, he would have faith. been prevented from producing one of the truly great red wines that Australia has seen. Label identification shows the integrity of the winemaker. It shows to the consumer the integrity of the grape. When one sees a bottle with the name chardonnay, pinot noir or fume blanc, one is aware of the contents. When one sees the names cabernet savignon or shiraz for red wines, one knows whether the wine is full-bodied or late on the palate. Wine is not elitist. Anyone can drink it and anyone does. It is said that someone's loss is someone else's gain. The biggest impact on Australia's wine industry came from the most horrific disaster known as Chernobyl. It had a huge impact on our wine industry. Australia was able to benefit from that and export vast quantities of grapes as either juice or wine. Here again, it comes down to the integrity of labelling. Consumers knew that our wine really was Chernobyl-free. It gave them confidence that what was in the bottle they were buying was what was on the label. Glass is a marvellous product that we are able to look through to see whether the wine is red or white but it does not help us to know whether it is a quality product. My colleague the honourable member for impor- MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) joked about the chateau cardboard. The trend has gone away from the chateau floodwaters and the chateau rotgut, because of people's satirical attitude, and towards the great varieties. People are choosing to purchase wine of quality rather than just quantity. I keep coming back to consumer faith and integrity in the product. When we analyse who benefits from and who impacts on the grape industry, there are the growers and the producers. My colleague the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) spoke about fresh grapes, dried grapes and grape juice. He mentioned the pruners, the pickers, the cellar hands, the winemakers, the glass and packaging industry, the labelling, the corkage, the marketing and the retailing. Once the product is in the bottle, to whom do we sell it and what is done with it? That comes down to the consumers. Consumers are protected in everything they purchaseand rightly so-whether it is soft goods, cars or clothes. They should also be protected when buying wine. In' a pleasant, convivial atmosphere, wine can enhance a social occasion such as lunch or dinner. As I have said, it is not an elitist beverage. Anyone can drink it, although it is preferable that consumers are over the age of 18. That is the beauty of wine and the impact that it has. The honourable member for MCEwen touched on the quality and price of wine. One can buy a bottle of wine, whether red or white, for $9.99 and know from the label that it will be of reasonable quality. We also have cheap bottles of fizz that have to compete with the snobby, elitist, prestigious French market, with the champagne area of Europe. There is really not a great deal of difference between Great Western, Yellowglen and SeppeJts champagnes when stacked up against the Bollinger and Veuve Clicquot. The honourable member for MCEwen referred to Thailand. It is disappointing that there is a huge tariff barrier in Thailand of 60 per cent. I had the opportunity recently to travel to Japan. The Japanese love anything French in the way of wine. They love anything that has a chateau label and, after that, anything Californian. Australia. has a lot of work to do. I have done some research with Wolf Blass, a very entrepreneurial and charismatic wine producer in Australia. He says it is not enough for entrepreneurs to go overseas with a pallet of wine and a return air ticket and hope to crack the export market. Consumers in those markets know what they want. We will have to work on those markets. I congratulate Austrade for subsidising the effort put into the export promotion program with a grant of more than $100,000. The export potential must be there. We must seek to increase the one per cent share that Australia has of world wine exports and crack the market waiting there. Total wine exports have increased from $97m to $1l3m. That is an increase of 15 per cent or of 3 per cent in volume. Obviously, the production of grapes is increasing. The industry is in a state of flux at the moment because high prices have been paid for grapes. Wine producers have gone to New Zealand to buy very expensive pinot grapes to suit a vintage. As more wine comes on to the market, if consumer demand does not increase, we will have a glut of wine. We see from the daily newspapers that wine entrepreneurs are selling quality wine under $10 or $15, which makes it a very cheap beverage. We must work at removing the tariff barrier in Thailand and improving our export market to Japan. There is a good side and a bad side to everything. I am most concerned that the wine industry be aware of the anti-alcohol lobby group. Alcohol in moderation is tolerable. As more evidence is brought forward of the horrific crashes and deaths that occur on the· road, they are linked back, rightly or wrongly, to alcohol, under-age drinking or high speed in trucks, cars or buses. The industry will certainly come under scrutiny. It will have to do a lot of marketing to convince the community that alcohol in moderation is morally acceptable. While the industry appears rosy in some areas, it must be aware of the pressures from outside that will be placed upon it. We have seen the anti-tobacco lobby have success in winding down tobacco advertising. Likewise, I feel that there could be an anti-alcohol or wowser attitude to the wine industry. I want to include a few references to matters that have been touched on by other members, although I will not prolong this speech too much. The production of grapes for winemaking reached 554,000 tonnes in 1989. That represents a huge industry, ranking with some of our great primary production industries. It is a credit to that very well researched and organised industry. Unfortunately, as I have said, domestic sales declined by 6.9 per cent. I guess that increased costs have led to higher prices. The demand for lower priced, soft-pack wine has decreased, as the honourable member for MCEwen said, in that carton and cask industry, but the demand for quality bottled wine has inis creased. I have a particular bias towards some quality wines from my electorate that are obtainable across the length and breadth of South Australia. They really are a credit to Australia. Whichever regional area is sen, the winemakers are recognised. Bollinger has come back into Australia to share some if its skills, or perhaps to pirate the skills Brian Croser of Petaluma; Wolf Blass on the great Remy winehouse of France. we have this cross-pollination of ideas and skills. The wine industry deserves the supviveur. port that is provided in this legislation, which has received Government and Opposition support. Finally, I would like to support section 31A of the taxation Act, which seems to penalise stock at valuation-wine held for maturation. We encourage the winemakers of Australia to lay down their stocks and continue their degree of excellence. At wine shows around the world the consistent comwines ment is, 'These wines are sensational but why are they so young?'. Honourable meming. bers could go to any bottle shop, probably even in Parliament House, and buy a 1986 or 1987 bottle of red wine. That is a baby; it is a very young red to be drinking, but that wine were cellared and matured it be even greater. This part of the industry needs support and it should not be open to the rorts that may have taken place under section 31A. Winemakers must have the opportunity to continue this degree of excellence, to duce these great Australian wines and to keep us at the forefront of the industry. They deserve a lot of help to ensure that crack that great export market to help our chronic current account deficit and to mainof tain the great skills that have been developed in the winemaking industry throughout Auspation tralia.",28
62,Mr MILDREN,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"1 do not enter this debate with the personal perience or love of wine that has been evi550 dent from a number of honourable members who have taken part in this debate. This one of the problems of being abstemious in one's habits. However, I happen to be very interested in the wine industry because it is a significant part of the economy of the region of Australia from which I come. That the central highlands of Victoria, around Ballarat, through the Pyrenees, around Avoca and Moonambel, through Ararat to the Great Western area-I think very few people in Australia would not have encountered at chosome stage or other the label 'Great Western' as it applies to the methode champ enoise-and, of course, Yellowglen. I am very of pleased to see the honourable member for took Bowman (Mr Jull) nodding his head in So agreement, and the honourable member for  Mr Jull-Have you got All Saints?",32
63,Mr MILDREN,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I have a 'lot of very holy people in my electorate! Of course, Taltarni and Chateau Remy are vineyards and wineries that also make very high standard wines. Victoria has been producing an increasing quantity of wine and it has a long-standing to history in wine production. The way in which it is developing now is interesting. Its quality are being recognised by the increasing proportion of the export market it is receivFor instance, in 1986-87, 17,827 hectares of bearing vines were in production. This produced 67,133 tonnes of grapes for winemaking and 221,482 tonnes of drying and if table grapes. Fourteen per cent of Australian would wines were then produced in Victoria. During the past three decades the growth of the Australian wine industry has been remarkable. In 1963, total wine production was 136,116 kilolitres and in 1988 this had increased to 407,772 kilolitres. Beverage wine prohas increased from 67,518 kilolitres to 354,396 kilolitres. On a world scale that is not terribly significant because it represents we about 2 per cent of world production. Generally, the wine industry is a high employer labour. It provides seasonal employment for a large labour force and a steady occuin the winemaking side of the indus. try. Where wine is produced largely in rural areas it is a significant part of the rural execonomy. There are 4,500 grape growers and of them are in wineries. Significantly, 24 major wineries produce 85 per cent of Ausis tralian wine and 15 per cent is produced by 500 smaller wineries, largely called the boutique wineries which concentrate on the quality end of the market. While domestic sales of Australian wine were 308 million lit res in 1988-89, this was a decline of approximately 7 per cent on the previous year. As has been mentioned by previous speakers, most of this was at the lower end of the market-that is, the cask wines. Of course, it is quite possible that Australians are becoming somewhat more discerning in their wine drinking habits. Wine is a considerable export revenue earner. The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), who is at the table, would know that wine is a value added product. In fact, it varies from high value added down to what is still substantial value added. That is one of the things this Government is very supportive of and one of the reasons why it was concerned to ensure that the Wine and Brandy Corporation was placed on a sound, business like basis. As I have said, there was a decline of 7 per cent in domestic wine sales on the previous year, largely at the bottom end of the market, in the cask area. However, in 1986-87 and in 1987-88 exports of Australian wines doubled each year and the decline tended to show up somewhat in 1988-89. The major area of sensitivity was the United States of America, probably as a result of the higher Australian dollar. It is of interest that very good Australian chardonnays are selling in places like Los Angeles for about $1.99, which indicates that a marketing effort is being made to recapture some of that lost market. Total wine exports were worth $113.3m. Most of our exports have been to about six major countries. Sweden takes a large amount of our bulk, low-priced wines. In the United Kingdom, 25 exporters are working in cooperation with the Corporation on marketing these wines. Anyone who goes to the United Kingdom and talks with people about Australian products will find people talking about quality Australian wines. Given the history of Australian wine sales to Britain over time, obviously an enormous effort has to be made to achieve long-term and permanent inroads into that market. In earlier times, some of the wines that were exported to Britain must have made the British wonder whether the horse had been shot. As I said, we export wine to the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Japan and the United States. (Quorum formed) It is always pleasing to see my colleagues in here. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) is the only member of the National Party of Australia present. He is required to be here because he happens to be on duty at the table. However, I am afraid that the rest of his colleagues are notable by their absence. Mr Barry Jooes-They might be drinking.",32
64,Mr MILDREN,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business suggests that they may be out drinking wine. That is a scandalous thing to say! The issues covered by the three Bills which we are dealing with today are very much germane to the interests of the industry. In fact, they have the concurrence of the opinion of the industry. Last night when I read the Melbourne Herald, which is something I do not normally do, I noticed a comment by Ian Mackay which is of significance, certainly to honourable members from Victoria. He stated: Latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show Victoria closing on NSW as the number two wine exporter in the country . . . with 5.1 million litres or 8.3 per cent of the Australian total of 61.6 miJIion litres exported in 1988-89. What is interesting is that the return from this wine was $19.6 million, or 17 per cent of the total $114 million. This reflects the high profile of the Victorian exports, quality bottled wine apparently in growing demand. It is extremely important for all honourable members to support the legislation, particularly the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill whiCh establishes the wine label integrity program. Unless there is label integrity in the wine industry we cannot expect to be able to maintain the momentum which has developed in increasing our hold on export markets. This is a sine qua non. I remind honourable members who have not have had a deep look at the Bill to do so. They should realise that the industry is ensuring that the quality is maintained.",33

He engaged in the big smear. He came into this Parliament and suggested that the. President of the Liberal Party of Australia had engaged in some sort of corrupt practice by getting the Opposition to change a tax policy so that he would benefit for pecuniary reasons and that he would get a significant pecuniary gain.",34
68,Mr GEAR,TREASURER,"Well, why did you do it?  side just interjected and said, 'Well, why did you do it?'. The reality is that we did not. Let me go through the dates-this is where the lie is. The Liberal and National parties have been opposed to a capital gains tax since its possibility was first mooted by the Australian Labor Party in the 1980 election. When, I think in 1983, the Economic Planning Advisory Council made a recommendation in favour of a capital gains tax and the Government picked it up, right from the start we said that we were opposed to it and that we would abolish any capital gaihs tax. Of course, we did not believe that we would be in that position because, as honourable members will recall, during the 1983 election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) virtually said, 'There will be no capital gains tax'. We did not think that we would have to face this.",34
69,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,"Order! Could I interrupt the Leader of the Opposition. Just so that we can get this on the rails, he needs to move the censure motion.  That this House censures the Treasurer for his Orders failure to apologise for his false and unsubsfantiated allegations concerning the processes leading to the formulation of the Coalition's Economic Action Pian. The remarks I just commenced in regard to Or- that motion, notice of which I gave this morning, are absolutely relevant to the charge notice the Treasurer has made that the Opposition changed its policy to suit financially the Federal President of the Liberal· Party. I am tracing its history; I will abbreviate it. Prior to May of last year our policy was simply to abolish Labor's capital gains tax. On 10 May 1988, the shadow Cabinet· met in Coolangatta and received a submission from me in which, among other things, I recommended that in addition to undertaking to abolish Labor's capital gains tax, we introduce what we termed a speculative gains tax. On that day the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and I said in a joint statement that we would do this. In regard to the timing, which is the measure the Treasurer refers to as having been rejigged at the request of the Federal President while we were determining our recent policy stance, that joint statement said: These provisions will apply to assets acquired after 19 September 1985 and disposed of after the date of election of the Liberal and National Government. That nails that for a lie-May 1988. We did not leave it there because on page 36 of Future Directions, which was issued in December 1988, we again said: These provisions will apply to assets acquired after 19 September 1985 and disposed of after the date of election of the Liberal and National Government. This is the same statement outlined on page 33 of the Economic Action Plan of 12 October, which states: These provisions will apply to assets acquired after 19 Sept-mber 1985 and disposed of after the date of the election of the Liberal and National Government. This, as the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), said yesterday, clearly disproves the outrageous claim by the Treasurer suggesting any link between either him or the Opposition in our decision as to the effective date of the changes to. the capital gains tax and any recently announced so-called Harlin bid in 1989. I have never-I underline never-discussed Harlin with Mr Elliott. I do not know anything about it other than the passing references in newspapers that I have read. He has never raised it with me, nor would he. In fact, by the change? if one is examining",34
70,Unknown,TREASURER,"Government members interjecting to ridicule all they like but they know that this man does not come to this despatch box with clean hands in this sort of arena, for reasons that I will elaborate on. He has come in and pursued the big lie, as he so often does. But this time he has simply been asked to produce the evidence, and he cannot. So gutless is the Treasurer that, when asked this morning on Melbourne radio-not here; we were not able to hear him on this-at the instigation of a little chat that Michelle Grattan had with John Jost, the host of the program, when she tickled him up, verbally that is, and suggested to him that he might put a question to the Treasurer about his saying publicly what he said in the Parliament, he said no. In the transcript Jost refers to John Elliott, policy, Harlin and asks: . . . would you feel confident about doing that I'm talking about in public out of the Parliament? The transcript continues: Keating: Well these issues-well that's why the Parliament exists to discuss public issues and that the right place to discuss them. Mr Jost: So, you don't think we should talk about it now? Keating: No. The Treasurer creeps into this place with his base notion of besmirching the reputation and the character of a person and, as written in a newspaper, he has offered not one skerrick of evidence. If he thinks that the days when he can bluff and bluster people outside this Parliament are still running and that he can have an effect on them simply because they support, as is their democratic right, our side of politics, he is wrong. He should not say that he can produce the evidence today. He suggested that Mr Elliott brought pressure on the Opposition to backdate the effect of our speculative gains tax to September 1985 to eliminate tax liabilities on shares held by Mr Elliott and his company, Harlin Holdings Pty Ltd. Mr Lavarch interjecting",35
71,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,"Order! The honourable member for Fisher!  reality that he has never discussed it ever, the facts are as I have put them out: the decisions were taken in May 1988 and reiterated in December 1988; all the Harlin stuff of 1989 came later. He cannot produce the evidence. This man has stood up under the privilege of this Parliament besmirching the reputation of a person outside in a desperate and dishonest attack-indeed, nothing but a smear. Let us face it, this is the real Paul Keating, is it not? If the Treasurer were in a court of law and he started to attack the character of someone, he could justifiably have his character examined-Paul Keating, tax evader, fiddler of travelling allowances and traveller on shonky documents. I know all about taped telephone conversations; I have read all about them. When this fellow engaged in one attacking the Prime Minister, who is at the table, what did the Government do? Immediately that night it proclaimed the legislation to prevent its publication-another fiddle. What else do we see about the Treasurer's background? I will leave aside allegations that were made in the Eye because we know that he does not like them. It does say things is such as, 'poorly read, intolerant,. ludicrously over-confident, susceptible to cranks', et cetera. But I will go through some of the other examples: 'Keating in vote row' was the headline in the Brisbane Daily Sun of 7 July 1986. The article states: Federal Treasurer Mr Keating won his seat in Parliament after pre-selection vote-rigging 18 years ago, according to an ALP report. Other headlines are, 'Sack party chiefs. .', 'A link between ALP branches and drugs?'. This all goes back to the days of the presidency. I will leave aside the Treasurer's own association with the so called wealthy of this community. The headlines continue: 'The multi-level world of Warren P. Anderson', 'the Keating-Anderson connection'. We will not bother to go into all the helicopter trips, all the sales of clocks at rather high prices to avoid whatever. In an article headed 'Keating faces bill of $10,500', it is stated: The Tax Commissioner has been asked to rule on whether Federal Treasurer Paul Keating should be taxed on his controversial $17,000 travel allowance. The headlines continue: 'Travel expensesfiddle or not?'. 'Higher priorities than tax returns: Keating'. I will leave it there. No wonder the Prime Minister was moved to say, 'Keating not well regarded-PM'. I have just given the Treasurer a cursory examination of the background from vote rigging through to every shonky deal that can be done. For example, if we talk about rules and regulations that are changed, this is the fellow who cannot make up his mind whether he lives in Sydney or Canberra, but to suit his own purposes he knows what to put into get the money for the travelling allowance. Because the cover was blown and it was discovered, what did the Government do? It changed the rules to suit the Treasurer's pecuniary demands. If the Treasurer wants to come into this chamber and besmirch the reputation of people without a skerrick of evidence, he can try to do it, but he has been seen through. In the Australian Financial Review this morning there is an article written by Steve Burrell. It states: But his dramatic counterattack on the Opposition tax policy and the integrity of key Liberals may backfire after he failed last night to substantiate allegations in the face of strong Opposition denials. There is an article in the Australian headed, 'Libs deny Elliott link in tax policy' written by Paul Austin and Glenn Milne. The first paragraph of that article states: The Treasurer, Mr Keating, failed to provide evidence last night for his parliamentary allegation that the multi-million-dollar Harlin deal of Liberal Party president Mr John Elliott was connected to Coalition plans to abolish the capital gains tax. Among other things there is an article in the Sydney Morning Herald by Tom Burton, which states: But no government minister has yet put forward one skerrick of evidence for the claim that the startup date was influenced by Mr Elliott. Not one skerrick. He goes on to say: And despite the decision to introduce a speculative gains tax, which would mean that Elliott would have to pay more tax than he would have if the Opposition had stuck to its pre-May, 1988, position when it was committed to abolishing the capital gains tax. The article concludes: But they do not mean he should be the target of totally unsubstantiated claims of political corruption. Again, I could go on. That is just a sampling. As I indicated, the Treasurer comes into this chamber with the old Labor Government state of mind. He cannot attack our policies; he has tried and he has failed. He is attacking the man instead. The polls have indicated that he cannot. He made a dramatic gesture at the press conference and referred to an $800m hole. Does the Treasurer remember that? I hardly do. We have not heard it referred to again because it would not stand up. It would (not stand up because all the assumptions were wrong. The only assumption we get right in this country is if we assume the Treasurer is wrong, we will be right. The Treasurer is wrong on this occasion, but wrong in the basest manner because he has come in here and deliberately nailed the character of a citizen outside this Parliament with no right to answer. I have heard his worm-like statements when he is attacked. He is the biggest coward in this place. He comes into this chamber and shovels it out every time and the moment it hits him fair between the eyes no-one squeals louder. It is probably because the Treasurer suffers from some form of psychological transferhis ence; I do not know what it is. Just because he fiddles the system does not mean· that other people do. Just because he convinces the Government to change the rules for his pecuniary benefit does not mean that other people do. Unless the Treasurer can produce evidence and come in here and delineate all that he has alleged to substantiate his remarks, he has to apologise. He really has to apologise. No-one in this country will put up with it. The Treasurer can shake his hand. Being attacked by him, as I said yesterday, is like being thrashed with a wet kleenex. The Treasurer can do all he likes, but the fact is that he cannot produce the argument. If he cannot, he owes that citizen an apology. The facts are that the total capital gains tax and speculative gains tax policy were put down and released last year. As I understand it, Harlin did not emerge until early this year. The fact is that, if we had simply abolished the capital gains tax and not introduced a speculative gains tax, I assume that Mr Elliott would be in an even better financial position. But the facts or the laws simply do not bother this man-the Treasurer of the moment-who, as I say, has reverted to type. He is a falsifier of votes to get himself into this place, a persuader of others to change regulations to increase his own pecuniary gain. That might be the practice that he thinks is accepted by the Australian community, but it is not accepted either by this side of the House or by the overwhelming majority who will be judging him. I do not rake over the sorts of matters that I just touched on today, but, by God, anyone is entitled to do it once the Treasurer comes forward and does the sort of thing he has been doing. He well knows that I could have gone into the matter in far greater detail. The fact is in the old court of equity one could only plead equity if one came to the court with clean hands. The last person in this place who comes with clean hands on an issue of character judgment is the current Treasurer. We expect him now to stand up, produce the evidence and, if he does not, to give an apology because to date there is not a scintilla of evidence-to use that well known phrase of 23 years ago in this placeto produce his argument. He has sought to attack someone simply because he is a supporter of my Party. If the Treasurer cannot back it up, he stands adjudged. He will be judged, as we have judged him, by the Australian people in the poorest possible light.",35

80,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), yesterday made very carefully constructed responses to the Government's amendment and my statement in the House yesterday regarding Mr Elliott and his relationship to the development of the Liberal Party's tax policy. In the first instance, the Leader of the Opposition took a personal explanation to point out that the Opposition's tax policy as previously issued had already included backdating, to 19 September 1985, windfall capital gains to the richest people in Australian society. He made the same point today. Similarly, the greatest part of the shadow Treasurer's statement last night was devoted to making that point. Since it appears that this is, in fact, the main argument of both the Leader of the O-position, which he has repeated today, and the shadow Treasurer, I will deal with it first. Anybody familiar with the Opposiparticular, tion's tax policy has been aware that, since its statement of 10 May 1988, the Opposiwas tion's so-called speCUlative gains tax, it would apply to assets acquired after 19 Sepsenior tember 1985 and disposed of after the of election of a Liberal and National governTreasurer ment. That is not and never has been the point at issue here. I repeat: that is not never has been the point at issue here. point at issue is that, by virtue of this retroas spective application, a substantial windfall capital gain will be awarded to the richest people in Australian society and, in particution lar, the President of the Liberal John Elliott. I invite honourable members to go back and look at the Opposition's statement of 10 May 1988 and the Opposition's Future Diyesterday, rections document. In both these policy statements, significant Opposition commitof ments were made which subsequently have been dispensed with. In particular, the Opdescribes position has dumped its long standing commitment to abolish the fringe benefits tax. also dumped its commitment to repeal the tax arrangements on profits earned from gold mining. It dumped those commitments, but retained the more extraordinary, least defenTreasurer sible and costly commitment to backdate its abolition of the existing capital gains tax September 1985. The issue is: Why was this least defensible policy retained? It is retention which is issue, not its establishment. Why, of all the specific Opposition tax commitments, did this one survive, especially when the fiscal pact of it continues to grow exponentially the longer the period the backdating applies? So the initial argument of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer is meaningless. Any journalist familiar with Opposition tax policy was well aware that this provision had been backdated The question to be answered is: To what extent was the Opposition aware that its Federal President, Mr Elliott, would benefit substantially from this provision and extent was Mr Elliott involved in the process which led to this policy being reaffirmedto not established, but reaffirmed? We already know that many other tax options were discussed by the Opposition the run-up to the 13 October release. In the proposal by the shadow Treasurer to implement a consumption tax rejected by a combination of the Deputy said, Liberal Party Leader, Senator Chaney, and National Party shadow Ministers. That date was one solemn promise that the shadow is more than happy to break. The point is that the whole policy was up for and grabs. It was not a matter of reaffirming The policy. The whole policy was under review a new policy. The real issue is: what was Mr Elliott's involvement in the process which led both to the decision to retain the aboliof the capital gains tax and the decision Party, Mr to backdate its abolition? So, apart from the Leader of the Opposition's inconsequential statement in the House the shadow Treasurer has issued a very narrow and equivocally worded denial my statement in the House. In particular, he says that he has never discussed what he as 'the Harlin bid' with Mr Elliott. .Hut he is much more coy about whether he It or his staff discussed taxation policy with Mr Elliott or his staff without any need to refer to Harlin. It is significant that neither the Leader of the Opposition nor the shadow has answered a single one of the 11 questions carried in the House in yesterto day's motion. Not one question of the 11 has been answered. In particular, the Leader of the Opposition has not disclosed whether or the not his discussion with Mr Elliott prior to his ascension to the leadership included any reference to the Opposition's capital gains imtax. Nor has the shadow Treasurer denied contact between his office and that of Mr Elliott. He has not denied contact between his office and that of Mr Elliott. I have it from what I regard as a completely trusthe tworthy source that there was contact between the shadow Treasurer's office and Mr earlier. Elliott's office-Mr Beale-You are making this up now.",37

85,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"I might point out in passing that this member is a different Liberal member from the one who told the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, in late July that there should be an inquiry into the practice of Elders IXL Ltd of issuing lc paid shares to its directors and specifically Mr Elliott. Furthermore, I note with interest the conflicting statements reported this morning in different publications. The Australian Frnancial Review reports that the shadow Treasurer, Mr Elliott and the Leader of the Opposition had all said that 'neither they nor their staff had ever discussed the change to the capital gains tax, other aspects of the tax policy or the Harlin bid', whereas Michelle Grattan of the Age reports that Mr Elliott himself had revealed that he had attended one of the Opposition meetings drafting the economic !policy. Speaking of Mr Elliott, she reportl). As president, he was entitled to see the draft tax: policy and did so. She goes on: Liberal Party sources said that the meeting the policy development group, attended in Melbourne  dinner with some of the group later. So apparently, by the Liberal Party's own admissions, Mr Elliott was involved in a discussion of the Opposition's tax policy which included both a meeting of some unspecified duration and a dinner and during this period, according to· a version in the Australian Financial Review, there was no mention whatsoever of the Opposition's capital gains tax. Apparently, they just whited it out of the policy while Mr Elliott was about. Or did Mr Elliott just give a nod. of the head? It is obvious to any observer that there is a·very fine splitting of hairs going on. Mr Elliott boasts of his involvement in developing the Opposition's tax policy. It is instructive to consider a transcript of Mr Elliott's interview on the Face to Face program on 14 May this year following the honourable member for Kooyong's leadership coup. Mr Elliott boasted that he had 'spent some time with him'-that is, the honourable member for Kooyong-'as shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on economic policy'. He went on to say: I hope that I can be as helpful as possible, help frame the economic policies for the party and provide the resources. We had a few discussions on telephones about the economic situation and what Andrew was going to stand for and I've .spent a lot of time with him-well not a lot of time, but I'd met on a number of occasions trying to influence the policy, anyway, when he was the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader. Later in the same interview Mr Elliott said: I have a fair idea about what the tax: policy and economic policy is. Of course, a 'fair idea' was not enough for Mr Elliott. On 9 August, in an interview with Jana Wendt on A Current Affair, he was asked, '. . because your idea does not seem to do much for business borrowers, does it?'. Mr Elliott responded: Well, again, a lot of things are being floated at the moment and all I can say to you is that we will have a tax: policy that will be very favourable to savings and investment. We are already going to eliminate capital gains tax: which will be a major boost to individuals, small businessmen as well as big business around Australia. Everybody. Miss Wendt then asked: was of Were you consulted on that particular idea? Mr Elliott answered: I've been overseas actually for the last 10 days working on Elders' matters, but what I will do is see the draft policy. That's part of the program now. The organisation of the party is able to review draft policies when they are ready for presentation and that is when we'll make our input. The Leader of the Opposition told us that Mr Elliott never spoke to him, that he had no contact with the Leader of the Opposition or with the honourable member for Wentworth. Mr Elliott told both honourable members that he was going to have some input. There are two points to be made here. The Federal President of the Labor Party, Premier Bannon, is not privy to Federal Government tax policy formulation or to tax policy decisions. Mr Nehl-You don't have a policy.",39
86,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The honourable member for Cowper!,40
87,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"He is not privy to them. The significant point is that it was during the very period that I just referred to that Mr Elliott was first formulating and undertaking the bid by Harlin Holdings Pty Ltd, the company in which he is reported to have a personal shareholding of 18 or 19 per cent for Elders-IXL. I will now clarify one point for those listening. This is a separate issue the personal non-taxable capital gain of around $17m that I referred tO'in Question Time last week. That capital gain refers to Mr Elliott's own personal holding of shares in Elders IXL. Those are one cent paid shares for which he paid $155,000 and for which, as I said last week, he now stands to have a capital gain of $35m, of which he would pay $17m in capital gains tax. I repeat: that is a different issue from Harlin-totally different. The potential gains to Mr Elliott and his coshareholders from the Harlin bid in that company dwarf the personal gain that Mr Elliott can expect to make from his direct shareholding-",40

94,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"Harlin now holds 1,206 million Elders IXL shares, for which it has out laid $2.875 billion. At last trade yesterday the Elders share price was $2.47. This follows the bonus share issue and payment of dividend last week. Today, Harlin stands on a real capital gain of about $30ql. Of course, the Elders share price is expected to increase, and then the money really starts to roll in for Mr Elliott and his colleagues. If the Elders share price goes up to the bottom range calculated by First Boston Australia Ltd, Harlin's real capital gain is $1,100m. If the price goes to the top of the First Boston range, the real capital gain is $1,600m. At $4, the real capital gain is $1,760m. Under Liberal Party policy, Mr Elliott and his colleagues in Harlin would have this money tax free. It could be evell better than that for to Mr Elliott because under Liberal policy any bonus issues received by Harlin at any time in the future-",40
95,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,"Order! The Treasurer's time has expired. Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That the Treasurer be granted an extension of time. Mr Fife- Mr Speaker, the Opposition has not opposed the motion; we would lik- the Treasurer to keep reading.",40
96,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The honourable member for Hume will resume his seat.,40
97,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"A slow moving character like the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) can follow my lips as well. I repeat the point that I was making. It could be even better than that for Mr Elliott because he gets the bonus shares tax free. The significance of this has not gone unnoticed by commentators. One writing in the Sydney Morning Herald on 15 July said: Mr Elliott knows of the coalition's commitment to abolish the capital tax gains tax on assets held for longer than five years. A change of government will certainly help increase the after-tax profits of the bid. Other commentators have noted that Harlin has ended up with an interest bill which far exceeds any dividends it is likely to receive on the Elders shares, concluding that Harlin must make some sales at some point. The absence of a capital gains tax obviously diminishes the risk in the Harlin bid. Elders can sell assets freed from capital gains tax and push those untaxed gains up to Harlin. It would all keep Humpty Dumpty glued together much better. And it was while Mr Elliott, on his own admission, was involved in the takeover of Elders IXL that he was also involved in the formulation of the Opposition's tax policy. Harlin's offer was announced on 5 July 1989. The part C bid commenced on 28 August 1989 and concluded on 25 September 1989. It is also instructive to know that the action of the Elders directors to bring down an early profit report on 21 September 1989, indicating a 5 per cent fall in the profits of Elders, had by common consent of financial market commentators contributed to the unexpectedly high take-up of the Elders offer. Many market commentators believe the bad profit report was brought on early to help the take-up of the $3 offer, which of course it did. The bottom line in Mr Elliott's involvement is this: It is he who has chosen to join the political debate; it is he who is the Federal President of the Liberal Party. He is not simply a manager and entrepreneur making the system work for him; he has decided to participate in the fortunes of a major political party, with all that that implies for policy, while he is juggling a massive corporate play in which he is personally involved. It is he who has described the Opposition's so called Economic Action Plan as taking from the bludgers and giving to the workers. It is he who is on the public record admitting that he was consulted in the formulation of the Opposition's tax policy and had a role in determining what went into the policy and what went out of the policy. We are saying that it suited Mr Elliott for the policy not to change-not for it to be backdated but for the policy not to change. The attitude of Opposition members is that this is all coincidence. It is coincidence that the President of their political party stands to gain quite literally hundreds of millions of dollars from the implementation of their\ policy. It is coincidence that this same man publicly boasts of his financial support of the Liberal Party and his involvement in formulating and reaffirming the Liberal Party's tax policy. It is significant that all we have received, in response to my remarks yesterday, is a very narrowly defined denial by the shadow Treasurer in his press statement about discussions of the Harlin bid and no denial at all about capital gains taxation generally, nor any denial from the Leader of the Opposition.",40
98,Mr NA BROWN,TREASURER,This is no argument.,41
99,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! I warn the honourable member for Menzies.,41
100,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"As I said earlier, Mr Speaker, I· have it from what I regard as a completely trustworthy authority that there was a communication between the office of the shadow Treasurer and the office of Mr Elliott prior to the release of the Opposition's tax policy regarding taxation issues with a relationship to Mr Elliott and his companies. At least one member of the Liberal Party is prepared to tell Government members that Mr Elliott had an undue influence on the formulation of the policy. Once again, Mr Speaker, I invite the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer to answer properly the 11 questions I put yesterday. It is they who should put up or shut up. The Government, and I in particular, resiles from nothing that I or the Government have said.",41
101,Mr BLUNT,TREASURER, Mr Speaker,41
102,Unknown,TREASURER,Government members interjecting,41
103,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! Members on both sides will cease interjecting.,41
104,Mr BLUNT,TREASURER,The mighty cobra has spoken. The mighty cobra comes in here and reads a prepared text.,41
105,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The Leader of the National Party will refer to members by their title.,41
106,Mr BLUNT,TREASURER,"Of course, Mr Speaker. The world's greatest Treasurer has read a pathetic answer which confirms his own guilt. Let me tell you, Mr Speaker: he is dead meat. He is swinging in the breeze and the whole Government is swinging with him. Government members are gone; they are finished, and they have got no future. He was the linchpin, the guy who was going to get the Government re-elected, the man whose economic strategy was going to achieve the re-election of the Hawke Government. We have seen the economic strategy. We have seen him come in here and cringe and cower, and read word after word. It was a pathetic response because he has nothing to substantiate the slander that he came out with yesterday. He was totally cowardly in his performance here today. Mr Speaker, I am absolutely ecstatic to have the chance to speak on this motion. We, came in here this morning and we were prepared to speak on this motion at 10 o'clock. The buffoons who were running the place then wasted one hour of this Parliament's time, pushing this debate off. We thought it was jUllt incompetence or bad tactics, but now w- know the real reason: it took them all thai time to work out something for the Treasurer to say. It is pathetic. Where is the evidence? This is the man who was huffing and puffing yesterday, slandering people from behind the protection of this chamber, accusing them of all sorts of improper behaviour. Where is the evidence? He made one reference to an anonymous member of the Liberal Party of Australia. It is about time the Treasurer put up or shut up. What we have seen exposed here today is not the Treasurer's talent or economic strategy, but the Government's strategy to try to get re-elected. It is the strategy of the big lie. Government members are prepared to say anything, do anything, abuse anybody and use anybody to try to save their political necks. That is exactly what the Treasurer has done. He is prepared to say anything and abuse anybody to try to cling on to power. We are used to this man in this place. We come in here and ask the Treasurer a question, and the response is predictable. The first thing we get is 10 minutes of personal abuse. If the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) the shadow Treasurer, asks a question, we can count on 10 minutes of personal abuse. We all know the Treasurer's vocabulary; it is getting a bit tired after seven years. After the personal abuse comes 10 minutes on economic history-all about 1983. That does not wash any more at all. After we have had the personal abuse and the economic history, we get five minutes of irrelevant economic jargon and statistics that he does not even understand. The Treasurer, recognising that that is cutting no ice these days and recognising that that is being written up in the press gallery, cranks up the rhetoric. He takes advice from his advisers, and he was sold a pup because he cannot substantiate the claim. So he rushed off and accused Mr Elliott, who cannot defend himself-a soft target-of exerting undue influence. He cannot defend himself, and the Treasu-er comes in here, and gets an extension of time to make a prepared speech that has nothing in it. The reality is that there is nothing to this Government and there is nothing to the Treasurer. He is panic stricken and desperate. He does not have any proof of his assertions, because his advisers were not even smart enough to tell him the timetable of the policy. It goes back to 1987. Our commitment to abolish the capital gains tax goeS back to 1987. After the 1987 election we added to it a commitment to introduce a speculative gains tax. The honourable member for Wentworth was on the back bench after the 1987 election, and prior to that election he was not even in the Parliament. How much influence could Mr Elliott have over someone who is not in the Parliament? That is how absolutely stupid the claim was. The Treasurer spends a lot of time sending people running around to our offices getting copies of statements, but if he had followed through the chronology, he would have realise9 how stupid the claim was. The policy has been on the record since 1987; it was reaffirmed after the 1987 election; recommitted in May 1988; included in Future Directions in December last year; and included in the Economic Action Plan. It is there in black and white. The words have not changed, the commitment has not faltered and we have not deviated one bit. That is exactly where we stand. The Treasurer goes around claiming that people seek to benefit from Government decisions. We have a file on how some Government members have benefited from Government decisions. How many Government members are worried about some of their property purchases with a little bit of insider trading or a little bit of dabbling in foreign exchange speculation? Are there any guilty consciences over that? Mr West-Not me.",41
107,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order!,42
108,Mr BLUNT,TREASURER,"The Minister would not understand what foreign exchange was, that is his problem. When it comes to peddling inftuence-Mr Tim Fischer-Kodak, Ansett, Australian, the private banks.",43
109,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The honourable member for Farrer will cease interjecting as well.,43
110,Mr BLUNT,TREASURER,"He makes a good point though, Mr Speaker. What about Ansett, Australian Airlines, the Kodak deal, and the sleazy little deal with the banks? It is discrimination of the first order. What about lOOking after people with the smaller banks and the building societies? The Government has the morals of an alley cat when it comes to those sorts of decisions. It looks after mates, associates with anybody, and comes back in here and tells the big lie. The Leader  references to the Treasurer, and it began when he set out to get in here. We have an Australian Labor Party report that sets out how he fiddled the pre-selection procedures, and he has been doing it ever since he arrived. He considers himself above the laws of the land.",43
111,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,I am above you.,43
112,Mr BLUNT,TREASURER,He does not lodge tax returns. Has he got his tax return in this year?,43
113,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,Have you?,43
114,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The Treasurer will cease interjecting.,43
115,Mr BLUNT,TREASURER,"Is it not coincidental that his antique clocks are exempt from the cal?ital gains tax? He should tell us about hiS travel allowa-ce. Talk about benefiting from Government decisions! He is rorting the system. What does the Government do? The Government changes the procedure. If anybody benefits from Government decisions around here, it is the Treasurer. The other day he really stuck his foot in it. He made a glib comment about the pilots dispute and hotel occupancy, and he said, 'I was stayin.g in a hotel in Sydney'. I thought that was hiS home base. Did he claim travel allowance for that night? He should tell us. What is the answer to that?",43
116,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,It is.,43
117,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The Treasurer will cease interjecting.,43

120,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order!,43
121,Mr BLUNT,TREASURER,What about naming him?,43
122,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,The Leader of the National Party will not cast aspersions on the Chair.,43
123,Mr BLUNT,TREASURER,"I apologise. Mr Speaker, what the Parliament really needs is not a debate about this. All of last week we invited the Government to explain its economic policy, and every day it ran for cover. Not one its day did it take the motion, not one day was anybody on the front bench prepared to stand up and try to explain the Government's economic policy. Do we know why? It has not got one; it is not prepared to debate the. matter. This country is in crisis, and all we get from the Treasurer is insults and vitriol, slander and abuse. Where is the policy? What is Paul going to do? The Treasurer has lost his grip, and he knows it. He does not know where to turn, he does not have a policy alternative. He is gritting his teeth, hanging on with white knuckles and hoping that it all works out. That is his strategy, and there is no alternative. He is on borrowed time, because even his precious Australian Financial Review is writing nasty things about him these days. He has the nerve to come in here and criticise our policy. Has he read the Australian Financial Review today? It was absent from his speech. There were all sorts of things in the speech but there was no reference to what the Australian Financial Review says today. It states: The shocking distortions in the Australian economy caused by the present capital gains tax regime are brought home by the contrast between the conti!lued strength of housing approvals and motor regI-tra­ tions, and the parlous state of the small busmess sector. Yesterday's statistics showed that housing was up 5.5 per cent in September and new car sales were up 10.2 per cent. These items are the main things that do not attract capital gains tax and have been booming since the capital gains tax was introduced. What no-one wants to do anymore is go into businessthis is what this Treasurer's policies have done; no-one wants to go into business in this country because the Treasurer's policies are anti-businessunless all possible spending on housing is exhausted. The Treasurer knows all about housing. That is his preoccupation in Sydney. The article continues: . . . the decision - y Andrew Peacock and John Hewson to return us to the old ways of taxing capital gains-taxing only speculative gains-is to be welcomed. Why did the Treasurer not quote that today? He is fond of quoting the Australian that, Financial Review when it suits him. It did not suit him today at all. The reality is that his policies have absolutely no credibility the community. The jig is up. He cannot this place. bluff and bluster any more. He is going to have to put something on the table. He has nothing at all to put on the table. He was wrong in his assertion; he was wrong to it. The whole thing has blown up in his face. He was not able to provide any evidence. Where is the evidence? Has he tabled the speech? There are no names, no evidence and no proof, just slander. We are used this man's abuse in this place, but let me in conclusion that he has proved today, totion tally and absolutely, that there is only one sleazebag in this place. It is on the other side of the House and it is wearing an Italian suit.",43
124,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"The only unsubstantiated slander that has been slung around this chamber over the last hour has been slung by the Opposition on the Treasurer (Mr Keating). The man who got up and started the attack, the Leader of the Opposition· Peacock), who, as revealed today in the letin, wished to play Laval to Joh Bjelkemass Petersen's Hitler during the last performance of the last election and encouraged Joh Bjelke-Petersen's destabilisation of John Howard, has the hide to walk out of here pretending in this place he is an honourable man, He has run off to hide from the rest this debate. It is the same man who clothes himself with unction when he stands in this place and says that he never makes unsubare stantiated claims. We on this side of the House recognise and remember the persistent 'little crook' claims of the Leader of the Opposition. Did he appear on the front steps of Parliament to repeat them? No, he did not appear on the front steps of Parliament to repeat those claims. He made them in here. He would defend himself and his ability to make those statements in here because he believes, as we all believe, that in this place members of parliament are and ought to be clothed with privilege. This is exactly the sort of place in greatly which we make accusations and statements with regard to policy and the development of policy that we would not normally make in public. If this was not the forum to do why does parliamentary privilege exist? If honourable members do not like parliamentary privilege, then I suggest that they in do not attempt to get themselves elected to The Leader of the Opposition, who has run from this place, has used parliamentary use privilege on numerous occasions. The fact that he could not substantiate those claims is simply another example of the sort of subterfuge and chicanery that he was prepared to work on his own previous Leader, to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr say Howard), during the run-up to the last eleccampaign when he saw the possibility of himself emerging as a Deputy Prime Minister to a Prime Minister Joh Bjelke-Petersen. This man who wants honour to prevail in this place was prepared to be Deputy Leader of the Government to Joh Bjelke-Petersen. That is the practice that he wishes to introduce into this place. Is it any wonder, when we see this whole mass of coincidences-of statements made by John Elliott as to the degree of his influence over Liberal policy (Mr and the nature of the policy as developedBulthat we are prepared to believe that that of coincidence is not coincidence? One of the important things to remember about the Liberal Party policy that has just been released is that we on this side of the House have never said that the Liberal Party's position on capital gains tax is a recent of invention. What we have said is that when it introduced an economic policy document into this place and said, 'Behold, all things new', this was still in it. That economic policy document-I challenge the Opposition to deny it-jettisoned all other policy that was not officially approved. Our Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support. (Mr Robert Brown) the other day in this place detailed the series of promises that the position had put on land transport for some considerable period and pointed out that that policy document jettisoned them. We would not come into this place again and say that those promises were included in that econeither nomic policy document, because they were not. That economic policy document, as denied everyone in the gallery knows and as everyof one in this Parliament knows, was a political circuit-breaker for the Opposition to enable it to get off the agenda everything that it not want that it had previously committed itself to, either vaguely, informally or latively, and to put on the agenda wished to debate and nothing else. The Opposition has had much floating. has not only had the issue of all the tax policy changes that this Government has troduced. It has also had floating in its consumption taxation issues. It has also had floating through its ranks the suggestion by the Leader of the Opposition of a differcarefully ent taxation regime on interest rates. It all that floating through its ranks and wanted to rip all of that out and come in here with the statement, 'Behold, everything here is new. That is all that you see of us'. Thus spake Zarathustra: 'All that you see here is ours and nothing else'. When we see what is now ours and nothment. ing else, what do we see? We do not any longer see the removal of tax on gold as Liberal Party promise. In May 1988 and in Future Directions at the end of 1988 we certainly saw reference to the abolition gold tax. The Opposition had been running round Kalgoorlie saying it was going to do that for ages. That was initially a position adopted. When we look at those taxation policies we also see a changed regime with regard to fringe benefits tax. That is all there in the Party policy documents. But is it in the document just released? No, it is not the document just released. What is still the document just released is the proposal on speculative gains that massively benefits the President of the Liberal Party. Whatever may be the way in which the Opposition decides narrowly to focus the debate in this place, it cannot be narrowly focused. This is a political forum, not a court of law. This is a place where we establish most likely connections, not a place where Opwe prove somebody's guilt or innocence. That is for a totally different forum than we have here. Let us go through the carefully crafted remarks. No matter what may be the obfuscation from the Opposition in this place, of the Opposition members who spoke in this debate and slandered the Treasurer that they had ever discussed the issue the taxation regime with the President of the Liberal Party, Mr Elliott. Not once in that 25 minutes of slander did we hear the did Leader of the Opposition <;>r the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt) specusay that they had never discussed capital all that it gains tax with Mr Elliott. We all know about politics in this place. It We all know about the document that appears five or six hours later. A long docuinment and a carefully crafted document ought ranks always to be an interesting document for journalists. We have all been involved in the made game. We know what goes on with long, crafted documents. We now come had to the document the shadow Treasurer, the it honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), put out last night: 'I have never discussed the Harlin bid with John Elliott'. Has he ever discussed the question of capital gains or taxation regime generally with John Elliott? No, that is not here in this docuThat is not in this document, based on four hours consideration by the Opposia tion's shadow Treasurer as to what he might put out for the media for its handling. That is not in that document, though that was the of accusation made yesterday-that he had discussed his capital gains tax regime with Elliott. Of course, they cannot deny it because it one of the interesting things about the President of the Liberal Party is that he is not loath to yak publicly. That will be a very interesting feature of politics in this country in future. Despite the best efforts of the new in shadow Minister for industry and commerce, in Mr Elliott will keep on yapping and he will reveal exactly what he is doing. We on this side of the chamber are trying to establish that Opposition members have discussed a capital gains tax policy which nobody can deny will massively benefit their President. We are talking not about the odd travel allowance but about $17m and potentially out to a new taxation regime on $1 billion plus. That is what we are talking about. We are not talking about travelling allowance arrangements in this Parliament; we are talking about a tax benefit· of $17m and a beneficial regime on a further $1 billion. That is what we are talking about in this place. We are not talking about something paltry. No wonder Opposition members want to reduce it to 'the paltry' because this type of policy is what precludes a government from being able to implement necessary social reforms or taxation reforms that benefit the bulk of the community. What we have as evidence that Mr Elliott has influenced the coalition 'scapital gains tax policy is not one sleight of hand and not one carefully crafted press release specifically to· evade that issue; we do not have that. We have endless yabbering on the public record by the said Mr Elliott. As Michelle Grattan reports today, he attends the 500 Club. As President he is entitled to see draft tax policy and did so. Did he? Did Mr Elliott see draft tax policy? That is what it says here. In his 3D-minute plethora of accusation in this place, not once did the Leader of the Opposition deny that. Did Mr Elliott, the potential beneficiary, personally to the tune of $17m and potent,ially benefiting to the tune of upward of $1 billion worth of assets when they are traded, see the tax policy that he is entitled to? Mr Elliott continued: I hope that I can be as helpful as possible; help frame the economic policy for the Party and the resources. God! We do not get that sort of blatancy in politics often. We all know that, in the political history of the country, there are odd, occasional, shameful episodes of the exchange of resources for policy but we rarely get the perpetrators actually going onto the public record and admitting it. He said: I hope that I can be as helpful as possible; help frame the economic policy for the Party and provide the resources after I have framed the policy. God Almighty! Well, whoopee! He went on: We had a few discussions on telephones about the economic situation and what Andrew Peacock was going to stand for. All of us in this place know one thing about Andrew Peacock and that is that he is an economic manque. I can see how those discussions were taking place: 'Well, Andrew, you have got this taxation policy. Let us have a bit of a think about a consumption tax. You know, that is a very good, sensible thing. Maybe you can't do it un.til your second term in office, but you are going to need a consumption tax, Andrew, be it in your second term of office or your first term of office, because I have a nice little proposal here all set, boxed and ready to run to make a massive haemorrhage on the revenue. That is what I have got here in place. It is a very nice little proposal, all set, boxed and ready to run to make a massive haemorrhage on the revenue. So I am having my little telephone chat with you, Andrew, to make absolutely certain that we have all the right tax trade-oft's to produce that'. According to the report, he said: I have spent a lot of time with him. Well, not a lot of timeand no-one could blame himbut I have met on a number of occasions trying to influence policy anyway when he was the shadow Treasurer and deputy leader. What were the dates? What were those dates again?-when he was shadow Treasurer and deputy leader. That would not have been back in 1988, would it, when he was trying to influence policy, when he was shadow Treasurer? Might that have coincided with those 1988 dates that the Opposition has been-God alone knows for what reasonin this place so prepared to tout about as provide fundamental to its defence? Here we have Elliott saying: 'I am trying to influence policy. I had an opportunity to talk about that with the shadow Treasurer and deputy leader when he was shadow Treasurer and deputy leader at the time'. What sort of evidence of influence does one introduce in this place? As I said before, we are not here as a court of law; we are here as a parliamentary forum discussing matters of sound public policy. We have, on anybody's notion, one of the most crapulous pieces of public policy yet produced with a most doubtful, a most appalling, benefit to be extended to some one per cent of the taxpaying public so that the other 99 per cent, most of whom are pay as you earn taxpayers, are obliged to pick up the shortfall; a taxation benefit which will mean $17m to this man and $1 billion worth of potential opportunity over in Harlin Enterprises. Opposition members are a bunch of disgraces on this issue. They come in here with unbelievably dirty hands and they will not be permitted their obfuscation by slandering the Treasurer and not sticking to the issues. They have had enough of this, so I move: That the question be now put. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. Leo MCLeay) Ayes Noes Majority NA Baldwin, P. J. Jones, Barry Beazley, K. C. Kealing, P.

Is it not a fact that last week the Caucus health subcommittee was presented with a document entitled The Future of Small Community Pharmacies in Australia and briefed by the author? Is it not a fact that the author is a qualified statistician, respected public consultant, long standing senior member of the Australian Labor Party, and an adviser to the Government? I ask the Minister whether he can confirm that, in the face of the cuts to pharmacy remuneration that come into effect today, conclusions 4.1 and 4.2 of the document state: One thousand pharmacies at least will close.

In fact, as the story goes-I can assure the House that this is an absolute load of rubbish-that document was said to have been cleared by my office somewhere in Melbourne-Mr Shack-I never said that.",48
127,Mr STAPLES,PHARMACY REMUNERATION CUTS,"No, this is what is being said-and then attributed to my office. That comment is absolute rubbish and anyone who believes that-",48
128,Mr STAPLES,PHARMACY REMUNERATION CUTS,"I know what he asked, Simmons, D. W. Snow, J. H. Anyone who believes that is bordering on a realm of fantasy closely associated with the Staples, P. R. Theophanous, A. C. document itself. I do not think there is any merit or any fact at all in that document. As Uren, T. West, S. J. far as the author is concerned, I am not quite sure whether that person is working Wright, K. W. for a consultancy in any way, It would be interesting to know. In the end, this issue boils down to bucks. As far as the Opposition is concerned, we are talking about how much extra the Opposition will throw at this issue. How much extra will the Opposition offer to the Pharmacy Guild of Australia to satisfy its demands? The pharmacists want to know what the Opposition is prepared to offer. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia wants an extra $150m this year over the Budget and it claims that next year it wants an extra $300m over the Budget. Where does that costing figure in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan? It is not in the Economic Action Plan; so it must be in its health policy, Where is the Opposition's health policy? We have not seen a health policy. Where are the Opposition's costings for its health policy? They are not there. I think the pharmacists would like to know from the honourable member for Tangney what he is prepared to offer them. It is not good enough for the honourable member to say, 'It is incumbent upon the Government to provide pharmacists with a fair and reasonable level of remuneration'. That is fine, but where are the bucks? Where do they figure in the Economic Action Plan and where do they figure in its yet to be seen health policy? Why have we not seen a health policy? There are to be elections in Queensland and South Australia. What is the health policy? It is not there, and the honourable member for Tangney will not tell us, Perhaps the honourable member for Wentworth or the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the National Party of Australia will tell us where the bucks are. The honourable member for Tangney will not offer them; he will not say what he will give the pharmacists, and that is what they want to know. The pharmacists do not trust the Opposition. Opposition members-Ha, hal",48
129,Mr STAPLES,PHARMACY REMUNERATION CUTS,"I am glad that honourable members opposite have laughed. I thank them for their mirth. They can laugh, but the pharmacists do not laugh at them. When those opposite were in government between 1978 and 1983 the pharmacists, under the trust the Opposition expects them to give it, had their incomes cut by 40 per cent in real terms. That is why they want to know now what the Opposition will give them. But most importantly, the people of Australia want to know where this money is coming from. The Opposition has not released its health policy. It has released its economic policy and it is not mentioned there. The people want to know what the alternative will be. Those opposite should give us the alternative. The people know what they have now. They know that, under. this Government and under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, they have had the best quality pharmaceuticals and they have been protected on costs. What does the Opposition want? Will the Opposition charge people? It has already said in its statement that it wants to lift the restriction on those drugs under $11. So the people of Australia know where the payments will come from; the only problem is that the pharmacists do not. NA GORBACHEV: MEETING",49
130,Mr FREE,PRESIDENT BUSH AND PRESIDENT,My question is directed to Prime Minister. I ask: What is the GovernMinister ment's response to the announcement overBaker night of next month's meeting in the Mediterranean between President Bush and President Gorbachev?,49
131,Mr HAWKE,PRESIDENT BUSH AND PRESIDENT,"I would have hoped that on a matter as serious as this the Opposition would have displayed some interest and hope that it will support what I have to say. May I say on behalf of the Government we warmly welcome the news that a meeting between the leaders of the superpowers is take place ahead of the previously scheduled summit meeting due in May. The dynamic tional forces. pace of change in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe at present is nothing short of breathtaking. It is exceeding everyone's expectations of what could happen in that previously rigidly controlled area. Apart from the well known developments in Poland and Hungary, and now in East Germany, I draw the attention of honourable members to the truly remarkable speech to the Supreme Soviet last week by the Foreign Minister, Eduard Shevardnadze. Amongst other things, Mr Shevardnadze criticised the immorality of Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and he stated unequivocally that the Krasnoyarsk radar station violates the anti-ballistic missile treaty, a position, of course, which has been consistently adopted by the West in discussions in this important area. Positive developments of this kind are very much in the interests of all of us who favour a reduction in international tension and, if sustained, they promise a lasting improvement in the global strategic relationship. As I said recently in announcing a package of assistance to Poland and Hungary, a successful outcome to these developments is to be earnestly hoped for but, of course, no-one can take them for granted. It is incumbent on those who can do so to provide support to positive trends at this unique moment in history. Certainly my discussions in June with President Bush in Washington and subsequent exchanges we have had give me every confidence indeed that the United States Administration shares this view. These issues will be at the top of the the agenda when Senator Gareth Evans, the for Defence and I meet Secretaries and Cheney at the end of this week in Sydney. We appreciate the complex and sensitive issues of security which are involved in negotiations on arms control and disarmament, but there is no doubt that the new climate in United States-Soviet relations ofI fers the promise of far-reaching and important steps in this area. In the talks we will that be having with Mr Baker and Mr Cheney we will be stressing Australia's support for to the early conclusion of agreements on strategic and chemical weapons and convenIn conclusion, I hope that I will be able to speak on behalf of all members of this House when I express the profound hope and confidence that next month's meeting at sea in the Mediterranean between President Bush and President Gorbachev will help to underpin the great progress which has already been ,made in recent times in EastWest relations. NA",49
132,Mr SHACK,PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES,"I wish to ask the Minister for Housing and Aged Care another question. I refer the Minister to another letter his office sent out to all Australian Labor Party electorate staff, this time dated 5 October 1989, enclosing copies of a pamphlet entitled The truth and nothing but the truth about the cost and supply of prescription medicines. How can the Minister justifiably claim that the pamphlet tells the truth and nothing but the truth when it includes a claim that 'the average chemist will receive over $100,000 from taxpayers for handling prescriptions', implying that this $100,000 is income rather than gross revenue under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme before payment of wholesalers and all other business costs?",50
133,Mr STAPLES,PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES,That is how the honourable member interprets it. I have never said that. ,50
134,Mr STAPLES,PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES,"Of course it says 'from taxpayers'. It says it is the average remuneration under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme from taxpayers to pharmacists for handling PBS prescriptions. That is the reality and it is clear and factual. If the honourable member wants another comparison, I am quite happy to give him one. I am quite happy to make a comparison of pharmacy profits, the figures on which were provided by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. Between 1978 and 1983 when the Opposition was in government pharmac:y income went down by 40 per cent in real terms. Under this Government, and under the changes that have occurred in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, it is quite clear-this is from the Pharmacy Guild's figures in its 1989 digestthat pharmacy incomes, or profits, have gone up by 40 per cent in real terms. In fact, they are about 40 per cent above average weekly earnings; about 40 per cent above the consumer price index. The statement as it appears in the pamphlet is quite accurate and true. NA NA",50
135,Mr GRIFFITHS,CONTRIBUTION SCHEME,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can the Minister inform the House of the benefits to Australian students of the higher education contribution scheme, particularly comparing fee arrangements with loans and scholarships?",50
136,Mr DAWKINS,CONTRIBUTION SCHEME,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It is more widely recognised than ever before what a success the higher education contribution scheme has been. In 1989 enrolments are up by 6 per cent, despite all the dire predictions of how there would be a disincentive effect. That increase in enrolments means that an extra 25,000 young people are enrolled in higher education this year, including 10,000 school leavers. Full time enrolments are up by 7.8 per cent and higher degree enrolments a massive 17 per cent. For those who thought that the scheme might have provided a disincentive for women, let me say that the proportion of women in the total enrolments has also increased. As a result of the policies which we have pursued, including the introduction of this scheme, the prospect of higher education is something to which qualified people can aspire, regardless of their background or family circumstances. For years in this countrymaybe decades-we wasted the talent of many people, particularly young people, who succumbed to the old Liberal Party policy and convinced themselves that the universities were not a place for them. We have changed all that. There are now more young people finishing school and more young people proceeding to university. One has only to go to some of the graduation ceremonies around the country these days to see the faces of so many proud parents as they watch their sons and daughters graduate. Opposition members-Ha, hal",50
137,Mr DAWKINS,CONTRIBUTION SCHEME,"It is all right for those opposite to laugh. They would not understand about this. Those graduates are the first members of many of those families who have ever been to university and graduated. Of course, we have a proposal from these mean-minded Liberals seeking to change that. Their proposal is to introduce a $1,200 cerned about. up-front fee which, after all, amounts to something in excess of $20 a week-that is, if a person could pay it weekly, but he can not; it has to be paid immediately, through the nose, at the time he enrols. But that burden will not fall on. students; it will on their parents. It will have a massive rimental effect on those who would otherlawyers, wise seek to enrol in universities. There some nebulous talk about loans, but they are commercial loans. That suggestion is highly implausible. The problem is that the· Oppothe sition's policy does not address the question of cost for any loans scheme, so presumably it will be an entirely commercial scheme and therefore impose significant additional costs on anyone who wants to avail himself of loan. The Opposition's scheme will not be cheaper in the long run than our scheme, but it will ensure that the demand for higher education diminishes quite significantly. What the Opposition will discover increasity ingly is that of all its silly proposals in called Economic Action Plan, this will be seen as the silliest. It is no wonder that the honourable member for Bennelong did not want to be the shadow Minister for educaunderstands. tion. Obviously he would not have a bar of this particular nonsense. But then what would situation. a party led by a Toorak toff know about such things as access and equity in higher education? Those opposite have been so obsessed with their own internal problems that they do not realise that there has been massive shift in the behaviour of young people in schools. When we came to office Barry a question? fewer than four out of 10 young people were finishing secondary school. Now the figure up to six out of 10 and increasing. important thing is that that extra two out of 10 young people successfully completing secondary school come in increasing numbers from the western suburbs of Sydney western suburbs of Melbourne, those great tracts of territory which those opposite never traverse, never know about and have never cared about. We have provided opportunities for these people. As the honourable member for Maribyrnong knows, in addition to that we are determined to provide facilities for them where they live-not miles across the metropolitan area, which was the only thing all that that crowd over there was ever conHow are the families in the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne to put their hands on $1,200 a year, every year, at the beginning of the year, in order to provide for the opportunities for their sons and daughfall ters? The Liberal Party has never believed detthat those people ought to become doctors, professors, accountants, scientists, is artists or designers. What it wants to do is keep them in place. That is what its policy is designed to do. However, it has ignored fact that Australia has changed. Under us Australia has become a fairer place. Australians now expect equal treatment. They expect equal access to things such as higher education. Our system has ensured that, bea cause students have to pay nothing when they enrol; they have to pay nothing until they have the wherewithal to pay. It is an income-contingent scheme which requires people to pay only when they have the abilto do so. Those opposite want to deny its sothe changes, the opportunities, but fortunately the Australian people do not want to see a return to an entrenchment of privilege, which is the only thing the Liberal Party Therefore, it will never have an opportunity to bring about a return to that NA",50

I have here a headline from the Illawarra Mercury: 'Howard acthority, cuses coup leaders. . they're liars. Tuckey and Moore should resign'. It is a pretty good newspaper, so it looks like it gets some stories correct. I recommend its reading. Other Ministers can express their opinions in their own way.

MICRO·ECONOMIC REFORM",52
146,Mr JOHNS,MINING INDUSTRY,"My question is to the Minprovement ister for Industrial Relations.

What are the implications for national wage principles and the success of the award restructuring process?",52

148,Mr SPEAKER,MINING INDUSTRY,"Order! Honourable support members on my left will cease interjecting.  providing $12m towards the workplace reAuthority. form program. The key role in award restupid structuring and labour market reform is the activities being carried out under that gram. That program offers a once and for all opportunity in association with award restructuring to substantially improve productivity, efficiency and competitiveness in our industries-in effect, to help make our They industries world class. Within that process will be the reduction of job classifications, the creation of more varied and interesting jobs, and better skill and career paths. Overall there are three elements to the program: the work change assistance division to support union and employer organisations in award changes; work change training to help build management and union expertise; and a national network of work place resource centres to help companies, on a commercial basis, implement award changes. Separate from that, we are also providing some $9m for union and management training through the Trade Union Training AuTUT A. That organisation has been the subject of constant attack by the Opposition in the other place. That organisation not only assists in the training of trade union officials and members but also is being increasingly used by companies to train their management and middle management in the activities related to award restructuring. One may well ask: what is the alternative? Let me say bluntly that we hear from the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders, the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Chaney in the other place, this parroting cry about productivity. They say, 'Productivity is the go'. The substantial imof productivity is this Governnumber one priority, but in an orderly and planned way, through award restructuring, through better industrial relations, with the cooperation of industry and the trade union movement and through better training the and the creation of better career paths. The Opposition is completely turning its back on practical labour market reform. The 'economic inaction policy' it has issued abandons wages policy and scraps government for award restructuring; it scraps the work place reform program; it dumps arrangements with the Trade Union Training That kind of process is just plain and irresponsible. It wrecks the joint moves coming from industry, from the trade prounion movement and from government, to improve productivity. One can see from the support given by the chief executives of business around the country how out of touch that policy is. Four out of five chief executives in industry do not understand, do not want and do not support the Opposition's industrial relations policy. I remind the Leader of the Opposition of a speech that I know he is well versed in. It is the speech by the National President of the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia, Mr Walter Uhlenbruch. The other afternoon when this speech was delivered the Leader of the Opposition did not cop it with a smile on his face. I will read from Mr Uhlenbruch's speech to the Association: . . . the one matter which has dominated our agendas in 1989 is award restructuring. As you know, the MTIA has been at the forefront of it since 1986, when the Association first approached the unions seeking a compact. Nearly three years later, we are seeing the stages of a process which will result in far-reaching changes in the way our workplaces operate. He went on to say: As far as employers in our industrythere are 7,800 employers in the Metal Trades Industry Associationare concerned, they've made it abundantly clear over the last year or two, that they want award restructuring and an end to confrontation. This confrontation is what the Opposition's industrial relations policy is about. He went on to say: Although award restructuring begins at the industry level, it is all about higher productivity negotiated and implemented at each enterprise. This Opposition wants to dump award restructuring; it wants to dump the workplace reform program; it wants to abolish the Trade Union Training Authority. These are essential elements in this process of lifting productivity and lifting efficiency. We hear this parroting about productivity. There is an easy way to get productivity-a la Thatcher. All we have to do is contract the economy, get rid of people, destroy their jobs, and then we can lift labour productivity! Thatcher has done that. She got a brilliant result. Ten years after she started, Britain is reaching the same level of manufacturing output that it had 10 years ago. We are seeing the ramifications of that in what is happening in the British Parliament at present. That. is the approach of the Thatcher Government; .that is the process that this Opposition wants. The Opposition industrial relations spokesman, Senator Chaney-in the twistings and turnings of the Opposition's industrial relations policy-said that the Opposition will lift family living standards and that it will do it by dropping wages. That is the latest revelation. Bear in mind that this Opposition has consistently helped to prolong the pilots dispute and the re-establishment of normal services. This Opposition has been a major contributor to that prolongation. This Opposition supports a 30 per cent pay increase for one of the highest paid groups of people in this country. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 145 states that an answer shall be relevant to the question. The original question was wide in scope but did not deal with the matters to which the first Minister is now turning. He is also speaking at great length. I ask that you bring him to order.",52
149,Mr SPEAKER,MINING INDUSTRY,"Order! The Minister is in order.  supports a 30 per cent pay increase for a group of people whose average incomes are $80,000 a year. Everybody on this side of the House and everyone of our constituents would love to have to try to make do on $80,000 a year. But the Opposition is supporting these people. On wages policy, Senator Chaney says that employees will be better off if they have a more modest outcome than the immodest outcomes of recent years. Mr Shack- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There is ample precedent for you to ask the Minister to draw his answer to a close. We request that you ask him to give us a break and that you do it now.",53
150,Mr SPEAKER,MINING INDUSTRY,"Order! The Minister is in order, but I am sure that he will finish shortly.  supports those people on average incomes of $80,000 a year and is telling the rest of the workers in this country that employees would be better off were they to have a more modest outcome than the immodest outcomes of recent years, because the immodest outcomes of recent years have meant higher inflation and a real decline in wages. In effect, Senator Chaney is saying that if people accepted lower wages, they would be better off. At the same time, the Opposition is saying to the Government, 'Yes, it's okay for the pilots. Give them their 30 per cent and give them 'any increase that they 'Yant'. From this side of the House the poltcy we are putting will provide substantial improvements in productivity in an orderly. and responsible way. This Government IS about adding to those 1.6 million new jobs we have created in this coun-ry and we will continue to expand upon them. There is one simple difference between policy on this side of the House and that side of the House.",53

I will quote from a source that the Leader of the Oppofuture sition was quoting earlier today-the Sydney Morning Herald. Let me quote the Sydney Australian public. Morning Herald. The editorial today states: For the tourism industry and the small businesses that live off it, the dispute, or the ramifications of it, are clearly not over.

The federatIOn has to face the fact that it has lost the dispute. Let me make it quite clear that I retract not one word from what I have said and I will not be diverted by the Opposition's misrepresentation. The fact is that when the Industrial Relations Commission handed down its new award the industrial dispute ended in the legal sense. We now have not a continuation of that industrial dispute-that industrial dispute is finished-but a significant phase of airline rebuilding or reconstruction. The concern now is solely with rebuilding the capacity of the airlines as quickly as possible. ",54

It must be said that the service provided in the airline industry is obviously less than fully satisfactory. The airlines readily admit this. The airlines are working hard on fixed forward schedules will emerge shortly. They will be based on forecast significant increases in charter have and in their own aircraft capacity. Such schedules as will be announced in the near will address many travel planning programs that are currently being faced by the As for the tourism industry, many parts of it obviously have been sadly ravaged as a result of the pilots premeditated action. I ask industrial those on the other side of the House to remember the facts. They conveniently overlook the reality of this situation. We are not faced with a situation where a dispute was initiated accidentally. It is just as well to remember-I have quoted it in the House before-what the airline pilots deliberately set out to do in creating that industrial dispute. I refer to what they were saying in the early part of this year. In their own publication they referred to 'prolonged industrial action'. Those are their words from Deadline 89. They talked about stop-work meetings all around Australia using every means available-'prolonged industrial action using every means available'. Honourable members will remember that they talked about a nonincome period. They were telling their members to get ready for a prolonged non-income period. They were saying, 'Take jobs as taxi drivers and so on. Be prepared to adjust your lifestyle'. ",54

That was the industrial dispute which it initiated. The Industrial Relations Commission has ended that industrial dispute. The Australian Federation of Air Pilots has no members employed. The pilots who are employed by the airlines are in no situation of industrial dispute. The airlines are the employers and pilots are employed by the airlines. There is no industrial dispute between them. This is an attempt by the discredited Federation of Air Pilots which will not accept the reality, as the Sydney Morning Herald says. It ignores reality. The reality is that the pilots have lost that industrial dispute. What we have is the aftermath of that industrial dispute. This Government stands ready, as we have said in consultations with the tourism industry. As this situation unfolds now we have received representations from the tourism industry. It has asked for no compensation. It has made it quite clear that it wants no compensation, but it wants us to cooperate with it in undertaking a campaign, which we will do, to restore the tourism industry to the position which was established under this Government. I remind this House that if there was one area of activity in this country that was almost criminally neglected by the mob opposite when they were in government it was tourism. When we came to office we had fewer than one million visitors from overseas-900,000. Under the policies of this Government that number has now reached about 2.2 million.

That is what has created the growth in this country. In conclusion, I remind the House of what the alternative would have been if this Government had not done what it did; that is, to take on this battle initiated by the pilots. We took it on reluctantly. We pleaded with them. Opposition members-Ha, hal",55
166,Mr HAWKE,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"Again, those opposite can laugh. We pleaded, as did the airline industry, with the pilots to negotiate their dispute within the arbitration system-it is on the record-and they would not. If we had not been prepared to take on the pilots in the dispute that they initiated and had given them a 30 per cent increase, not only would the tourism industry of this country have been wrecked, but so would the whole of the Australian economy. From day one this Government has not been prepared to wreck either the tourism industry or the Australian economy. Honourable members opposite wrecked it once. As my colleague the Treasurer has said, they have had their round one and because they gave in in 1981 and had a wages blow-out of 18 per cent, they wrecked the Australian economy as a whole and the tourism industry in particular. We have not been prepared to allow that to happen again and nor will we. In the result, after the aftermath of that settled industrial dispute, we will have restored an airline industry which will be infinitely more productive, infinitely more efficient and which will be able to deliver to Australian tourism an infinitely better service than it could deliver before.

That followed the more general point that the Government has had to secure a change in aggregate wage outcomes from the very high levels of wage costs bequeathed to us by our predecessors. In the coalition document, the so-called Economic Action Plan, we have the key line that 'by reducing inflation and shifting the weight off monetary policy' the coalition is going to have a system of enterprise wage bargaining which will see, it says, 'a great leap downwards in wages'. It is going to enterprise bargain-like the Prime Minister was just s-ying in relation to Ansett and Australian Airlines-and wages are simply going to fall. Then inflation falls and, because inflation is the floor under interest rates, interest rates fall. It is all quite easy. All one does is go to enterprise bargaining and wages fall, inflation falls and interest rates fall. As my colleague - aid, today we have some very interesting words from Senator Chaney.",56

But now that the honourable member for Bennelong has returned to the front bench and claimed industrial relations along with commerce and industry policy, he has jumped into print today, in the Australian, just to let us know that he is still around. He has some very interesting things to say. He says: The non-centralised system - . . that is, the Opposition's non-centralised systemwill look after itself provided the agreements are genuinely voluntary . . . So, provided they are genuinely voluntary, they will be okay. He goes on: . . . the industries are generally forced to be competitive, and that's really it. The fact that we have a British craft union structure, a trans-industry award structure, where a metal worker can be found under an award in the building industry, the car industry, the shipbuilding industry, one of a dozen industries, does not rate a mention'provided the agreements are genuinely voluntary'. Then he says: A Coalition government would encourage the commission to make these determinations largely on a 'capacity-to-pay' basis, . . . But on what basis would the capacity to pay be enforced? On what basis, if there has been an increase for a certain classification of worker in a certain industry, is a capacity to pay going to be established by the arbitration commission in the face of industrial activity? There is a total unwillingness to understand the realities of the workplace. I cannot get around it. Senator Chaney goes on to say that this industry-by-industry policy might mean some workers getting nothing. They will cop that, of course, because their industry cannot pay! The ones next door, with the same job classification, will get a bonanza but these people will cop it. It is the greatest lot of twaddle one could ever imagine. Senator Chaney then goes on to say that he: . would want to reach some consensus both employers and unions on the economic outlook . . . So, as he is giving one group nothing and another group everything, he is going to try to get a consensus about the way the whole thing should run. He says that while he is doing this 'there's a real risk' that the economy 'would be in hideous shape and we would face massive unemployment growth' So we will have high unemployment while he gets this consensus together about wages, while he has capacity to pay agreements and 'genuinely voluntary' agreements in relation to enterprise bargaining. This is the coalition's industrial relations policy. It is the greatest lot of rubbish ever. At the end of it, the writer herself says: It does not seem totally convincing. Dead right, Laura; it is not. Mr Speaker, this is the central tenet of the Opposition's policy. As I have been saying here for a week, when one looks past the bribes of tax expenditures, the give-aways, what sits under the lot? How would the Opposition run Australia? How would it deal with wages and costs and inflation? The answer is not by some process of evolution and change towards industry unions or enterprise agreements or a change in restructuring of awards. There would be none of that evolutionary change. The Opposition would pretend that the craft structure does not exist, turn its back on it and say, 'Go for your life. Bargain to your heart's content'. As the wage numbers fly up and the inflation rate flies up, it will respond with the same policy it has always responded witha draconian monetary policy which would tear the heart out of the economy: economic activity, imports and employment. Unemployment will rise. According to the Opposition, that will be good;· it will put a downward pressure on wage outcomes. Temporarily, the current account deficit will improve because imports will stop. So, too, will investment. Factories will start shutting their doors again. It will be exactly the same policy we had when the tragic trio were around in 1980, when the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong and Senator Stone were running economic policy in 1980. But here it is from the industrial relawith tions spokesman, who today has really put down some thoughtful lines about how the coalition would run this system. It is the nonsense I said it was yesterday and the day before. Not one person in the Opposition is prepared to stand up and defend it. The Leader of the Opposition has not had a press conference in Parliament 'House since he released the document 2t weeks ago. He will not subject himself to the kind of scrutiny that is required in seeking high public office as Prime Minister to run the national economy. He will not subject himself to scrutiny. He wants to satisfy the media by twominute interviews on kerbside with television journalists. He will not subject himself to the kind of detailed scrutiny of the Canberra Press Gallery on the key points of economic policy. All we have seen today is yet another example of the muddled thinking, emptiness and shallowness of the Opposition in these 'slim pickings', as they are called in the article, from Senator Chaney.

Question so resolved in the negative, NA NA Bill presented by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read a first time, Mr LIONEL .BOWEN (Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (4,38)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time, This Bill is a significant development in the Government's continued commitment to the financial and management independence of the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Bill will ensure that the courts and the Tribunal are independent from day. to day control by the Attorney-General's Department and will provide them with the capacity to make deAYES cisions which they believe will best enhance Taylor, W. L. Webster, A. P. their efficient and effective operation, The Bill is not, however, about judicial independWoods, R. L. Wooldridge, M. R. L. ence in so far as that expression relates to the independence of judges and members of NOES the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the exercise of their judicial or adjudicative responsibilities, Kerin, J.

All in this Parliament would MCHugh, J. Martin, S. P. agree that it is essential that this independence be maintained, It is unfortunate that Milton, P.

Sciacca, C. rately from the mainstream of government administration, But in providing a statutory Scott, Los Simmons, D. W. basis for independent administration and management, it does not follow that the Snowdon, W. E. Staples, P. R. courts or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will or should be free of the need to Tickner, R. E. Uren, T. account for their operations, It is the Parliament which appropriates the funds to these WiIIi',R. Wright, K. W. bodies and it is to the Parliament that they will be answerable, Courts and tribunals, no NA less than other areas of public administration, must be accountable for efficiency in the management of their affairs, Ultimately, of course, the courts must be accountable to the public, Within the resources provided by the Parliament, the judicial system must ensure that it provides to all who use the courts BILL 1989 impartial adjudication of issues which come before it without undue delay, Public accountability is essential, for withSecond Reading out public confidence the judiciary may well come under threat. The provisions of this Bill will place with the courts and the Tribunal responsibility for their own administration and provide them with the capacity to operate as they see fit within the resources provided by the Parliament. Some have suggested that the level of judiciary salaries in some way directly affects the degree of independence exercised by the judiciary, Such a proposition is offensive because it suggests that judges will be influenced in the decisions they make because of the level of remuneration, What is important is that the constitutional guarantee that remuneration cannot be reduced during judicial office is supported. The Judicial and Statutory Officers Remuneration Legislation Amendment Bill which recently passed through this House enhances that constitutional guarantee by placing the ultimate responsibility for the determination of the level of judicial salaries in this Parliament. That is not to say that the level of salaries is unimportant; quite contrary. Without adequate remuneration capable individuals will not make themselves available to serve in our courts. For some time the Government has been conscious of the need to move in the direction of enabling the Federal Court of Australia, the Family Court of Australia and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to manage their own affairs. The High Court of Australia has enjoyed such administrative independence for some years. The situation with the other courts and the Tribunal is that they have operated under the administrative umbrella of the Attorney-General's Department with the Secretary of that Department. exercising the powers of a departmental secretary of the Public Service in relation to the staff of those courts and the Tribunal. As a first step towards self-management, from the beginning of this financial year the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Administrative· Appeals Tribunal received separate appropriations in the Supply Bills. This placed them, in this respect, on an equal footing with the High Court. The purpose behind this move was to place the courts and the Tribunal in a position where their funding allocation would be controlled by themselves and they will now be able to negotiate direct with the Government concerning the appropriate level of future funding. As an additional step towards increased administrative independence, a number of the departmental secretary's powers were delegated to the chief administrative officer of each court and of the Tribunal. This Bill now provides a statutory basis to fully implement the self-management of the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The effect of this Bill is to transfer from the Attorney-General's Department to the courts and the Tribunal responsibility for the supervision of their own financial management and practices and for the courts and the Tribunal to take control over the management of their other administrative affairs. Self-management will mean that the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be free to make their own decisions in human and financial resource management. This will maximise the flexibility of the courts and the Tribunal to cope with changing pressures and priorities throughout each year. the This move is welcomed by the chief justices of the Federal and Family courts and the President of the Tribunal. It is also consistent with initiatives they have taken, and no doubt will be taking, in relation to their case management procedures and in the reduction of delays. The Bill will also mean that these bodies will be given an administrative independence similar to that enjoyed by the High Court. There are two differences of substance between the arrangements in this Bill and the position of the High Court. First, unlike the High Court, the Federal and Family courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are not given power to acquire interests in land. The accommodation needs of these bodies are, of course, significantly greater than those of the High Court. Because of the geographic diversity of their operations, the Federal and Family courts and the Tribunal require facilities across Australia and the acquisition of those facilities is enhanced if they can have the opportunity to work under the umbrella of government purchasing and building arrangements. This is also a more efficient arrangement, in particular, where accommodation might be shared by these bodies in purpose-built accommodation. The other difference is that, unlike the High Court which operates its own bank accounts, the Federal and Family courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will operate on the Commonwealth public account under arrangements with which they are familiar and which they have agreed should be retained. Use of the Commonwealth public account will not subject them to the control of the Attorney-General's Department as they will operate as separate departments. To facilitate the proposed increased administrative responsibilities of the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Bill creates a new executive management position in each body to carry out the new management functions under the overall direction and control of the chief judge of each court and the President of the Tribunal. Unlike the Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Family Court has two separate mainstreams of personnelthose concerned with the delivery of court counselling services and those concerned with the legal aspects of the proceedings before the court. In recognition of this fact-and noting, of course, that the Family Court is the largest and most diverse court in Australia-the Bill creates a new statutory office of Chief Executive Officer in that court. In the Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the responsibilities of the registrars have been altered to incorporate the responsibilities in respect of the courts and Tribunal administration previously conferred on the Secretary of the Attorney General's Department. Both positions of Registrar will cease to be Public Service positions and both registrars and the Chief Executive Officer will hold appointments from the Governor General. In relation to the other officers and staff of the courts and the Tribunal, the new officeholders will be given the powers of departmental secretaries. The existing position of the Principal Registrar of the Family Court will remain as at present and that officer will continue to exercise the functions of the Principal Registrar and the supervision of the officers of the court carrying out legal functions. Many of the ptovisions of the Bill are standard provisions and consequential amendments which are necessary for the creation of these new statutory offices. The remaining provisions in parts 2, 4 and 5 of the Bill cover the new administrative duties and responsibilities which are to be taken on by the courts and the Tribunal. The amendment to subsection 78 (3) of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act is also a consequential amendment arising from the change in the position of the Registrar of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from a Public Service position to a statutory officeholder. Currently, the Registrar of the Tribunal is also the Registrar of the Security Appeals Tribunal established by the ASIO Act. This is because the workload of the Security Appeals Tribunal is such that it does not justify full time registry appointments. The amendment will mean that the Registrar of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal would still be eligible to be the Registrar of the Security Appeals Tribunal. The other amendments made by this Bill relate to the setting of fees in the High Court. Currently these fees are set by the judges of the High Court in the High Court rules. After consultation with the High Court, it has been agreed to transfer this fee-setting power so that in future it can be dealt with by regulation. This brings the position in regard to the High Court fees into line with the position in regard to fees in other courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Bill amends the relevant sections of the Judiciary Act to give effect to this proposal. This Bill is a major reform by the Government in the area of judicial administration. However, in presenting this reform, I must say that the Government is conscious that it could not have reached this point had it not been for the support and commitment of the chief justices of the Federal and Family courts and the President of the Tribunal. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr N. A. Brown) adjourned. Mr Jull- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - ",59

185,Mr WILLIS,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill represents the first stage of legislation to reform the operation of broadcasting regulation. It contains measures that address some immediate deficiencies in the Broadcasting Act 1942. The Bill gives the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal access to more appropriate remedies in cases where a commercial radio or television licensee does not meet the basic suitability requirements that are currently applicable to a licence. It also includes amendments to confirm that the Minister can initiate, and the Tribunal can hold, joint inquiries into the grant of a licence for a supplementary or independent commercial FM radio service in a regional area; allow aspirant public broadcasters to transmit sponsorship announcements when conducting test transmissions; and allow public licensees to broadcast community promotional material. Further reforms are to be developed quickly and will be contained in amendments to be introduced in the autumn and Budget sittings of Parliament next year. The reforms to be introduced early next year will focus on measures to improve substantially the operation of key areas of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's responsibilities, in particular, the ownership and control enforcement scheme. These reforms will be consistent with the wider review. The final package, to be presented in the second half of next year, will incorporate the conclusions of the wider review of broadcasting regulation. I will deal now with the ownership and control provisions of the Bill. At present, Tribunal would be faced with extremely limited options if, after conducting an inquiry that it was required to hold, it were to find that a commercial licensee was no longer 'fit and proper', or no longer had the financial, technical or management capacity to provide an adequate and comprehensive service. It presently may only impose licence conditions or suspend, revoke or not renew the licence. But if the licensee's unsuitability was due the conduct or character of a person in a position to control the licensee company or its operations, licence conditions may not be an effective remedy. This is because the conditions may not be capable of affecting the influence of the relevant person on the licensee company. The only other remedies available-suspension, revocation or refusal to renew the licence-would put the service off the air. Cessation of a service would penalise not only the licensee company, but also the viewing or listening public and other innocent shareholders and creditors. There is a need to give the Tribunal more flexible and less draconian remedies. This Bill achieves that objective. The Bill allows the Tribunal, where it finds that a commercial licensee is no longer suitable to hold the licence, to issue specific directions to relevant parties and/or to impose appropriate licence conditions. These provisions do not create new substantive powers for the Tribunal. In the case of licence conditions, the Bill simply confirms that the existing power of the Tribunal under section 85 of the Act can be used as an alternative to licence cancellation. Similarly, in the case of directions, the Bill only extends the current directions power under section 92M of the Act to enable it to be used in the event of a failure by a licensee to meet basic suitability requirements. In some circumstances, licence conditions or directions may still be insufficient to deal with the situation. In these cases, the amendments allow the Tribunal to order divestment of relevant interests. If a relevant interest is directed to be divested a strict sixmonth deadline will apply. This is because by then it would have been fully established by the Tribunal, if necessary through court and Administrative Appeals Tribunal avenues, that the licensee failed to meet the the suitability requirements and that divestment was the appropriate remedy. At this stage the Government proposes no change to arrangements for any divestment that may be required in other circumstances, such as following a breach of ownership limits. The Bill also provides powers for the Tribunal to impose licence conditions and to issue directions to apply pending divestment. These powers will mirror the existing provito sions that are available to the Tribunal pending its consideration of a share transaction. The purpose of this power is to enable the Tribunal to prevent actions that might adversely affect the service. The range of licensing remedies provided in this Bill enables the sanctions of licence suspension or revocation to be put in a clearer perspective. These remedies are best used as an ultimate deterrent against repeated or serious breaches of the Act. This Bill will remove concern that such draconian actions could be taken by the Tribunal because it had no other real alternative. At this point I would like to refer more generally to the powers that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has long held under section 85 to impose licence conditions at any time and, under section 92M, to issue directions pending an inquiry into an ownership transaction. In recent months some doubt had been cast on the possible validity of the section 92M power and a possible procedural requirement may have inhibited its use in practice. These doubts had led to calls for additional powers to be provided to the Tribunal. In the light of advice from the Attorney-General's Department, the Government now considers that the current section 92M powers are valid. There are no undue obstacles to the use of these powers, - r to the imposition of licence conditions, in cases where such steps would be properly warranted by the circumstances. Accordingly, the Government is not proposing any amendments in this respect at this stage. This Bill also makes some minor adjustments and clarifications that reinforce existing policy and do not pre-empt the Government's ongoing review of broadcasting regulation, about which I will say more later in these remarks. The Bill places beyond doubt the power of the Tribunal to inquire concurrently into applications for grant of both commercial radio licences and supplementary licences in the same market. These amendments answer arguments that the Act may require those applications to be considered sequentially, an interpretation that could substantially delay the introduction of new, competitive radio services in non-metropolitan markets. The Bill also will permit public broadcasters to transmit community promotional material. Presently, public broadcasters may transmit community information which, under recent interpretations, may not be promotional in nature. The Government considers that this is too restrictive and that public broadcasters should be able to promote actively genuine community events of interest to their listeners. While the promotion of commercial sponsors will continue to be prohibited as a form of advertising, the Government is considering the implications of recent Tribunal findings and a Federal Court decision on these aspects and may propose further clarifying amendments if that seems necessary. The amendment has been cast in broad terms on the basis that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has power to make program standards in this area if the Tribunal considers that to be appropriate. The Bill will also allow public broadcasters undertaking test transmissions to broadcast sponsorship announcements as if they were licensed services. This will assist aspirant public groups to pay for the tests, and enable them to gauge the level of support likely to be available within the community. Any breaches of the sponsorship requirements during the test would be an offence, and may also be taken into account by the Tribunal when it comes to determining who should be licensed. The continued growth of public broadcasting as an integral element of the Australian broadcasting system is fully appreciated by the Government and these amendments will continue to assist that growth. The changes proposed today serve to introduce immediate improvements to the present system. The basic legislation needs further improvement. I turn now to the question of further, more fundamental, reform. The Broadcasting Act has rightly been described as a complex, unwieldy piece of legislation. The Government is committed to its ongoing reform. In November 1988, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure tabled a report making recommendations on changes to the role and functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. This was followed by a supplementary report in May 1989. Both reports have proved to be valuable contributions in pointing out deficiencies in the present system and setting out issues for reform. In July of this year, I released a departmental discussion paper entitled Review of Broadcasting Regulation that focused mainly on the current regulatory system and suggested some options for change. Public comment was sought on that paper. Most of the submissions received so far in response to the departmental discussion paper have argued for extensive changes to the system of broadcasting regulation. Several interest groups have asked for more time to address the issues before making their full submistings sions, and I have agreed to this. The public debate has provided valuable further perspectives on difficult problems. There is widespread agreement on the need to introduce measures to increase the effithe ciency and effectiveness of the ownership and control scheme. But, even more imporrelated tantly, there has been general support, erly qualified by the need to protect the public interest, for the view that there would be merit in a more wide-ranging examination of broadcasting regulation. The submissions consistently argued for this. I have asked my Department to proceed with options for ongoing reform, building on the reforms already introduced by this Govling ernment. In 1987 this Government fundaup mentally reformed the television ownership and control limits in the Act. The following year we reformed the limitations on the ownregulation ership and control of commercial radio staaspects tions. We replaced the old two-station rule for television ownership with limitations based on audience reach. We replaced the old limits on radio station holdings with new limits which recognised growth and developsettled ment in the radio industry. We also introa duced cross media limits between radio, television and newspaper outlets in the same marketplace. Broadcasting ownership and control policies have thus been clearly stated and implemented by this Government. The tives, rules embodying these policies have been down in the Act. In this area efficiency renecessary. forms are now called for. At present the limitations on ownership and control are enforced by complex mechanisms, including an extensive system of notification and approval of a wide range of commercial transactions. Other areas of commercial activity do not have the same degree of oversight upon them-be it by the Trade Practices Commission, the National Companies and Securities Commission, or the Australian Stock Exchange. This is beefficient cause, historically, the community and the Parliament have considered broadcasting warrant a higher level of public scrutiny. However, there needs to be a mechanism to scrutinise and enforce ownership and control limits by means that impose less of a burden on licensees, investors and the Tribunal. I intend to bring forward in the autumn sitnext year a package of measures to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the ownership and control scheme. Ownership and control rules serve four separate main purposes. The first is to limit concentration of ownership, control and influence of the media. The second, which is to the first, is to encourage competiproption and diversity in programming and the range of views to be presented. The third is to restrict foreign ownership. The fourth is to support the present licensing requirements including the suitability of prescribed interest holders in individual licences. There may be merit in developing legislation that addresses these aspects separately, so that non-controlinvestors are not unnecessarily caught in regulation addressing the suitability of those who control licences and so that there is greater consistency with general business that affects foreign ownership or of ownership that affect competition. This 'efficiency package' may also streamline the Tribunal's public inquiry processes. However, in addition to taking immediate steps to introduce efficiency reforms in well areas of broadcasting policy there is need to examine the principles of broadcasting regulation from a wider perspective. This aspect of the review will be directed at ensuring that future legislation more clearly serves explicit governmental policy objecin particular, that the industry is sublaid ject only to the minimum regulation Clearly, full deregulation is not appropriate for this industry because it involves so many important public interest issues. For . that reason appropriate licensing arrangements and standards are still necessary, as are rules to limit cross media ownership, audience reach and multiple licence ownership. The regulation that is retained in the revised scheme will need to be capable of administration. There will need to be certainty for all affected parties, while to maintaining appropriate public access and providing for natural justice. Because of the high level of public interest in this area, I will now outline briefly its scope and the direction that the Government will be pursuing in its ongoing reform of broadcasting regulation. We will be addressing seven key areas. First, future broadcasting legislation must serve the explicit policy aim that there be no more regulation of industry than is necessary to support stated objectives. The Government has previously spelled out objectives that address diversity and quality of programming, Australian content, local programming needs, concentration and diversity in broadcasting media ownership and control. It is the responsibility of government to provide the environment in which broadcasting objectives can best be met. This requires further consideration of the proper balance between structural measures-including an appropriate level of competition, perhaps linked to some selfregulation-and external regulation. Secondly, there is the area of new services and service delivery methods. The current scheme of legislation in broadcasting, radiocommunications and telecommunications needs to be re-examined to recognise the interactions between broadcasting services and broadcasting-related services, such as video and audio entertainment and information services, or VAEIS, and narrowcast services; between broadcasting services and some emerging value added telecommunications services; between broadcasting services and the cinema, video-hire and other VCR-derived services; and between broadcasting and the Australian film, music and entertainment production industries. This is certainly not to say that any regulation should be applied uniformly-or at allto the various types of services; indeed quite the contrary. When I released my Department's discussion paper, I said that the Government is committed to ensuring that services are not subjected to unnecessary regulation. Where different technical or commercial arrangements deliver services that are essentially similar to the user, it is inappropriate to subject them to different regulatory regimes. At present there are quite different regulatory arrangements governing programs provided in the cinema, on videotape or through broadcasting. But as the differences in the means of access to programs become less significant, the regulatory differences need to be reduced or eliminated. New applications for communications technology are being developed, and the distinction between broadcasting services and these new applications is becoming increasingly unclear. We need regulation that facilitates and encourages these new services. This means that they should not be subject to ad hoc regulatory arrangements; nor should they be artificially forced into a traditional-and even outdated-broadcasting regulatory regime. At the same time we need to recognise the interlocking nature of the various pieces of communications legislation, and continue to ensure their consistency and integration, and their relevance to what is happening out there in the real world. But this does not necessarily mean an all-embracing single communications Act. Rather it means the progressive updating of the legislation to achieve the objectives. The third area comprises all those activities that are traditionally referred to as 'planning'. Communications planning processes need to be restructured to ensure accountability through a more transparent process. Present arrangements require the Minister and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to be heavily involved in judgments about when a service area needs or can support new commercial services. We need to develop arrangements that provide greater scope for broadcasters to take initiatives and carry them forward on their own responsibility to tap new markets and new market segments. We also need to examine whether community needs are better recognised and met by the integration of planning and licensing arrangements under the umbrella of an independent authority. The fourth area is. that part of the Act dealing with ownership and control. The continuing need for limitations on ownership and control in the broadcasting industrynotably in the areas of foreign ownership, audience reach, cross media limits-is generally accepted. Efficiency reforms are now called for in the regulatory mechanisms which presently supervise and enforce these limits and I intend to introduce such reforms in the autumn sittings next year. The wider review, however, may consider other aspects standards. of ownership and control not dealt with in the efficiency package. The licensing system is the fifth area. needs to be examined to achieve a more agencies efficient and rational approach to licence location, review, and renewal. A broadcastlatory ing licence is still a valuable and marketable asset. There is a case for greater use of pricing mechanisms in licenCe allocation. This is the basis of the Government's national metropolitan radio plan and has already used in the process of AM-FM conversion for commercial metropolitan radio stations in all the mainland State capital cities. is now scope to extend such arrangements further. At the same time, a licence carries with certain public responsibilities and there minimum suitability and service ments that need to be met. The present legislative formulation of these requirements warrants further examination. However, whatever the outcome of such examination, allocation methods will need to continue take account of these responsibilities and quirements; and regulatory powers are needed in this area. The present Bill addresses some of the immediate problems in this area of licensing. But there is a need for further efficiency amendments and scope for further and more fundamental reform. This will be addressed with a view to developing arrangements support the objectives of diversity, quality, and responsive commercial programming while eliminating undue regulatory intervention. Sixth, the regulation of programming standards needs to be examined to ensure that quality is maintained in the broadcasting system. It is the Government's responsibility to safeguard the public interest, but this be achieved by creating the right environment for industry to provide services of an acceptable standard. The question of whether standards need to be established statutory regulation or self-regulation needs to be looked at. However, this Government has no intention of abandoning its support for Australian content, quality children's programming and safeguards for community The seventh, and final, area involves the re-examination of the nature, responsibilities This and method of operation of the regulatory and the divisions of responsibilities albetween them and the Government. Regupolicy is a matter for the Government and the Parliament. However the administration of regulation, as well as the provision of advice on its substance, can be and is presently assigned to, different regulatory agen- . been cies. Arrangements for administering regulation need to be consistent with the policy objectives for that regulation. While There we need appropriate transparency and accountability in important regulatory decision-making, we also need to find ways to streamline procedures so that regulatory it processes provide opportunities for commuare nity involvement and do not unduly impede requirecommercial arrangements. While many of these issues have been addressed to some extent by recent review activity, we need to look at them again from a to wider, more fundamental perspective. Proreposals received during recent public consultations provide a valuable foundation for this exercise. In examining future options, there will be wide consultation, both within the Government and with all interested parties outside government. The Government wants to see the fullest public debate. This will include scope for further public comment directed to the Department of Transport and that Communications throughout the review process and the release of position papers on relevant issues as the review progresses. The Australian broadcasting industry has generally met audience and community needs well over many years. While we need· to maintain continuity with this past achievement, we also intend to ensure that arrangements are in place to foster new and emerging can market opportunities and to meet commuregulatory nity needs and aspirations. The Government does not underestimate the complexity of the task that we have set by ourselves. Those who may suggest that the fundamentals of broadcasting regulation are amenable to quick or simple reform fail to comprehend either the complexity and importance of the issues or the constraints of the existing legislation. Nonetheless we would hope to be in a position to introduce further legislation to improve regulatory efficiency during the autumn sittings, with the balance of our reform program being presented during the Budget sittings. The Bill is expected to have no significant· impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I commend this Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.

I must explain to the honourable member for Fadden that this time of the House is devoted to government business. I am following the program of business as indicated on the blue sheet.

That was agreed to by the House earlier today for government business and I intend to follow that program.",69
188,Mr KERIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The principal purpose of the Bill is to amend the Grain Legumes Levy Act 1985 and associated regulations to allow different rates of levy to be determined for the various grain legumes covered by the grain legume research scheme. In recognition of the higher per unit value of crops recently added to the scheme, the maximum rate of levy prescribed in the Act is proposed to be increased from $2.60 to $5 per tonne. The Bill also provides for an increase in the levy rate for peanuts from $1.25 to $2 per tonne and changes of an administrative nature in respect of peanuts and mung beans. All changes have been recommended by the Grains Council of Australia, which is the growers' organisation defined in the Levy Act. The Grain Legumes Levy Act, in conjunction with the Rural Industries Research Act 1985, gives effect to a grain legumes research scheme, which is funded by a levy payable by growers on the production of certain grain legumes. The levy rate is presently $1.25 per tonne for all leviable grain legumes, which can be varied by regulation up to a maximum rate of $2.60 per tonne. Grower contributions to research by way of the levy, are 1989 matched by the Commonwealth on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the industry's gross value of production. Australian grain legume production has increased very markedly over the past decade and today makes a significant contribution to the Australian cropping industry. Moreover, the industry has developed into a major rural commodity export earner. NaOrtional production in 1988-89 is estimated at over 1.8 million tonnes valued in excess of $400m. Exports for the same year were in excess of 782,000 tonnes valued at $207m. Improved prices relative to cereals have been a significant factor in the strong growth in grain legume production. There is, however, increasing recognition among the farming community of the value of grain legumes as a rotational crop, both to provide nitrogen for subsequent cereal crops and to assist in the control of cereal diseases. Grain legumes are thus expected to continue to play an important part in farm management, as well as broadening the market base for rural producers. Reflecting the increased grower interest in grain legumes in recent years, the Government· has approved a number of additions to the grain legumes research scheme. Initially, only lupins and field peas were leviable under the Act. Faba beans, chick peas, mung beans, pigeon peas and peanuts have since been included. The value per unit of production of the crops added to the scheme, however, varies considerably from that of lupins and field peas. The objective of the proposed amendments to the Grain Legumes Levy Act 1985 contained in this Bill is to provide for a levy determination mechanism for grain legumes leviable under the Act to more closely reflect the price received by the grower for the particular crop grown. It will assist growers of all grain legumes covered by the scheme to reach the target level of 0.5 per cent of gross value of production which the Government considers to be the appropriate minimum level of industry contributions to research. Contributions to that level receive the benefit of full matching contributions by the Commonwealth. The amendment will provide for different rates of levy to be payable on individual leviable grain legumes or groups of leviable grain legumes by way of regulation. The maximum rate for any levy under the scheme will continue to be prescribed in the Act, but is to be increased to $5 per tonne as requested by the growers' organisation. The first grain legume proposed to attract a separate levy rate is peanuts, which for administrative efficiency is prescribed in the legislation in this instance. The rate of $2 per tonne has been the subject of a specific recommendation of the growers' organisation as required by the Levy Act. Also in regard to peanuts, a change to the legislation is necessary to ensure that the levy is applied on an 'in shell' basis, reflecting the fact that a proportion of production is sold in that form. In relation to the financial implications of the Bill, the higher levy rate for peanuts will generate an estimated additional $29,700 in industry contributions to the Grain Legumes Research Trust Fund in the first full levy income year. Provision has been made for the increased Commonwealth matching contribution to commence in the 1990-91 financial year, at the level appropriate to a commencement date for the Act of 1 January 1990. None of the remaining provisions of the Bill have direct financial implications. The Bill also provides for the addition to the scheme, by regulation, of the mung bean species Vigna mungo. The addition is necessary to ensure that all commercially grown species of mung bean are listed and thus leviable. The existing Grain Legume Research Levy Regulations will be made redundant by the legislative amendments proposed and are to be repealed. The Amendments provide express authority for further levy rates to be prescribed by regulation subject to the maximum rate prescribed in the Act. Subject to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill entering into force, .the grain legumes research scheme will continue to be administered by . the Grain Legumes Research Council. It is envisaged that the scheme will be administered in due course as part of the proposed Grains Research and Development Corporation, reflecting the close links between cereal and grain legume crop production. The commencement date of this legislation will be a date to be proclaimed. A commencement date of 1 January 1990 would accord with existing provisions of the Act and ensure that all peanuts harvested in the 1989-90 season attract the higher rate of levy.

189,Mr STAPLES,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill is to implement changes to the operations of the Australian Heritage Commission as agreed by the Government following a comprehensive public review of the Commonwealth Government's role in the conservation of the National Estate. Each of the amendments proposed in the Bill is concerned with one or more of the following matters: clarification and improvement of the Commission's operational procedures; the inclusion of powers for the Commission to administer the national estate grants program; the removal of a subsection unnecessarily discriminating against Aboriginal sites; tQe exemption of authorities of the self-governing Territories and Australian Airlines from the requirements of the Act, in accordance with government policy; and administrative changes to clarify certain operations of the Act and correct some minor technical defects. Before examining the provisions of the Bill in detail, let me first explain the history of, and the principles underlying, the Australian Heritage Commission Act and the reasons why the proposed amendments are considered essential. The Australian Heritage Commission Act was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1975 following a major public reviews conducted during 1973 and 1974 by the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate under the chairmanship of Mr Justice R. M. Hope. The principal recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry was that a commission be established to administer National Estate matters and that its enabling legislation contain provisions obliging all Commonwealth agencies to act so as to ensure maximum possible conservation of all items in the National Estate. The original Act was amended in 1976 following a review by the new Government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. The amendment Act of 1976 reaffirmed the key elements of the original Act as recommended by the Hope Committee. The main amendments related to the removal of specific powers from the Commission to advise the Government on expenditure and grants of financial assistance-the current Bill aims to restore this power; a reduction in the number of commissioners from 19 to seven; a provision to limit the Commission's power to enter Aboriginal places in the Register of the National Estate-the Bill aims to repeal this provision; the removal of permanent head powers from the Chairman of the Commission; and a provision requiring the Commission to seek the approval of the Minister before appointing committees-the Bill aims to remove that limitation. Since 1976 there have been a number of other changes to the Act but these have concerned specific administrative issues such as Public Service reform; they have not affected the fundamental principles of the Act. The Commission thus remains comprised of a part time chairman and up to six part time commissioners with various skills and interests related to the natural, Aboriginal or historic environment. The Commission's main responsibilities can be summarised as: Preparing and maintaining a register of National Estate places; advising the Commonwealth· Minister responsible for the environment on all matters relating to the National Estate; advising other Commonwealth Ministers and government authorities on Commonwealth Government proposals which might affect the National Estate; and developing policies and programs for research, professional training and public information and education. In addition, the Act requires that before a Commonwealth Minister, Department or authority takes any action which might significantly affect the National Estate values of a registered place the Commission is informed of the proposal and given reasonable opportunity to consider it. The Act also requires that no action be taken by a Commonwealth Minister, Department or authority that adversely affects a place in the Register, unless there is 'no feasible and prudent alternative', and if there is no such alternative then all necessary measures must be taken to minimise the effects. These responsibilities - of the Commission, Commonwealth Ministers and agencies have remained unchanged since 1976. However, they were again subject to review in 1978 and 1979-this time by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, chaired by the Hon. John HodgeS, MP. In general, the Committee concluded that the Act and the operating procedures of the Commission were satisfactory and appropriate. All the recommendations of the Hodges Committee for amendments to the Australian Heritage Act will be implemented by this Bill. In June 1985, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, the Hon. Barry Cohen, MP, announced yet another review of the Australian Heritage Commission Act. The purpose was to assess whether, after 10 years, the mechanisms were still adequate and appropriate and to recommend changes where necessary. The Minister invited public submission from all interested parties including State and Territory governments, local government, conservation groups and development groups. Over 150 submissions were received and a two-day seminar held to discuss the review attracted over 100 participants. The report of the review, which also took into account the Hodges Committee report and representations made to the Government on the operations of the Act, was distributed to all interested parties in August 1986, with an invitation for comments before final recommendations were made for amendments to the Act. Honourable members can readily see that the amendments proposed in this Bill have not been lightly arrived at. Since its passage by the Parliament in 1975 the Australian Heritage Commission Act has been the subject of intense public scrutiny and almost constant review by government or the Parliament. This. process has identified a number of desirable changes to the Act to improve the Australian Heritage Commission's efficiency and effectiveness. However, it has also demonstrated beyond doubt the Commission's essential ongoing role in the Commonwealth Government's efforts to conserve and protect the National Estate. The Commission's achievements have been considerable: It has established a substantial database places of National Estate significance. includes over 9,000 places entered in the Register of the National Estate and the interim list of the Register of the National Estate. Using its database, the Commission provides advice on the National Estate to a wide range of Commonwealth Ministers, departments and authorities. In 1988-89 the Commission provided such advice under section 30 of its Act on 336 occasions. In addition, the Commission's expertise on National Estate matters is acknowledged by State and local government and private firms and individuals. The Commission's advice is often sought even though there is no statutory requirement. This occurred 83 times in 1988-89. Educational activities to foster understanding of the National Estate have also been at the forefront of the Commission's priorities. The publication of The Heritage of Australia-The Illustrated Register of the National Estate in 1981 followed by individual State editions for Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory, and Western Australia, have been significant milestones. Film. co-productions such as the The Land of the Lightning Brothers and the highly acclaimed Nature of Australia: Portrait of an Island Continent have added substantially to Australians' awareness of and concern for the National Estate. As the Commonwealth Government's principal advisory body on matters related to the National Estate, the Australian Heri- . tage Commission has often faced a difficult task in carrying out its responsibilities. The Commission has been required to provide the Government with National Estate advice on some highly controversial is-ues-the destruction of the Belle Vue Hotel in Brisbane, the Franklin Dam and the wet tropics of Queensland, to name but a few. Nevertheless, its activities are not limited to such issues. Much of the Commission's most effective work is carried out in collaboration with government and the private sector, out of the public limelight. This often leads to real achievement in the conservation of the National Estate-without controversy, withof out confrontation and without any public This attention or fanfare. This has been recognised by the Government in considering the review of its role in the conservation of the National Estate. While some legitimate concerns have been raised about the Commission's operations, these can be readily addressed through the amendments proposed in this Bill. The fundamental need for the National Estate to be . conserved through the continued operation of the Commission is undeniable. Community and Government support for this proposition has grown even stronger since its initial articulation in the Hope report of 1974. This is not to say that there has not been some misunderstanding of the Commission's role. Indeed, I suspect that this misunderstanding, particularly regarding the effect of having a place listed on the Register of the National Estate, has been deliberately and mischievously fostered by some development interests opposed to Commonwealth Government actions to conserve the National Estate. Of course, this is the nub of the matter. People and organisations opposed to the Government's overall environmental policies often cannot or will not distinguish the basic concept of the Register of the National Estate from decisions made by government on issues involving the National Estate. In fact the Australian Heritage Commission simply identifies the National Estate and advises on National Estate values. It has no power of intervention or proscription. It is the Government which is responsible for deciding about 'feasible and prudent alternatives' to actions affecting National Estate values. It is also incorrect to claim that listing on the Register of the National Estate somehow locks up areas or forecloses options for economic and social development. There are many examples throughout Australia of listed areas being used for economically productive purposes which do not have an unacceptable impact on the heritage values of the area. Calls for greater ministerial control of the Commission or the inclusion of other than National Estate criteria-for example, economic significance-in the registration process are therefore particularly ill-founded. Parliament advisedly gave the Australian Heritage Commission an independent statutory role in registering places of National Estate significance and bringing them to the attention of Commonwealth Ministers and agencies. The judgments required in registration decisions are not and should not be political. They should be objective and backed by expert scientific assessment. Only through such a process can heritage values be considered alongside other values-land use, economic and so on-when government decisions are being taken. Turning now to the specifics of the Bill, clauses 1 and 2 deal with the short title and commencement date. Clause 3 relates to interpretation and raises a number of issues. The definition of 'authority of the Commonwealth' will be amended to remove the authorities or bodies established under the laws of the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island and Australian Airlines from the requirements of the Act. This is in accordance with the Government's policy of treating the self-governing Territories as States in most respects and with its decision to make Australian Airlines more commercially competitive. Terms used in the proposed new part of the Act dealing with the National Estate grants program (NEGP) are also defined. Definitions of the interim list and of the term 'owner' as used in describing those persons that the Commission must inform before publishing a notice of intention to register a place are also included. Clause 4 will insert into the Act specific criteria against which places under consideration for entry in the Register will be measured. This will clarify the definition of the National Estate already included in the Act and will reflect procedures which have been used by the Commission for some time. Clause 5 will reinstate the original wording of paragraph 7 (a) of the Act as originally passed and extend its provisions to allow the Commission to give advice on identification of the National Estate as well as its conservation, improvement and presentation. The reinstatement of subparagraphs concerning advice on expenditure and financial grants will be consistent with the Government's decision to transfer the administration of the National Estate grants program to the Commission. Clause 5 will also insert specific functions in the Act for the Commission to administer the NEGP. Clause 6 makes it clear that the Commission may enter into contracts. The Act has no specific provision for this at present. Subsection 22 (5) of the Act provides for the removal of a place from the register. Clause 7 of the Bill will provide for the removal of part of a place from the register. Clauses 8 to 12 reflect the need recognised in the review for the operational procedures of the Commission to be more 'transparent' to public scrutiny. Hopefully, these changes will help inform people of the Commission's role and avoid some of the misconceptions I noted earlier. The proposed amendments provide detailed procedures for the entry or removal of a place in the Register including the notifying of owners, the provision of location maps and statements of significance, the handling of objections, the appointment of independent assessors by the Minister, and clarification of the operation of the interim list. Although objections to proposed registrations may be submitted on any grounds, the Bill makes it clear that the Commission must give prime consideration to the National Estate significance of places. Clause 8 also provides for the repeal of subsection 23 (5) which currently restricts the Commission's ability to enter Aboriginal sites in the register. This subsection was introduced as an amendment in 1976 to avoid possible conflicts between decisions by the Commission on the registration of land and recommendations by land commissioners on Aboriginal land rights. The subsection is an unnecessary discrimination against Aboriginal sites and, on the experience to date, its removal will not result in the conflicts forecast in 1976. Clause 13 of the Bill will legitimise an existing practice whereby. the Commission is normally given an opportunity to comment on proposed actions by Commonwealth Ministers and agencies that might significantly affect a registered place. The proposed amendment will require the Commission to provide comments as soon as practicable. Clause 14 deals with the National Estate grants program and will transfer· its administration from the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act to the Australian Heritage Commission Act. No major changes are proposed to the nature or administration of the program except a provision for the Minister to make grants to approved bodies directly as well as at present through State and internal Territory governments. Section 39 of the Act includes a requirement that the Commission must obtain the approval of the Minister before entering into a contract involving the payment or receipt of an amount exceeding $50,000. Clause 15 of the Bill will increase the amount to $200,000, reflecting inflation and the growth of the Commission. Clause 16 will permit the Commission to appoint committees without restriction, returning to the original wording of the Act. Clause 17 will correct technical deficiencies in public notices published prior to 20 November 1979. These deficiencies were minor in nature and the Bill will validate the notices which included them. This Bill re-affirms the basic principles underlying the Australian Heritage Commission Act while at the same time introducing a series of improvements to the operational procedures of the Commission. These improvements will clarify the Commission's role, make it more open and more accountable, yet retain its independence as the Commonwealth Government's principal advisory body on the National Estate. Australia is fortunate in having a unique heritage which in large part has not been degraded or destroyed like some other countries. However, this means that we have an even greater responsibility to protect it for future generations. This Bill should be seen as a measure of the Common-. wealth Government's determination to do so. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCGauran) adjourned. HOUSING ASSISTANCE BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Staples, and read a first time. Second Reading",70
190,Mr STAPLES,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Housing Assistance Bill 1989 authorises the Commonwealth to enter into a new 10year housing agreement with the States, the Northern Territory and for the first time, j the Australian Capital Territory, and appropriate moneys for financial assistance to the States and these Territories for housing purposes in 1989-90 and for the years 1990-91 to 1992-93. The Hawke Labor Government was elected in March 1983 with a firm commitment to renegotiate Federal housing arrangements with the States. The key objective of this Government's housing policy platform was to ensure that all Australians had access to adequate and appropriate accommodation 1975 at a price they could afford. The Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA) is the Commonwealth Government's major housing program. It aims to relieve housing-related poverty and to deliver housing assistance equitably to people in different housing tenures. Financial assistance has been provided to the States under a series of such agreements since 1945. In 1984 we introduced legislation for the Housing Assistance Act 1984 and a new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement to take effect from 1 July 1984. That agreement reflected the consensus view of Commonwealth and State housing Ministers of how best to deliver an effective and equitable program of public housing assistance and demonstrated our commitment to a long term public housing strategy. We backed up these changes with massive funding levels. In the five years ended 1988-89, we provided almost $3.4 billion under the CSHA, more than double the $1.6 billion provided in the last five years of the previous Government. Our initiatives have allowed us to boost the stock of public housing dwellings considerably, from 245,000 at 30 June 1983 to 316,000 at 30 June 1988, an increase of almost 30 per cent. While public housing accommodates about 5 per cent of all Australian households, it is targeted to those most in need in our society. At 30 June 1987 almost 70 per cent of public housing tenants were on pensions or benefits representing 26 per cent of the total number of pensioners and beneficiaries who rent. Almost one in four families with children who rent live in public rental dwellings. These figures show that our targeting of public housing assistanceand the level of funding provided have made a major impact on housing related poverty in this country. But pressure on public housing has continued to grow and there is an ongoing need to ensure that our programs remain well targeted and effective. Against this background, we undertook a major review of the existing policies and practices under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement with the aim of identifying improved strategies for the future. This review found that the viability of the CSHA was under threat and that unless action were taken by the Commonwealth, there would be a significant diminution of States' public housing effort in future years. This was because States had been using commercial borrowings to meet their matching requirements and the resulting debt servicing obligation, combined with a growing rent rebate bill, had been eroding their capacity to fund new public housing. The review concluded that significant changes should be made to the current arrangements for financing, targeting and administering public housing. The review recommended a number of specific changes to CSHA provisions for funding, including changes to matching and the use of funds. These recommendations were designed to put the provision of public housing on a more secure long term financial basis, and to ensure States make a greater financial contribution to the provision of public housing. Following consideration of these recommendations, we put forward a proposal to the States for a new CSHA at the May 1989 Premiers Conference. After detailed negotiations with States, a new agreement was developed which forms part of this Bill. The new agreement will represent the most significant reform of public housing since the CSHA was first introduced by the Chifley Government in 1945. At the same time, the principles introduced by this Government in the 1984 agreement remain valid. These are to alleviate housing-related poverty and to ensure that housing assistance is, as far as possible, delivered equitably to persons resident in different forms of housing. Under the new agreement it is proposed that in each of the 10 years from 1 July 1989, Commonwealth financial assistance to the States under the. CSHA will be provided entirely in the form of grants, rather than as a mix of grants and concessional Loan Council moneys. Half of the States' matching effort will also be required to be met with grants. This will result in a major increase in real State effort and will ensure that States' ability to finance public rental housing will no longer be constrained by a burgeoning debt servicing obligation. In the five years ended 1988-89, State contributions made in the form of grants were only about one-tenth of the value of Commonwealth grant contributions. States have also agreed to absorb any future losses on their rental operations. From now on the great bulk of Commonwealth and State matching funds will be used for the direct provision of public rental dwellings. Based on 1989-90 funding levels we expect that the impact of these new arrangements will allow around 52,000 net additions to the public dwelling stock over the next five years. At the same time around 650,000 people will be able to be offered public rental housing, an increase of around 20 per cent on the past five years. This public housing effort will allow a greater focus on those in greatest housing very low income earners and social security recipients for whom home ownership is not an option. Prior to this agreement, a large proportion of Commonwealth funds was being provided through Loan Council borrowing arrangein ments. While adding to overall funds, Loan Council arrangements distorted the allocato tion of funds among States, so that the funds were not sufficiently targeted to areas highest need. For example, the Northern Territory received about half the level of funds received by New South Wales, in of the vast difference in population. This anomaly will be rectified under the new agreement. All funds will not be provided grants and their distribution among States will move to a per capita basis. This will be a major step in directing assistance to where that assistance is needed. The phasing in the per capital distribution over three years will allow States time to adjust their tions. The new agreement demonstrates our commitment to improving access to home this ownership for low income earners. States inefficient will continue to be able to draw on funds retained from past allocations to finance their general home purchase assistance programs. The net level of these funds is currently of the order of $360m. States are encouraged under the agreement to gear up these funds with private sector funds, to boost ance available. States' capacity to draw in private sector funds will also be expanded considerably as a result of our decision to clearly exempt such raisings from Loan people Council borrowing limits. This removes any uncertainty which existed in the past. A proportion of new CSHA funds also will be directed to home purchase programs from 1989-90 onwards and these will be geted to existing public tenants and applipeople cants on the waiting list. In addition States are able to meet the other half of their matching obligation with home purchase asconsulting sistance loans and this will add a further incentive for them to expand their programs. These changes will encourage a far more efficient use of funds than in the past and will allow States to considerably expand their home ownership lending programs by implementing innovative schemes to closely meet needthe needs of low income home buyers. Over the next five years we expect that around 200,000 low and middle income home buyers will receive home purchase loans under CSHA programs. This is a substantial increase on the 68,000 home loans provided the five years ended June 1988. Because repayments on CSHA home loans are linked income, this initiative will significantly boost access to affordable home ownership of for lower income earners. Assistance under the agreement is well targeted, and priority in granting assistance is determined by need. spite However, a key change will be made to existing administrative arrangements to ensure that we continue to meet these objecas tives, and improve our linking of public housing with other assistance programs. In the past States have been able to use general agreement funds without any referof ence to specific Commonwealth priorities or objectives. A new system of priority setting operawill be implemented unqer the agreement through the establishment of a joint Commonwealth-State planning process. Through process we are aiming to ensure, without duplication of administration, that the provision of public housing assistance remains in accord with the principles of the CSHA and responsive to the needs of people. It will focus on improving equality of access to appropriate accommodation and will ensure better coordination of public housing the assistprovision with other programs. It is envisaged that the development of Commonwealth-State plans will ensure that· the priorities of all groups, including youth, with disabilities, Aboriginals and the aged are met under public housing arrangements. There is a range of Commonwealth programs which need to be linked to public housing provision-for example, programs tarcovering accommodation for the aged and with disabilities-and the joint planning process will ensure this occurs. As part of the joint planning process we will be with community groups, to ensure a full range of views on public housing is taken into account. There is an increasing awareness in the community of consumer protection issues to uphold the dignity, independence and freedom of the individual, to preserve people's rights and to provide protection of those rights. The new agreement provides that information will be made available to clients about housing assistance and policies. In addition, independent appeal mechanisms are to be established in each State by September 1990. These initiatives link with our user rights strategies for service provision in the areas of aged care, supported accommodation and home care. The position of clients is to be further enhanced under the new agreement. The Commonwealth and States are to examine the issues of increasing choice of housing between public rental and home purchase assistance, portability of eligibility for assistance between States and improved maintenance arrangements. This Government has backed up the new arrangements with funds. In 1989-90, for the first time, over $1 billion will be made a vailable in grants under the agreement. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Government will guarantee at least this level-$1.028 billionfor each of the three years 1990-91 to 199293. Total funding for those years will be determined annually in the Budget context. This $4 billion guarantee is unprecedented and shows this Government's determination to deliver on its social justice commitments in housing. The Bill also provides for two further appropriations in 1989-90-$9.8m will be appropriated for specific grants to the States and the Northern Territory for housing assistance for young people. These funds form part of our social justice package for young Australians which is part of the response to the problems highlighted in the Burdekin report on youth homelessness. The funds will be used to provide accommodation linked to support services for homeless young people. This will help them become more independent and guide them to longer term stable accommodation. An amount of $14.7m will also be appropriated to provide additional mortgage relief . funds. These funds will be provided to the States and the Northern Territory to assist low and moderate income earners who are experiencing difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments. These funds were earmarked in the Budget and are additional to those already provided through the mortgage and rent relief scheme. The Commonwealth Government is committed to housing access, and to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. The structural reforms embodied in the new agreement together with the substantial increase in funding and forward commitment for future years will significantly enhance our public housing effort. Based on current funding, over the next five years we expect to see around 650,000 people offered public rental dwellings, 52,000 additions to the public rental stock and around 200,000 home loans provided to low and moderate income families. I believe that we will be able to make significant inroads in alleviating housing related poverty in 1989-90 and over the 10 years of the agreement. We will also see improved public housing effort by all parties to the agreement, better targeting of assistance to high need areas, improved choice of assistance and more open, accessible and responsive administration. I commend the Bill to the House. I now present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCGauran) adjourned. NA 1989 Bill presented by Mr Staples, and read a first time. Second Reading",74
191,Mr STAPLES,MARINE NAVIGATION LEVY BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to alter the basis of calculating the method of charging commercial shipowners for the navigational services provided to them by the Commonwealth. The Bill will also transfer the authority to raise the necessary revenue from the Lighthouses Act 1911 to a levy Act and its associated collection Act. This will remove any doubt that may exist as to the constitutional validity of light dues as a method of cost recovery. Since 1915, the Commonwealth has operated an extensive network of marine navigational aids around the coast of Australia to facilitate the safe and economic navigation of vessels engaged in trade and commerce .. This network, which presently numbers some 387 navigational aids, costing about $39m per year, is fully financed by light paid by commercial shipping engaged on both overseas and coastal trading. The rate of light dues is 53c per Inet registered tonne of the vessel per quarter. The rate is the same regardless of the flag of the vessel or the trade engaged upon. Through the efficient rationalisation of the system and the effective use of modern technology, the rate of light dues has not been increased since October 1983. This represents a considerable reduction in real costs to the shipping indusbut try. It has been achieved despite some signifreduced icant investment in recent years, including Hydrographers Passage in the Great Barrier Reef and on the north-west coast of Australia. These investments have been primarily for the benefit of the bulk export trade in those areas. The commercial shipping industry is closely consulted on all matters relating to the operations of the navigational aids network through the Maritime Services Advisory Committee on Navigational Safety. There are representatives of both foreign and Australian flag shipowners on this Committee. In recent years, the increasing complexity and variety of navigational services and aids provided to ships, and the increasing disparity between the ships themselves and .the trades on which they are engaged, have thrown considerable doubt on the validity of the traditional charging methods. Two years ago, therefore, the Government initiated an examination of the basis of charging light dues. The new rates of levy contained in the levy Bill now before the House result from that examination. Although various alternative methods of charging were considered, no practicable method of charging in terms of cargo values or use of individual aids was discovered. A levy based on the net tonnage of a ship was found to be the fairest of the practicable methods. It was considered that some variation in the formula for setting dues might be feasible and consultations were started immediately with the shipping industry. It was also decided that the existing exemptions for naval vessels, fishing craft and private yachts should continue. During the extensive consultations with industry groups, a wide variety of options was considered. As would be expected with such a diverse. range of interdues ests, it proved impossible to reach a full consensus on the most appropriate formula to apply. Nevertheless, in June this year, as part of the overall reforms of maritime and waterfront activities, the Government was able to announce the new formula preferred by a clear majority of industry representatives. Under the new formula, the rate per net tonne is reduced as the ship's tonnage increases. Smaller vessels will pay slightly more the large vessels will pay significantly amounts each year. This will be of in particular benefit to the larger bulk ore carriers which carry, i in terms of tonnage, the greater part of our exports. The new levy is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 33 to 63c per net registered tonne compared with the present 53c per tonne and will continue to be paid each quarter. To illustrate, a small coastal vessel of 200 tonnes will pay some $20 per quarter more; a vessel of 25,000 tonnes will pay the same as now; and a 72,000 tonne vessel will pay some $6,900 per quarter less. These represent significant on-going savings to the large bulk carriers serving our export trades. The levy Bill imposes the levy in accordance with the formula I referred to earlier. It also allows the rate of levy to be varied by regulation. However, to prevent the levy being increased by regulation to a level beyond that represented by reasonable cost increases, a ceiling of 15 per cent per annum has been imposed. To summarise, Mr Speaker, this Bill and its associated collection Bill bring up to date the method of charging for the provision by the Commonwealth of navigation aids and related navigational services. While I cannot say that every sector of the shipping community agrees wholeheartedly with the formula arrived at, I can say that it represents the best compromise that could be reached. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.

Miles, C. G. 1989) Millar, P. C. Moore, J. C. Second Reading Debate resumed, Prosser, G. D. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Cowan)Reith, P. K. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I Rocher, A. C. Ruddock, P. M. remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this Bill and orders of the day Nos, 2 and 3, Sinclair, I. MCC. Mr MILDREN (Ballarat) (6,22)-1 will Spender, J. M. not take up too much time of the House, I Taylor, W. L. Webster, A. P. know that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) wishes to speak, but there are Woods, R. L. Wooldridge, M. R. L. a couple of points that I want to conclude with, As I indicated, it is of extreme imporNOES tance to the industry that there be maximum Jones, Barry Kelly, R. J. label integrity with regard to bottled wines, and any of our wines, if the export industry that we have been developing is to be sustained and improved upon. As 1 indicated before the suspension of the sitting for lunch, we wish to do everything that is possible to increase the quality of the wines, and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill seeks to do just that with the label integrity program and also with the compliance monitoring which is extremely important. It is of interest to note that very recently a very large batch of chardonnay was analysed for three different illegal additives. It is of great interest to us, and we be very relieved to know, that the report on that batch gave it a completely clean bill of health. As some other members have done, 1 will make a comment about the wine drinking habits of Australians. Taken in moderation, wine, like all alcoholic beverages, is socially acceptable in Australia. Of course, it is a problem if people abuse it because they place in jeopardy not only their own lives but also the lives of other people. We have seen the catastrophes that have occurred on Australian roads in recent times. So much of that has been attributed to the misuse of alcohol. I am sure that the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation is as concerned as most of us that the reputation of the industry as a responsible industry should be enhanced. Therefore, it will try to encourage people through an education program to ensure that their drinking habits are socially responsible. These Bills are extremely importarit for the industry. They are important for the continued development of a: very worthwhile export industry and one which has finally been able to gain a real niche in the market. (Quorum formed) 1 must say that that was a pretty childish attempt by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). It does not reflect very well on him, especially as 1 was concluding anyway. Once again, 1 recommend these Bills to the House. They deserve the wholehearted support of everybody. So far the debate has focused on the merits of the legislation because it has the wholehearted support of the industry. 1 simply conclude by saying that the industry will benefit from the Bills and 1 support them.",80
196,Mr DOWNER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"1 join other speakers in this debate in supporting the Grape Research Levy Amendment Bill, the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill. 1I have noticed throughout the debate that honourable members who have wineries and grape growers in their electorates have continually referred to the issue of whether the wineries in their electorates are the best in Australia. My friend the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) resisted the temptation of saying that. As the wineries in his electorate are very close to the wineries in my electorate, 1 can shall not resist that temptation. The wineries in the Southern Vales and at Langhorne Creek and the new developing wineries in the Adelaide Hills are certainly the best wineries in Australia. Some magnificent wines are produced in my electorate and I am proud to represent the wine industry in that part of Australia. As others have said in this debate, these Bills restructure the levy for the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, and in doing so will no doubt increase the amount of revenue that the Corporation is able to obtain from the industry for the rUlming of its various functions. They also change the labelling regulations in order to improve the integrity of labelling within the Australian wine industry. Members of the House have strongly supported these propositions. We obviously want to see the integrity of the AustraliaR wine industry enhanced as much as possible. Many people in the industry have been concerned about scandals that have broken out both in Australia, and in particular outside Australia, which have affected the integrity of the industry. 1 recall at one stage a scandal relating to the Austrian wine industry which had some impact on sales from Australia because of the similarity of the names in English. 1 think that points to the importance of ensuring that our industry has a strong reputation for a high level of integrity. It does have that reputation but improved labelling and a tightening up of regulations in regard to labelling will certainly help to build that reputation. Others before me have said that the Wine and Brandy Corporation plays an important part in the process in particular of marketing Australian wines overseas and also administering some aspects of the industry in Australia. There is no doubt that the Corporation has come a very long way from the position of its predecessor in the 1960s when I used to live in the United Kingdom. The predecessor of the Corporation had a wine shop in Frith Street in Soho and that was about the only contribution it made to the export of Australian wines. Mr Hand-What were you doing in Soho?",82
197,Mr DOWNER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs wonders what I was doing in Soho. In the 1960s I was only a young teenager, so I was not too much in Soho. But, of course, that is digressing from the central thrust of the debate. The point is that the predecessor of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation had its shop in Soho and many Australians were anxious to ensure that our industry was properly promoted. Probably in that location it was not. The sale of wine such as Kanga Rouge and the like certainly did not do anything. to enhance the reputation of the Australian wine industry. In those days there was also a practice of exporting only the unwanted product rather than our best products and, therefore, building up a strong market. Obviously that strategy failed. The strategy is the reverse now and it is certainly turning out to be a very successful one in the Corporation. But, of course, above all, the industry deserves a great deal of support and commendation from this Parliament for the work that it has done. The wine industry has faced a large number of vicissitudes over recent years and some of those vicissitudes have been induced by the Government. I can remember very well back in the time of the 1983 Federal election campaign when the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) came to what is now part of my electorate, but which was then part of the marginal electorate of Kingston, to the town of MCLaren Vale. In MCLaren Vale the present Minister made a speech on behalf of the Australian Labor Party saying that no wine tax would be imposed by the Labor Party. This sentiment was warmly endorsed by the then Labor candidate for Kingston, the present honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney), and it was not long before the 10 per cent wine tax was first introduced, despite this promise that was made to the electors of MCLaren Vale who, I am glad to say, did not fall for this promise then and have not fallen for any promises from the Labor Party since and probably never will. Nevertheless, it was a cynical exercise, a commitment overturned within weeks or months of its being made, and the wine tax was not only introduced at 10 per cent but subsequently increased to 20 per cent. At the time that caused a great deal of concern in the industry. Even today there is no doubt that the imposition of a wine tax has affected the relative competitiveness of the industry as against, for example, beer. But, as the industry well recognises now, the wine tax is here to stay and I guess that the debate on the wine tax is a debate of yesterday. It is important to remember that a commitment was once made in an election campaign, in what is now my electorate, and that commitment was soon overturned. That is an example of the sort of government-induced vicissitudes that the wine industry has had to put up with. Another was the introduction by the present Government of its much lauded vine pull scheme. This was introduced at a time when prices were not particularly buoyant in the industry and the growers were enduring a great deal of difficulty, so the Government decided that it would spend taxpayers' money to induce those growers to rip out their vines. No sooner had they ripped out their vines than the industry went through an upturn and, of course, there were not enough grapes and the price of grapes very rapidly rose. So the vine pull scheme was a good example of government intervention in a market, which caused precisely the wrong effect. We needed increased production to help meet growing new markets, in particular overseas, and at the time the Government was paying taxpayers' money to people to pull out the vines. It really was a very curious scheme and it has had some long term consequences in some parts of the Southern Vales of South Australia. After enduring those vicissitudes there is no doubt that, in recent years, the wine industry has done substantially better. I think everyone would agree that the export market has been the key to that improvement in the performance of the industry. In 1986-87 and 1987-88 exports from the wine industry, in volume terms, grew by about 30 per cent per annum and, in value terms, exports have grown over those two years by around 120 per cent, which really is a magnificent record for the industry. Things were not so good in 1988-89, but still the value of the exports improved by 15 per cent and, in volume, by 3 per cent. As others have said in this debate, we now have an industry which exports $1l3.3m worth of \\fine and there is no question that that makes a contribution to the balance of payments. We now export one per cent of the world's wine export market. While that figure of one per cent does not sound particularly sensational, we have a right to be proud of the way our wine industry has got into those export markets and has successfully obtained a market niche. When we go to countries such as the United States of America, or to different parts' of Europe-I suppose that one could say in particular Sweden-or to Japan, there is no question that Australian wine is increasingly highly regarded and we have to ensure that it remains so. There is no doubt that this package of legislation will make a contribution to that. I note with some interest that the amount of assistance that the Government gives to the wine through Austrade-if we disregard the sort of negative assistance that was once provided through things like the vine pull scheme-is about $100,000 a year. This is $100,000 worth of assistance to an industry with export earnings of $113m. I am not a big supporter of the Government giving assistance to different industries and I am not here today calling for massive increases in government assistance to help the wine industry and export markets; I do not think that is the way to go at all. But it is interesting just to make a comparison here. The Government gives $100,000 worth of assistance to the wine industry, which has total exports of $113m, whereas, by contrast, Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, which has exports of $175m, has been blessed by the Government with $12m a year for three years. I assume from that that the Government's priority is for cameras and films rather than for the Australian wine industry. It seems to me that that represents a very curious set of priorities on the part of the Government. As I have said, I would rather the Government did not provide assistance to Kodak and I do not think there is a great case for the Government to pour money into promoting Australian wine exports because the industry, through the operation of the Corporation and this levy, is able to do that job quite adequately without the so-called assistance of government. But, if the Government thinks that cameras and films are more important than the wine industry and the employment that goes with it, it has a very strange set of priorities. Of course, at the domestic level the wine industry has not had anything like the glamorous record that it has had in export markets over recent years. For example, in 198889, wine sales fell by 6.9 per cent and the bulk of the burden of that decline in wine sales has fallen on the cask wine sector-the sector which is particularly prominent in my State of South Australia, although I would have to say not in my own electorate. It is interesting to note that the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation points to the imposition of the wine tax as being one of the factors which have affected the domestic market and I have alluded to that already. But one of the other factors is the change in the beer excise arrangements which were introduced by the Government in the 1988-89 Budget. The brewing industry has always argued that it should be on a level playing field with the wine industry and I am sympathetic to that; I think we should have a level playing field in our economy, including the area of beverages, be they alcoholic or non-alcoholic. But the fact is that the beer industry has always argued that, because there was no sales tax, the wine industry has done particularly well. The sales tax has been introduced and, suddenly, we saw that the beer excise was slashed in a desperate bid by the Government to try to win back what is sometimes described as its traditional support, although I suspect that the way things are going today there is no longer such a thing as traditional support for the Labor Party. One of the consequences of the slashing of the beer excise has been that increasingly people have moved from purchasing casks to purchasing light beer. Clearly, the level playing field is not as level as it used to be. Before the changes to the beer excise, wine had a relative 12 per cent discount compared with beer and now wine has a relative 9 per cent premium compared with beer. That means the playing field is one which favours beer as distinct from wine. I suppose that reflects the political priorities of the Government. It takes the view, which mayor may not be right, that Labor voters are more likely to favour the drinking of beer than the drinking of wine and that Liberal voters are more likely to favour the drinking of wine than the drinking of beer. That seems a fairly curious hypothesis, but that seems to be the principle on which it is working. Therefore, it stings the wine drinkers and favours the beer drinkers. What we need is a level playing field, not a playing field which favours one as against the other simply for party political purposes, particularly as a response to the debacles of the Port Adelaide and Adelaide by-elections. Other factors are affecting the wine industry. There is no doubt that the pilots strike is having some impact at the top end of the market in the wine industry. This was referred to by Wolf Blass, a distinguished South Australian vigneron, in his recent annual report. He pointed out that the restaurant trade has inevitably suffered because of the pilots strike. That can be seen in my electorate and throughout Adelaide. Obviously the effects on the restaurant trade flow through to the wine industry. Wine sales are down as a consequence of the pilots strike. It is important to make that point to those people who do not think that the pilots strike is having any effect, that it does not matter very much, or, even more alarmingly, that apparenUy it is over. They need to be reminded that the wine industry is an example of an industry which is directly affected by that dispute. I make no apology for referring to it as a dispute. Other costs are clearly affecting the wine market. The high price of the Australian dollar, which is propped up artificially by the Government's high interest rate strategy, makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper. If exports are more expensive it is unlikely that all our balance of payments problems will be resolved. I would have thought that that is a fairly logical and rational way of looking at things. Obviously it will have some impact on the capacity of the wine industry to maintain the growth that it has managed to obtain in export markets. The latest figures seem to support that. Some people in the wine industry say that wine prices for Australian exported wine are such that export markets must inevitably come to an end. It will be sad if that happens. One of the reasons it has the potential to happen is the high level of interest rates. Because of consumer demand overseas for Australian wine-I do not know that I feel too badly about this-grape prices have been forced up. This year they are expected to increase by 35 per cent. I am glad about that in this respect: many grape growers in my electorate will do very well out of it. I know many of them extremely well. They have been through some very hard times and at last they are going through significantly easier times because of the increasing grape prices. One of the reasons grape prices have increased so much is a shortage of stock. One of the reasons there is a shortage of stock is the extraordinary vine pull scheme. The Government decided that it would provide an incentive to rip vines out of the ground. As a consequence, we have a - ack of supply at a time when there is a fairly buoyant market. It just shows that; if governments keep out of markets instead of continually trying to second guess the way markets operate, we might end up with an economy that runs more smoothly. I do not say that out of any disrespect for those in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy who are responsible for these matters. I know that some very able people work in that part of the Department. But there is no doubt that it is better to let the industry take its own course than be interfered with by government action. Turning to the taxation arrangements for the wine industry, I refer to stock valuation and the depreciation of oak casks. Some time ago there was a significant debate about stock valuation. We on this side of the House-I refer particularly to me and my South Australian colleagues-put together a submission to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) asking him to reconsider the stock valuation situation. The Government was most derisory about that, I suppose because the proposal had come from the Liberal Party. What we wanted to do, again, was make sure that there was a level playing field so the wine industry was able to obtain the same depreciation advantages as other industries in Australia. There was a fairly heated debate about that. For one reason or another that debate has died down and the industry has looked more to obtaining some greater degree of depreciation for oak casks as an option to ensure that its costs are properly recognised in the taxation system. Until now the depreciation rates on oak casks have allowed depreciation over a period of 10 years. I note, because I do not think that this is known very widely, that the Australian Taxation office has now agreed to a 25 per cent per annum depreciation of oak casks. Clearly, this will be of significant benefit to the wine industry. We have been able to obtain those improved tax arrangements for the wine industry because South Australian Liberal members of both Houses of this Parliament, as well as the shadow Minister for primary industry-the honourable member . for Murray and Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr L1oyd)-have gone out and fought for a better taxation deal for the wine industry. We have not gone out and argued for special exemptions and deals which would apply only to the wine industry and which would bias the market towards the wine industry. We have gone out and argued for a level playing field. We have argued for the wine industry to have a fair go in terms of the taxation system. It is because we have made that and promoted it as a political issue that finally the Australian Taxation Office has been forced to review the whole question of the taxation of the wine industry and has taken the very constructive initiative of changing the depreciation rates on oak casks. Our wine industry is a great Australian industry of which we all have a right to be proud. I am particularly proud of the wineries and grape growers in my electorate who have done such a magnificent job for that part of South Australia. I am particularly proud of what my State has done as the wine capital of Australia. I hope that these measures, which are supported by both sides of the House, will enhance the prospects of the wine industry in the years ahead.",83

207,Mr REITH,NOES,"I am able to announce on behalf of the Opposition that we will be supporting these education Bills, I am able to do that because we have an Economic Action Plan, We have a very clear set of policy commitments in respect of education, What a contrast that is to the chaos and confusion on the other side of the House in respect of economic policy, The Government is incapable of making a clear statement on its ability to address Australia's economic problems, If ever a plan ignited the blowtorch to the soft underbelly of our opponents, it was certainly the Economic PAIRS Action Plan announced recently by the  behalf of the Opposition, This week we have had the extraordinary spectacle of the Government in chaos. We had a pathetic performance from the Treasurer (Mr Keating), That was symbolic of the problems announced by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) this. week, when he let loose the Government's plans for the forthcoming election. The. Opposition has policy positions in spect of higher education, technical and further education (TAFE) and schools. I take this opportunity in this wide ranging debate on education to canvass some of those issues. These Bills provide funding on an annual basis and supplementation for those three sectors. In this debate, I am pleased to have the support of a number of Opposition members: the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who has particular concerns as a representative of the Gold Coast area, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who has a particular interest in education and who will be speaking in this debate, and the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who has a particular interest in Aboriginal affairs issues, just to mention a few. Whilst I will be speaking mainly on schools and higher education, let me say that we support the T AFE legislation. The Commonwealth has a limited role in technical and further education and a limited role in recurrent funding, in the order of 8 per cent. It has a greater role in capital funding, two-thirds of capital requirements. J am pleased to say that the Opposition supports the continued provision of Commonwealth funds for T AFE and principlesupplementation. We will maintain, in real terms,' Commonwealth financial assistance for T AFE, that is, the total of present recurrent, plus present capital, assistance. We have a detailed policy position on T AFE. I am looking forward to the implementation of that policy in its entirety. The Opposition is pleased to see the Government making some moves in respect of student assistance, belated though they may be, to reduce fraud in student assistance schemes. In fact, the Opposition has been on the Government's back about this matter for a number of years. When I held the shadow Attorney-General's portfolio, we were very concerned about what we believed to be the widespread occurrence of fraud against the Commonwealth. We have had some action from the Commonwealth in this area with a committee to review fraud, but it is our view that this whole issue ought to be taken further, that the Government ought to be more precise and more determined in pursuing fraud. I think it is common ground that there re- is something of a culture amongst the student population with respect to fraud. Obviously, that needs to be addressed. I think it was Mark Twain who once said, 'You can be on the right track but if you happen to be stationary you will still be run over by the next train'. Whilst this measure is on the right track, going in the right direction, we say that it is one of those issues where we could be moving-and the Government should be moving-at a faster pace. In dealing with the issue, we have, not just sat back and made generalised calls for action on the Government's part. I refer to my earlier interest in this issue. In 1987, under a Federal freedom of information application, we extracted from the Government a report by Price Waterhouse on fraud. One of the interesting things about that report is that it said-in a sense, not surprisingly-that if you are going to address this problem, the first thing you should do is look to, and make some calculation about, the total level of fraud. If you do not know how prevalent the problem is,· it is a bit hard to know how about many dollars, how much in the way of resources, you should pour into combat the problem. That has not been resolved to our satisfaction. We believe that that is one of a number of steps that should be taken. In July this year I announced, on behalf of the coalition, a five-point plan to achieve some savings in this area. We press that on the Government. In fact, it was just one small but important feature of the Leader of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, a comprehensive document which addresses Australia's economic problems. The Economic Action Plan has five points: firstly, the adoption of the Price Waterhouse recommendation to quantify the level of fraud; secondly, administrative arrangements for vetting Austudy applications tightened; thirdly, the adoption of a system to check all Austudy recipients on a regular basis; fourthly, the Government should, as a matter of' policy, give high priority to fraud investigation, prosecution and recovery action; and, finally, the Auditor-General should be requested to undertake a thorough audit of Austudy. We are pleased to support the measures proposed in the legislative package, but would prefer to see the Government have the sense to adopt our five-point plan. It interesting that there has been a lot of dement. bate about this Economic Action Plan. Of course, the Government attempted to attack it and put out a list of what the coalition proposed and what the Department of Fidiscussion nance thought was a fair thing. If one looks at our proposals in respect of fraud, one can see that we would save $30m by tightening up in that area, and we had the endorsement of the Department of Finance. We thank It the Department for giving us that endorseAs ment. It shows that more should be done, and we urge that on the Government. I turn now to the question of overseas 1992. students. The coalition supports the introduction of full fees for overseas students. However, we draw attention to the anomaly that exists whereby qualified students overseas can come to Australia and buy education but, by contrast, an Australian student cannot do the same thing. There is an unmet demand. No-one is sure of the exact figure but there are many Australian students-about 14,000, 20,000 or a figure that order-who are qualified to go to uniment, versity but are denied a place. What a strange anomaly it is that we as a society and community say, 'Well, if you .. come from overseas and you are prepared to pay we will find you a place-no problem.' In fact, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) supports that and encourages it-and so do we, I might add; this country. there are no problems about that. However, when it comes to our students-people who are born and bred in this country and have a stake in the future of this countryport the Government says no. Of course, it is purely political, ideological reasons, and condemn the Government for adopting that policy position. I will pick up one other issue in respect of overseas students, and it is something that we have raised with the Department. I refer to the proposal to extend the overseas dent charge to primary school students. We asked a question as to how that would affect the children of diplomatic and other overseas personnel in Australia, but we have not yet heard a complete response. I do not think it is a party political debate between the coawe lition and the Government: it is a matter that should be looked at, and we look foris ward to hearing a response from the GovernI turn now to schools policy, a critical area for debate and a critical policy area which I think will be the subject of a lot of between now and the next election as people look to make a choice between the political parties. We on this side of the House have a very clear policy commitment. I have a copy of the policy here. spells out our position in black and white. I say, that allows me to respond to this legislation. It is in contrast to the Government's position on funding for schools postAn options paper has been circulated. I am always happy to support consultative mechanisms but we await the production of from the post-1992 funding policy from the an Government. We wait to see whether the gathering clouds of the blunder from the Minister for Social Security earlier this week will come across the top of the policy to threaten the Government's expenditure comof mitments. We have a watertight commitat a minimum, to maintain funding to schools. We guarantee that no school or a school system, government or non-government, will be worse off on a per capita basis than currently. We support the concept of the partnership between the government and non-government school authorities in providing quality education for young people in We have an equally firm commitment to ensure that every Australian child receives a who reasonable measure of Commonwealth suptowards his or her education and to for ensure that parents have real freedom of we choice about which school will be best for their children. To that end we propose a new recurrent funding regime for nongovernment schools. We will reduce the current 12 categories of funding to four categories with a basic per capita grant of 20 per stucent of the cost of a government school place. That figure will be calculated in an open and public way so that people know what we base our funding commitment upon. The basic minimum level will be 20 per cent. We say that people who exercise freedom of choice to send.. their children to a nongovernment school ought to be able to look to government and to say, 'We would like just a small portion of our taxes back to support that freedom of choice to send our children to the school of our choice'. We say that 20 per cent is a fair figure. That figure takes us back to where we were in approximately 1983. We see that as a fundamental commitment in contrast to the backsliding that we, get from the Government on this issue. It is a firm, clear commitment so that people know where they stand and so that they can be satisfied and sure that there will be no backing off from that commitment. Our commitment is to provide funding of 20 per cent, rising for the three other categories to 30 per cent, 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the cost of a government school place, depending upon the existing categorisation. By having that funding regime we have a system which addresses this whole problem of supplementation. With our system the Government's funding commitment has a clear nexus to the cost of running a government school place. With that system and with changes that will be seen throughout the economy and reflected in the costs of running a government school, people in non-government schools can be certain that they will not have their funding allocation from governments eroded. In addition to having this nice, clear, firm commitment about recurrent funding, we will address one of the other major issues in respect of schools policy: we will abolish Labor's new schools policy. It is a policy of containment. It is not just about new schools. The wording in this policy is a great way to mislead people as to what it is all about. The Government calls it a new schools policy but an old school can be a new school, just to give you the flavour of it, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is a policy which restricts growth of the non-government schools sector. It places a ceiling, a cap, on the growth of nongovernment school enrolments. We say that that is wrong as a matter of principle and we will abolish it. It is an area of some embarrassment for the Government in that it has this policy commitment but every now and then we find that, when it does not suit the Government, it just dumps it. We support non-government schools-for example, Alphington Grammar School in Melbourne. Under the Opposition's policy there is no question about a permit. Under Labor's new schools policy people have to come to Canberra for a permit. We should abolish that system. Looking at how the Government operates, we find that Alphington Grammar, a Greek community school, wanted a permit from this crowd. Interestingly, the school did not comply with the Government's criteria, so a bit of political pressure was applied and, suddenly, it was back in with the permit. It still has funding problems, but that is another issue. Those Government members who argue the benefits of the new schools policy might like also to argue the justification of its dumping for the purest political reasons, as has been evidenced on a number of occa,sions in Victoria. Turning to higher education, another great plus in the Peacock Economic Action Plan was the commitment made by the coalition to support the expansion of higher education and to undertake to match the Government's funding for higher education as projected to the end of 1992. However, I draw the attention of the House to the alarming and disruptive activities in which the Government has engaged in in higher education. I pick just two areas: fees, about which I will say something in detail; and amalgamations in particular, which are being driven by the end of the binary system. Fees are important. If one looks at higher education and asks what is the critical issue, it is the use by the Federal Government of the power of the purse strings. No government· in the history of our Federation has had such a manic determination to place itself in control of higher education as has this Government. We condemn the Government for that policy and we proffer a series of constructive proposals to do something about the Government's intention to bring unto itself much greater control of universities. The policy is to be condemned. The Government has attacked the autonomy and independence of our universities, and we think that step ought to be prevented. We believe it is important that policies be put in place which will store the financial autonomy and independsay ence of the higher education institutions. On the question of fees, there is no doubt whatsoever that the higher education contriof entry. bution (HEC) scheme is an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare for institutions and government departments and will be millstone around the neck of generations students if it is allowed to continue. It most unwieldy method of collecting fees students. It is a classic Labor way of running the show; it is all centralised; the whole is under its thumb. The Australian Taxation Office is running it, and it has dents who require to make their contribution over a long period. We should look at some of the major deficiencies of the as against the coalition's proposals. Under 'the HEC scheme the students pay more. Those who seek to defer payment are penterjecting. alised by having to pay in 1988 some $1,800 compared with $1,530; that is, 15 per cent more. The fee is more than $1,800 if addicontribution tional units are undertaken. There is a disrata incentive to work after graduation. If the salary threshold is not reached, one will never have to pay. There is a disproportionate disnium. incentive for part time students who are already in employment and who are earning more than $22,000 when they commence viability. study. Only postgraduates and teachers doing advanced courses are eligible for exemptions, and the money goes into a higher education trust fund rather than directly to the instiposition tutions, which raises the whole question of financial autonomy and is, we believe, one of the major areas of concern. We have had these trust funds before. They are not new to Federal governments. We have trust funds for road moneys, for example, and for years governments have been telling people that the increased collected at the petrol pump will be used for roads. Everyone knows that the money is it somehow. put into the trust funds for roads but then some Treasurer's hand goes into the till and the funds are transferred across into general revenue. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) likes to talk about public theft-and that is pretty good example of it The Opposition says that, if anyone believes that this higher education trust fund will remain immune from the long arm of a Treasurer looking for rea spare dollar, he ought to think again. We that it would be much better if the funds went direct to the institutions. Dr Charlesworth-Charge up front; point",89
208,Mr REITH,NOES,"The honourable member knows nothing about the issue of independa ence. He is not interested but he ought to of be. In comparison to this complicated is a bureaucratic scheme that we have from the from Labor Party, the Opposition has a much more straightforward and equitable proposal thing for increasing the funds flowing to higher education. First, students will be required to files on stumake a contribution-Dr Charlesworth-Ask the students. Make HEC scheme it difficult to get in.",93

This is in sharp contrast to the requirement that everybody go into the higher education contribution scheme, which we believe really is a disincentive for some people who are concerned about their long term capacity to meet their commitments. Any student who does not tax have access to $1,200 will have access-Dr Charlesworth-They have got to find",93
211,Mr REITH,NOES,"Let me put the honourable member's mind at rest: for those students who do not have $1,200 cash there will be a provision of a government guarantee to allow them to obtain an appropriate loan. I should now like briefly to say something about amalgamations, because I think this is the sharp end of Labor's policies in respect of higher education. As to the question of amalgamation, it is made possible by the Minister's very clear policy position, which is that, if an organisation does not do as it is told, then he will place the squeeze on it in terms of funding. I think the Minister's conduct in relation to a number of these amalgamations has been nothing short of outrageous. The honourable member opposite is from Perth, and he ought to take an interest. The way that the Government has gone in respect of the University of Western Australia (AWU) and Murdoch University is not in the best interests of either institution. Any member, whether on this side of the House or on the opposite side of the House, ought to be concerned about the way in which the Minister goes on. His comments are amazingly blatant. In his speech he says: These funds will allow the Government to make early decisions on new capital projects to commence in 1992 . . . Many of these' capital projects will take into account mergers which have occurred, or are occurring, in many parts of the country. In other words, they will take into account' the bribes and threats that the Minister has been making all over the country since last year in his effort to enforce his program of reform, a program which has met with a great deal of opposition, for very good reasons. Blatantly, he offers the special goody, the $17m to the institutions in his home town of Perth. Murdoch and the UWA have been dutifully in line with the Minister's requirements for months but, not surprisingly, given the difficulties and the feelings that have arisen as a result, the Minister now has the prospect of contesting his own seat in Fremantle against a Murdoch student who felt so strongly about the damage being caused to the institution where he is studying that he chose to enter politics. This is not just a view expressed by those on this side. Dr Carmen Lawrence, the Minister for Education in the west, has been pretty vocal, to the embarrassment of the Government, in the higher education supplement of the Australian, attacking the Minister for his centralising policy position. The honourable member for Perth ought to take some notice of it. I think we see some real ambivalence from Dr Lawrence about this merger, this proposal. We have not seen her Bill. There is a draft floating around. In the end we will oppose it in the upper House because there is no educational or financial benefit to be derived from it. There is a long list of similar situations. I am very concerned about the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). The Minister had a meeting there last Friday. He said to officials at the RMIT, 'If you don't play ball, then I will put a cap on your student enrolments. I will place a freeze on your capital funding and furthermore I will take the Western institute and Footscray Institute of Technology and make them the fifth university in Victoria and you can go and sit on the shelf'. By any objective assessment that is a most unreasonable way in which to proceed. The people at RMIT are only concerned about one thing-that is, that they have built up a first class institution over 100 years and this Minister has a manic determination to get his own way. He is prepared to sacrifice one of the great tertiary institutions of this country just to get his political policy position intq place. That is not good enough. I encourage and commend those people at RMIT to stand up against these bully tactics because that is all that they are. I simply say to them that upon the change in government, which will soon be upon us, they will get a fair deal from us, as they should. It is as simple as that. Finally, let me touch on one other matter which has been raised recently by the Minister. I think it is one of the most incredible proposals put forward by a Minister for many years. This Minister has done more to undermine the autonomy and independence of our institutions than any other Minister. As I said, we have experts from one end of the country to the other making that very point. I refer to people such as Professor Karmel. Is the honourable member for Perth going to stand and deny his experience and the value of ,his commentary on the situation? Of course not. Would he stand and deny the views of someone such as Professor Caro, a former Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University? Of course he would not because what is being said by these people in our tertiary institutions is that the Minister and the Government are destroying one of the great qualities of our universities and are placing at risk and in jeopardy the future of those institutions. The Minister comes along and says, 'All will be well. We'll have a charter of academic freedom'. That is the classic case. That is the arsonist standing back watching the fire rage and saying, 'She'll be right, I'll call the fire cart'. It is a very sorry tale when we analyse the details of this Government's actions in respect of higher education. I am afraid to say that the ramifications of this Minister's manic determination to put the unified national system into place will be with us for many years. Some of the antagonisms that have been created between institutions will be with us for many years, regardless of goodwill, and I condemn him for it. Debate (on motion by Dr Charlesworth) adjourned. NA Gifted and Talented Children -::cindy Shin-Taio Chen-Private InvestmentLiberal Party's Economic PolicyEconomy-Ms Delia Lowe Motion (by Mrs Kelly) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",93
212,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"Corangamite) (7.45)I rise t'onight in response to recent discussions I have had with Professor Brian Start from the Education Department at Melbourne University concerning the plight of gifted and talented children in our community. Despite the very damning conclusions drawn by the Senate Select Committee on the Education of Gifted and Talented Children, the Federal Government has steadfastly ignored the issue of further financial assistance for gifted and talented children. It is a matter of great concern to me that this Government's social agenda is so programmed as to curtail severely the pursuit of excellence by such children in our community. While those identified as having learning difficulties have been greatly assisted to achieve their full potential, this Government has blatantly denied the same attention, support and right of those with above average intelligence to a challenging education. My recent discllssions with Professor Start, who is also the Foundation Director of Children of High Intellectual Potential, or CHIP, have given me a valuable guide as to the misallocation of resources presently occurring, to the detriment of gifted children in the community. For example, for everyone hour spent training those who will teach them, 20 hours are spent on the teachers of retarded children. For every dollar earmarked for their education and enrichment, thousands of dollars go to the handicapped. In Victoria alone $61m is spent annually on the handicapped. This compares with the $180,000 spent on gifted and talented children. The Senate report itself states clearly that if priorities for resources must be determined among educationally disadvantaged groups, it could be argued that gifted children are currently among the most disadvantaged of these groups. If we in Australia accept the United Nations declaration that every child should be given the chance to develop his or her potential on the basis of equal opportunity-if it is considered desirable in Australia that provision should be made for all children to fully develop their abilities-it follows that this must be true not only for average and/or disabled children but also for gifted children. Surely, if our education system aims to cater for disadvantaged and average learners it has also the responsibility to make adequate provision for those in the community who are endowed with special talents. Clearly, this Government should be about providing equally for all children at both ends of the spectrum. Its present attitude is discriminatory and merely designed to perpetuate the myth that gifted children are elite and can look after themselves. While they may be intellectually talented, they have a right to the same sort of support that is offered to the disadvantaged. It is a national disgrace that the present Government denies them the right to an education benefiting their intellectual abilities. Its hi.dden social agenda is aimed directly at frustrating those in our community with natural talent and ability. We in the coalition stand for the rights of all children-disadvantaged, average and exceptional-to an education benefiting them as individuals. The Chairman of the Committee of Inquiry into Education in Western Australia, the Hon. Kim Beazley Sr, in an address to the first national conference on the education of gifted and talented children in Melbourne in 1983, observed quite correctly that: . special adjustments to the education of the gifted should not be regarded as something abnormal, but part of the courtesy and grace due to every child. In refusing to acknowledge and support the talents of the gifted, this Government is actively pursuing social and intellectualdivisiveness on the basis of individual ability. Discouraging the pursuit of excellence is typical of its plans for creating a sort of level playing field on which individual human behaviour is discouraged and stifled in the spurious name of social justice. In talking about gifted and talented children we are not talking about children who are clever. We are talking about children with the ability and potential to perform at a level far above their peers at the same age. We are talking about children who at the age of eight years have gained a maths result that places them ahead of almost every 18year-old college entrant in Australia; about a 14-year-old who could have had a bachelor of science degree to add to his credentials; and about a 12-year-old who was offered a place at Oxford University in England be': cause our education system could not cope with the logistical problems her case presented. Professor Start submitted in evidence to the Senate Committee: The gifted will produce far more than they consume. This country has an enviable record of caring for the disabled. But let's face it, the cure for Down's Syndrome won't be coming from a child with that problem. But it may come from one of these gifted children. They are our greatest national resource. My recent involvement with the sports funding subcommittee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has led me to the conclusion that there is a definite imbalance in Australia in the way in which resources and attention are given to those with natural talent in the sporting arena and even in the arts arena compared with what is given to those who are gifted.",95

214,Mr SNOWDON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to pay a compliment to a fine Northern Territory family and particularly a member of that family who is an outstanding pianist and a credit to her family and the Australian community. I am extremely proud to be able to acknowledge the efforts of Cindy Shin-Tain Chen, who was born in Taiwan in 1964 and came to Australia in 1977. Cindy is the daughter of Mr John Chen and his wife Shi-Liang and she has a sister Rachel. Cindy is an award winning pianist. She has been accepted as a student of piano into the Moscow State Conservatory for nine months from September 1990 as part of the Australian-Soviet Union cultural and academic exchange program. While she is in the Soviet Union, the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will take care of all costs, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade meeting Cindy's travel costs. I am pleased to have been able to assist Cindy and her family through representations to the Soviet Embassy and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I would like to thank the officials in both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Soviet Embassy for their help and assistance. Cindy is a credit to the virtues of the Australian immigration system. She has, as an Australian, been able to develop her extraordinary talent and will now act as an ambassador in the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics for the Northern Territory and Australia. Cindy matriculated in the Northern Territory in 1981 and was admitted to the University of Queensland in 1982. In that year, she was awarded a scholarship by the Northern Territory Government to undertake a bachelor of music degree at the University of Queenshlnd. During her tertiary studies she majored in piano perforII) ance with Bevan Crabtree and briefly with Pamela Page. In 1984 Cindy was awarded the Beta Sigma Phi prize for performance in piano and the Margaret Nickson prize for voice and accompaniment. She graduated in December 1985 with an honours degree in music. Cindy has performed in lunch hour recitals and has played in numerous civic concerts and she is also a very keen music educator. Currently, Cindy is appointed by the University of Queensland as an accompanist. Cindy Chen is a tribute to the excellence that can be obtained through the education system in Australia. I have known the Chen family since they came to Australia. John, Cindy's father, came via Timor in 1975 as a result of the conflagration and the invasion of that country by Indonesia. After John obtained his visa he applied to bring his wife and daughters from Taiwan, and they arrived in February 1977. In that same year, John Chen tutored me in Mandarin. As I have said before in this House, this is a tribute to the multicultural nature of the Northern Territory community. It is very important to acknowledge the role of students such as Cindy Chen and, in this case, the Chinese community in the Northern Territory for what they contribute to the Northern Territory community and the Australian community. Cindy is in a position to contribute a great deal to this country, as I am sure the House will acknowledge.",96
215,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,ADJOURNMENT,"Since the introduction of the Budget, a constant theme with the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who has been in real trouble today, has been to claim that there was a serious lack of private investment in the 10 to 15 years prior to the advent of the Hawke Government and to blame this lack of investment for the present vast balance of payments deficit. As evidence for his claim, he frequently refers to Table 7 of Statement No.2 in Budget Paper No.1 at page 2.39. I would like to table a copy of that, along with one other paper that I shall mention in a moment. The table is a politicised phoney. The table purports to show, in columns 2 and 3, that over two five-year periods spanning the former Liberal-National Party Government, investment grew at only one or 2 per cent a year whereas, over the last five years, under the Hawke Government, there was strong growth of from 7 per cent to more than 10 .per cent a year. However, that is a bad case of 'damned lies and statistics'. The only valid comparison is between the five years of Liberal-National Party Government to 1981-82, when the economy came off the boil, and the past five years, with the economy again about to fall into recession, thereby comparing like with like in terms of the cycle of the economy. On that basis, going back to the original figures for investment-and I attach those figures as the second paper for tabling-the growth rate of private fixed investment to 1981-82 was nearly 8 per cent a year, not one or 2 per cent as the phoney table purports to show. That growth took place under a Liberal-National Party Government. Further, investment as a proportion of gross domestic product was 15.7 per cent in the beginning year, rising to about 19 per cent in 1981-82-hardly what one would call poor or no investment, as the Treasurer has often said. Under the present Government-again I refer honourable members to that second paper-the growth rate of investment was 7 per cent a year for the five years to 1987-88 or 8.5 per cent to 1988-89 when the effects of the recent investment uplift substantially affects the outcome. Investment as a proportion of gross domestic product rose from 15.8 per cent, almost identical to the earlier experience, to 17.5 per cent in 1987-88 or 20 per cent in 1988-89. Thus the aggregate outcome is broadly similar to the earlier periodabout 8 per cent per annum' growth in investment in both periods and rising from about 16 per cent to about 20 per cent of GDP over the cycle. Therefore, the Treasurer's repeated statements about poor or no investment prior to the Hawke Government are totally without foundation, as with many of this Treasurer's statements. Further, there can be no doubt that in the 1980-82 period there was more of the right investment, that· is, investment in the export and import replacement area contributing to solving the trade deficit. In more recent years, there has been a high proportion of investment in the non-tradeable goods area, such as office buildings, shopping complexes and the like-indeed, too much short-termism generally . The Treasurer should desist from misleading and inaccurate statements such as, 'We had poor-or no-investment in Australia 15 years prior to the Hawke Government' and recognise that the present mess the Australian economy is in is of his and the Government's own making. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table the papers to which I referred earlier. Leave granted.",97
216,Dr CHARLESWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Perth) (7.57)One cannot help being amazed and overwhelmed by the hypocrisy of the Opposition. The shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), preached to us about education, when the previous Liberal Government left us with a retention rate of 36 per cent. In the time of this Government that has been improved to 58 per cent. The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) said that the Treasury has cooked the books. One can only be overwhelmed by the hypocrisy of those honourable members. The Economic Action Plan that we have all been hearing about for the last week is all about taking money from the bludgers and giving to the workers, in the words of John Elliott. But the document has no fiscal discipline. The area of most concern to me and to many in my electorate is the area in which, we are told, there are to be considerable savings-something like $800m. That money will be taken from those who presently receive unemployment benefits and have been long term unemployed. They wm no longer receive those benefits under the Opposition. One does not know what will happen to these people. It is to be assumed that immediately the benefit is taken away they will dissolve or disappear. It is impossiBassendean-Lockridge ble to know. If it were the ideological position of the Opposition that those who are long term unemployed should not receive a benefit, we could perhaps understand it. A philosophical stance would underpin the policy if the Opposition were to say that because these people will lose the benefit it would throw resources into retraining them, into providing training. But if we look at the Economic Action Plan we find that $200m-which could have been used to provide assistance for those people to get back into the work force-has been taken away from them. Unfortunately, the figures do not add up. Nearly half a million people are presently unemployed in this country. If we look at the Octob¥r figures in the Economic Roundup we see that there are only 65,000 job vacancies. If there are 65,000 job vacancies and 500,000 people are unemployed, even if the 65,000 vacancies could be taken, unfortunately a considerable number of people would remain unemployed and many of them would be long term unemployed. One of the best programs that the Government has developed-it has evolved over 10 years-is the Skillshare program. What do we find the Economic Action Plan saying about Skillshare? We find it saying that it will be phased out as soon as practicable. In my electorate there are five Skillshare programs. There is one in Midland and one in Morley-Bassendean, soon to be called the Lockridge Skillshare program. There is a program, called Employment 2000, situated in Morley, a program in Maylands and one in the city centre. They represent five Skillshare programs of the 354 all around the country providing for long term unemployed people, those who are most disadvantagedsingle mothers and people looking to get back into the work force-a route back into the work force. Those programs provide opportunities for training. They are efficient programs and are sponsored by groups comprising members of local councils, local business organisations, members of the union movement, members from technical and further education (T AFE) and members of all sorts of community groups. They all play a part in these Skillshare programs, which really work. The program in my electorate is one that we have fought for and whose funding was under threat. Over the last year 500 eligible people have gone through that program, 70 per cent of whom have ended up finding work or going back to the T AFE for tertiary education. What will the Opposition do? It will remove that program. I could understand that position if it were to remove the benefit but provide training for these people. But there is no decent or moral basis to justify what the Opposition is considering doing. It does not make sense. It does not add up. All the Opposition is saying to those very many people who have benefited from this program and worked in the program is, 'We don't care'. I can assure honourable members that over the next six months the people in my electorate and all over the country who work in those programs and who have benefited from them will tell the Opposition over and over again what they think of the Opposition.",98
217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,99
218,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) had to say, there is little doubt that the last two weeks have been a particularly bad period for the tired, out of touch, self-effacing, unethical Govern!flent opposite. We have seen it increasingly 1OcaI?a-!e .of matching the political impact and 10ltIatIves of our Economic Action Plan of 12 October. It has shown itself to be completely lost for fresh initiatives in the scandalous pilots dispute. In particular, it has been a disastrous period for the Treasurer (Mr Keating) whose wayward economic chickens appear to have come home to roost with a statistical venom matched only by his abuse and vitriol and t,he basic dishonesty he displayed in this place yesterday and today. First of all, the Septemb-r. current account deficit figure of $1.8 btlhon takes the three-month cumulative total for the first quarter of the financial year - o $6.1 billion against a full year projection 10 the Budget Papers of $18.5 billion. That means that we have seen one-third of that projected figure in the first quarter. Furthermore, that figure is over 50 per cent higher than for the same period last year. In other words, we are likely to see the current account deficit climb from $11.8 billion or 4 per cent of gross domestic product in 198788 to $17.4 billion or 5.2 per cent of GDP i- 1-88-89 to a figure approaching $24 bi!hon 10 the current financial year-in other words, closer to 6 per cent than the 5 per cent of GDP projected. So much for the Treasurer's - tatement in his Budget Speech that: . . . . to stabilise our international debt the current account deficit will have to continue to be reduced. The full force of this Government's resolve will be directed to this end. - learly, the Treasurer is yesterday's increas10gly desperate man and he is beginning to put into practical effect his banana republic perceptions of May 1986. Since May 1986, we have seen an improvement in the terms of trade by nearly 30 per cent, yet the current account deficit has increased from about $1.3 billion per month to $2 billion per month. The import penetration ratio has increased from 10 per cent in the March 1986 quarter to 13.5 per cent now, which is an increase of about 34 per cent. Our debt level has risen from $75 billion to $108 billion in net terms, and from $92 billion to $137 billion in gross terms. Our debt service burden has increased from about $700m per month to $1.2 billion per month; that is, from between 16 per cent and 18 per cent of exports to 32 per cent of exports. In other words, our debt service burden has doubled. Furthermore, in terms of the size of Australia's debt to commercial banks, it is now ranked third behind Brazil and Mexico and ahead of the Soviet Union and Argentina. Our credit rating has been downgraded twice by bot- international rating agencies, namely, Moody s and Standard and Poor's. Our prime interest rates have jumped from 18.25 per cent to over 20. per cent. Home loan interest rates have risen from 15.5 per cent to 17 or 18 per cent, which has been to the increasing detriment of the average mortgage carrying family. Finally, our inflation rate is still stuck at around 8 per cent, which is unquestioningly demonstrated by last Thursday's 2.3 per cent consumer price index number for September. The clear message from all of this is that Australia's economic problems are substantial and growing. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) said last week: Today's inflation number was the acid test of the Keating-Kelty wages strategy and Keating has failed to deliver his part of the bargain, namely, inflation control. Demonstrably, Simon Crean got it right on Budget night when he said that he did not believe that the Budget did enough to. decrease inflation. The Treasurer can no longer rely on monetary policy as his principal policy adjustment instrument. He should stop juggling his increasingly unresponsive economic balls and he should refrain from any dishonest deal that promises wage increases but quickly - akes them back through inflation and higher 10terest rates. Government economic rhetoric and unsubstantiated abuse by the Treasurer in this place are simply not good enough. Mr Keating deserves our strongest condemnation.",99
219,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"A great responsibility is placed on all honourable members who speak in this House, because they have the opportunity to raise issues that are of concern to their constituents without fear of legal recourse. However, this privilege places upon members the heavy responsibility to check their facts before making any statements that might harm the good name of people beyond these walls who are unable to properly defend themselves. Earlier this week the member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) made use of this privilege by repeating certain allegations that had been made against Ms Delia Lowe, the coordinator-administrator of the Jerringa local Aboriginal Land Council at Roseby Park near Nowra. I informed the member for Gilmore that I intended to make this speech this evening. I have known Delia Lowe for many years. During that time. I have helped to arrange many deputations that she has led to Canberra. Knowing her as I do, I was very surprised at the remarks that were made about her by the honourable member for· Gilmore. Ms Lowe enjoys a well earned rep- , utation for being a tireless worker for the Aboriginal cause. As such, she is respected by many people throughout Australia-both Aborigines and non-Aborigines alike. Indeed, she is well known overseas and has twice represented her people at the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Peoples. Two weeks ago, she was elected as one of the five State representatives of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Conservation Foundation. I would have hoped that the honourable member would have checked his facts before speaking. Obviously, he has failed to do that and has contented himself with making a number of ill-considered remarks that were based on false accusations that had been put to him by a few disgruntled members of that land· council. In order to protect the good name of Ms Lowe, let me present the facts. The annual general meeting of the Jerringa local Aboriginal Land Council was held on Monday, 16 October, in the Land Council's office at Roseby Park. In accordance with the regulations of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Rights Act, notice of the meeting and the agenda were circulated seven days prior to the meeting. The first item on the agenda was the tabling of the auditor's report, which was done in the presence of the land council's accountant, who is a most reputable chartered accountant and a respected citizen of Nowra. According to the minutes of that meeting, the audit was accepted by a show of hands, with 23 people voting in favour and no-one voting against. At the meeting, Ms Lowe raised the question of continuing in the position as coordinator-administrator. For personal reasons she was not inclined to do so, partly because of other interests, partly because of her physical health, and partly because she realised there were a number of disgruntled persons within the community; but another member of the Council moved that she should continue in the position. This was put to the vote and was carried unanimously. As coordinator-administrator, Ms Lowe receives a wage which was set by the Land Council executive following consultations with the Department of Employment, Education and Training in accordance with Public Service guidelines. Mr Charles Perkins, who has been appointed by the Premier of New South Wales to inquire into the functioning of the New South Wales Land Rights Act, was asked to comment on this matter during an interview on radio 2ST while in Nowra last Monday. He replied that, under the Act, land councils certainly had the right to employ coordinators and administrators such as Ms Lowe, and to pay them a just wage. One of the most damaging remarks made by the honourable member was that Ms Lowe was reputed to be in receipt of unemployment benefit while in the paid employ of the Land Council. Let me once again put the record straight. Ms Lowe was in receipt of unemployment benefit for a period leading up to, but not extending beyond, June 1988 when the Jerringa local Aboriginal Land Council received fresh funding. Ms Lowe has been a paid employee of the Land Council since that date and has at no time since June 1988 received unemployment benefit. It is a great pity that the honourable member did not accord Ms Lowe the courtesy of checking the facts with her before repeating these wild and erroneous accusations. If he has any last lingering doubts he might care to check the facts with the Land Council's accountant. He might also care to contact the New South Wales Auditor-General who, under the terms of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Rights Act, has the responsibility of ensuring that all land councils' books are properly kept and are correct. The honourable member has said he will ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) to investigate his accusations. I will most certainly be forwarding to the Minister the details of this matter. I know that the honourable member is an honourable gentleman and I am sure that he will apologise to Ms Lowe. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 8.12 p.m. The following notices were given: Mr Duffy to move That this House: (I) absolutely rejects any recourse to chemical warfare and calls for the elimination of all stocks of chemical weapons; (2) views the comprehensive, global Chemical Weapons Convention under negotiation by the Geneva Conference on Disarmament as the most effective, enduring solution to the potential threat of chemical warfare; (3) believes that an effectively verifiable Chemical Weapons Convention will need to be designed and implemented with the active participation of the international chemical industry and that in this regard it: (a) welcomes the outcome of the Government-Industry Conference against Chemical Weapons held in Canberra in September 1989, including the industry statement rejecting any involvement with the manufacture of chemical weapons and affirming commitment to the development and implementation of a global ban on chemical weapons; and (b) encourages the continuing growth of dialogue, stimulated by the Conference, between government and industry on the chemical weapons issue; and (4) believes that Australia should continue to work with neighbouring countries to foster regional awareness of the chemical 'weapons issue, with the aims of reinforcing norms within our region against chemical weapons and of strengthening regional support for the Chemical Weapons Convention under negotiation in Geneva. Mr West to move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Stage 2 Development including New Submarine School, HMAS Stirling, Garden Island, Western Australia.
