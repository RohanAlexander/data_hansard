3,Mr TIM FISCHER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Melbourne Age this morning reported Il!e as saying that at the end of the day my colleagues and I would support the Mabo bill. That is the complete reverse of the position. It probably fell out overnight. In fact, all my Liberal and National Party colleagues, members and senators, are totally opposed to this very bad legislation and will be voting accordingly. NA",11
4,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I wish to inform the House how I see the business program proceeding today. Honourable members will have noted from the blue daily program that a deal of material has to come back from the Senate. The Senate is still meeting on legislation which ought to be coming back in the course of the afternoon. As can also be 'seen from the blue, a considerable amount of time will also be devoted to debating the motion to take note of the report of the Procedure Committee that was presented by the honourable member for Bonythan (Dr Blewett). That debate will cut in pretty soon after we have concluded the legislation we now have from the Senate. I would think that some of the other matters that are now being dealt with in the Senate would start to come in by mid-afternoon and compete with a number of other activities, one of which is a possibility that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) will make a statement relating to budget procedures for next year. That is not an absolute certainty but a high likelihood. That would be at 3 o'clock, were that to occur. Previously I had thought that we would be doing valedictories at about 11 a.m - and I think I told the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) that-but the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)· has a program that leaves him fully occupied until about 4 o'clock this afternoon, so it would be the intention to start valedictories at about 4 p.m. We would then have a look at how much we had received from the Senate and what progress the Senate had made on the Native Title Bill. If we are left with a substantial amount of material to come across from the Table Office, we will go until that is completed and, if it is obvious that we are not going to get the Native Title Bill. at any reasonable time tonight, there would be a likelihood that we would adjourn some time not unadjacent to dinner tonight.",11
5,Mr HOWARD,BUSINESS,Not un adjacent to dinner?,12
6,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"Thereabouts-5 o'clock, 5.30 or 6 o'clock-in the hope that we do not actually have to come b-ck here",12
7,Unknown,BUSINESS,Honourable members interjecting,12
8,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"That reminds me of an early harassment case when a corporal was had up for vile, obscene abuse of a female recruit. He was invited to explain himself. He denied all allegations· and said, 'I said no thing to the recruit. All I said was that she was at point A and I wished her to be at point B'. I would rather be at point B, which is about 2,000 miles west. Anyway, that is for tomorrow. As I said, we get papers from the Senate too slowly and unless, as is most unlikely, the Senate proceeds faster than we expect on the Native Title Bill we should conclude around dinner time and there will be an opportunity tomorrow, again whilst waiting for all the legislation to come across from the Senate, to continue discussion on the report of· the honourable member for Bonython a bit further.",12
9,Mr HOWARD,BUSINESS,About what time has the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in mind for the report of the honourable member for Bonython?,12
10,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"These bills, which are basically",12
11,Mr HOWARD,BUSINESS,Roughly adjacent to lunchtime?,12
12,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,It depends on how much trouble we encounter on all these other matters coming from the Senate.,12
13,Mr HOWARD,BUSINESS,We will not give any trouble on these.,12
14,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"I think most of these are being accepted. I am not sure about the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. But assuming that there is not much in that, I would expect us to be onto that after the environmental protection bill is debated and passed; probably close to lunchtime.",12
15,Mr SINCLAIR,BUSINESS,"Knowing as I do the propensity of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) for blood sports, it is a pity we are not having question time today, given that there is inadequate work for the government. It would be appropriate on this last day of sitting for us to ask a few meaningful questions of the ministry.",12
16,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,I was hoping that there would be an opportunity to hear the right honourable such member for New England (Mr Sinclair) for 20 minutes on the subject of the reforms of the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett). It would be far more interesting than asking me any questions.,12
17,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,And take pity on the Speaker!,12
18,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"Given that it was correctly pointed out by the Speaker the other day that all the standing orders which the right honourable member feels are being used to ride roughshod over the rights of members were invented by his good self, this would be an opportunity for the right honourable member to suggest to us a few more. Rather than question time we ought to have a chance to listen to his words of wisdom that the right honourable member no doubt has for us on that.",12
19,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"I might just point out for the benefit of honourable members that, given the unusual nature of tomorrow in that we will be sitting on a Saturday, a circular will be coming around to all members advising them of arrangements within this place in respect of catering and other issues. So stay tuned, as they say.",13

22,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Once again we have received amendments from the Senate without any prior notice' from the government. I understand that it has had sufficient time, but it has neglected any duty it feels towards this chamber to provide any sort of detailed or relevant information. There is in existence, I understand, an explanatory memorandum covering these amendments. It is not even before the chamber, as I understand it. We went through this exercise a week or two ago. It is an indication of the disdain with which the chamber is treated and are for use by the exemption user so as to satisfy one or more of exemption Items 1,2, IS, 23, 2S, 29, 33, 35, 36 and 3S.

No. 3After clause 135, page 60, insert the . following clause: Schedule 1 ""13SA. Table 3 in Schedule 1 to the Principal Act is amended by adding at the end the following credit ground: Claimant has borne the tax borne on when the goods repair goods tax on eligible the goods became eligible rerepair goods. pair goods it is an indictment of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). As I understand it, several measures are dealt with in these amendments which were promulgated in the Senate, including changes to deductions that are allowable to life assurance companies. It is my understanding-and no thanks to the Assistant Treasurer for my understanding, as honourable members will have already observed-that deductions allowable for life insurance companies are further amended to try to ensure that the formula which allocates certain deductions of various classes of assessable income of a life assurance company allocates all the relevant deductions. The bill apparently includes certain amounts which are described in the denominator of the formula, but apparently not all of those amounts are included in the total of the numerators used to apportion the non-exclusive deductions of a life assurance company to its various classes of assessable income which are, as I am sure everyone in the chamber knows, taxed at different rates. There is no financial impact. As far as we can tell, given the circumstances I have described of a lack of notice or information, the amendments appear to be sensible ones. They are certainly in line with the government's stated objectives, but Ido atta.ch the caveat that we have not been able to examine them at length prior to this matter being called on for discussion. A further amendment includes changes to the sales tax law involving credits for parts used in repairs. This amendment, as I understand it, provides a credit for parts used in repair of Australian made goods, the property in which will be transferred to another person who will use these goods as business inputs in primary production, mining or manufacturingindustries. This principle will also apply to property which will be transferred to other persons during the course of repair of other Australian used goods where that other person will use these Australian used goods as business inputs in the primary production or manufacturing industries. This becomes effective from 1 January 1993 and, although it is retrospective, as we have stated on many occasions, we have no objection to retrospectivity when it confers a benefit. That, I understand, is to be the case. ",14
23,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Forrest is on a fast learning curve but it is not fast enough, it seems, from that"" interjection. Mr Elliott-He is a slow learner.",15
24,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I was not going to say that; he is a colleague of mine. How dare the honourable member put words in my mouth. Apparently some of the background to this is that under the sales tax law, where a person repairs, renovates or reconditions used goods, the new parts used in the work are applied to the use of the person at the time of the repair, renovation or reconditioning. The parts lose their separate identity, of course, in this process. If the repairer is not entitled to an exemption at the time the repairs are carried out, the later sales to exempt persons will not relieve from tax the goods or the parts used in their repair. This amendment seems to put that in some order again. I qualify that conclusion with the remark that we are not really in a position to be entirely sure, given the circumstances I have already described. I would have thought that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) might have been a little bit more forthcoming when he presented these amendments to the chamber. I do not suppose it does any good to go over that ground again, but we do live in hope that the government, and the minister in particular, will be a little more thorough if he the is not moved to consider the ordinary niceties of presenting amendments to legislation previously considered in this chamber.

VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1993 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the· Senate with an amendment. ; Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration in committee of the whole house forthwith. Senate s amendmentPart 2, Division 2, line 8 (page 2) to line to (page 3), omit the Division.",15
25,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Cal wellParliamentary Secretary to the· Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (10.21 a.m.)-I move: That the amendment be disagreed to. The bill requires full passage to implement changes to remove inconsistencies for service pension assessment and maintain the nexus of omit pension assessment with the Social Security Act. Allocated pensions have the characteristics of managed investments without· the constraints normally associated with a superannuation fund.· For example, a superannuation fund provides fixed payments over a person's lifetime and owns the asset. The Senate amendment excludes allocated 1994 pensions and allocated annuities from the managed investment rules in the Veterans' Entitlements Act and thereby prevents the equitable income and asset assessment of these investments compared with other forms of managed investments. The Senate amendment will reduce the equity of service pension income and assets tests. Pensioners with the same means and the same financial resources available to them should have the same amount of income and assets assessed for service pension purposes. People who invest in an allocated pension or allocated annuity should not be treated more beneficially than those who invest in other managed investments. It is a principle of the income test that ongoing gains are treated as income for all investments that can be readily realised and utilised by the pensioners for their support. There is no reason why allocate<.l pensions and allocated annuities should be excluded and given privileged treatment.",16
26,Mr TIM FISCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"We support the amendment now returned from the Senate to this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) and particularly we support the deletion of clauses 4, 5, 6 and 7 in division 2, the subject in essence of what the parliament secretary has spoken about in moving his motion to reject the Senate amendment. Let it be quite clear that, whilst the government is moving in the lower house to reject these amendments, the coalition in both houses is quite adamant that this amendment should stand the course of the passage of this .legislation. The essence of this matter is about the moves, the skulduggery if you like, of the government in relation to introducing a form of notional capital gains tax in respect of shareholdings of those pensioners, service pensioners, who have managed linked investments and other forms of investm-nts. I regard with absolute anathema any form of notional capital gains tax because it is in fact one of th- cruellest forms of taxation that exists only in a few places right around the world. .What do I mean by notional capital gains tax? I mean exactly this: if a person holds shares as at 1 July 1993 and does not trade those shares at all during the course of the year and gets to 1 July 1994, the end of the financial year, and has had a gain in the value of those shares but has not realised that gain-and still holds just 1;000 shares in companies X, Y, and Z-in fact, the person is then being taxed on that capital gain in a form. To be (air it could be argued, and I accept the government could argue, that it is not an actual capital gains tax. It is a form reduced income to the pensioners involved. Under this arrangement, the service pension and, for that matter, the age pension gets reduced as a net outcome Of these proposals in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. These amendments were moved and carried successfully by the coalition in the Senate and they are now before this committee stage of the House of Representatives. In the closing stages of this extended lengthy parliamentary session at the end of a most interesting year, I want to say that we are being absolutely consistent in expressing our opposition in respect of this skulduggery with managed investments and with regard to those holding shares-which is separate but related-and that we totally reject any form of notional capital gains tax and its impact on veterans, on the elderly, on members of the Association of Independent Retirees and on their standard of living, hard pressed as it is. Honourable melT!bers have to remember, at the other end of the equation, that retirees, particularly, and pensioners, for that portion of their income that might come from interest, have had 15 consecutive reductions in their income as a consequence of correct economic policy; no doubt, it is submitted to reduce the official rates of interests rates over the last in thi's case couple of years. There is a flip side to that coin: people on set and fixed incomes in retirement and pensioners with some small elements of safety net and reserves for rainy days which they too have invested have come down, in terms of their .interest bearing income, 15 separate times as the Reserve Bank has adjusted downwards the official rates of interest. That also has a bearing on the matters .currently before the House. We believe in a fair go. The government has· attempted to arrive at a notional balance and level playing field between. various forms of investment. To be fair to parliamentary secretary, this is the nub of the argument advanced by him that somehow this is going to even up treatment of all aspects of income. At the end of the day it does not do that; at the end of the day it injects a form of notional of capital gains tax into the circumstances; at the end of the day it leaves a very complex situation with managed investments. Quite properly, for all those reasons, the coalition has helped to bring about the carriage of these amendments in the Senate, and it stands by those amendments.",16
27,Mr BRADFORD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Iwant to strongly support the remarks of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I am disappointed that the government has not chosen to support the amendment which has been made to this legislation in the Senate. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) has paid little attention and now· pays no attention to what was said by the Leader of the National Party. In fact, he read a few remarks",17
28,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,How dare you say that. What would you know about it.,18
29,Mr BRADFORD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The parliamentary secretary obviously does not understand; he has no empathy or sympathy for the veterans community at all. The honourable member could not even get the words right when he stood up to read it.,18
30,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,I hike that to be a personal reflection from a gentleman .who does not know what he is talking about and I ask that he withdraw. Mr Thckey-Withdraw what? That is not unparliamentary !,18
31,The CHAIRMAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor is not assisting. The parliamentary secretary will have a chance in his reply during the debate to address the positions that have been put by the honourable member for MCPherson.,18
32,Mr BRADFORD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The debate about the treatment of unrealised capital gains has gone on in this place for a long time and there is no doubt in my mind that the government has got it comprehensively wrong from day one. There is no doubt in my mind that the government has lost an enormous amount of support in the community because of the way it has gone about treating .the relatively small number of aged and service pensioners who have invested in instruments which are subject to capital gain. There was never any logical rationale for treating unrealised or notional capital gainsas income. It was, as we pointed out on many occasions, completely inconsistent with the way that they are treated by tax law and with the way that those gains are treated for every other person in the country. Pensioners were singled out for special treatment in respect of these particular gains. Person after person has demonstrated to me-as I am sure they have to their Labor members-the futility of this particular exercise, which effectively reduces their pensions. The question that we have asked, and which we have never had satisfactorily answered, is how that gap is bridged for people. In other words, .how do they make up that income? The answer has always been-and I deplore the answer-that they simply cash in some of the .particular instruments that they have, whether they be a managed investment of some sort, or a share portfolio, or whatever. People who have provided for their own retirement and are proud of having done so; and have done so commendably-in fact, that is what we want them to do; we encourage people to provide for their own retirementare being effectively told by this government that they are expected to actually realise or cash in those savings and effectively put their future ultimately at risk. And this is being reinforced here once again today. I have deplored this from day one. But I take further umbrage this morning, because this is an attack on the veterans community. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous), in the remarks that he read-and I give him the opportunity to defend himself, but I repeat my accusation that he does not understand what he was saying-has no empathy at all for the vetetans that he is talking about. I believe this government is held in contempt by the veterans community. Time after time, the government has taken action which, in my view, the veterans have regarded as being an attack on them. I am quite sure that the general reading among those in the veterans community now is that the government has written them off. It makes life so difficult for veterans, at just about every tum, that the government has obviously decided that it does not need any votes in the veterans community. That is a great pity, and it is also a pity that it has come to that; which I now believe it has. There is an argument, and I will continue to put the argument here in this place, that veterans are different. If you wanted to debate this issue just on that point-and it was the parliamentary secretary who read out the point that somehow there was an argument for treating veterans in the same way as other social security beneficiaries-then I would be prepared to argue, on that point alone, that veterans are in some sense different from other pension beneficiaries. That has always been recognised. The fact is· that they are different. They qualify on different tenns. They qualify at a different age for the service pension and the various benefits that go with it, because we have always traditionally recognised that veterans were different,and are different, because of the very special service that they have rendered to this country in the past. As time goes by, it concerns and aggrieves me that, as veterans diminish in number and diminish as a political force, for obvious reasons, their concerns will be taken less and less seriously in this place. There are very few in this place who speak on behalf of veterans these days. There are a few left who are able to speak from very much first-hand experience about the concerns of veterans. I will continue to do that, and I will continue to argue for special treatment of veterans, if the government wants to debate this particular matter on that ground alone. The government has got it wrong. It is not only an attack on all pensioners as a group. We have made that point ad infinitum in this place. The treatment of managed investments and unrealised capital gains in this way is absolutely flawed and completely wrong. I also argue strongly that this is a specific attack, in the context of this legislation, on the veterans of this community. I condemn the government for that action.",18
33,Mr TIM FISCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I thank the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) for his excellent contribution. The focus of this is a very complex' calculation fonn which does not take into account original purchase price of the units in relation to current price, and that has caused pension;. ers to have their pension rate cut without receiving any compensating income, as the honourable member for MCPherson has said. It is compartmentalised from, but not irrelevant to, the other adjustments which the government has made with regard to shareholdings as well in a direct sense. It is for all these reasons that we oppose this motion. I would like to seek an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) that, should this motion be carried-and I hope it is not and that wisdom will prevail at this 11th minute with the government-as he goes through the process of the standing orders then applying, he will convene a meeting of the committee of the House that is set up to draft answers to the Senate. I also seek his assurance that he will consider the report over a period of time and not over just two minutes, and that he will not truncate and short-cut the processes of the parliament with respect to that particular standing order. It will be a total travesty of justice if the parliamentary secretary were to stand up and present a report and reasons for a report when, in fact, that committee could not have met. It would be even more of a travesty of justice if he gets an adjusted copy of that report and those reasons for that report which I think he might have just received. The due process should apply. He will be moving to set up a committee to draft a report, to give the chamber its reasons for objecting to the Senate's amendment. He should do that properly and not in some truncated version.",19
34,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"CalwellParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (10.37 a.m.)-I am happy to reply to some of the concerns of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I appreciate his concerns. In relation to the gratuitous comments of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), I point out that he should be aware that in my, role as parliamentary secretary I have extensive contact with the aged community. In factMr Bradford-Why don't you listen to them?",19
35,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member has had his tum. Only last week I addressed a conference of independent retirees; I listened to their concerns, and I am in a position to know a hell of a lot about this matter, so the honourable member actually owes me an apology for his comments. Leaving that aside, this is an issue which has raised some questions in the community to which the government has responded. The government has responded because in October this year it announced an independent review of the income and assets tests for service and social security pensions. The reality is that that review is going to look at all these issues, including the issue we are discussing here. It will be a wide-ranging review and, if there are any problems, there will be opportunity for that public input before a report next September. As a result there will be a good look at all of these matters. I agree that all these issues -)Ught to be looked at. As a consequence of that review next September, the government will make whatever amendments and adjustments are required in the budget of the following year. So it is not correct to say that we are not aware of these issues. As for the other point made by the honourable member for MCPherson to the effect that only he and his party care for the veterans community, I point out to honourable members opposite-and the Leader of the National Party is aware of this point as well-that they went to the election in March of this year with a proposal to reduce outlays by $10,000 million-$1O,ooo miIlion-and that they are now coming into this chamber and pretending that every piece of social legisl-tion is not one that was going to be cut. They say that Veterans' Affairs was not going to be cut. Social Security was not going to be cut. Medicare was not going to be cut, none of them was going to be cut. but that they were going to save $10,000 million. The reality is that they would have had to cut pensions and benefits to veterans if they had tried to save the $10,000 miIIion. that is for sure. The public of Australia was aware of the potential impact on the health system. One thing that the veterans are concerned about is the health system and health issues. A lot of veterans voted for the government because they were concerned about potential changes to Medicare, not to mention all the other changes, in the Fightback package. So let us not pretend that only the opposition cares. What a nonsense! The opposition parties cannot get their act together on one single question of social policy. It is nearly nine months since the election. yet not a single piece of soCial policy has been put forward by the opposition. All we are getting is opposition to this and opposition to that and opposition to the next measure. We are not getting anything positive. There will be a review, but in the meantime it is important that there is no inconsistency between the social security pension and the veterans' pension. This legislation ensures that there is no inconsistency during the intermediate period until we see what happens with the review. The honourable member for MCPherson said that veterans should be treated in a special way. There are a number of special benefits for veterans. However, in this matter it would be quite wrong tor.have a major inconsistency between the· veterans' service pension and the aged pension. Clearly, we need to get this inconsistency eradicated. I repeat: the government is looking at these matters. If there is cause for concern, if people think there is a major unfairness of some kind, then those matters will be examined in the context of that review. It is interesting that the Leader of the National Party of Australia described this legislation as a notional capital gains tax. It is not a notional capital gains tax at all. A notional capital gains tax presents a situation where it is assumed that there has been a capital gain which is not realisable.",19

43,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NOES,"Cal wellParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (10.55 a.m.)-On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up the reasons for the House disagreeing to the amendment of the Senate, I present the reasons which have been circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsThe Bill requires full passage to implement changes to remove inconsistencies for service pension assessment and maintain the nexus of pension assessment with the Social Security Act. Allocated pensions have the characteristics of managed investments without the constraints normally associated with a superannuation fund. For example, a superannuation fund provides fixed payments over a person's lifetime and there are no redeemable assets. The Senate amendment excludes allocated pensions and allo-ated annuities from the managed Investment rules In the Veterans' Entitlements Act and thereby prevents the equitable income and asset assessment of these investments compared with other forms of managed investments. The Senate amendment will reduce the equity of the service pension income and assets tests. Pensioners with the same means and the same financial resources available to them should have the same amount of income and assets assessed for service pension purposes. People who invest in an allocated pension or allocated annuity should not be treated PAIRS more beneficially than those who invest in other managed investments. - t is a principle o.f the income test that ongoing gains are treated as Income for all investments that can be readily realised and utilised by the pensioners for their .support. There is no reason why allocated pensIOns and allocated annuities should be excluded and given privileged treatment.",22
44,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NOES,I move: That the committee's reasons be adopted.,22
45,Mr TIM FISCHER,NOES,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (10.56 a.m.)Not to have had a proper meeting is one thing, and I accept that there are due processes; but the reasons are not yet in the hands of honourable members and senators on either side of the House, and the opposition is not going to allow this particular motion to proceed until such time as they are widely circulated and distributed. I think we are entitled to see the five paragraphs in this statement of reasons which has instantly appeared after the meeting of a committee set up just one minute ago. I accept that this has been part of the process, but the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) has not got a copy. He has spoken out repeatedly on this issue of taking away pensioners' rights on the managed links and the capital gains tax. There are inadequate copies available of the reasons, and it is in that circumstance that we now take a set c?urse of action to provide that they are CIrculated before the House comes to its next vote. We are not of a mind to call a division on that next vote, but there is a reasonable and level course of action that the government should pursue in these matters. The committee has changed the reasons given, and I now take the opportunity of pointing out the change in the second paragraph. It says: Allocated pensions have the characteristics of managed investments without the constraints normally associated with a superannuation fund. For example, a superannuation fund provides fixed payments over a person's lifetime and.and here, please delete msert'owns the asset' and ' there are no redeemable assets.

48,Mr SLIPPER,NOES,"No, not up .here.",23
49,Mr TIM FISCHER,NOES,"The honourable member for Wide Bay has still not received a copy. He is my benchmark on this distribution. The honourable member for Wide Bay has, along with the honourable member for Hinkler (MrNeville), particularly pursued this issue of a fair go for service pensioners and a fair go for veteran pensioners, and an end to notional capital gains tax and an end to this alteration to managed linked investments, which is taking away the income circumstance of the elderly and pensioners in a way which the coalition regards as being absolutely unfair. I ask again: has the honourable member for Wide Bay received a copy of the reasons? I understand that he has now received one, but that others have still not. This is hopeless, Mr Deputy Speaker! Every honourable member present in this House is entitled to receive a copy of this before wedeliberate on this motion. I have to say that I regard it as unacceptable, albeit at the end stages of this session parliament, that due process should not pertain. I now understand that honourable members seeking copies have received those, so I will continue to speak. This is not just a matter of logistics. I know there is a lot of pressure on very hard working clerks and staff of the parliament. It is not their fault, by the way. It is, amongst other things, the fault of the government, which has produced an alteration to its reasons on the death knock. That was, by the way, about the third alteration. Sitting in front of the parliamentary secretary was the original version with a line through it, and it just shows we have a government in absolute chaos on the specifics of this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) and on the other specifics. I might add, for the benefit of those who still have not got the reasons-I have now had them for about two minutes-that they are inadequate in terms of the position of the government in rejecting our amendments. These amendments have been dealt with by the Senate, a majority in the Senate has carried these amendments, and the governmentat this 11th hour should look long and hard at altering its position, otherwise we will not be here only on Saturday, we will be here on Sunday, we will be here in Christmas Eve and beyond. Frankly, I would rather be somewhere else at this time of the year. Extra copies of the statement of reasons produced by this ad hoc committee for the benefit of the proceedings of this House have now finally arrived and a member of the committee is seeing them for the first time; the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) is seeing these reasons for the very first time. Has your copy got the addendum, the scratch-out, Eric?",23

52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The Leader of the National Party will address the chair.,23
53,Mr TIM FISCHER,NOES,"I put it to the House that in the circumstances the House is entitled of to look at the statement of reasons. We reject the reasons given. We reject the government's position with regard to rejecting the Senate amendments and we plead for a fair go for our veterans, for our service pensioners, for the elderly and for the retirees, who have really had the butt end of this recession in terms of a range of events which have moved against their circumstances and have put under enormous duress their standard of living and their ability to finance a minimum standard of living.",23
54,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"Berowra) (11.03 a.m.)These reasons appear to be predicated upon principles of equity and fairness. If we read through the reasons that are given, the government is arguing that, in relation to other pensioners and people who receive benefits from the government to whom the income testing and assets testing rules apply, the way in which the act here is· being dealt with will prevent an equitable income and asset assessment in relation to investments held by veterans as against those who are receiving other forms of pensions and benefits. If it were thought that fairness and equity was the proper approach that ought to be taken, the government should be persuaded by the amendment that we have proposed, because what we are seeking for all pensioners and for all people entitled to benefits, whether they are veterans or otherwise, is a fair and equitable system. The difficulty is that the government's present system is neither fair nor equitable. The government itself now acknowledges that this is the case, because it has started to call for expressions of interest from people who may be prepared to undertake a form of inquiry into assets and income testing. In relation to that inquiry, the matter of assets and income testing and its application",24
55,Unknown,NOES,Government members interjecting,24
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The parliamentary secretaries collectively will stop interjecting.,24
57,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"I am pleased that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) knows that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) is commissioning an inquiry. The point I am making about that inquiry is that it will go to the whole question of assets testing and income testing and its relationship to allocated pensions and annuities, particularflawed ly shares, managed investments and unrealised capital gain. The whole purpose of that inquiry is to look at developing a fair and equitable system. This side of the House has sought and long argued for the inquiry, and we are pleased that the government has now been persuaded that such an inquiry should be undertaken. When an inquiry of this sort is being commissioned and new rules are being looked at, changes should not be advocated to a whole lot of other issues. Our view is that there ought to be a moratorium on these sorts of changes until the inquiry has been undertaken and we have some worthwhile recommendations on the difficult issues of unrealised capital gains on shares in relation to managed investments and allocated pensions. The matter of allocated pensions is one that has also been addressed by a Senate committee, and the minister has given an assurance that new rules will not be proclaimed in relation to allocated pensions until such time as the Senate committee reports. As I understand it, the Senate committee is merely issuing a discussion paper in relation to its position; there will be a period of timeperhaps a considerable period of time-before the Senate committee finally reports. The argument that this bill is needed for equity between veterans and other beneficiaries is fundamentally flawed. In relation to allocated pensions, on the assurance of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner), .the legislation will not be proclaimed until. the Senate committee reports, and we know that is a long way off. The other matters have been the subject of very considerable controversy and the government has been moving to amend them. It seems to me that the more appropriate way for the government to respond is to take this amendment, accept it and then look at ways and means by which the other issues can be put on hold until the full inquiry has been undertaken.· Mark my words, this inquiry will be significant in terms of the volume of expressions of interest and submissions that it will receive from people who have been manifestly hurt. by the unreasonable and rules relating to unrealised capital gains both on shares and on managed investments. The government comes here arguing in terms of equity and fairness when it has put in place the manifestly unfair provisions that it was persuaded of the need to alter in relation to those people who had long held shares. It removed the retrospective application of its provisions but it left in place the unfair provisions for people who haveacquired shares since August 1992. The rules are now quite different in their application. The government is arguing that fairness and equity ought to be sustained but its own rules do not provide for ·fairness and equity. I do not see any reason advanced in this statement from the rather farcical committee that was set up to persuade us to vary our position. This committee was able to produce its reasons within seconds. I do not see any argument of substance to persuade us or the Senate to adopt a different position.",24
58,Mr TRUSS,NOES,"I would like to comment on a couple of aspects of this matter. Firstly, I will talk about the preparation of the statement of reasons. I know that this procedure is followed regularly in the House, but it is utterly farcical. It is a nonsense to set up a committee to prepare a statement of reasons to go back to the Senate and then to have that report delivered immediately to the House. There is no care taken in the choice of the members of that particular committee. The person at the table just looks around desperately to try to find a couple of government members in the chamber who can be appointed to the committee. They then instantly produce a statement of reasons. When we look closely at the document that is being distributed, we see that this statement of reasons has got a time at the top of it when it was faxed to this chamber-lO.08 a.m. In other words, the statement of reasons was prepared and delivered to this chamber three-quarters of an hour before the committee was even appointed. So how could anyone argue that the members of the committee made any contribution whatsoever towards the development of these reasons? They were not even appointed when the statement of reasons was prepared, and that makes a mockery of the parliamentary process. It is particularly appropriate to raise this matter today because of the intended debate later in the day on the question of parliamentary procedures. This is one aspect of procedures which is clearly farcical and needs to be corrected. In this particular instance, the government demonstrated its total lack of interest in the wishes of members of parliament on this question, because it did not even bother to produce enough copies so that everybody could have a look at the document. When the parliamentary secretary proposed that this statement of reasons be adopted, ije actually referred to it as the statement that had been distributed to honourable members. He was caught out. It had not been distributed because there were not enough copies. I suppose he expected there to be only one or two people in the chamber and so he would get away with only producing a couple of copies. There had to be three or four attempts then to rush out and to get extra copies of the statement of reasons so that honourable members could actually have the privilege of reading first what they are going to be asked to approve. Of course, the government is not anxious in a case like this for honourable members to have any time to read the document, because the statement of reasons is so clearly flawed. It fails to address the issues involved and it fails to provide satisfactory justification for the rejection of the Senate's proposed amendment. The process needs to be adjusted. If there is going to be a genuine statement of reasons on behalf of the House of Representatives, it is also unjust that only government members should be involved in the preparation of that statement. After appointment of the most capable people, those who have got a particular interest in the subject, the committee needs to prepare the reasons, carefully consider a draft and then circulate that to members of parliament, to give us all an opportunity to make a contribution on whether that statement of reasons is appropriate. Mr Ruddock-The honourable member for Hunter is going to speak on it in a moment.",25
59,Mr TRUSS,NOES,"We are looking forward to his contribution, because he only got his copy of this statement which he prepared, this committee report, some minutes afte(the debate had been going, well into the speech of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). Mr Ruddock-Isn't that alteration in his handwriting?",25
60,Mr TRUSS,NOES,"I doubt that it is his handwriting. Like the rest of us, he probably cannot even read it, it is so poor. I noticed that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, were in the untenable position of being expected to control a debate on this particular matter without having a copy of it provided to you. That is an example of the way in which the parliamentary secretary and the government treat this House with contempt, and that is a totally unsatisfactory situation. I hope that when this situation arises in the future, when there is a need to draft reasons, the government will give that process the attention that it deserves and allocate the time that is necessary so that the process is seen to be reasonable. On the matter of the substance of the reasons, the question of including the capital gain on shares in an income test has been canvassed for some time. The government, to its credit-although that credit is given grudgingly-finally backed down on the question of which shares would be counted. It left out a large number of shareholding pensioners. To some extent that quietened down the clamour of opposition to these proposals throughout the country. However, in the process, the government created a new, justly aggrieved group. The government had firmly indicated that it was unprepared to change its quite foolish policy in this regard or to do anything about modifying the proposals, so many pensioners sold the shares that they had had for some considerable time leading up to that date. That put that group of pensioners in a disadvantaged situation when the government changed the rules at the last minute. I have had many pensioners write to me who had sold their shares and bought others which would make them less likely to be affected by these provisions. In fact, they were trapped because the government would now have exempted their previous shareholdings; the new ones that they had purchased have been caught up in these arrangements. Frankly, the government has treated those people disgracefully. There is no compensation available to them. They made a prudent deCision on the basis of the information on the legislation that was available to them at the time. They acted in even accordance with good, sound commercial judgment. They wanted to have some control over their retirement and to provide some contribution to their retirement income. Many of them wanted to invest in Australia, to do something for Australian companies, and so they wanted to maintain that opportunity. Those people have been disadvantaged by the government's change of policy. The government needs to address that issue. I know that there is an inquiry. I welcome the inquiry. I trust that it will be a genuine and searching inquiry, but it comes too late for these people. They are already being affected. Their pensions are being chopped apart. That applies to veterans and to aged pensioners as well. Many are also being unjustly and unfairly affected by these managed investment rules. In particular, it is the philosophy of these proposals which is so utterly wrong. The government suggests that pensioners should maximise their income. It says they should try to make their own arrangements for their retirement and yet, month after month, the government introduces proposals which disadvantage those who take the government's advice, those who actually do something about caring for their retirement income needs. Pensioners and ageing people should be rewarded for putting money aside for their retirement. New penalties should not be put in place. The philosophy of our approach to aged care and aged incomes should be adjusted to take that into account. Hopefully, the inquiry will do that. The Senate amendment was a commendable step in that direction. It ought to have been accepted by the government. The reasons put forward in this draft statement are inadequate. They do not adequately address the issues. They show all the signs of being prepared hastily and without adequate consideration of the issues. They should be rejected for that reason.",26
61,Mr BRADFORD,NOES,"I had the opportunity earlier this morning to make remarks along the lines of those of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). Having canvassed those issues and the issues raised by the shadow minister for social security, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), on many occasions in this place, I think it is probably a pointless exercise to go over it again. Nevertheless, I want to underline the points made by the honourable member for Wide Bay in respect of the procedure that was adopted here. I do not think that these reasons that the House of Representatives is giving to the Senate will be acceptable to the Senate. In fact, I hope they are not, and that of course going to create a problem for the government. Whilst I have little in common with any of the Australian Democrats, I am pleased on this occasion, as I have been on previous occasions, that the Democrats seem to have some understanding of the concerns of the retired and of the veterans community. I am prepared to give credit where credit is due and I believe it is due. I hope that the Democrats will not be swayed by these reasons and that they will hold firm on this matter. Then the government will have some difficult decisions to make as to how it proceeds. I want to answer one question that was posed by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). I listened very carefully to the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) when he first came in here this morning and indicated why the government was not going to accept the Senate amendment. I want to tell the House-because it is very enlightening as to how things worked here-that the statement of reasons which we eventually got from the committee which met for about three seconds bears a remarkable similarity to the remarks that were made in the first instance by the parliamentary secretary. Therefore, I take it that this ad hoc committerm tee that met very briefly gave very little consideration to putting up cogent reasons for the Senate and merely rubber-stamped the remarks that were originally made by the parliamentary secretary. I hope that the Senate will see through this farcical procedure and will not accept these reasons and that the Senate will continue to maintain its support for the amendment which it sent back to this place.",27
62,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NOES,"CalwellParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (11.21 a.m.)-in replyThe honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) raises some important concerns. I referred to those concerns earlier when I first is talked about the review, and I can assure him that the review will take into account the concerns that he raises and it will be a genuine and wide-ranging review with much public input. Honourable members do not need to have any concerns about the review being very substantial in that sense. The point made by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) indicates that his approach to the review was slightly different from that of the honourable member for Wide Bay. He maintains that the review itself is a recognition of fundamental unfairness in the system and that therefore we should not proceed with these amendments. If the honourable member for Berowra had been here when I made. the original explanation, he would know that what these amendments are doing is ensuring that there is an equivalence and & fairness in the system at the moment. It is not appropriate to have a situation where, because there is a review, we allow a completely different and unfair situation vis-a-vis two categories of pensioners: the veterans pensioners and the aged care pensioners. That situation cannot be allowed to continue simply because there is a review. We need to have an equivalence here, and we will have an equivalence if this legislation is passed through the SenateMr Tim Fischer-A level playing field?",27
63,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NOES,"No, that is not a that I tend to use. That is an economic rationalist term that I prefer to avoid. The professor over there uses it quite a bit but I prefer to avoid it. Dr Kemp-We know where you are coming from.",27

66,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NOES,"The situation is that we want this equivalence. As I mentioned, the review is there and it is a very important review. It wi1llook into all of those concerns raised by pensioners, veterans and by a number of community organisations. I have already invited the opposition to participate and work with us in making sure that the review is comprehensive and deals with those issues.

Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration in Committee of the Whole House forthwith. Senate s amendmentClause 5, page 3, after subparagraph (2)(b)(i), insert the following paragraph: ""(is) the other person is of the opposite sex;"". Motion (by Dr Theophanous) proposed: That the amendment be agreed to.",28
67,Mr ANDREWS,NOES,"Menzies) (11.26 a.m.)Mr Deputy Chairman, I rise to indicate that the coalition will be supporting this amendment. I do feel it is important to place on record the nature of this particular amendment which is being moved by the government, to put it in the context of the legislation itself, and to indicate the reasons that this amendment is necessarily brought back here to the House of Representatives, having been moved in the Senate. The amendment relates to part of the Child Care Rebate Bill in the definition sections under the heading 'Definition of family'. We are talking about a section of an act of the Commonwealth parliament which relates to families, and about the way in which this government has sought to define families in this piece of legislation-coming, as it does, on the eve of the International Year of the Family. The proposal, as the bill originally placed before the parliament provided, was that a person could claim a child-care rebate on the basis of being the partner of another person. There were two categories for being able to claim a child-care rebate. The first one, which is not controversial, was if the person was legally married to the other person and was not, in the managing director's opinion, living separately and apart from the other person on a permanent basis. That category deals quite clearly with people who are legally married to each other and are not in a situation where they have separated and where it therefore would be inappropriate for a child-care rebate to be paid. The second proposal in this legislation is put in the following terms, prior to this amendment being moved and adopted: (b) all of the following conditions are met: (i) the person is living with the other person; (ii) the person is not legally married to the other person (iii) the relationship between the person and the other person is, in the Managing Director's opinion ... a marriage-like relationship; On the face of it, that may seem rather unexceptionable, except that the import or effect of this, had it been carried into law in Australia, was to say that the definition of family, as it says in the bill itself, for the purposes of the Commonwealth law of Australia and for the purposes of this act, includes those persons who ,are living in same-sex relationships. Thus, if a homosexual couple, for example, wish to live together and one of those persons has a child, then of course a rebate can nonnally be paid there. But it also means that a rebate could be claimed by the other partner on the basis that this government is saying that that relationship constitutes a family in Australia. It was only when this matter was raised in the Senate-in particular, by Senator Harradine and Senator Herron-that this matter came to the notice of honourable members of this parliament. It is interesting to note some of the debate which occurred in the Senate on this topic, and the contribution to that debate by the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley. In the Senate Hans(lrd on 24 November 1993, she said this: The definitions that Senator Harradine has just taken us through make it clear that the reach is to recognise what are commonly called de facto relationships and to include other arrangements where people may be in a relationship. In this it would allow the inclusion of people of the same sex who have the responsibility and care of children. So quite clearly, quite unambiguously, the Minister for Family Services was saying in the Senate on 24 November this year that those persons who are living in same-sex relationships will, for the purposes of this Commonwealth law, be regarded as a family. How many other Australians would regard that ideal of a family as one which ought to be legislated for and written down in the laws of Australia? Dr Kemp-They are right out of touch with Australian families. Mr ANDREWSAs my honourable colleague has said, they are entirely out of touch with ordinary Australians. Of course, when this matter was raised in the Senate, Senator Crowley was forced to back down. What she said later on was that she wished to place on record that that was an unintended consequence of drafting. We are talking about a minister who is also on the public record as saying that the way in which we talk about families and define families in this country is by self-definition. That is, people can say simply that they are a family and that will do. The minister is on record as saying that. If she is so ingenuous as to say that then how would she say that this was an unintended consequence of drafting? Unintended my foot. We are talking about a minister of the Commonwealth of Australia who has a department to advise her of a bill which is drafted by Parliamentary Counsel. Instructions for that bill are given and we have here a definition of family whereby, for the first time, it is proposed in relation to Commonwealth laws that it be extended in this way. That is hardly unintended. As a result of these matters being raised in the Senate, and Senator Harradine described it as a try-on by the minister, the government was severely embarrassed and so we have now the amendment which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) brings back to the case, House after it was adopted by the Senate. As I said, the opposition will not be opposing this amendment. In fact, we support it wholeheartedly because the effect of the amendment is to place into the second part of the definition of family, that is, the definition that recognises that de facto couples for the purpose of law can be regarded as families and therefore able to claim a child-care rebate, the requirement that the other person is of the opposite sex. What it does is recognise that de facto couples do live in family relationships. Nobody would deny that any more than people would say that a sole parent-where one partner has left for whatever reason, whether it is death, divorce or separation-and a child is a family unit. This clearly indicates that de facto relationships are, in the conventional sense of de facto relationships, between persons of the opposite sex. I thought it important to place on record the import of this amendment and to place on the record the reasons why this amendment has been introduced here. I do not intend to say any more other than to indicate that the coalition will be supporting the amendment.",28
68,Mr BRADFORD,NOES,"I am delighted that the government is supporting this amendment. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) was strangely quiet in his remarks in outlining the reasons for the government's acceptance of this amendment. In fact, he did not say anything at all so I only assume that the government is severely embarrassed by this particular try-on having failed. As the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) pointed out, this is a particularly important amendment which we are dealing with here because it really gets to the very core of what family is all about. I congratulate the Senate, Senator Herron, and particularly Senator Harradine. I think Senator Harradine, the Independent senator from Tasmania, who is often derided for his views, does a remarkable job representing his constituency. I believe that this parliament, and the Senate in particular, is very much better for the presence of someone of the calibre and commitment and beliefs of Senator Harradine. I say that without any reservation whatsoever. Mr Thckey-He is equalled by the honourable member for Menzies.",29
69,Mr BRADFORD,NOES,"We know we have got people of equal calibre in this House as well. I believe that Senator Crowley has no credibility at all. I understand that she is even embarrassing her colleagues in that she somehow appeared as Minister for Family Services and, in my view, ever since she took on that role she would be better termed the minister for family disservices. She has the very important role of overseeing the Australian government's involvement in the International Year of the Family, yet every pronouncement she has made-pronouncements echoed recently by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-indicates to me that we ought to be very concerned about the direction in which this government is taking this country in respect of family .. It is very easy to moralise or make judgments when we get into this particular area. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) touched on one important issue. It may be difficult ultimately to determine what a family is. I think that these days we need to recognise that in practice families assume different complexions. I do not think anyone believes that is ideal. The traditional family, the intact family, by almost everybody's admission is still the best possible situation that can occur. Anything outside of that is, in can my view and the view of a very large number of people in the community and in this place, less than desirable. I do believe that we need to decide at least what a family is not. That is the point of this amendment. I would like to think that this was some sort of a drafting error, although, having observed this government in action and its attitude to families over the last few years, I am not sure that I would be so charitable as to suggest that it was not other than what certain senators thought it was, a pure try-on in respect of bringing into legislation and the law of the Commonwealth some recognition of certain relationships which, in my view, are clearly not family relationships. Unfortunately, I was not here when the Child Care Rebate Bill was discussed in detail, but the fiasco of this bill has caused enormous concern in the community, and rightly so, because from the start it was a further attempt by this government at social engineering of the worse kind. It attempted from the start somehow to suggest that children were better off being cared for by people other than their parents. I refute that very strongly. I am not going to take up too much time arguing the point this morning as to the availability of child care and so on, but I do make the point that I believe, and many experts believe, parents ought to be able to have the choice to look after their own children when those children are young. The great irony of the present situation, the explosion of the availability of child care, has been that people can actually pay someone to look after their own children but do not have that particular service recognised if they provide it themselves for their own children. I am very concerned about the direction taken by the child-care industry. There has been an explosion of child-care centres and there are entrepreneurs out there advertising enormous returns on investment for people who put their money into child-care centres, based on the fact that these centres can be built and, because they are heavily subsidised through the fee system by the government, there are huge profits to be made. Very often the people who are getting access to those child-care centres are, ironicalmatter ly, not the people who really need to .have their children in those centres. The people who are going to those child-care centres in my electorate are very often low income earners with both parties unemployed. They are then in the category where they can send their children off to a child-care centre five days a week and get a 75 or 80 per cent subsidy for that particular arrangement when, in many respects, they are ideally suited to substantially take care of their own children. People who need child care cannot afford it any more. The fact that this arrangement has forced prices up from about $12 or $13 a day on average a couple of years ago to an average of $24 or $25 a day means that people on average earnings and slightly above that who need child care because both parties in the family are working can no longer afford child care. The whole system is in a mess. This ham-fisted attempt at some accreditation is, as I said, blatant social engineering. It is extreme in every respect, and it has been objected to within the more credible and thinking, parts of the child-care industry. I am' delighted that this particular amendment has been sent to us by the Senate because it is extremely significant, and I am pleased that the government is accepting it. I hope the parliamentary secretary indicates when we do submit it that there is a recognition by the government that this is an important amendment. His introductory remarks did nothing to indicate to me other than that the government was embarrassed about the whole thing and just wanted to shoot it through or sneak it through here as quickly as possible.",30
70,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NOES,"CalwellParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (11.42 a.m.)-The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) persists in misrepresenting me but I cannot do anything about it. I actually did make initial remarks because I wanted to hear the debate from the opposition and I now have a couple of things to say in response. The government is not embarrassed. What has happened here is a clarification of a that arose in relation to this. The Minister for Family Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Crowley) has said that this was an unintended consequence of the drafting and that the government is committed to the definition of a family with respect to those eligible for child-care rebate in which only relationships between persons of the opposite sex will be recognised as constituting a family for the purpose of clause 5. This amendment will maintain consistency with the social security legislation. Before pious people get on their high horses and pretend that only honourable members of the opposition and Senator Harradine pointed to this unintended consequence, I point out that that is not correct. In fact, there were a number of honourable members on the government side who also pointed this out. The matter has been corrected and the government's position has been made clear. Any attempt to make cheap political points in relation to the definition of the family is nonsense. It has been made perfectly clear to those people who have been concerned about this matter that the government's definition of 'family' with respect to this and the social security legislation refers to relationships betweeq persons of the opposite sex. Those people who contacted me, including certain religious leaders who were concerned about this unintended consequence, will be well satisfied, I am sure, with the government's clarification of this matter. I do not want to continue to hear these pious noises from the opposition suggesting that they are the only ones who can correct problems of this kind when they arise. In fact, government members also played a significant role. Finally, the eligibility of children of single parents who live in a same-sex relationship will not be affected by this amendment provided, of course, that all other eligibility conditions are met. Obviously, if there is a same-sex relationship and there is a parent of the child there, that parent will still be eligible for the rebate. So it does not actually affect the concrete situation in terms of eligibility for child care for that parent; but we have taken steps to clarify the definition of family. I think the matter should be allowed to rest there.",31
71,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"I do not normally speak on these matters, but I was somewhat surprised by the. comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government· and Community Services and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) that members of the Australian Labor Party were concerned about this matter; that there was an unintended consequence; that this was a natural correction; and that it was unreasonable for members on this side of the House to raise the matter. I suggest that there is an abundance of evidence to support the contention that the case is otherwise. This is no unintended consequence. It is part of a deliberate attempt by the government to utilise every opportunity to restructure the laws of this country in such a way as to suggest that 'family' means something more than we have understood it to mean in this country over a long period. That is not to say that there is a lack of recognition that, while the ideal family may comprise a father, a mother, children and an extended family, there are situations in which there might be, through bereavement or changed circumstances, families that do not fit the ideal. However, it is important that members be aware of what has been happening. I do not think honourable members would be aware of this, so I will recount something that I witnessed recently When I had the great privilege of representing Australia at the World Conference on Human Rights. In the context of a review of the speech to be given by Australia in the general committee in relation to future developments in international human rights, we had the opportunity of reading a draft speech which adverted to the need, through international covenants, to deal with homosexual relationships and to characterise them in the same way as familial relationships, and to provide them with the same level of protection and benefits. That speech sought international support for international covenants that would meet this objective. Senator Harradine and I drew attention to this matter that was included in the speech. We asked whether it represented government policy. I told the leader, Ms Penny Wensley, who was representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), that thisought to be referred back to Australia for advice. She agreed, being the consummate diplomat that she is, that the speech should not go forward in that form without being checked. Advice was sought from the Commonwealth Attorney-General as to whether or not the speech should proceed in that form; the advice from the Attorney-General was that it should proceed. I can only say that I know that from my own participation in that conference. It is very hard to come into this place and to say that this was some unintended consequence which people had not been turning their minds to or trying to address. The fact is that people have been turning their minds to this question. What they are looking for is not only what they can do in our laws but also how they can be constrained in the future in the way in which they legislate by requiring international laws that will legitimise it. If the parliamentary secretary wants us to believe otherwise, he is going to have to search high and low amongst his colleagues for an explanation as to what they have been doing: Quite frankly, it is clear to me that this is part of a wider agenda and that 'they-that is, the ministers who are involved in it-were found out. They recognise now that it has some dangerous consequences. I am sure there were bishops talking to Labor ministers and to Labor members. I am sure that happened. I am sure they had to try to make an excuse, and that is what we heard today. Quite frankly, if the parliamentary secretary does not know, he ought to find out. If he does know the truth and the background to these matters, he ought not to come into this parliament and try to spin us a line and say, 'Please do not hold us accountable; we were innocent. We had no intention of making this major alteration; it was an unintended consequence'. If he really believes it, he should go and find out what has been going on in his own party. Do not come if! here and spin us a line.",32
72,Mr FILING,NOES,"I wish to speak briefly to this amendment. I am also very concerned about the explanation by the parliamentary secretary as to the change in definition as some, so-called, unseen or unforeseen consequence. I say that because I am aware of Senator Crowley's views on a number of issues. I would say that that unforeseen consequence-in other words the original intent of the legislation-would be entirely consistent with her philosophy; entirely consistent with the approach to the definition of families. Honourable members may recall that in George Orwell's famous work, 1984, there were three ministries: one was the ministry of love, which dealt with hate; one was the ministry of peace, which dealt with war; and the other was the ministry of truth, which dealt with lies. We have a situation where we have a ministry for family services which deals with everything but families. If families are defined as widely as possible, the entire definition of family becomes meaningless. If any relationship can become defined as a family then, philosophically, the family itself becomes some sort of ephemeral concept that has no real meaning and can therefore be dispensed with in the scheme of things by the government. I am mightily concerned with this march of social engineering that we are seeing. At every opportunity, the government makes some sort of attempt to change the forms, the meanings and the definitions of the institutions which, for the vast majority of Australians, have provided the community with a standard of living and a lifestyle in a country with which they have been happy. Under this government and the accelerated changes that have been made since the re-election of the Keating government-a most unfortunate event as far as the future of this country is concerned-these social engineering changes are being pushed through at a very alarming rate. The other aspect of this was the extraordinary statement of reasons that was somehow provided earlier today before the appointment of the committee that allegedly dealt with it. The procedures and the processes have been mightily abused. Any excuse that somehow this extended definition of family was some unforeseen consequence is entirely incredible. I think the parliamentary secretary and his colleagues ought to be thoroughly ashamed of themselves for coming into this place and pretending otherwise. Question resolved in the affirmative.

73,Mr ANDREWS,TRAINING FUNDING LAWS,"I indicate at the outset that the coalition will be concurring, . albeit reluctantly, with these amendments which have been brought back to this place from the Senate. In indicating that agreement, I would like to say something about the background to this matter, because it raises a very serious issue about the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states in relation to the provision of vocational education and training in Australia. I think that the ministers for education in four of the states of Australia, and J suspect the new minister for education in South Australia, would concur with my view that an amendment which was introduced at the last moment by the government when the bill was first in this place seriously undermines the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states and the agreement between the Commonwealth and the states relating to the provision of vocational education and training. The· Commonwealth and the states agreed a couple of years ago that there was a need to try to provide further vocational education and training in Australia. We hear the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) from time to time crowing, to use his words, about the massive improvement in education under the Labor government, but part of that massive improvement in education was the Commonwealth Labor government decreasing its provision of funding for vocational education and training from a figure of about $460 million in 1984 to less than half that amount in 1991-92. Some massive improvement in education and training that is! We also know that the TAFE participation rate of students in this country over the period of the six to eight years of the Labor Party stayed the same. What we had under this grand conceptualisation of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) when he was Minister for Employment, Education and Training was this ideal that we should reduce the divide between the universities and the colleges of advanced education, which divide is being put back in place today. We had this other notion that we should try to give every student an opportunity to go to university, although at that time the participation rate of Australian students higher education was one of the highest in the OECD. Yet, at the same time, when we had a very low participation rate of vocational education and training-the training that gives young people in Australia the very skills that they need to get a job-we had a government that turned a blind eye to vocational education and training in Australia for a period of almost a decade. Dr Kemp--ut they destroyed the colleges, too.",33
74,Mr ANDREWS,TRAINING FUNDING LAWS,"And the government destroyed the colleges, too, as the honourable member for Goldstein points out. This was a deliberate policy to ignore vocational training and education in Australia, and a deliberate policy to look at a different direction. One has to ask: to what extent is the level of youth unemployment in this country contributed to by the fact that we have not provided an adequate and ideal system·. of vocational education in Australia? If my words are not sufficient for people to believe what I am saying, then I invite anybody who is listening to read chapter 3 of the government's green paper which confirms everything that I am saying and says that the government neglected this area of education. It is against this background that we are talking about an agreement which was finally arrived at between the Commonwealth and the states to provide a higher level of funding to this important area for our young people and also for the future in terms of the international competitiveness of this country. That agreement provided that the states would pool their money with the Commonwealth, and then that money would be allocated back to the states at least in the equal proportion that the states had first contributed and, in addition to that, growth funding would be provided by the Commonwealth. The structure that was set up-the Australian National Training Authority-was to be overseen by a ministerial council comprising the ministers for vocational education in each of the states, the Commonwealth Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the Commonwealth Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. On that in ministerial council the Commonwealth would have the· casting vote. The agreement between the governments to establish this ministerial council provided that the ministerial council would oversee the direction of vocational education and training and, if any of the states were not meeting their commitment, it would remain the responsibility of the ministerial council-that is, the collective state and Commonwealth ministers-to do something about it and perhaps impose some penalty on those states. The Australian National Training Authority was to give advice to the ministerial council in this regard. What does the government do in this bill? At the last moment before the bill was brought on for debate in the House of Representatives, the government moved an amendment. The effect of this amendment is that the Commonwealth minister may withhold funds to any of the states, including the Commonwealth funds. We have here a cooperative arrangement entered into between the Commonwealth and the states which says, 'Cooperatively we will establish a ministerial council, and if any of the states renege on their agreement the cooperative ministerial council will decide whether there is some penalty that ought to flow to that state'. What does the Commonwealth then do? At the last moment, unbeknown to the states and, I am infonned, unbeknown to the Australian National Training Authority, the Commonwealth introduces an amendment to the legislation which says, in effect, that the Commonwealth minister can completely ignore anything that is said by any of his colleagues in the states of Australia, even though they are primarily responsible for this area of education. The Commonwealth minister can simply ignore what they may have to say as a collective body, and in his opinion-fonned on whatever basis he thinks fit-he can simply withhold funding from the . states. The Commonwealth government and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training every now and again bemoan the fact that the states are seeking to assert their rights in relation to vocational education and training because somehow this is a states rights issue. If anything has occurred this that would give the states of Australia reason to believe that the Commonwealth was not prepared to act in a cooperative and understanding manner with regard to this funding, then it is this precise amendment that was introduced by the government. The states are rightly saying, 'Why are you reneging? Why are you tearing up an agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the states in relation to this matter?'. In addition to being able to simply withhold Commonwealth funds, one of the state ministers for education has received advice that indicates that the effect of this amendment would be to allow the Commonwealth to withhold from the state the funds which that state itself had put into the pool in the first place. If there has ever been an example of the centralist, corporatist approach that this government takes to affairs dealing with the states, this is clearly it. The Commonwealth is saying, 'We don't give a damn about the agreement that was entered into between the Commonwealth and the states. We are prepared to tear up this agreement and say that we will force legislation through this parliament which will give the final decision to the Commonwealth minister himself'. It is for those reasons that we are reluctant to support this amendment which was moved by the Australian Democrats in the Senate, when our amendment to ensure that it was the responsibility of the ministerial council was defeated. We are reluctant to support the Democrats' amendment because, in effect, it does nothing. The amendment says that the minister, before fonning his opinion, must seek and have regard to any advice provided by the authority. Under the heads of government agreement, one of the functions of the al,lthority is to provide advice to the minister and the ministerial council. The Democrats' amendment does nothing that is not in the agreement itself. We will support it because at least it says the minister has to have regard to advice; although that advice is advice which he has had to have regard to, in any event. We will therefore support this amendment, but it simply does not go far enough and does year not undo the damage which this government has sought to wreak on the agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. It is another example of a centralist mentality which says that states have no rights at all. This is clearly another example of that. Question resolved in the affinnative.

76,Mr SNOW,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the European Institutions and Belgium. The delegation visited Europe between 12 September and 1 October 1993. As honourable members will be aware, this was a critical time in European politics, with issues such as the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the finalisation of the Uruguay Round of GATT, continuing negotiations in relation to the Blair House accord, the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism and the tragic problems. in the former Yugoslavia receiving much attention and debate. It was in this context that I had the privilege to lead the Australian delegation that visited several important European Report institutions, including the European Parliament, the European Commission, NATO, the North Atlantic Assembly, the European Court of Justice and the Council of Europe. The report of the delegation records in some detail the meetings and discussions that were held at these institutions. I will not take the time of the House to review all of those. However, there are three observations I wish to make. Firstly, like the other members of the delegation, I formed the view that Europe is in a period of significant change and some uncertainty. On the economic front, the global recession has resulted in high rates of unemployment in most countries of the community, a loss of competitiveness of European industry and low or negative rates of economic growth. In central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union there are immense problems of economic restructuring and political stability, with governments in those regions trying to balance reform against mounting unemployment and social deprivation. On the political front, progress towards a new era of integration and cooperation within Europe is less certain, and it seems that many of the institutions will consolidate rather than extend the progress that has been made. There have been several contributing factors to this situation, including the effective collapse of the European exchange rate mechanisms and the failure of European nations, through their institutions, to redress the problems in the former Yugoslavia. In relation to Yugoslavia, may I just add that the delegation was dismayed when told from its delegates in the European Parliament that the conflict in the former Yugoslavia may be resolved only with the onset of battle fatigue and that institutions such as the parliament do not possess the collective will or the institutional mechanisms necessary to address this tragic issue. Secondly, the House should be aware that the members of this delegation, in the many meetings they had at these institutions with parliamentarians, business organisations and farming organisations, strongly advocated the finalisation of the Uruguay Round and the Blair House accord. We said that this was the minimum acceptable position to Australia and the Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries. Members of the delegation made forceful presentations emphasising that the common agricultural policy of the European Community and, in particular, subsidies and third market interventions are having a significant adverse effect on Australian farmers. In this respect, I recall the powerful statement of my colleague the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) to the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Australia and New Zealand. His remarks reminded one member of the European Parliament of our nation's approach to football. The third matter I wish to refer to briefly relates to APEC. The Europeans whom we met were keenly interested in APEC and the possibility of it emerging as the Asia-Pacific response to European and North American trade blocs. I and other members of the delegation, particularly our deputy leader, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), informed our European colleagues of the aims and objectives of APEC and counselled strongly against any developments that would lead to 'fortress Europe', 'fortress America' and 'fortress Asia'. As leader of the delegation, I was honoured to be able to make a statement in the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly debate on the OECD. The Australian delegation was also in attendance when the Secretary-General of the OECD, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, delivered the annual report on OECD activities and the world economic outlook. The delegation found it anomalous that the forum for these debates is the Council of Europe, in which there are non-members of the OECD seated for this occasion. Accordingly, the delegation's report contained an important recommendation that the federal government initiate a proposal to establish a parliamentary forum involving all members of the OECD, particularly the United States, at which the annual report and activities of the OECD can be reviewed and discussed. It is our view that Australia can playa leading role in bringing this proposal to fruition. Our visit to Europe and its institutions also incorporated a bilateral visit to Belgium as guests of the Belgium parliament. The delegation received a very warm welcome from the presiding officers and parliamentarians. Our program in Belgium was detailed and comprehensive and we found our briefings at the Belgium National Radio Isotopes Institute and the National Labour and Central Economic Councils particularly enlightening. I would also like to make some comments about the delegation, which I believe is one of the most important conducted by this parliament. The delegation provides a very real opportunity for Australian parliamentarians to gain detailed knowledge of current issues and concerns in Europe and to provide the European institutions with first-hand information on Australia and the region. It is a marvellous educative process and I am sure all the members of this delegation are now able, with significant insight, to understand the organisations and processes that operate behind the plethora of acronyms associated with the European institutions and policies-I will not set them a test-such as CSCE, WEU, NACC, NAA, EMU, EMS, ERM and EP. This was the first delegation that I have been on and it was an added privilege to be its leader. I wish to record my thanks to the deputy leader, the right honourable member for New England, who, with his distinguished background in portfolios such as trade, primary industry, social security and defence, was a great source of knowledge and support. I thank our secretary, Neil Bessell, who was always willing to work day and night to ensure the success of our delegation and dealt with all the rushing about, the changes and the emergencies. He is a great organiser. The delegation worked extremely well together and I think it is a compliment to the delegation as a whole that we were described by a member of the European Parliament as 'a most business like, professional and friendly group of people'. Apart from the honourable member for MCEwen and the right honourable member for New England, whom I have mentioned"" I also thank Senator Noel Crichton-Browne for his perceptive contribution to our discussions and reports and Senator Cheryl Kernot for her cooperation and goodjudgment which endeared her to all we called on. To be able to serve with two natural and experienced leaders such as the right honourable member for New England and Cheryl Kernot is a tribute to them more than to me. We were very much strengthened in our work by the successful arguments of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) on behalf of people, as well as the economy, and the common sense of the honourable m-mber for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), which was qUietly very effective in our negotiations. We all wish him well in recovering from his health incapacity following our return to Australia. As with all delegations, there are many people whose skill and expertise enhance its work. I believe our report faithfully records our gratitude to these people. Nevertheless there are two groups who deserve speciai mention. Our thanks go to Mr Jan Claes and Mr Michel Vande borne, our liaison officers from the Belgium parliament who worked tirelessly during our bilateral visit. I am also sure that every member of the delegation would join with me in extending our special thanks to the Australian ambassador in Belgium, Mr Ted Pocock, his wife, Meg, and first secretary at the embassy, Mr Ted Knez, for their outstanding contribution to the work o.f the delegation which, I must say, continued rIght through the delegation's visit to Europe.",36
77,Mr S,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I Jom wtth the leader of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the European Institutions and Belgium, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), and other members in reporting to this parliament and to tell a little of our visit to the European institutions. To the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and to each of the other members of the delegation, I extend on behalf of my wife and myself our thanks for what were a very harmonious and productive few weeks in discussions and dialogue across a breadth of very important subjects that I think all of us found challenging with institutions. To the delegation leader' and Neil Bessell the delegation secretary, I extend particula; compliments. Neil was undoubtedly a terrier in. the way he kept us up to the mark and provided excellent secretarial"" services. Administration is an important issue particularly if a delegation is more than sightseeing. I have little doubt that the work that was required of the secretarial staff, and in particular those who assisted Mr Bessell from our embassy in Brussels, went beyond the ordinary, in that on one occasion they had to stay up all night because of the lack of facilities to try to prepare what was undoubtedly one of the major contributions made by the delegation-a speech on the OECD debate in the Council of Europe. Let me divide my remarks into three. Before I speak about Belgium, I mention the delegation's visits to the institutions of Europe. There are several of these institutions as my friend and colleague the honourablmember for Eden-Monaro has said. Most are known by acronyms which are generally unknown on this side of the world. The difficulties in Europe are undoubted. There is still a tendency to fragment. In our visit, we went to the battlefields of Waterloo as well as the battlefields of World War I and World War II. In Australia, we tend to forget that the Europeans have been fighting each other for so long that it is little wonder that there are enormous difficulties in each coming to grips with the prejudices of the past. That is perhaps evident in the break-up of the former Yugoslavia and in the conflict between the Serbs and the Croats, the difficulties in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the problems in Macedonia. The genesis of the European parliament, as I understand it, came from an idea from Winston Churchill that there should be a parliament of Europe to renect opportuniti- given in the British institutions, and there IS now some chance to air these views. On many issues, we did not see that division, but in the debate with the committee for Australia and New Zealand within the European parliament we did learn that there are still fundamental differences. It is good that there is a forum within which these can be aired. For all that we found,· it is a, little paradoxical that the European parliament has been meeting in a building owned and occupied by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. It is quite a magnificent building. It is a bit like this place in that one has to walk miles before one gets anywhere, but it is reasonably functional. Because the European commissioners essentially meet in Brussels, they decided to build a new parliament there. That is now complete. I understand that Mr Speaker and the Clerk of the parliament recently visited the new building in Brussels to have a look at electronic voting. Not only are they building this new· building in Brussels but also they are building a new parliament in Strasbourg. When we think of the extravagance of which some accuse us in this building, we need to understand that over there they are going to even greater extremes that I found very hard to justify. They will have a new parliament in Brussels and a new parliament in Strasbourg. Meanwhile, the Council of Europe building-which I gather is not used all of the year-would quite easily be capable of being used for the purpose of the meetings of the European parliament. There are areas and expenditures that one wonders about and questions, particularly at a time when so much more could be done. The tragedy is that, while there is an opportunity for dialogue and for people to express views-perhaps that might help to ease the risk of conflict-they do not seem to be able to do anything about a substantive issue such as the resolution of the problems of BosniaHerzegovina or Macedonia. It is quite appalling that they have this institution and that they have the apparent capacity for people to bring together the wish of governments, parliamentarians and people but that when it comes to a difficult decision nothing can be done. That is one of the difficult challenges for the Europeans themselves to face. If the Europeans say, 'Look, this is a European problem', and they do not do anything about it, the rest of the world will obviously not respect them and will say, 'What the devil are you people really about?'. It is an issue worth bearing in mind, coming as it does after what was seen as the brave new world order post Operation Desert Storm and the war in the Gulf and the feeling that suddenly international pressures would be able to apply some sort of discipline to the recalcitrants-if I might use that word misused by the Prime Minister. It is a problem. I think it needs to be understood that those of us who come from afar and admire their institutions, their history and capacity in so many fields are somewhat appalled that the Europeans are unable to control themselves in issues so fundamental as trying to allow the transition from a dictatOrship to democracy to take place without the appalling loss of life that has occurred in the former Yugoslavia. Some other forums are worthwhile mentioning- I found particularly fascinating the European Court of Justice. It was quite remarkable. Ms Maxwell, the twin sister of the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell),is one of the very skilled interpreters who functions there. In our report, we have spoken about the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg and the wonderful night that we had with Ms Maxwell and her husband Mr Ove Carlssen and their family. The purpose of that court needs to be understood in the context of our own High Court. The Europeans are only beginning to learn of the consequences of having a federation. The European court deals with each of the separate countries which are members of the European Community. It is remarkable that they are able to make the decisions that they do which come on appeal after the matter has fallen foul of the system in one way or another in their own national jurisdictions. They come to the European Court of Justice. A large number of decisions have been given. The way in which the decisions are apparently being accepted is quite remarkable. It provides some hope for those countries which are members of the European Community. There are problems in what we would see as their area of interest. On at least 3,000 occasions where judgments have been given involving community law they have been applied by the member states. I think that provides hope for the future. We all have pride that there is an Australian participating as an extraordinarily skilled interpreter in forum. . We have made a recommendation in the report. Above all, this is a way in which we can .give new meaning to our participation in the DECO. Dver the years, I have been fairly cynical about some of our international organisations. I think there are too many, they are too extravagant, cost us a great deal and most of them have about 10 times as many bureaucrats and administrators as they need. Having been President of the Food and Agricultural Drganisation of the United Nations, I will never forget that it had more employees based in the headquarters in Rome than it had out in the field, yet the organisation is supposed to be there to help the developing countries. I remain cynical of many of these bodies. The DECO has a very important role to play. Fundamentally, this delegation's role was to go to Europe to talk in the DECO debate in the Council of Europe. I will not go into the nuances of the Council of Europe and the difference between it and the European parliament other than to say that the Council of Europe embraces a lot wider constituency than the European parliament. The problem is that the Council of Europe embraces a lot of countries which are not members of the DECO. We went over there, as members of the DECO, to hear the annual report from Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the Secretary-General of the DECO, but we went to conduct it in a body of which a significant percentage of members are non-members of the DECO. We were invited, as non-members of the Council of Europe, to participate in a debate on the DECO, an organisation of which we are members, but other members of the Council of Europe are not members of the DECO. So that anomaly struck us as being quite ridiculous. But what makes it even worse, and we are all generally conscious of this, is that one of the challenges international organisations face today is getting equal participation. Funding these organisations is very hard, as it is with most of these bodies, because of the sheer size of the American economy. The Americans are very important in the whole of the DECO, but who does not that participate? The United States. As there was no United States delegation in these discussions, there was no opportunity for it to speak about the DECO, which presumably the United States has views on. That is what I recall from the occasion that I visited. the DECO forum as a ministerial delegate representing Australia, and it struck all of us as being absolutely ridiculous. So what we have to do is find a way in which we can set up a parliamentary forum of DECO members to talk about DECO matters. I commend very strongly to the government the recommendations that we have made on page 32 of our report under part 4(11). Recommendation 2 really helps to identify that anomaly and asks why there cannot be a meeting-preferably, I guess, in Europeprior to the meeting of the Council of Europe to discuss the DECO where all the member countries of the DECO can get together. What we have suggested is that there should be a parliamentary forum. The Australian government shquld raise that matter at the next ministerial council of the DECO and suggest that a meeting be held. I suggest that Australia should take the initiative. I doubt that it will be very convenient to have the DECO parliamentary meeting in Australia; although, were I a minister, I would say that we would be prepared to host that meeting. But I think, before that Council of Europe meeting, we ought to see whether we can set up a parliamentary forum on the DECO. That would enable all the members of the DECO to get together, and it would certainly allow the Americans to come. We could share views and see just what their views are. I thought some of the views of the Japanese, Canadians and others were fairly interesting. We met some of those other delegations, and we have suggested that it would be helpful on future occasions for there to be an opportunity to meet them before the Council of Europe debate. It is ridiculous to go to the Council of Europe, as non-members, to talk about a body of which we are a member. Having been to a few of those DECO ministerial forums, I think it would help, in presenting the general structure and identity of the purposes of the DECD, if a meeting of parliamentarians apart from that ministerial forum could talk about the issues as they affect the member countries of the DECD; and, of course, to receive the annual report from the Secretary-General of the DECD. We made other recommendations, but I do not intend to take up the time of the House with those. The recommendation I have referred to, in particular, is one that I commend to the parliament, and certainly to the government and trust that it might take action on it. The other matter I want to talk about concerns administration. We have made a number of recommendations with respect to administration in part 4(16) on page 33 of the report. I think that, if we are to have the value of delegations-goodness knows, we spend enough of the taxpayers' money sending ministers and members to conferences around the place-we ought to try to set up the administration arrangements so that people know what will go on first. We arrived at the European Parliament to find that a body existed which we did not really know aboutthat is, the Committee for Australia and New Zealand. A number of members of that committee have visited here on a number of occasions-in fact, some of them were here only a few weeks ago-and we found that they knew quite a deal about a range of subjects in which we all had an interest. We would not want to be caught short, for example, on a debate about migration at a time when there is considerable concern in Australia about aspects of detention, about refugees, and about how one can assess economic refugees as distinct from those subject to reasonable fear of persecution in their own county, as categorised by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. I think we need to be able to be briefed, and any future delegation needs to have some opportunity to know, on what subjects will be debated. My colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro quite properly wanted to raise a concern that all of us from rural Australia have about possible bans on the export of kangaroo meat to the European C:::ommunity. If that is going to be· done, .it would help enormously if we knew there would be an opportunity for us to debate those issues and· to present a case.· So we have to have prior knowledge of where we have to speak; some opportunity not only to react to the issues that other countries may raise but for us to initiate Ii few of our own too. I think that in that seilse we have to bear in mind that, if we are to have a working delegation,it needs to have access to a portable computer and printing facilities. Delegation members might have to use a manual typewriter all night in a laborious attempt to produce a worthwhile draft that can then be properly distributed, because everything has to be written. In all these bodies the delegates speak multiple languages and full everything has to be interpreted. Unless speeches are interpreted, justice is not done to a person's case. We forget that the advantage we have in this forum is that we all speak the one language. Instead of delegates speaking extempore, as I tend to do, written speeches have to be available for the interpreters or what is.said is likely to be not understQod. I think, therefore, it is important that that secretarial assistance be made available. I support the leader of the delegation in commending Ambassador Ted and Mrs Meg Pocock and Mr Ted Knez, who did a wonderful job in helping us. In Brussels, Belgium, as a part of being with them, we were able to have that tremendous privilege of visiting the European battlefields and to see those Australian war graves. There is no doubt that Australia is well served by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Mr Ron Wilson, who is the director of the north European area was of enormous service to us. We were helped by the administrator, Mr Ian Connerty, who was an absolute fund of knowledge. It became more memorable visiting those European battlefields with Mr Connerty, because he knew of the instances that took place there. If we stood on hill 60 he could tell of this group of men, that group of the men, and the battles that took place there. Envisaging the tragedy of that whole Ypres area in World War I was made a little easier simply by the knowledge that he had of the battles of that very sad period. But, for me, the most memorable of all experiences was to go into the tunnels under the Citadel of Verdun. Around Verdun, in France, before you come into Belgium on the western front, something like 500,000 people were killed. Of course, the citadel is a mediivaI castle. Underneath it are all these tunnels. Physical models have been reconstructed and, when you see them, you sense what must have happened. For our coming frbm a natural environment to go into the cold, closed, somewhat still environment of the citadel, to imagine thousands of people being incarcerated there for years, and then to go out to where battles were fought in trenches situated in absolutely unbelievably horrific circumstances, it brought back something of the horror of it all. Even though it is now 75 years past, I think we all owe a great deal to those who laid down their lives in those battlefields. Some might say it was a war that did not directly involve us. But for me the freedoms that we enjoy and the democracy of which this parliament is a part essentially exist because so long ago people laid down their lives to protect and guarantee us the right to say what we feel in this place.",38
78,Mr GIBSON,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I appreciate the opportunity to make a few comments on the parliamentary delegation to Europe, because it was a great privilege and pleasure to be a part of the delegation. The delegation had outstanding leadership from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) as deputy leader. It was a real pleasure for me to be able to work with those two gentlemen and with the other members of the delegation. As the right honourable member for New England indicated, it was a very harmonious delegation. All members, which also included the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) and the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay)-unfortunately the honourable member for Fairfax has not been with us for the past few weeks; we wish him well in his recovery-worked very well together. Senator Cheryl Kernot and Senator Noel Crichton-Browne were also involved. We went on this visit to Europe with a single purpose: to advance the interests and benefits of Australia and to make sure that the issues that are of importance to Australia were listened to by our European colleagues. As a delegation we had that single-minded purpose. We certainly did achieve that, in that we put forward a number of important issues and arguments to explain Australia's position on trade and a range of other issues. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Neil Bessell, the secretary of the delegation, who did an outstanding job and has also done an outstanding job in getting this delegation report written, completed and tabled six or seven weeks after we returned. That is quite an achievement because there was a lot of work on that delegation; we went on a lot of visits and raised a lot of matters. I congratulate Neil for the work he did while we were on the delegation and for his outstanding efforts since. Australia has been very well served by our ambassador in Belgium. Ted Pocock was fantastic in the support, advice and assistance he gave along with Ted Knez, the first secretary of the Australian embassy in Belgium. They accompanied us for the three weeks we were there and provided a range of support. They put in an enormous amount of effort in planning the various elements of the delegation, making sure we had lots of meetings and people to see, and visited lots of places. No request we made was too difficult for them to handle and they always responded very positively to us. I also thank our hosts in Strasbourg, the members and President of the European Parliament; who provided great hospitality, support and assistance; and the President and Speaker of the Belgian Parliament, who were our hosts in Belgium for a week and who provided an outstanding program. I also thank Mr Claes and Mr Michel Vanderborne who accompanied us for the week in Belgium and gave us a lot of assistance and support. There were many highlights on this trip. I was sincerely appreciative of the opportunity to participate. For me, one of the two highlights was the visit in Belgium to the war graves and the battlefields of the First World War-as the right honourable member for New England has also said-and the opportunity to participate in the very moving ceremony at the Menin Gate where members of the delegation laid a wreath. Those memories returned to me on Remembrance Day this year when we had the ceremony in Canberra for the return of the Unknown Soldier. We met the Mayor of Ypres who was accompanying the body of the Unknown Soldier back to Australia. We visited a number of war graves. That was the first time. I had been to Europe and seen at first hand the sites of those battles and the vision of the thousands of graves in those cemeteries. It was an incredibly moving experience. I appreciate the opportunity, as a younger Australian who was not involved in either the First World War or the Second World War, to understand the significance of the contribution that our Australian men and women made in the First World War. It was quite an honour to visit those graves. I agree with the right honourable member for New England in his comments about the War Graves Commission doing an outstanding job in maintaining the memory and significance of the sacrifice that the graves represent. It was incredible to see thousands of tombstones with the words 'An unknown Australian soldier lies buried'. There were literally thousands. In the Tynecot cemetery over 5,000 unknown Australian soldiers are buried. When one visits a cemetery like that and thinks that those people are someone's husband, son or brother, it brings home a very powerful message of the extent of the sacrifice of those men and this country. That was a very important part of the visit for me-and something I will always remember. The other part of the visit that I enjoyed considerably, although we did have extensive frustration, was the participation in the debate on the OECD report. Like the right honourable member for New England, I was pretty frustrated with the whole process of that debate in that as a member nation of the OECD we take that membership very seriously, yet through the process of the debate we were treated as add-ons. We were called nonmembers all the time. The whole way that occurred was very frustrating. The right honourable member for New England has outlined the strange situation of our being added on to the Council of Europe instead of being a separate body for the purposes of the debate. That is the reason the United States does not get involved because it does not see the process as being sensible or reasonable. After we had been in the OECD meeting, the right honourable member and I talked about this problem and said we should have a separate parliamentary debate of the member states of the OECD, as a separate institution, to enable us to make worthwhile contributions. We suggested that straight after having participated in the debate. Australia made some very significant contributions to the debate. Our involvement in the Council of Europe debate and the OECD report was very worthwhile. We ensured that the report was amended into a more sensible reflection of the current realities in the world economy and reflected on some specific issues in a much more sensible way. Australia, once more, played a very important role in an international forum in asserting its views about economic and human rights issues and other issues of importance to us. So it is important that we participate but it would be of much more value to all the OECD countries if we had a separate parliamentary forum for debate. The other thing I would like to comment on briefly is the fact that when I went to Europe and had discussions with members of the European and Belgian parliaments I did not think that they would have as much knowledge as they did about issues affecting Australia, but they were well informed. They were seeking our views and were very much up to date on Mabo and the debate in Australia about native title. In each place we went to we were asked, 'What is happening? What are the implications for your treatment of indigenous people?'. . They were very interested in the culling of kangaroos and what environmental impact that had. We played a very important role in informing them of the realities about kangaroos, rather than the mystical view that we are wiping out all the kangaroos and they are an endangered species. We clarified some of the facts for them. That was also an important contribution. They were very up to date on things such as APEC and Australia's involvement in it. I was surprised at their level of knowledge but pleased to be able to contribute to the discusseparately sion and inform them further. The other thing that happened for me in those discussions and debates was that I·became much better informed about the common agricultural policy, about Europe's views about GATT and why people take a strong position on protection of their farming interests. I learned a lot more about the structure of their society and the impact that the CAP and the GATT round would have on their communities. It was very much a two-way flow of communication and knowledge. That is one of the strengths of these delegations; it ensures that as Australians we learn a lot more about what the rest of the world is experiencing and what their views are; and they learn a lot more about our experiences and situation. I conclude by saying that I very much appreciated the opportunity to participate in this delegation. It was a very good learning experience for me. I think it has benefited Australia in that we were better able to inform first time. our European colleagues about Australia's interests, but it has also meant that we, as a nation, are now much better informed about their interests as well. I commend the report to the parliament and the government and I urge serious consideration of all the recommendations. I commend the leader of the delegation for his outstanding leadership throughout the trip.",42
79,Mr SINCLAIR,DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to add a few words on behalf of the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), to whom I have just spoken. '",44
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,Mr Andrew)The right honourable member for New England may proceed.,44
81,Mr SINCLAIR,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Before I came into the House I spoke to the honourable member for Fairfax who, as has been said, is convalescing after a very radical operation. He is on the improve and we all wish him well, as my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) just did. He said that he would like me to express on his behalf-which is why I rise to do so from my own remarks-his thanks to the leader of the delegation Mr Snow, our Secretary Mr Bessell, and all of those who helped us during our journey for their assistance. He said to say that he enjoyed the trip; it was a great learning experience. He found one of the great benefits was having the opportunity to visit a large number of organisations and to learn something of the diversity and complexity of those institutions which are now part of the European framework. In particular, he asked that his appreciation be extended to Ted and Meg Pocock, the Ambassador and his wife from Brussels, to Ted Knez who accompanied us, and to all of those who were our hosts. He thanks them for the generous assistance and hospitality· that was extended. ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION (SEA DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1993 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a Second Reading",44
82,Mr LINDSAY,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development) (12.52 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Deputy Speaker, the government is committed to the protection of the Australian marine environment and has pursued the implementation of this policy on both the national and international fronts by participating in consultations aimed at producing agreed measures for the prevention and control of marine pollution. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 so as to enable Australia to ratify the Protocol for the Prevention of Pollution of the South Pacific Region by Dumping, which is commonly referred to as the SPREP dumping protocol. This protocol is one of two protocols to the Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region, otherwise known as the SPREP convention. Australia has already ratified the other protocol concerning cooperation in combating pollution emergencies in the South Pacific region. The SPREP convention was ratified by Australia on 19 July 1989. It is a comprehensive, umbrella agreement for the protection, management and development of the marine and coastal environment of the South Pacific region. It lists the sources of pollution which require control, such as pollution from ships, dumping, land based sources, atmospheric discharges, among many others. The SPREP dumping protocol recognises the danger posed to the marine environment by pollution caused by the dumping of waste or other matter at sea, and places obligations on parties to prevent, reduce and control pollution in the protocol area by dumping. The SPREP dumping protocol is essentially a regional agreement consistent with the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other MaUer, also known as the London Convention 1972. Australia fulfils its international obligation tions under the London Convention 1972 through the Sea Dumping Act, which came into effect on 6 March 1984. As a great majority of the obligations under the SPREP dumping protocol are met by the provisions of the Sea Dumping Act, it is expedient that Australia join its Pacific Island neighbours in this regional agreement by amending the Sea Dumping Act. Also, the major overlap with the provisions of the existing act means that the financial implications of ratifying the SPREP dumping protocol will be minimal. However, there are some aspects of the SPREP dumping protocol which impose slightly different requirements from arrangements currently in place under the Sea Dumping Act. The major differe/lce is that the SPREP dumping protocol covers a geographical area which is different from the definition of 'Australian waters' in the Sea Dumping Act. However, there is no legal reason why Australia cannot choose to apply the additional requirements of the SPREP dumping protocol in waters to which the Sea Dumping Act applies. The practical effect of applying the SPREP dumping protocol to all Australian waters and the continental shelf is that it will . be an offence to dump organophosphorous compounds in the Indian and Southern oceans as well as the SPREP convention area. Consequently, as Tasmania currently has the roll-back provisions under section 9 of the Sea Dumping Act which allows it to administer the loading and dumping of wastes or other matter in its coastal waters, the Tasmanian Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1987 will need to be amended within 12 months to reflect the additional requirement of the SPREP dumping protocol. The necessary action is under way. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. . Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",44
83,Mrs GALLUS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Hindmarsh) (12.56 p.m.)The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) has described very ably what is contained in the Environment Protec(Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill. I do not think there is any point in my reiterating what he has already said, except to mention the provisions regarding organophosphates which have been added in the legislation. I have found no explanation as to why they have been added, but I presume that could be one of the substances found in the storage containers in the hulls of ships which could possibly be washed out into the water. Mr Lindsay-Yes.",45
84,Mrs GALLUS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"The parliamentary secretary is nodding; I think that is a fairly logical assumption. We already hav.e the London Convention and this legislation widens that slightly. The protocol is one of two that are part of the convention which covers the South Pacific. Having said that, I would like to comment more widely. The effect on our coastline of pollution caused by the wastes which come from ships is a very important topic. But this is only one small area with regard to the effect- on our coast and I would like to look at some of the others. Yesterday we spoke about the legislation dealing with oil and oil pollution. I think is one of the major problems that we face Australia. As a continent, we are surrounded by water and we are very vulnerable to oil spills. I mentioned this fact yesterday, but did not mention the concern we have about the aging of the shipping fleet, which was mentioned so ably in the report Ships of shame. We are simply not sure about the Paci fic starfish'. safety of many ships operating under a flag of convenience which come near Australian ports. The Kirki incident brought home to us so very clearly what sort of condition some those ships can be in and the danger that they pose to Australian ports. Of course, when we talk about oil spills always think of the Great Barrier Reef. I hesitate to say that this is Australia's the crown, because it is one of those more over-used phrases, but for lack of a better phrase I will refer to it as such. I think body in Australia is concerned that a spill may happen near the Great Barrier Reef. Because of this, it has been mooted that perhaps it would be better for ships to travel outside the reef waters. But that turns out to be satisfactory because those waters are uncharted, and in the event of a storm there is a larger likelihood of an accident How we guard against those accidents I think will remain a big problem for Australia. Ballast is another problem. We have only to look at what is happening in Tasmania with the North Pacific starfish to see the enormous problems that ballast water can bring into our country. The RAC report has listed some of the problems that have come into Australia· with ballast. The first one mentioned is toxic algae. When the viruses and bacteria that can be carried in the ballast of ships are let into Australian waters they can cause harm in the form of toxic algae. have already mentioned the North Pacific starfish, which the RAC report also mentions. I keep in frequent touch with people in Tasmania about this problem. It is of immense concern to the Tasmanian government. The Tasmanian government was extraordinarily angry when the federal government refused to take it seriously over this problem of the starfish until it was raised on Four Corners. that Immediately after the program the Commonin wealth decided to send a team of CSIRO scientists to Japan to see what could be done about the starfish, but that was only after the I Tasmanian government had been approaching the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) for months saying, 'We have a massive problem with this North The extent of the problem has not yet been realised. The starfish is a voracious' eater. of What happens when the starfish have eaten all the nutrients where they are now? Will they move up the river estuaries? How far out will they move from where they are presently we located in Tasmania? The multiplication of these creatures is absolutely incredible. They jewel in just eat and multiply. I cannot exaggerate the concern that the North Pacific starfish is causing in Tasmania. everyWe hope that the recent visit of the CSIRO scientists to Japan and the exchange of information that is going on will bring us some information. As far as I can understand, it is not such a problem in Japan. It flares up not sometimes, but it has never got to the stage that it is at in Tasmania. There are obviously predators in Japan which we do not seem to occurring. have in our waters. Undaria seaweed, which is a threat to the abalone industry, has been brought in by ballast water. It grows on rocks and around areas where fish farming is occurring, around oyster and mussel farms. Some of the exotic fauna which have come into Australia in ballast water are: Asian benthic fauna, four varieties of exotic fish species such as the yellowfin goby, the Japanese sea bass, the striped goby and the Sobaity sea bream. Another problem that occurs on Australian waters involves the illegal importation of I animals and fish. Recently Customs detected that a shipment of snakehead fish had been brought into Australia. Snakehead fish are rather like piranha. Fortunately they did not get out into our waterways-they were found by Customs. An amazing fact is that not all the fish were found; some of· the fish had eaten other fish so the number decreased before they were collected by Customs. That is the major list included in this RAC report with regard to ballast. To summarise, I started by mentioning the problem of wastes. Oil pollution is another problem, as is ballast. If we look at the Australian coast as a whole, we see· the enormous pressures we have put our coast under. I notice that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) is at the table. The minister and I were members of a parliamentary committee inquiring into the problems on the Australian coastline. She and I were horrified at some of the things we found happening to our coastline, and also at the lack of integrated planning to stop these things. The report that came out was called The injured coastline: protection of the coastal environment. Ms MCHugh-A top report.",45
85,Mrs GALLUS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"A very good report indeed. I remember very clearly that one key phrase in that report was 'the tyranny of small decisions'. That has really hit Australia. Around the coast we have local governments which take the view that it does not matter what they do in their area because tl)eir area is such a small part. When all those small parts are added together we get the big whole. When someone says, 'It does not matter if we remove these mangroves because there are lots of them all along the coast', and the council comes along and says exactly the same thing, it is no wonder we have lost 70 per cent of our mangroves along the eastern coast. This has enormous ramifications for the health of Australia's coastline and for the breeding of its fisheries. The importance of mangroves has not been sufficiently recognised by the Australian community. The community sees white sandy beaches and thinks, 'Ah, this is what we really want', and it tends to ignore the mudflats where mangroves grow. Yet it is those mangroves that keep our waters healthy and maintain the fish breeding grounds. In Townsville or CairnsMs MCHugh-In Cairns.",47
86,Mrs GALLUS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"In Cairns people started to recognise the importance of mangroves. Development was coming close to the mangroves, so it was decided to put a buffer zone in. I think the buffer zone was all of 10 feet, which was a total and utter failure. The local council should have realised that a lO-foot buffer zone is not a saviour for mangroves. Mangroves, like sandhills, migrate. As the seas go in and out, mangroves further advance inland and retreat. They need a fair area to do that. A buffer zone of 10 feet between the mangroves at Cairns and this absolutely enormous development which was about to go in there would not assist the mangroves. There are extensive mudflats in the city of Cairns. The council mooted the idea that it would clean up and remove the mudflats for development. So, instead of having wide plains of mudflats, there would be these nice, clean, pristine developments. In their wisdom the people voted to keep the mudflats, which shows the sophistication of the people of Cairns. Ms MCHugh-And the fishing industry.",47
87,Mrs GALLUS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"And the fishing industry, which understood the need to keep the mudflats there. Another problem we face on our coastline is the nutrification of our waters. This is a particular problem on the Great Barrier Reef with the run-off from agricultural areas. Phosphorous and nitrogen come out of the rivers and onto the reef. All rivers in Australia which flow into coastal waters bring down siltation and a heavy nutrient load. If I could just divert a little, this is one of the reasons Jervis Bay is such a unique place on the east coast of Australia. The shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), has said that the reason Jervis Bay is so different from other bays is the clarity of its water. The clarity is due to the fact the bay has no rivers coming into it bringing siltation and, therefore, has a low nutrient load. Jervis Bay is indeed one of the special places on the coast of New South Wales. People are looking at places like Jervis Bay and Shoal water Bay and asking; 'Where. is the balance between development and protection?'. We always tend to think, if there are two things in conflict, that one is bad and one is good. It is very much a conflict of principles. We need the resources, we need the export industry and we need to develop areas, but at the same time we need to keep our natural areas in a condition that we can pass down to future generations so that they too will have the joy of looking at their great natural beauty. More importantly, it must be said that those areas are not just aesthetically beautiful; they also contain enorrilOus biodiversity. One of our problems is the ongoing erosion of our biodiversity. We have not appreciated the marvellous wealth that we have in our flora and fauna-so different to that of any other country-and we have allowed much of that to be removed through habitat destruction. Certainly, littoral development is one contributor to the breakdown in our biodiversity. One of my saddest memories of the coastal zone inquiry was the· inappropriate development going on around our coast. I remember vividly the Big Banana and the Hawaiian type developments with their plethora of palm trees. That sort of monstrous development does not look like Australia and it alienates the people in the area from their own beaches. I realise that I am straying somewhat from the subject of this bill-the dumping of waste in our seas-but what I am talking about does impact on the coast and, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to continue. I never thought that I would become an expert on sewage, but since the coastal inquiry I think I could claim to know more about sewage than do most people-I have certainly smelt more sewage plants than most. I can talk convincingly about primary, secondary and tertiary treatment of sewage. Having said that, it is of serious concern to me that we continue to dump sewage in the ocean; that as a continent we have not realised that the ocean is not a dumping ground for our wastes. . For too long the world has seen our oceans as great sinks into which any mess that we create on the land can be dumped and got rid of. We do not realise that the ocean is itself a living land and a source of so much on our own hard land, and that around our coast we are destroying that environment. There are alternatives to piping sewage into· the sea. One is the dry compost system, an innovative - nd interesting way of treating sewag- whereby it is aerobically processed and turned into good compost or soil. . Mr Lindsay-They are even using effluent on golf courses· now.",47
88,Mrs GALLUS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"On golf courses, wood lots and similar places, yes; that is so. One of the big problems with using effluent is that, while it is marvellous in summer during the dry period, it is not wanted in winter",48
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Mr Andrew)The chair has been very indulgent in this debate simply because, far from being provocative, the honourable member for Hindmarsh has touched on points with which everyone agrees. However, at this point the honourable member for Hindmarsh is straying a little further than I can accommodate, even in the bipartisan spirit of this debate.",48
90,Mrs GALLUS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take your point. With your admonishment ringing in my ears, I bring my contribution to this debate to an end. I conclude by saying that on this side of the House we will always support bills designed for the protection of the Australian environment, particularly of our coast.",48
91,Mr CHYNOWETH,DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope that I can keep within the boundaries that the last speaker, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), kept within. I do tend to stray now and again but I will do my best to keep to the subject of the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill. This matter was first raised in, I think, 1983, and I spoke to it at that time. I have kept an eye open for this particular bill and for anything to do with the sea because my electorate is located on the Mornington Peninsula. Of course, the people of that electorate also have a great interest in the sea and anything that is dumped into it - and a lot of stuff is dumped into it. Marine pollution is one of the major forms of pollution. I am not sure of the exact figure, but something like 10 per cent of marine pollution is caused by the spilling and dumping of oil. And the biggest source of polluting oil is not Exxon Valdez or Kirki type incidents; it is the oil leaked by small boats of the kind used for fishing and other water activities. I have a little boat-I do not get to use it too often because I do not get the time-and the exhaust· from its outboard motor goes straight into the sea, leaving behind a slick of oil and petrol. That is a sort of dumping. In my little boat I am dumping pollutants into the sea, as does anyone else who goes out in a small boat-and,there are hundreds of thousands who do. That all contributes to a lot of oil being dumped into the sea. The coastal zone inquiry looked at .the impact of sea dumping. We usually connect sea dumping with oil or dredge material pollutants-that sort of thing-but, in fact, we all contribute to polluting the sea. We all wash our hands and flush the toilet, and that is processed and ends up in the sea. Each one of us is a polluter. We are all of us dumping our wastes into the sea all the time. Whenever we wash our cars, the detergent goes into the drain, into the outfall and straight into the We are continually dumping tonnes and tonnes of pollutants into our seas every day. The situation has been exacerbated by the increasing coastal population. Close to nine out of 10 Australians live in the coastal zone. Almost half of Australia's population growth in the past decade has been in the coastal zone. By the year 2005 almost a million more people will be living in the coastal zone than currently lives there. All of them will be dumping their waste into the sea, adding to its pollution. We have recognised the problem; now we must do something about it. The other area which I feel particularly concerned about is the dumping of ballast water into our sea. Mention has been made several times about the waste-we believe it has come from Japan in some areas-that has created this particularly nasty infestation of starfish in Tasmania. Tasmania has enough dumping down there. It does not want ballast water dumped there. Honourable members would be aware that this bill is directly related to the dumping of waste products, I think it is jarosite, from the Pasminco-EZ zinc refinery in Hobart. This waste gets taken out to sea. Every week a ship is filled up with waste which is taken out to sea and dumped. This has been going on for years and years. This is a particularly nasty sort of pollutant that gets dumped, as I said, every week. This bill addresses the problem because we have to have certain permits to be able to dump waste. We have to be granted a permit and I think that the Tasmanian laws have to be altered to be made consistent with this piece of legislation. I think the Tasmanian parliament has about a year to put this together. So what we are doing in Tasmania could be a little outside the guidelines for the rest of the world and the conventions that were signed. However, at long last we are starting to get around to doing something about that dumping of this nasty waste from this zinc refinery. In relation to the ballast water, I spoke last night on a bill and I said that it was quite dangerous for this ballast water in Port Philip Bay, which has toxic blooms, to be pumped into ships and then transferred to a storage sea. area that is being rebuilt at Westernport Bay. This will transfer around these toxic plants via the ballast water on these ships. So there is quite a bit of sea dumping that, we cim say, does not occur 200 miles out or whateverright out in the middle of the ocean-it occurs very close to our homes. This should be looked at extremely closely, especially in relation to the amount of oil, petrol and waste that goes overboard from small pleasure craft aU around the coast of Australia. The report The injured coastline: protection of the coastal environment was mentioned. I was on the committee when we first started that inquiry back in, I think, 1989. One of the areas that we looked at was the Carrum sewage plant. There are millions of gallons of treated water being dumped into our sea everyday. I think about 70 per cent of the homes in Melbourne go through this one sewerage treatment plant. Some of that water is being used-I call it the peninsular riverand this just pours out at Cape Schank. Have spoken about it many times. However, the sludge, once it is skimmed off, .builds up and I do not believe that it is used. However, I read that there was a novel use for the sludge at the new runaway at Sydney airport. It is being put over the sand and turning it into grass very quickly. The nutrients in the sludge are doing a great job in converting sand into grass or lawn. In the Geelong treatment plant that we had a look at, all it did was filter sewage and then the sewage went straight out into the ocean. I trust and hope that that has changed. On the issue of sea dumping, we should also be aware of what is happening on the Great Barrier Reef. Not only is oil being dumped there, but some years ago the leader of the Country Party, as it then was, Mr Doug Anthony; was involved in a floating hotel development. They had this floating hotel moored on the barrier reef. I do not think that they had pontoons; another operator had pontoons out there. These were concrete pontoons moored there and they sunk to the bottom and were laying in this beautiful lagoon. I complained many years ago and asked to have this concrete removed, but I think the operator had gone bust and the pontoons could not be brought up out of the water. I trust that the head of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Mr Graeme Kelleher, has certainly taken steps to correct that. Knowing him, I am quite certain that he would have done it. We can say that that is a form of dumping. The concrete pontoons crashed to the bottom, the company went broke and the pontoons were just left there. We also have a real problem in relation to sea dumping on Australia's external territories. As chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on National Capital and External Territories, I have had the pleasure recently having inspections and talks at Cocos Island and at Christmas Island. I have also been to Antarctica and Norfolk Island. So I have been to a large number of Australia's external territories and there are many problems in relation to sea dumping. When we were at Cocos Island recently, there was a barge being loaded up with trucks, excavators, bits of tin and all sorts of metal bits and pieces. When I asked what this barge was going to do, I was told that it was going out to sea to create another reef in the Indian Ocean somewhere. However, I was assured that they had a licence for this and th!lt all the harmful oils, break fluids and all the bits and pieces in the tru.cks and cars had been removed. I trust that that was done. It being only a month later, I imagine all those bits and pieces are at the the bottom of the Indian Ocean. However, that is a problem. What do these people do? Cocos Island is hundreds of miles out in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Do we bring back them back? Do we do that for those small islands, or do we continue to do what is happening now? Some of the islands have treatment plants. At other islands, the waste goes straight into the sea. Norfolk Island has a unique rubbish dump. It has this incinerator on the top of a cliff. There is a chute where all the rubbish, after it is burnt, goes straight into this magnificent bay. So there is a bit of sea dumping out there. Our committee is aware of that. I know the department is aware of it. It has been going on for a long time and steps are being taken to try to rectify this problem. At Christmas Island, we only have to look at that place to see derelict cars and rubbish everywhere. The British Phosphate Commission left it in a disgraceful state when it left. There are old, rusty buildings and locomotives. It did not do any repairs. There are old pipes and, as I said, many cars are there. Mr Kerin-And the Abbott's booby bird.",48
92,Mr CHYNOWETH,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Yes, and the Abbott's booby bird. This is a very beautiful island and it has been in the press lately because of the opening of the casino there. However, the residents have started to clean of up the island. The cars are bought from Singapore. I believe they are fairly cheap. When the cars break down or cannot be fixed, the residents just leave them on the side of the road. There are cars scattered all over the island. Whatis going to happen with them? How are they going to be removed? Are they going to be dumped into the sea? We do not know. Let me give an example of sea dumping which Australia does not do and which, I believe, is an example of how to remove waste. This example should be picked up by . many other nations. The area that I am talking about is Antarctica. When I was down there in 1989, the Australian Antarctic Division was embarking on a huge program of collecting the rubbish that had built up over 50 or 60 years. It packed up this rubbish, burnt what it could, put the rubbish in boxes and shipped it back to Hobart on the return trip. It expensive, but a very good way of cleaning up. Other nations would just put their rubbish on the ice, let it noat out to sea and it would be dumped on the bottom of the ocean around Antarctica. We can, if we have enough money, clean up all of these islands and I think we should start to take steps to do that. We have empty containers left on Christmas Island and Cocos Island and we have to pay to get them back. I think it might be worthwhile to pay to get them back full of rubbish. The rubbish can then be treated properly in Australia, instead of its being dumped on the bottom of the Indian Ocean. This is a very important bill. It corrects some of the areas that have needed amending over the years. It certainly deals with what is to happen in Tasmania in relation to the dumping of this material from the zinc smelter. I believe it has the support of all parties in this House. I trust it will be implemented fairly quickly to stop anybody dumping anything in our oceans.",50
93,Mr SHARP,DELEGATION REPORTS,"As those veterans of the debate in the House last night will recall, I somewhat foreshadowed this debate in my remarks last evening on a similar bill that dealt with levies for ships sea. That matter was in relation to oil pollution equipment. We have had, in the last 24 hours in this House, quite an interesting debate on matters relating to pollution at sea. I guess that what we have learnt from the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill that was debated last night and the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill that we are now debating is that there is tremendous concern and awareness of pollution at sea. Honourable members who have involved themselves in the process of the debate have drawn an association between the potential for pollution and existing pollution and the economic cost to the Australian economy. All of us are now aware of the very great potential Australia has to generate economic activity and income from our marine environment, be it through the tourism industry, from the fishing industry-indeed, from abalone diving is very in Tasmania, South Australia and off the south-east coast of New South Wales-or any other type of activity that emanates from the sea. All of that is dependent upon the marine environment being maintained adequately and this particular bill goes in one small part towards helping to achieve that goal of protecting Australia's maritime environment. This is an extension of the London convention that Australia has been a signatory to since 1972. It is a worthy step in the right direction and one which, as my colleague the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), our shadow minister for the environment, who spoke earlier, indicated to the House is supported by both sides of the House, as has been the case on virtually all of these bills that relate to improving the protection of the sea that have come in the last few years. I, as the, shadow minister for transport, representing the opposition on shipping matters, have come to realise that we as responsible citizens have to support reasonable measures to protect the seas. I am pleased to say that our Australian shipping industry takes a similar view. We are very fortunate that here in Australia our oil comat panies and our shipping companies are acting in what I think is as responsible a manner as we could hope for, particularly when we compare the actions of other shipping industries and other oil companies around the world. I think Australia is very fortunate indeed. For those who are interested in these matters, I think it would be a good exercise to go to the base of the Australian Institute of Petroleum at Geelong where some first-class equipment for dealing with oil spills at sea has been established. I know many honourable members of the House are interested in these things and I am one of only a handful of people in the House who has actually visited the base of the Australian Institute of Petroleum at Geelong where tens of millions of dollars have been invested over the last few years in establishing a base, personnel and equipment that can deal with oil spills wherever they may occur around the Australian coastline. People would say, 'What happens, as was the case with the Kirki, if we have an oil spill off the west coast of Australia and the equipment is all down there at Geelong?'. The answer to that is that everything can be put in containers, which are on site, and within a matter of about an hour and a half to two hours they can be loaded on a truck and on board an appropriate aircraft headed towards that oil spill. That can be supplemented with oil spill equipment that is now based at virtually every port authority around Australia. Not even the equipment Australia has could have dealt with the break-up of the Kirki, which caused a very big oil spill, adequately and properly-people talk of the Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound in significant terms; it certainly was a significant spill, but the break-up of the Kirki had the same potential for damage-had the currents and winds been going in the opposite direction. That equipment can be supplemented, through arrangements that Australia has with Singapore, by equipment being airlifted from Singapore to Australia within a matter of hours. In addition to that, the oil spills centre at Southampton in the UK has equipment which can be flown out to Australia within a matter of 24 to 30 hours. That equipment can supplement the equipment that we already have in this country. So there is within Australia and overseas a network of arrangements which can deal reasonably with a major oil spill. The best way to go, of course, is to try to avoid oil spills altogether. That involves having very safe and very high standards for the ships that come into and out of Australia and ensuring that the registration societies that operate around the world are kept honest. One of the major problems that those who concern themselves with the protection of our maritime environment have to confront is the very low esteem in which many of the registration societies around the world are held. Some of them are simply an opportunity for the country which houses that registration society to generate income for themselves. They have no interest whatsoever in maintaining proper standards. It is simply an opportunity for everybody along the way to make a buck out of the process of registering a ship. As responsible citizens in the world's community, we have to bring as much pressure as we can to bear on those countries that allow the operation of very low standard or poor registration societies to exist in their countries. Australia has to bring to bear as much pressure as it can because one of the major causes of pollution and loss of life at sea is the fact that ships that should not be at sea, that are absolutely ancient and that are falling apart are allowed to be registered by those registration societies and to go plying themselves around the oceans of the world. So, if we want to go further than we are in the bill before the House this afternoon, one thing we can do is ensure that the registration societies that register ships around the world are kept honest and maintain a proper and decent standard. That is a very difficult task. It is far easier to say it than to do it. But it will never happen unless we embark on that course, and we will be fighting a losing battle. It is important for us because Australia does derive so much income from its maritime environment. I was reminded of this as I travelled last week with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) on the new vessel of the Tasmanian line, the Spirit of Tasmania, formerly the Peter Pan. It only came into operation a couple of weeks ago. It is an excellent ship. If anybody gets the chance to go down to Tasmania, do not fly but go on the Spirit of Tasmania leaving Melbourne and sailing to Devonport. It is a great experience, a very comfortable passage and a comfortable ship. I would urge members of parliament to take the opportunity to go on at least one leg of the journey-either to Tasmania or from Tasmania-on the Spirit of Tasmania. It is a great ship. Whilst we were on board the ship, and subsequently travelling around Tasmania, we were told about the tremendous income that Tasmania is now deriving from its maritime involvement. This income is very seriously threatened by pollution at sea. Today we have heard the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), and yesterday we heard the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) speak of their concerns-as did I - about ballast water. I do not need to go on about it because it has already been well and truly talked about in the last 24 hours in this House. It is a major concern that this country has to come to grips with. I am sure that if the government was to initiate measures to further enhance our maritime environment by dealing with the problems of ballast water, those of us on this side of the House would support it. I am confident that the Australian shipping industry would also support it because they have an interest in this matter that is equal to that anyone else. We need to address this concern, and I am sure we will continue to do so in further legislation that comes before the House in the next year or two. This side of the House recognises the importance of this legislation, and we will continue to support such legislation in a bipartisan manner as long as it is reasonable and benefits the protection of our maritime environment. The viability of the industry is essential. It is all very well passing these types of bills but, unless the industry is viable, shipowners will be encouraged to cheat the system that is in place because it saves them money. It is important for us to recognise that the viability of the world's shipping industry is as critical to the protection of our maritime environment as any other legislation that we pass in this place today. If we are concerned about protecting the environment, it is in our interests to ensure that the shipowners of the world can afford it, and that can only be achieved by not taxing the daylights out of them through increasing fuel excise-which the government did in the budget in August this year. We must also ensure that we do not overburden shipowners with unnecessary and wasteful work practices. We must deal with these issues if we are to ensure that the world's shipping industry-and particularly the Australian shipping industry-is to remain viable. Through that viability we will ensure that shipowners can afford to do the right thing by themselves, by their crews and by our maritime environment. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I join with my colleague the honourable member for Hindmarsh in supporting this bill.",51
94,Mr KNOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I rise to speak on the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill. Too often the Australian public see parliamentarians through the eyes of question time when perhaps the performances of all of us on both sides of the House are less than desirable. It is unfortunate that what the Australian people do not see is the degree of co-operation that exists when there are things that are of mutual concern to all of us. I would like to extend my gratitude of to the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) and others for their comments in the debate on this bill. This debate shows that there is a common concern by members of parliament-too often forgotten by members of the community, and too often missed in the hurly-burly when we concentrate on the things with which we disagree. I would like to begin by mentioning an amusing little plaque that my father has at his home beside his swimming pool. The plaque reads, 'We don't swim in your toilet, so please don't pee in our pool'. I have a vested interest in this legislation in that I am one of those Australians who actively uses the seas to recreate. I am a surfer. I have been a board rider for many years. I still enjoy that sport. It is one of the few sports that I get a great deal of enjoyment out of. I happen to live 500 yards from an ocean outfall pipe from a tertiary treated sewerage system. The body responsible, the New South Wales Water Board, gave us all the assurances in the world that there would be no pollution and that this was the cleanest water in the world. We were assured that we had nothing to be concerned about because people could drink that water. I have had a lot of officials from the public works department and the water board in New South Wales telling me how they can drink this water, but on the numerous occasions when I have offered them glasses of that effluent and asked them to take a slug, not one of them has taken me up on that offer. I think that suggests something. I remind the House of the wording of the little plaque beside my parent's pool. I do not go out to sea to surf in treated effluent. I go out to surf in clean ocean When treated effluent, dosed up with chlorine-which is not saline-is put out to sea, it is at a different temperature to the ocean waters and there is no dispersal. What physically happens is that there are great pools of effluent which float around for long periods of time. Dispersal is very slow. The area known as the Boneyard is very close to where I live. I bought my house in that area because it is one of the great surfing locations on the coast of New South Wales. We get a lot of rain at times when the southerly swells are coming through. Unfortunately, engineers in this country have not been able to design a sewerage system with a pipe system that does not leak. They insist on putting these pipes in trenches. The trenches with less compacted soil fill with water, the pipes then fill with water, and there are no holding banks on any of these outlets, even if they are tertiary treated. As soon as we have high levels of rain-bang-it all goes out. We have rudimentary breaks that pull out the larger lumps, and the rest goes straight out. My friends and I are consistently having health problems in the sense of ear, lung and stomach infections which are specifically caused by this effluent. The denials that come from the responsible bodies are outrageous. I have been in conflict with the Shoalhaven City Council a number of times. The council is augmenting a new sewerage disposal system on the south coast in the area of Jervis Bay. I concur with the honourable member for Hindmarsh who said that it is one of the most beautiful places she has ever seen. To have these philistines, these idiots, suggest that we should take the cheap option and put this effluent out into the water is outrageous. I have put myself on the line in the press. I do not always say things in here where I am covered from defamation; I say a few things outside. I accused Mayor Atkins of the Shoalhaven City Council of being a liar and of being deceptive because he claimed that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was not the one who suggested that Governor's Head entrance-which is under the control of this water. House-should not be used. However, other ministers agreed that ocean outfall should be put into Jervis Bay. I might put on record that the council has since conceded that I was correct and they have pulled out of the option for Governor's Head. I was told by the previous opposition speaker, the honourable member for Hume, that I had to get on to jobs. I have been getting on to jobs. As the honourable member for Hume mentioned, because the Tasmanian waters are clean and green, North Atlantic Salmon has, in the space of five years, developed an industry in Tasmania which is now earning over $20 million a year. Seven organisations are involved in that industry. People on the south coast are already piloting schemes in the area of mariculture. If the idiots in the Shoal haven City Council get their way and use ocean outfall to get rid of their sewage problem, how will we be able to sell mariculture? How will we be able to set up sunrise industries on the Australian primary industry front? The answer is that we will not be able to. We will not be able to sell fish to the Koreans, to the Japanese and to the other Asian markets because they do not really want fish that have grown up in our excreta. I am trying to put sense into the argument by suggesting that water, a valuable resource, be used for forestry farming along the coast. Hopefully, with the cooperation of some of our ministers, that will take place and I might be able to mention some of that in a future speech. The outrageous praCtice of throwing our effluent into the sea on the basis that the sea is so large that it will not have any effect is a fallacy that we have to understand. The ocean in its enormity-it is an enormous place-is still vulnerable. From the bottom of the deepest trenches that man has managed to reach some sediments have been pulled up which show that various commodities have been dumped in the ocean. These ocean outfalls are one thing. Nutrification, which honourable member for Hindmarsh mentioned earlier, and organochlorines, et cetera are another. But I would like to talk about stormwater drains and litter. People often use storm water drains as a cheap option to get rid of toxic materials. Those people should be gaoled and we should throwaway the keys. To me, having absolutely no regard for their fellow man and the biosphere makes them criminals of the worse nature. Let us look at something simple that all of us at some stage have probably been guilty of-littering. Perhaps I was in my younger days. It is only from seeing the effects of litter that I have now reformed and will preach this reform to others. If people saw the effects of plastic bags in the guts and the gullets of dolphins and other marine mammals, and the effect our litter has on the fish populations, they would never be guilty of littering again. It is something that is oft overlooked. We throw something in the street and we do not connect it with the ocean. But it gets washed into the gutters and the drains and where does it end up? It ends up in our oceans. It ends up polluting our oceans in a way that attacks those organisms which require that environment to survivemammals, fish, birds, et cetera. The oceans have been used as a repository for chemicals for so long. It grieves me when I think of the damage that we have already done and the fact that we are only just alerting ourselves to what is going on. Organochlorines, such as PCBs-polychlorinated biphenyls-are very heavy and toxic materials. I know that at many times people from Greenpeace are epitomised as drug smoking hippies with dreadlocks. They are not. They are quite reasonable and responsible people. They are putting their butts on the line in rubber duckies to try to stop people dropping drum after drum of heavy toxic materials into the North Atlantic ocean because they have not got the economics right in the production process. I will put forward my theory of the economics of the production process. If we cannot look after the waste from our industry in economical, sensible and environmentally sound ways, we do not deserve to be doing it. the We should not be doing it and we should be prevented from doing it. These people put their lives on the line. We have seen some of the confrontations at sea when their small dinghies have been overturned, et cetera. These people are the heroes in our environmental campaigns. The Russians have recently done some work. Paul Hunt in Bangkok wrote an article in which he stated: Russian marine scientists exploring the deep oceans of the world have discovered a chilling phenomenon which they fear could devastate coastal areas around the globe. The scientists, using highly sophisticated ocean bed spying equipment developed by the former Soviet navy, say they have evidence to show radioactive, toxic and other hazardous wastes dumped at sea can be propelled from the deep marine canyons back up to delicate coastal zones. The erroneous idea that 'If you throw it out there and it is deep enough it will go down and it will be all right. No worries mate', is absolutely outrageous. The Russians have now shown that even from the deepest trenches there are phenomena which can levitate that material, bring it to the surface and deposit it on our coast. As a result of the incident with the Braer, which was referred to by the honourable member for Hume, it has been found that, because of the adverse weather conditions, oil and oil· extracts have polluted the coast up to 10 kilometres inland. Apart from having devastated the fishing industries and the world-class record of the Shetland Islands for clean product in terms of the northern species of fish which it sells, its agricultural areas have been devastated. It is an irony that the Russians should discover this because it is the Russians who have been dumping low level and high level radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan, for God 1s sake. The irony goes on. The Japanese are horrified, raise their hands and suggest what a terrible thing the Russians are doing. For God's sake, the Japanese have been doing it to the Pacific uncharged for so long it funny. They will not even tell us what they have been putting in the ocean. A recent convention agreed on a permit for the dumping of nuclear waste. For the record, the five abstainers were: Britain, Belgium, China, France and Russia. Those countries really need to get their act together. But we in Australia are not above comment ourselves. While we suggested that we would support the convention, we are one of 20 countries which stiII dump. We are part of a group of 20 countries which are still selectively dumping. The honourable member for Dunkley mentioned the Hobart zinc refinery. The Pasminco Metals-EZ refinery continues to dump a brown toxic sludge which contains arsenic, mercury and cadmium. Tasmania has gone to a great deal of trouble to develop its marine industries which will help Australia to the extent that it will increase our exports and cover our balance of payments. Something needs to be said about ballast water and its dangers. One problem that nonliving dumping creates is that it affects the marine life around it. When talking about species being introduced, must we in Australia always talk about the rabbit? Can we have a marine equivalent of the rabbit? Prickly pear is one example and there are a number of others. In the marine environment, how much harder would it be to control? It would be uncontrollable. We are putting at risk the great economic rewards that this country can expect to gain in the future from maric-lture. I also mention algal blooms, which relate to my first comment about ocean outfalls. Jervis Bay-the love of my life, as the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Mrs MCHugh) would know-suffered a major toxic bloom. The tourist and the fishing industries were both devastated. I agree with the honourable member for Hume. I have taken the approach that we must grab the economic rationalists, who believe that we have to put things in dollar tenns or it does not matter, by the throat. I concede that. Sometimes it is· the only way thilt one can talk to a brick wall. When we look at the economic values that are put on the environment we see the amazing is not amount of money that we forgo by allowing dumping to continue in all forms. We need to have a good look at ourselves as a species. We must come to grips with the fact that we are in plague proportions. Apart from our love of fellow humanity, if we were detached and looked at ourselves, we would probably say that half of the population of the world today should be removed. Obviously, there is no way that that can be done. Some people do not even consider that birth control or family planning should be enacted in certain countries. There were some comments earlier in another place about that. We must recognise that the biosphere in which we live is our home. It is bigger than a roof; it is bigger than four walls. Unless we take the Aboriginal attitude that the land, the earth that we live upon, is our mother and part of us and that we are part of it, I have grave misgivings about what will happen to this planet. Unless we can love the place where we live, unless we can love the earth that we live upon and the oceans that give us such wondrous pleasures, then we as a species are doomed. I commend this bill to the House.",53
95,Mr HORNE,DELEGATION REPORTS,"It gives me a great deal of pleasure to support the Environment and Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment BiII. In a world that takes for granted a couple of astronauts in a spacecraft in space, taking space walks and attempting to repair the solar receptors so that the United States of America can operate the Hubble telescope and so that we can know more about the galaxy in which our world is located, it is amazing how little we know about the planet on which we live and about the life-giving processes that take place on our earth. This bill is the first step in a long journey that we must mak--not only as a nation but as a world as a whole-if life on earth is to be sustainable. This bill is an acceptance that the oceans are not infinite in their ability to accept the run-off from the continents and the materials that we may care to dump in them. Many of our attitudes to the ocean are born out of ignorance. They are attitudes that have been developed historically. They are attitudes that we continue today because we have not questioned the outcome of those practices. How ironic that most Australian families still see the annual holiday at the seaside as a great place to take the family. It is a healthy environment, so we say. Given this attitude that is widespread in our community, we then proceed to dump in the ocean virtually every nasty substance that we have because it is either too volatile or too dangerous to store on land. The attitude is: out of sight, out of mind. Unfortunately, it is not out of the ecosystem. Over the years, we have seen major disasters-disasters such that made the Exxon Valdez a household word throughout the world. Earlier this year, we saw the dumping of radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan, indicating that there are nations that have a blatant disregard to act as responsible global citizens. Despite this bill, we as a nation still employ' many undesirable practices with respect to the ocean. Even with the' passage of this bill, we will continue to do so. As a nation with 80 per cent of its population living within 50 kilometres of the coastline, the majority of our sewage and a large proportion of our industrial waste goes into the ocean. Often it goes via rivers, harbours and lakes. We have created marine d-erts. With the dramatic increase in nutrients in some areas, we have artificially promoted the growth of some of the organisms to the detriment of others. In other words, we have brought about, through human intervention, a major change in the ocean as an ecosystem. Obviously, we as a nation of few people and a large coastline have been very fortunate. In comparison with other countries, we do not have the pollution crises that they have. That is why we as a nation have the opportunity to lead the way in developing alternative methods of waste control and, above all, to save the integrity of the ocean. The ocean is a vast resource. I have indicated that many of our policies are based on ignorance. How many of us have ever cared to look below the surface of the ocean; beyond the veil of the surface that hides a multitude of past sins? I appreciate that scuba diving is a fairly popular pastime with many people. However, on a worldwide basis, only a very small part of one per cent of the population have ever swum below the surface of the ocean and inspected what goes on there. If they did, what would they find? They would find a world that is not that dissimilar to the world on dry land. They would find plants that undergo the' very same processes of living: they carry out photosynthesis, they absorb the sunlight, they produce oxygen and they are eaten by organisms. With the production of food through photosynthesis comes the production of oxygen. How many people are aware that the ocean is the major contributor to global oxygen in our atmosphere? People become very passionate about the cutting down of forests. They fear that we will run out of oxygen. Yet how many people ever question the contribution by the ocean to the life-giving gas in the atmosphere that is necessary for all of us? I do not think I have ever read a paper on that. But it is a fact, and it is something that of course we have to take into account in our management of the ocean. There is a full spectrum of marine organisms. As a lover of seafood, I obviously enjoy some of those. The full spectrum ranges from the largest of mammals-the whale-to microscopic life forms. They all have their place in the food chain. They all have their niche in this bountiful provider-and bountiful it is. The global production of fish throughout the world is about 90 million metric tonnes per year. It is assessed that 100 million tonnes is the renewable catch. In other words, we are very close to the renewable catch on a global basis. While that figure may be correct, I know that fishermen in my electorate of Paterson are having to resort to practices that they have not used previously simply to maintain the level of catches of previous years. They are using bigger nets. They are fishing more hours with bigger boats. They are going further afield simply to catch the same number of fish. It would appear that the natural production of fish in our coastal waters has certainly passed that renewable limit. The warning lights are on. The ocean is a resource that needs to be managed correctly. . I have already mentioned the whale. It is an example of what can be achieved when a problem is perceived and the correct steps are taken to resolve that problem. One of the great victories for environmentalists is the management of whale numbers. It is now reaping benefits. It is something that Australians in particular are very proud of. Whales have returned, particularly to the east coast Australia, and they are a great tourist· attracthey tion. Again, I will revert to my electorate because a female whale and her calf entered Port Stephens during their northern migration this last winter. The local community was ecstatic because it was the first time in living memory that that had happened. But let us get back to some of the problems. I hate to be gloomy at this time of year, but we must be realistic. Oyster farming is a major contributor to the economy of many coastal towns in Australia. Indeed, Australian oyster farmers are amongst the world leaders in this. But they are experiencing a major threat because of the high levels of pollution in coastal waters. Various forms of bacteria and heavy metals are passed into the water through our sewage treatment plants. All the things associated with civilisation create problems for oyster farmers. Only a few weeks ago many honourable members enjoyed some salmon that had been grown in Tasmania and brought here as a promotion. I hope you, Mr Speaker, had the opportunity to have some of that. If you did not, I would thoroughly recommend it to you. It was magnificent. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) has said, this is something that is readily acceptable on a global market. In fact, salmon farming in Tasmania has led Australia to become a net exporter of salmon because it is grown in environmentally friendly conditions. It is seen by other countries as perhaps being the cleanest salmon in the world. These are examples of how the ocean can be used to our benefit, how it can continue to provide, but we must continue to manage it. Surely that is a sign to government of· the responsible course of action that we should take. But what do we find? We find that the dumping in our harbours of ballast water from the Northern Hemisphere has done things such as produce three new species of fish in Sydney Harbotir. Who knows what the effect of those fish will be on native fish? We find that there are various forms of seaweed. We find that variotlS forms of starfish are being introduced into Australian waters through a habit that was borne out of ignorance. Some of of these starfish are extremely voracious. If get to the scallop beds or to the oyster farms, we will find that industries which were previously viable will no longer be so. These are the sorts of practices that are being allowed to continue despite the passage of this bill today. These are the things that we must keep fighting against. We must take every opportunity to make everyone aware of them, particularly the people who are responsible. The shipping lines, the importers and the exporters must always be aware of maintaining the integrity of Australian coastal waters. I· appreciate that many here today would like to participate in this debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, I appreciate the interest that you take in this particular debate. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to participate in this debate. This issue is something that, during the remainder of my career in this parliament, I will certainly be supporting because, as I indicated in my earliest comments, this is the first step. It is the first step of many that we have to take to make sure that the integrity of the oceans is maintained-not only in Australia but on a global basis. We, as a nation, must use all our expertise to educate the rest of the world of what must be done to maintain this very bountiful provider for the world.",56
96,Mr NEWELL,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I join the debate on this very important piece of legislation, the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill 1993. The purpose of the bill has no doubt been explained: to amend the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 and to implement the government's decision to ratify the Protocol for the Prevention of Pollution in the South Pacific Region by Dumping-referred to as the dumping protocol. The Protocol for the Prevention of Pollution in the South Pacific Region by Dumping is one of the protocols of the 1986 Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region. This convention is essentially a regional agreement established in the context of the United Nations environment program and is consistent with the provisions of the international Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matters-known worldwide as the London convention 1972. The dumping of wastes at sea was one of the first areas of marine pollution to be the subject of an international convention. It is not untimely that the South Pacific countries also see the needs as pertaining to their area-they have entered into a convention no doubt based upon this but more pertinent to their local region. The London convention is the principal international instrument regulating ocean dumping and prohibits the dumping of the substances listed in annex I-called the black list-which includes organohalogen compounds, mercury, cadmium, zinc, persistent plastics and oils, radioactive wastes, and biological and chemical warfare materials. The substances listed in annex 2, known as the grey list-I do not know how many more colours we are going to add to this-contain such elements, and I had better get it right or Mr Deputy Speaker will correct me, as arsenic, lead and cyanides which may be dumped pursuant only to a prior special permit. This convention was ratified by Australia in 1989 and is a comprehensive agreement for the protection, management and development of the'marine and coastal environments of the South Pacific region. There are 10 parties to the convention: Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, France, the Marshall Islands, the Federatput ed States of Micronesia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa and the Solomon Islands. With the ocean as a source of food for many of those islands with smaller economies, it becomes a much more significant aspect of their economies. Consequently, we need to pay particular attention to the needs and aspirations of those economies to ensure that not only Australia's but their economies and elements of the environment are protected. A number of other countries, including the United States and' Nauru, have signed the convention but have not yet ratified it. The general obligations imposed on the parties to the convention to take all appropriate measures to prevent, reduce and control pollution from vessels, land based sources and sea bed activities, radioactive waste, nuclear testing, dumping and atmospheric sources are within the convention area. It is not untimely, in light of the recent revelations regarding further and ongqing tests in that area in the 1960s and 1970s that were not notified to the world. The convention area comprises the 200 nautical mile zone, in accordance with international law, of the countries that are party to the convention. As an island continent, it is extremely vital that we protect our marine environment. The Resource Assessment Commission's coastal zone inquiry final report, released last month, described Australia's coastal zone as a priceless resource. But it is not just about the coastal zones; it is about the wider area and the effects that dumping can have. Our coastal zone contains very complex and diverse ecosystems that are the subject of continual change caused by natural processes and, undoubtedly, the effects of human activities. It is to reduce the effect of human activities that these conventions need to be not just signed and adhered to but, to avoid tragic consequences in some cases, enforced. As the chairman of the caucus environment, recreation and arts committee, I am only too well aware of the need for such legislation to be effective. The Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill does more than into legislation the protocol for the prevention of pollution by dumping in the South Pacific region; it sets the standard of protection for the marine environment. The need for Australia to protect its marine environment is star. more important than ever before. Our marine environment is a major contributor to the Australian economy, particularly in such industries as fishing, tourism and recreation. The previous speaker in the debate, the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne), mentioned some aspects that he saw as important. I reinforce those aspects of the resource to refer to it as having an economic value in today's climate. Even something as seasonal as whale migrations maintains an industry and adds to the amenity and enjoyment of people who live along the coast. Some 80 or 85 per cent of Australians live along the coast-no doubt they are well aware of that amenity-and live there for a number of reasons. As someone who lives very close to the coastline, I understand that. We need to understand the impact of decisions we make in this House or business decisions we make outside it-or allowed to be made-on the resource. As the honourable member for Paterson pointed out, we risk enjoyable things such as watching whales, oyster farming or salmon fishing. I am particularly concerned about the oyster industry-I have a small oyster industry in my electorate-and the encroachment of the Pacific rock oyster. Perhaps if we had had stronger sea dumping protocols in place and better legislation on our marine approach to debunkering ballast we may have been able to avoid such a problem. Unfortunately, it is not possible to wind the clock back in some of these cases. I note the cost of attempting to reduce the impact of not making some decisions in days gone by. The Commonwealth is now spending a considerable amount of money on research into the Pacific sea star in attempting to understand and control it in our own waters. It is an introduced species, has no predators and has an environment it can thrive in, which is exactly what it is doing, to the detriment of other species. It is contributing to an unfortunate reduction in biodiversity the marine area. I strongly commend the research and development funds that have gone into combating the northern Pacific sea I have mentioned oysters and the whales that the honourable member for Paterson referred to. All such species depend very much on the way human beings treat the oceans as a resource. If we think of the oceans as just a conveyance for ships and us and something we can just flock to during the hot summer months, we have a bit of a problem. We need to have these conventions in place and they need to have teeth to ensure that countries will respect our borders and know that to transgress the conventions and spill things into the water can have longer term and wide ranging impacts. The RAC's coastal inquiry I mentioned earlier indicates that mariculture prospects depend on further expansion of domestic and international demand for various types of fish products. Recent reviews show that world demand for such products continues to increase and that traditional wild fisheries will not be able to cater for such demands. In other words, to meet that demand we need to go into a more managed area. The quality of Australia's fish product is internationally renown and creates employment for thousands of people and communities around the country. That will continue only while we have that reputation. Recently some of our land based resources-for example, the beef industry-have run into problems with some of the pollutants that have been allowed to accumulate in the soil. We are very likely to run into similar problems if we do not enforce and encourage other countries to enforce protocols and conventions such as this. We cannot afford to lose any such industry through detrimental dumping practices. In my electorate of Richmond the coastal environment plays a. very important role in providi-g employment and creating economic growth. The north coast region has a rapidly expanding tourism industry based around three areas-the Tweed, Byron and Ballina areas. Without those regions' clean beaches in and crystal clear water-you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, with your forebears having grown up in that area-we would not have an industry. I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who is sitting at the table, is nodding. If he wants come fishing, he is most welcome. Mr Snowdon-I look forward to it as long as you can guarantee I will catch something.",58
97,Mr NEWELL,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I guarantee that. Some concern has been expressed about the convention; that it may have some detrimental impact on the economics of some industriesindustries which have been allowed to dump waste in the sea. We have to balance that up very quickly and honestly with the impacts if we do not adhere to and enforce these conventions. I have outlined some of the costs which will be incurred if we do not follow through with these conventions. If we had made decisions along these lines some years ago, we would not now be faced with the costs and the downgrading of some industries, such as the oyster industry. The convention also contains a provision for ministerial declarations in relation to the coastal waters of a state. The principal effect of clause 4 will be to require a state or tory seeking a section 9 roll-back to comply with the provisions of the dumping protocol. That may have an impact on one state, and I need to address that point; I do not know whether it has been addressed by any other speakers. The situation in Tasmania, with the dumping from the Pasminco factory, has obviously caused some angst among some people from that state-and rightly so. An article which appeared in yesterday's Australian Financial Review says that Pasminco is heading towards resolving its waste problem-the dumping of jarosite waste from its zinc smelter in the Netherlands. The article quotes Pasminco's managing director as saying: ... some minor modifications would be needed to this smelter to allow the use of low-iron concen50 trate. However, he said that the low iron feed would have the side benefit of producing other waste products which might even be useful. I point out that jarosite is a high iron compound which may also contain other elements which are detrimental to the environment. That sort of news from another part of the world is welcome. But some problems still need to be overcome in order to secure to the future of that smelter in that country. I am sure that if the environmental problems can be overcome in that country, they can also be overcome in Hobart. The managing director also said: ' ... if the environmental licensing process necessary to ratify the proposals worked out between Pasminco and the Dutch authorities was finalised and the necessary changes to the smelter committed, then the smelter operations would continue. This indicates that there is some light at the end of the tunnel with regard to the concern expressed about that operation. In other words, it is possible to begin to implement the convention to ensure that substances such as jarosite do not continue to be dumped into the ocean whilst allowing the company's operations to continue. I have mentioned that the ocean is a tremendous natural resource which we must not take for granted. We must ensure that strict marine environmental controls are being terri- adhered to and come down very harshly on those who do not adhere to the regulations. We have an obligation not only to ourselves but also to our children and the international community as a whole to ensure that they are enforced. As we enjoy another Australian summer, the need for such controls really hits home. In recent years there has been a significant shift away from sea dumping as the lull environmental impact and consequences of our actions over decades have become more apparent. We cannot sustain these levels of dumping any longer. Such practices not only harm the immediate environment, but also indirectly affect our health. Approximately 85 per cent of Australia's population live in the coastal zone, with some per cent of our population growth in the last 20 years occurring in that zone outside our capital cities. It is not just because we find the climate in the coastal zone somewhat attractive; it is also because a lot of biodiversity exists-I am not talking population-wise-in that· area. We need to protect both our marine and coastal areas as part of our responsibility to future generations.",61
98,Mr LES SCOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I am very pleased. Mr Snowdon-You don't live on the coast.",62
99,Mr LES SCOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,That is a very valid point. This afternoon I said to my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) that if we do not do something about monitoring our sea levels my electorate may well finish up on the coast and his will be a long way underwater. Mr Nugent-It will be slightly improved.,62
100,Mr LES SCOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I do not know about ·that. I am pleased to rise this afternoon, on hopefully our second last sitting day of the year, to support the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill 1993. The oceans surrounding Australia are perhaps amongst our greatest natural assets. I do not think there is much doubt about that, particumoratorium larly when we look at some of the wonderful places in the state of Queensland and in northern New South Wales, which I have the opportunity to visit fairly regularly. . Mr Nugent-It is all part of Australia.",62
101,Mr LES SCOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I know that, but I want to be a bit parochial in my remarks. Not only are these bodies of water of immense environmental value in themselves-as has already been highlighted by honourable members today-but also they provide the basis of several important industries that employ a substantial number of Australians. That is a very important factor in the present economic climate. These industries include not only more traditional type, such as commercial shipping, but also those which have come to prominence over recent decades, such as tourism. Without a doubt that is our fastest growing industry. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) is always very supportive of that industry, as he was in his previous remarks. Australia's international reputation for having clean beaches and clear oceans has been a major contributing factor to the success of our tourism industry. If our oceans were polluted to any significant degree, this would not only result in the destruction of many of our traditional fisheries but also have significant implications for our tourism industry. I make reference again to my home state of Queensland. If sea dumping were to occur near the Great Barrier Reef, this would not only endanger one of the great natural wonders of the world but also have a devastating impact on the Queensland tourism industry at large. That would certainly affect the state's economy dramatically. In this area, as with many other environmental issues, what makes good environmental sense also makes good economic sense. The phenomenon of sea dumping is yet another example of humankind treating a finite resources as if it were infinite. An example of this type of arrogant behaviour occurred earlier this year, with the Russians engaging in the dumping of radioactive waste to the north of Japan. This dumping occurred in spite of the fact that there has been a on the dumping 'of low level radioactive waste for over a decade. I have spoken about low level radioactive waste in this place before. Clearly, if this precious environmental and economic resource is to be protected, international cooperation by all governments is essential. The federal government already has in place legislation designed to limit the pollution that results from the dumping of waste into the ocean. The 1981 Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act and the 1986 amendment to the act control the dumping or incineration of wastes at sea. The legislation applies to all ships in the waters of the Austhe tralian fishing zone and any Australian ship or aircraft anywhere. The act divides waste into three categories in compliance with the London Convention of 1972. These categories include material which is banned from sea dumping, material which may be dumped under special conditions, and other material that can be disposed of subject to normal precautions. Any vessel which wishes to load for the purposes of dumping or wishes to undertake dumping needs to apply for a permit. Before dumping will even be considered, a waste audit needs to be undertaken to ensure that all feasible alternatives to dumping have been investigated. Anyone wishing to undertake dumping on a regular basis needs. to make a separate application for each proposed dumping, with applications costing $2,500 for a general permit or $5,000 for a special permit. Any vessel caught not complying with permit conditions faces penalties for non-compliance. The Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill 1983 is an important step forward in Australia's playing its part in international effort. It amends the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 to give effect to the Protocol for the Prevention of Pollution of the South Pacific Region by Dumping, as well as updating penalties for non-compliance. This protocol is one of the protocols to the 1986 Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region. This is. a regional agreement established as part of the United Nations Environment Program. Throughout the world there are 11 regional plans operating under the UNEP. The UNEP established an action plan for the South Pacific region in 1982. This action plan . resulted in the negotiation of the SPREP convention in 1986, and Australia is one of 10 parties to the regional convention. The Australian parliamentary delegation which I led to Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific islands in July this year visited the SPREP secretariat in Western Samoa, which was referred to in my report which I had the pleasure of tabling here last night. Mr Hollis-Great report!",62
102,Mr LES SCOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I thank the honourable member for his comment. The Director of the SPREP, Dr Viii Fuavao, and his staff discussed issues of environmental significance with us. That particular program in Apia in Western Samoa was perhaps one of the most impressive things that we saw on that visit. The dedication and work of those people there is second to none. I am honoured to say that that program is very much supported by the Australian government and by the World Bank. It is doing marvellous work right throughout the whole South Pacific region and it is a credit to the governments and the World Bank that support it. It was certainly extremely interesting to see the work that the people there are doing and the support that they are receiving. The Director of SPREP impressed on us that all Pacific island nations are aware of the need to take action to protect the environment. For example, a small increase in sea levels would have catastrophic implications for a number of the Pacific islands. Certainly, the Australian coastline would not be exempt this from that either. I may have been making a bit of a joke earlier in the piece, but there are very many people living around our coastline. I was reading recently that more than half the population of Australia lives within eight kilometres of the sea, so we are obviously sea-loving people ourselves. Promoting biodiversity in the South Pacific is given high priority by SPREP as there are a number of species unique to the region. Australia is held in high regard by the secretariat because of the cooperation it has undertaken with this body. The director expressed appreciation for the sea level monitoring program, which was commenced by Australia and involved Flinders University. Other projects which he said he felt Australia could make a contribution to were in the areas of solar energy, water tanks and garbage disposal. During that visit one of the things that we saw that most concerned us was the efforts at garbage disposal. It is very hard for some of those small island nations to dispose of their garbage. In the Marshall Islands, on a small island called Majuro, we saw the dumping of containers, a lot of old cars and things. There is not a coordinated effort throughout those islands to dispose of such garbage. Also, when we were in Papua New Guinea, Senator Coulter from the other place took the opportunity at Madang to do some diving. He reported to us that the waste dumped in the waters there was of concern to him. We all are well aware of Senator Coulter's keen commitment to the environment. In the report of the parliamentary delegation which I tabled here last night, the delegation expressed the view that an organisation such as SPREP, with its regional bases and programs, is a positive influence which promotes sustainable development. The 1986 SPREP convention obliges the parties that have signed it to prevent, reduce and control pollution from vessels, land based sources, seabed activities, radioactive wastes, nuclear testing,. dumping and atmospheric sources within the convention area-in our case, the South Pacific. This legislation will enable Australia to ratify the SPREP dumping protocol. The appendices of this· protocol include a list of the substances that it is prohibited to dump or for which a permit should be necessary. While the organisms living in the oceans of the world account for a large proportion of marine pollution, waste from the activities of humans accounts for around 10 per cent of the total. This pollution comes as a result of not only industrial waste but also mine tailings, sewage and the dumping of dredged materials. It may come as a surprise to many members that dredged material accounts for the majority of substances dumped in the sea by humans, representing as much as 80 to 90 per cent of all dumped substances. It is staggering to think that an average of 215 million tonnes of dredged material was disposed of in this way each year between 1980 and 1985. While dredged material may be considered relatively benign by some, when we consider that as much as 10 per cent of this dredged material contains substances such as oil, heavy metals and organochlorin compounds, we can see the potential environmental devastation that couid occur. So the potential damage to the environment which can be caused by sea dumping necessitates strong action on the part of governments. I believe in this bill we are providing that. The other bill before the parliament last night increasing the shipping levy from 4c to 6c is also. relevant to this legislation. The question of the environment of our region cannot be ignored by anybody, and I would expect that such a bill as this would have bipartisan support. We must think about the future of our children. I referred earlier the area of the Great Barrier Reef where as a young man I had the opportunity to spend a fair bit of time, fishing and enjoying myself. Mr Snowdon-What did you used to do?",63
103,Mr LES SCOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,We used to do a bit of fishing and things like that. Mr Snowdon-We are not interested in things like that.,64
104,Mr LES SCOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Well, we used to get up to a few other things as well. As young men we really appreciated the facilities that the Barrier Reef provided us. Any Australian who does not have the opportunity to visit the Barrier Reef misses out on one of the great wonders of the world. We must ensure that it is protected at all costs. I mentioned earlier that our whole coastline needs to be protected. I am always concerned when I walk along the beaches and see the pollution from things like tin cans and bits of paper that are dumped. We can never stress enough on our population why we need to be aware of the need to protect our environment. Those of us who have had the opportunity to visit other parts of the world know of the sorts of problems that can arise. The other day I overheard an alderman from the Gold Coast making a comment that the federal government was not doing enough to protect the beaches and the environment of the Gold Coast. I cannot remember her name. It was one of those cases of someone-in this case a local alderman-blaming the government instead of getting on with the job of doing something to clean up the beaches. I think we are all aware of the situation in Singapore where not many lolly papers and cigarette butts are dropped in the street. . Mr Nugent-The government does that, so why doesn't your government do something about it?",64
105,Mr LES SCOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"The government in Singapore does a good job. Perhaps we should start with local authorities doing more and putting recommendations through to their respective state governments to apply fines in these cases. We need only to drive around our streets to see the amount of litter. People also litter our sea when they go out in boats, to particularly in our fishing areas. It is important that we do something really positively to protect our facilities. When the delegation visited the SPREP secretariat at Apia in Western Samoa we were able to inspect the sea level monitor1ng devices. The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) actually unveiled one of those devices at Majuro in the Marshall Islands. Last night, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) spoke about the problems faced in places like Majuro, where there is already evidence of a rise in the sea level. We all need to be very conscious of that. . The role that Australia is playing throughout the South Pacific-from Papua New Guinea to the other island states that we visited-is well regarded. As long as we continue to play our part, this part of the world will be a better place in which to live, but we still need to be conscious of the global scene. Since this will probably be my last speech before parliament rises, I take the opportunity to offer my best wishes to my parliamentary colleagues, and to the clerks and to the Hansard reporters who have been so helpful to us all again this year. I especially add my best wishes to those expressed last night to my good friend-the retiring transport officer-John May. John has looked after us for many years, making sure that we get here and get home again. He has been a good friend to all of us. John is moving to the north coast of New South Wales, to a spot just south of the Gold Coast in Queensland. I wish John and his wife a long, healthy and happy retirement there. I am sure that he will have plenty of opportunity to stroll along the beaches of the Gold Coast, that is, when he is not finding other things to entertain him-he tells me he is in walking distance to the local bowls club, but as long as he does not drive his car he will be right. As he takes a stroll, I am sure he will think about the bills like this one that have passed through parliament in his time. He knows that members of parliament, such as those honourable members who have spoken in this debate, are concerned for the future of the citizens of Australia and how they will benefit from facilities such as the ones I have been speaking about. To conclude, I would like to thank everyone associated with the parliament for the assistance they have given me and my staff. And again, I wish John May and his wife a long, healthy and happy retirement.",64
106,Mr HOLLIS,DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to be following my surfing mate, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), in the debate on this important legislation, the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill. I am last on a long list of speakers to a bill that has not provoked much dispute-it actually enjoys the bipartisan support that it should enjoy-and since t:nost of the points that needed to be made were made an hour or so ago, there is not a lot left for me to say. This bill complements the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill, passed last night, relating to marine oil pollution along the coastline. The scope of that bill was quite narrow, dealing as it did with the dumping or spillage of oil along the coastline and the great dangers that posed to our marine environment. On the other hand, the scope of the bill presently before us is much wider because it deals with the dumping of various goods in our oceans. When there is an oil spill, either through an accident or the intentional release of bilge oil-the amount of bilge coming out of ships is, I think, the greater danger-we can actually see the damage being done. It is very visible, and when it is washing over something like the Great Barrier Reef we are all justifiably outraged. But some of the things that can be dumped at sea, such as chemicals, are more insidious because we cannot see them and are therefore unaware of them. In many respects, they pose an even greater danger to the marine environment, to our lives and the lives of our children than the very visible oil spills. As the honourable member for Oxley said, the ocean water around Australia is one of our great treasures. One only has to go to Europe to see what passes for a beach there to appreciate what we have here. Because my electorate of Throsby is on the eastern seaboard-I am a patron of several surf c1ubsI am very aware of the impact of the ocean on that area. As has already been said, our oceans are important not only for their pristine beauty;' they also have an economic value. ,\ Mr Deputy Speaker, you have been a champion in this parliament of the' fishing industry, especially as it operates on the south coast of New South Wales. I have heard many of your speeches-all of them interesting, ,all of them riveting-about long-line fishing and the bluefin, not to mention the orange roughie. The role you have taken in educating us on these matters has made us all very much more aware of the important issues.' We know that the oceans are an economic source that we must protect. If we continue to dump things in our ocean, th-t economic source will not be there for very much longer. Other speakers have stressed the importance of our coastline to the tourism industry. The tourism industry promotes the fact that our water is unpolluted. I have recently visited India and Bangladesh. I did not have the opportunity to go surfing in those places, but if I had, I would have gracefully declined. On the other hand, not too many visitors who have the opportunity to take advantage of our surf beaches decline the offer. One of the previous speakers in this debate mentioned the fact that prevention of dumping in our oceans, the purpose of this bill, makes good economic sense. The government-since it is Christmas time, I will be bipartisan about this-and, indeed, all parties are committed to the protection of the Australian marine environment. We have pursued the implementation of this policy on the national and internato tional front by participating in consultations that have resulted in agreed measures for the protection and control of marine pollution. As others have said, the purpose of the bill is to amend the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act of 1981 to enable Australia to ratify the protocol for the prevention of pollution of the south pacific region by dumping, which is commonly referred to as theSPREP dumping protocol. This is one of two protocols to the Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region, otherwise known as the SPREP convention. Australia has already ratified the other protocol concerning cooperation in combating pollution emergencies in the South Pacific region. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be well aware, the SPREP convention was ratified by Australia on 19 July 1989. It is an umbrella agreement for the protection, management and development of the marine and coastline environment of the South Pacific region. It lists the sources of pollution that require control, such as: coal; pollution from ships dumping; land based sources; atmospheric discharges; and the like. This protocol recognises the dangers posed to the marine environment by pollution caused by the dumping of waste or other matter at sea, and places obligations on parties to prevent, reduce and control pollution by dumping in the protocol area. That protocol is not only concerned with the dumping of these hazardous wastes and other things at sea but also with the unintended consequences of the dangers posed to our marine environment by the condition of many of the ships that are plying up and down our coastline. Last night we said that bilge oil was a danger, but chemicals are also a great danger. We should have a register of the ships carrying chemicals around the Australian coastline because we do not know what is being carried and dumped off our coastline. The rust buckets that are carrying chemicals around the Australian coastline pose unbelievable dangers to it. But, as with so many issues, Australia can do very little on its own solve this matter. If we are going to find a solution to the problem, it has to be an international one, not just a local one. For too long the sea has been the repository of all sorts of dumped material. Last year I raised concerns in this parliament about ships coming from the Black Sea, and I received some criticism for that. I raised in this parliament information I had about the condition of some of the ships from the Black Sea, the nuclear waste carried by them and the leakages that had occurred. Indeed, Port Kembla had a nuclear waste scare because of such ships. Some people told me that I should not have said anything about the matter; that I should have been part of the conspiracy of silence that surrounds those ships from the Black Sea. I was pleased that I raised the matter because EMSA now inspects all those ships. One thing that still worries me is the fact that the former Soviet Union navy and merchant fleet have always been very interdependent; it is difficult to separate their ations. With the changes that have occurred over the last few years within the former Soviet Union and to the operations of the Black Sea port fleet, I fear that much of the material that was on those ships two or three years ago is now at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean. When organisations such as AMSA and others tightened up their inspections and made it almost mandatory that all ships from the Black Sea coming to Australia were inspected, ships on their way to Australia had a clean-out. That clean-out meant that a lot of the contaminated nuclear matter that had been carried in sealed rooms and concrete rooms in the bow was thrown overboard and is now at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. That contaminated matter could well be polluting those oceans-and all the legislation in the world will not change that. Maybe history will prove me wrong, but I am afraid that it will prove me right. That is a great worry. The sea is very fragile. In June of this year I went to the Shetland Islands to inspect the economic and social impact of the Braer disaster. The Braer ran aground off the southern end of the Shetlands in atrocious conditions over the Christmas-New Year period two years ago. I was very interested in the result because, as I have said many times in this parliament, I believe that the Great Barrier Reef faces a similar danger. It is a matter of when, not if, an environmental disaster happens there. I wanted to see, from an economic and an environmental point of view, how the Shetlands had dealt"" with a major environmental disaster. Although the disaster in the Shetlands was not quite as bad as many people thought it would be-mainly due to the freak weather conditions that prevailed at the time the Braer went aground-it was for me a very sobering exercise. Even today, two years later, the salmon industry around the Shetlands-one of the mainstays of the Shetland economy-has not recovered; nor, indeed, has the tourist industry. I conclude on a point that I made earlier. As other honourable members have done, I operhave spoken many times in this parliament about the dangers of oil pollution. Debate often centred on the condition of ships going around our coast. Oil pollution is very visible: we can see it; we can see the damage that it is doing; we can see the impact of it. And we are all horrified by it. The importance of this proposed legislation is that it is aimed at controlling the dumping of pollution that is not so visible but which could be even more damaging to the environment and to the people of the world. So, if I am right in what I suspect, the dangers of the clean-out of waste by some of those ships from the Black Sea are much greater than any danger presented by oil spills. It is the festive season, so I take a minute to wish everyone-especially you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the clerks, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Mrs Crosio), and the attendants-the compliments of the season. I thank everyone for the assistance that I have been given in this place during the past year. Let me add my voice to what .has become a chorus of voices extending good wishes to John May. I have been in this place now for 11 years. John May has always been helpful and friendly to me, and-a very important thing in this place-always discreet. I wish him well in his retirement, and I wish everyone the compliments of the season. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mrs Crosio)' read a third time. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",65
107,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith the following motion of censure: This House censures the Prime Minister for his failure to uphold proper standards of ministerial and parliamentary conduct in not dismissing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories over the gross maladministration of her portfolio and the misleading of this House in statements concerning the community cultural, recreational, and sporting facilities program. There has never been a more clear-cut case: we have an incompetent minister who has administered a corrupt program and who has misled this parliament. In those circumstances, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has to go. This is an open-and-shut case and everybody in this parliament knows that. We can walk along the front bench, talk to anyone of the ministers and they will say that without a doubt she should go. If we talk to the backbench-they are talking openly all over the parliament about this-they say she should go. If we go and talk to the media, everyone involved there says she should go. The great majority of the Australian people think she should go. There is absolutely no doubt that she has misled this parliament, that she has proved herself an incompetent minister, and that she has run a corrupt program. This is a circumstance where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) must immediately remove this woman, this minister, for a clear cut breach of ministerial responsibility, for incompetence, and for misleading this parliament. One only had to be in this parliament over the course of the last few weeks and watch this minister try to answer questions about this program to know how incompetent she really is. People on both sides of the parliament were squirming at her inability to provide a simple explanation for her giving one grant and not another-absolutely squirmingOrders Mrs Crosio interjecting",68
108,Dr BEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"I was watching the honourable member who just interjected, and she too was squirming over there. Mr Chynoweth interjecting",68
109,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"Everybody was squirming because the minister just stood there, totally incompetent, totally unable to offer any simple explanations",68
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Mr Jenkins)Order! The parliamentary secretary will come to order. The honourable member for Dunkley will not interject on his feet.,68
111,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"as to how she administered a $30 million slush fund, allocating money in order to buy votes in key marginal seats. There is absolutely no doubt that that money was allocated in a way advantageous to the Labor Party at the expense of the coalition. The minister could not satisfy the Auditor General with any information about how she made the choice between one grant and another. As we dug into each grant we found just how ludicrous some of them were. grants given for lights for football clubs that did not even exist. The minister could not stand up and give a clear cut explanation for her putting one grant ahead of another; nor .could she satisfy the Auditor-General. Most importantly, of course, the minister clearly misled this House by saying on a couple of occasions that she had provided all the documents to the Auditor-General. When it was clearly demonstrated that we had a document that had not been passed on to the Auditor-General, it was quite clear that she was misleading this parliament again. That was confirmed before a parliamentary committee yesterday in a statement from the Auditor-General. She clearly misled this parliament. The Prime Minister, perhaps, knows better than anybody else that misleading the parliament is a hanging offence. This is an openand-shut case. When a minister misleads this parliament-if parliament is to mean anything; if the integrity of this institution is to mean anything-that minister has to go. Gough Whitlam, when he was Prime Minister, understood this. He sacked Jim Cairns for misleading the parliament over the loans affair. Bob Hawke understood itunderstood it particularly clearly. He forced the resignation of John Brown, the minister for sports, tourism, and everything else at that time, for misleading this parliament over the tendering processes for Expo. And we do not have to go much further than the grandfather of the New South Wales Right, Neville Wran, to get a clear cut statement of the situation in this regard. I remember the time in 1983 when he removed Rex Jackson for his involvement in an early release scheme. He said: I regret losing the services of Mr Jackson but to mislead the Parliament is a most serious matter and, under the Westminster system, must lead to the resignation of the Minister. If that were not enough, our present Prime Minister, in an earlier manifestation, seconded a motion moved against one of the Fraser government ministers in this parliament in 1981. He said: The crime this Minister has committed is to have lied to all of us here, to have lied to the Parliament and to have misled the Parliament. The whole concept of ministerial accountability and responsibility has just simply broken down. It is a corrupt Government. It is corrupt because it has no standards of integrity. To try to restore some of the integrity this Minister should accept the censure and get out, resign. That is a clear cut statement from the present Prime Minister when he was in opposition and seconding a censure motion-a clear cut statement from him of ministerial responsibility; a clear cut statement of the penalty for misleading this parliament-that the minister must resign, and that if she is not prepared to resign, she should be sacked. I have been fascinated by the fact that the Prime Minister has stood beside this minister and defended her incompetence. It makes us stop and wonder why he has defended the grants program. The reason, of course, is that all of those opposite are involved. This was a massive piece of political corruption in the run-up to the last election, and the Prime Minister has stood side by side with the minister, defending her incompetence. Of course, he has had plenty of experience of incompetence on the other side of this House. We only need to think back to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) being exposed at the time of the last budget. We only need to think about the pay television scandal and the way that the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Collins) were exposed for incompetence. We only need to look at the Mabo debate and the way in which the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) was sidelined. The opposition also exposed the incompetence of the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker). Then there is the area of industrial relations where the incompetence of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has been exposed. On the issue of child care and the new accreditation system, the incompetence of the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) was exposed. The incompetence of the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) was exposed. In the pensioner investment area, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) were exposed. The Prime Minister has had plenty of experience with incompetence. It is he who has lowered the standards of ministerial performance to that level. It is interesting to note that while the Prime Minister may stand side by side with the minister on the issue of incompetence, surely, on the basis of his past practice, he cannot stand side by side with her on the issue of misleading this parliament. When behaviour like that is causing him electoral damage, he will even move on a mate. We all remember when he moved on the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), standing him down in the run-up to the last election because that minister was becoming an electoral liability. When the previous Speaker became an electoral liability, the Prime Minister stood him down and finally cut his throat. The honourable member is here now. Because of that $65,000 he was stood downMr Leo MCLeay-Your side is going to cut your throat.",68
112,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"The honourable member for Watson must be feeling particularly good about the fact that he was sacrificed while this minister continues to sit on the front bench. We have to ask ourselves one question: why is the Prime Minister defending this minister when he has already cut the throat of two mates? The answer is that the minister is not just a mate; she is actually family. She is of the royal· family; that is why he will not cut her off. I have visions of the Prime Minister coming back into this parliament early next year. There will be no more Zegna suits then. He will be trailing a long gown-probably with the Treasurer running along carrying the train-and the pair of them will be very regal. They will come in here and go through the whole parliamentary business. Then they will go back to the Lodge, which by this time, of course, has become the palace. The Prime Minister is becoming very regal and very imperialMrs Crosio-Ha, hal",70
113,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"The honourable member for Prospect laughs, but she would dearly love to be part of the royal family. She has not made it yet. She is just a mate. She does not make it into the royal family. Mrs Crosio- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask you illuminate and to inform the Leader of the Opposition that I am neither a lady-in-waiting nor a mate. I am quite sure that he would like to have that brought to his attention.",70
114,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,70
115,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"The Prime Minister should be censured because this minister is incompetent. She has proved her incompetence. She has run a corrupt program and she has committed the mortal sin of this political system, and that is to mislead this House. Surely honesty means something. It means a lot to me; it means a lot to the people of Australia. But it obviously means nothing-absolutely nothing-to this government, which has consistently lied and cheated to get into power. The Prime Minister has lied and cheated so many times that he now respects it as the law",70
116,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw that remark.,70
117,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,:-I withdraw. The Prime Minister has misrepresented the situation so many times .that he has lost sight of the part importance of honesty in this government. (Time expired),70
118,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Is the motion seconded?,70
119,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"Higgins) (3.18 p.m.)Mr Speaker, I second the motion. We are sick of dealing in this parliament with the minor royals, like the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). It is now time for the head of the royal family himself, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to come into this parliament and do something to protect the minor royals. It is time for the emperor to come down and give some kind of defence. It is time that the people of Australia saw that the emperor has no clothes-the emperor has no justification; the emperor has no standards; the emperor has no defence; the emperor has no potentiality whatsoever for justifying this. This is an emperor who has no defence. There is no more important issue going to ministerial accountability than the way in which ministers deal with taxpayers' money and account for it to the parliament. When it comes to Minister Kelly, she strikes out on every front. Her problem is now the Prime Minister's problem. We only have to look at today's West Australian, which says: Kelly's sport aid lashed by auditor. Chickens coming home to roost. 'Sports rorts' blame must stop with Kelly. If we go through the editorials, the Canberra Times says: Grants: whiff of politics. The Telegraph Mirror: It's time to show your hand, Ros. The Bendigo Advertiser: Kelly should stand down. The Sydney Morning Herald: Smoke from Kelly's fire. The West Australian said: itself back Biased Kelly has to go. Government member interjecting",70
120,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"These are editorials, dummy.",71
121,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,We have already had the West Australian.,71
122,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"Don't you engage in a cacophony of sound, trying to shout me down just because I am a man. We know what your tactics are. You hate the sight of trousers on this side.",71
123,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The honourable member for Higgins will resume his seat. The Leader of the House on a point of order,71
124,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"I am glad you told us you are a nian, because we would not have known.",71
125,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,:-There is no point of order.,71
126,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"You hate. the sight of trousers on this front bench, especially ones you buy off the rack. Yes, you hate trousers that come off the rack in ordinary sizes. The West Australian says: Mrs Kelly is following the modem tradition of trying to tough it out until the storm clear that the scheme was handled in her office and she is responsible ... The facts are obvious. The only proper course is for Mrs Kelly to be sacked. The Age said, 'Pork-barrel politics'. Even the Australian said, 'Sporting Grants of Concern'; the Herald-Sun, 'Kelly's last stand'; the Sunday Herald-Sun, 'Sexism blunder'. The Leader of the House will like this: Mrs Kelly also was hit by friendly fire of the most dangerous kind. In an embarrassing and feeble attempt to defend his struggling colleague, Employment Minister Kim Beazley entertained the gallery with the preposterous claim that the Opposition was targeting Mrs Kelly because of her sex. The Adelaide Advertiser said: Mrs Kelly may well have come to the aid of the party but she seems today to be a naive liability. She should be consigned to the backbench to devote her energies full time to the needs of her affluent electorate. We had the same in the Canberra Times yesterday: Kelly trial deepens, a judgment nearing. We have this wonderful cartoon, and because it is Christmas I will read it out. We have a Santa Claus looking like Mrs Kelly writing a letter, and it says this: Yes, Virginia ... there really is a Santa Claus .. If you listen carefully you can hear her ho ho ho-ing d9wn your marginal electorate chimney on election eve. This minister is an absolute disgrace. This minister is an absolute joke. This minister, by any ordinary standards, ought to go. If she will not go, there is only one person responsible, and that is the emperor himself-the head of the royal family who has to step in. Heads of royal families have to do this sometimes. They have to discipline the younger members who say things that they should not say when it comes to tape recordings and tabloids and other areas. This has to be done from time to time. The head of the royal family-the emperor himself-has to step in. He has to exercise control. He has to take responsibility. He has to make sure that the minister is accountable to the parliament. He has to discipline her. He has to stand her down. He has to reassure the people of Australia that there is some accountability in his government, and he must make sure that passes. It is this minister is gone.",71
127,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"We have had the first vain knight palely loitering in this particular instance-the old Don Quixote himself. Now we have had Pancho Sanchez, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). He comes up as a loyal follower. He managed to contribute in the entirety of this week's discussion absolutely nothing new from what he presented in weeks before. We must expect this of him because his is a personality which has been evident to the general public, and those who know him, and some of those who may well have once loved him, for a very long period of time. Some journalist recently came across a most interesting description of the honourable member who has just sat down. It is so good that I thought it is worth regaling the House with it as one of the reasons why we might forget about this particular censure motion. It was the 10 October 1977 issue of the student newspaper Lot S Wife reproduced on the letters page. It was a poem written by Doreen Previn and it was sent in .by a student who suggested that it reminded her of the ,honourable member for Higgins. Entitled 'The PerfeCt Man' it reads: I looked up at that perfect man His long golden hair ' His fair and flawless face His rhetorical style He had such grace He had such grace So sure he seemed So together and complete Like no man I've ever known I was dazzled ' I was thrown by his stro'ng Persuasive style and his sweet Self-centred smile And not once did I cheat And look down at his feet Knowing they would be grey And they would be made of clay They knew him then; we know him now. There is not a thing in that particular poemread extraordinarily well, honourable members would agree-that has in any way been disproved or taken away from by his performance here over the last four weeks. The only difference in today's events is that the vain knight or pale light who has been loitering on this subject for the past month has finally cut loose. We have had several attempts at moving censure motions during the normal periods of sitting of his House this w-ek, and the pale light knight has vainly lOItered through all of them. Finally, at 3.30 in the afternoon, when everybody else in the government is going abOut their business doing the things that are necessary to continuto improve the economic recovery that is well under way, the vain knight has finally cut loose in this place. He is at last entrusted to be able to stand up and display his lance for all of us to see on the subject of where he thinks the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) ought to be placed. What is the opposition arguing about? We have to get to the nub of this particular proposition. The opposition is arguing that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories misled the parliament. The particular document which the opposition uses is a document that was before the Auditor-General in the entirety of his considerations. In fact, erroneously the ppposition chlims that its presentation of that document to the Auditor General some 12 months plus ago was what actually started the investigation. Mr Leo MCLeay-Who said that?",71
128,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"That was Pancho. The Auditor-General was actually invited to confirm whether or not Pancho had been misleading the general public on that topic. The Auditor-General was quite cheerful in making a presentation to the committee which said, 'Well, no, the claims of the man with the feet of clay are quite erroneous'. Of course, that did not have anything to do with the launching of the investigation, but the detail was there. If we are going to censure somebody for misleading the House, we have to establish that in the course of misleading the House the person misled the House in such a way that it made a material difference to the proceedings of the House-a material difference to the consideration of the issue either in this House or elsewhere, or that there was a product of that outcome which has produced an outcome in the rest of the community that is materially to their disadvantage. This is absolute nonsense. Absolutely nothing has been presented. Indeed, the Auditor-General was questioned at length by the Clarence Darrows who found their way onto this committee to confirm for them the sort of heinous nature of the crime that they think has been perpetrated upon them. The Auditor-General was asked, 'Would presentation of this letter have made any difference to your considerations?'. The Auditor-General might well have said, 'Well, it did not make any difference because I already had it'. The Auditor-General did not bother to say even that; he said, 'No, it would not make any difference to our consideration of these , matters'. Why would it not have made a difference to his consideration of these matters? Why would not the smoking gun in the opposition's mind have made a difference? One expects of a smoking gun that a bullet has gone off and hit someone somewhere and the opposition ought to know something about it in order to advance its cause. The whole point about trying to get to the bottom of any supposed act of concealment is to do that. The reason why the Auditor-General found that it made no material difference to any of his considerations is simply this: the material contained.in it was a statement of applications that had been made from the electorate of Wills to the minister, and to the minister's office in the department, for sporting grants. Those lists existed in plethora in the departmental records and had all been presented to the Auditor-General, and had all been· considered by him in arriving at the conclusions that were arrived at. Mr Costello-Gellibrand, not Wills.",72
129,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"All right, Mr Willis, the honourable member for Gellibrand. It is about as relevant a point in the course of this discussion as the letter itself. Those opposite have been like the people who carved the Lord's Prayer on a pin head. They take a grand piece of literature of great spiritual meaning and debase it by seeing whether they can carve it on a pin head. The opposition's efforts in arguing this case have gone around and around. The parliamentary standards are elevated into the aether, into the heavens, to be examined, defended, worshipped and glorified. What have those opposite produced to demonstrate whether those offences against those principles have been committed? They have hauled out a pin head and presented it to us as something that we and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) are supposed to take seriously in this place. One would have thought that a man of minimum competence-he has affirmed to us that he is indeed a man, and we are all grateful for that knowledge-in this place would, after about a month's activity and opportunity under freedom of information acts, and after endless consultations with the Auditor-General's Office and his sleuth-like efforts at putting questions down, have had something new to say in the course of the proceedings of either yesterday or today. Of course, nothing was there. Throughout my speech I have been referring the bulk of my remarks to the honourable member for Higgins. I have scarcely had anything to say about the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) because there is nothing to say about him on this matter. The Leader of the Opposition lives in a vapid field in which he ruminates on things that might have been as he watches· the cycle pass him, as he tries not to accept personal responsibility for the monumental failure of his party at the federal election earlier this year and tries to devise some reason why he should continue to exist in office. Those opposite have finally prodded him. They have got a pitchfork into his backside and said, 'There is a bit going on in this place. Why don't you get up and let yourself be seen, let it be known that you actually amount to a row of beans in this place, let it be seen that you have some value in you, because, were you not to demonstrate that, another person might well come into this place and deal with you'? Despite his laziness, the efforts of the honourable member for Higgins are directed at putting exactly that prod into him because he does not want some leader other than himself to emerge. It is a pathetic effort on his part.",73

135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"As the honourable member would be aware, I have responsibilities relevant to the operation of this parliament, this chamber and these precincts. I would not think that that matter comes under my administration. The short answer is no. NA Reform of the Budget Processes",75
136,Mr DAWKINS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Fremantle-Treasurer)by leave-In the 1993-94 budget, I announced the government's intention to move away from the traditional August budget date and to bring the budget down before the commencement of the financial year. Since then, I have discussed the details of that change in timing and, perhaps more importantly, the proposed change in budget processes, with my colleagues, and with the Australian Democrats, the Greens (WA) and Senator Harradine. I offered to include the opposition in these discussions, but unfortunately it refused to participate. While we now have agreement from a majority of the Senate on the nature of the budget processes and timetable, I remain willing to discuss these arrangements with the opposition, and for them to participate in the proposed consultation processes if they commit themselves to the principle of an early budget. These reforms constitute much more than just a change in timetable: They are part of major. reform in financial administration in Australia. Not only will the budget become a superior vehicle for program planning and management, but the nature of the budget process itself will change, with greater opena ness, enhanced consultation procedures and better community understanding of the fiscal framework and strategy. The government's fiscal policies are now set in a medium-term framework which, while providing a short-term stimulus to support the recovery, at the same time establishes a program of fiscal consolidation over the medium term. This framework aims to provide a foundation for achieving sustainable and strong growth in activity and employment with continuing low innation over the remainder of the 1990s. Within this framework, specific outlays and revenue measures announced in the 1993-94 budget will build up to savings of around $8 1/z billion by 1996-97, which will reduce the Commonwealth deficit to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97.1 note with appreciation that this medium-term fiscal strategy has been accepted by both the Australian Democrats and the Greens (WA) , but unfortunately not by the opposition. The further reforms to the budget processes are threefold. First, as I have already announced, the 1994-95 budget will be delivered on 10 May 1994. The earlier budget will enable departments and agencies to plan on a full financial year basis with budget funding available on a similar time frame. Passage of the budget bills before the start of the financial year would render a supply period unnecessary. The changes will also provide states and territories with the opportunity to bring down their budgets before the end of the financial year, allowing better planning and implementation of programs. There will also be potential for better coordination of fiscal policy. Second, in formulating the 1994-95 budget, there will be a new process of pre-budget consultations undertaken with the government caucus, the Australian Democrats, the Greens (WA) and Senator Harradine. As I mentioned earlier, the opposition would also be welcome to participate in this process if it commits a itself to the principle of an early budget. I believe that a more open budget development process is in the interests of good government. The government will make available its overall budget strategy and objectives through public paper setting out the broad fiscal framework for the budget. This paper will be available in late February and will provide the framework both for consultations with the caucus and with the Australian Democrats, Greens (WA) and Senator Harradine and for more general public debate. Hopefully this process will lead to a much better understanding of the budgetary process itself and the constraints within which a budget must be developed. Of course, a prime purpose of the consultations is to enable the Australian Democrats, Greens (WA) and Senator Harradine to put forward proposals to the government, and to have them considered as part of the development of the budget. The consultation process may not lead to agreement on all issues. However, it will reduce the scope for disagreement and ensure that all parties to the process have a better understanding of each other's respective positions. This will provide a better basis for parliamenDemocrats tary consideration of the budget. The third element of the budget reform package will be to improve budget and related documentation and to ensure enhanced opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny of budget measures, program outcomes and the activities of departments. Budget and related documentation will be revamped to reflect two major stages of parliamentary scrutiny-the first in May; the second from September, including additional estimates from November. In May, the documentation will provide a basis for effective parliamentary scrutiny by focusing on the government's economic and budgetary strategy, major measures and continuing appropriations for the coming year, as well as estimates of aggregate current year outcomes. The second set of documentation will include revenue and outlays outcomes for the financial year, and rationalised accountability documents reporting on the .outcome of programs and the activities of departments, while avoiding as far as' possible the duplicatime tion currently contained in program performance statements an,d annual reports. Desirably, audited financial statements will be included within the documents but the possibility of this-in terms of timing-has yet to be determined. These would be the key accountability documents for the parliamentary scrutiny process. The precise form of this documentation is subject to further consideration and consultation with the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Australian Democrats, Greens (WA) and Senator Harradine, and, if they make a commitment to the principle of an early budget, with the opposition. The Australian Democrats and Greens have agreed to these budget processes and a timetable which would facilitate consideration of the appropriation bills and associated revenue bills so as to enable the Senate to complete its consideration of the bills, without removing any of the rights of respective parties, with the aim of resolution of the bills by 30 June 1994. The details of the new arrangements are set out in the report of a joint working party involving the government, the Australian and the Greens. A copy of that report is attached to this statement. I commend this package of budget reforms to the House. I table the report and the attached working party report.",75
137,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The statement that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has made today about the budget process for 1994 and for the 1994-95 budget is a response to the debacle of the 1993 budget process. I want to say at the outset of my remarks that the coalition rejects the early budget timetable proposed by the Treasurer. We reject the early budget for three reasons. First of all, it is perfectly clear that the raison d'etre for the early budget is to collect extra revenue over a period of months that would not have been available had the budget proceeded at the usual time. This is a tax and spend government which is committed not just to big spending programs but to placing an ever growing burden of taxation on Australians. The bringing forward of next year's budget from the traditional time of August, which has served this country well since federation, to May is simply a grab for extra taxes. Let me take the example of the jobs tax, which the Treasurer to his credit is trying to resist, but which many members of the government are attempting to impose on Australians. If we took an approximate figure of a jobs tax raising $3 billion through a financial year, from 1 July to 30 June, and if this jobs tax were introduced in this year's budget, the government would end up collecting that full $3 billion for the financial year rather than a lesser figure had the budget been brought down in August. If the jobs tax had been effective from an August budget in that financial year, it would have brought in $2.6 billion. In other words, in the context of the jobs tax, the bringing forward of the budget is worth another $400 million to the government in extra taxes. As I mentioned, this is a government which has a preoccupation with raising extra taxes. Honourable members should remember that, at the time of the last election, $8 billion worth of income tax cuts was promised. Already $5· billion of those inc<;>me tax cuts has been abandoned and there is a debate within the government over whether the last $3 billion of tax cuts, which became effective from November of this year, will also be abandoned and be snatched back in the form of the jobs tax. The government admits that more revenue will be needed to meet the deficit reduction target, in particular the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has made that point. That is only reinforced by the fact that, in the green paper, the government is looking at $1.4 billion worth of spending on top of its existing budgetary obligations, and that will have to be funded somehow. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said that there will be no spending cuts. But only an extremist or a fool believes that there should be spending cuts. Frankly, if that is the case, the only way the government can fund the green paper initiatives would be through increases in taxation. If it is not the jobs tax per se, it will be backdoor methods of increasing revenue and increasing the burden of taxation. The point is that bringing forward the budget in this way is a backdoor method of simply raising extra revenue. We also oppose the bringing forward of the budget-the early bUdget. It will create administrative dislocation within the bureaucracy in terms of its financial and economic planning. The Treasurer's decision is a long standing dream of his, I gather, to bring forward the budget. It goes back to the time when he argued for it when he was the Minister for Finance. The then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, was averse to the idea and knocked it on the head. The reason it was knocked on the head when the present Treasurer was the Minister for Finance was that both the Treasury and the Department of Finance argued that it was an administratively inefficient thing to do. Despite the fact that those departments still maintain precisely that view and have argued precisely that case with the Treasurer, he has all the same decided to go ahead with this measure-and, I must say, very unwisely. It is very unwise not only in the face of opposition from Treasury and the Department of Finance, but also in the face of opposition from many senior ministers. For example, the Treasurer's colleague the Minister for Finance, still embittered from losing the job of Treasurer to the existing Treasurer, has opposed doggedly this decision to bring forward the budget next financial year. It has also been opposed quite prominently and leaked through to the media by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and a large number of other ministers. The cabinet decided to cave in only when the Treasurer made it perfectly clear to the cabinet that, after all he had been through with this year's budget, if he did not get his way in bringing the budget forward he would resign. It was only on that basis. It was not on the basis of analysis; not on the basis of common sense; not on the basis of a practical initiative; but on the basis of saving the ego and reputation of the Treasurer, such as is left. I waIit to make it perfectly clear that, by bringing forward the budget, it will have to be based on incomplete estimates for that financial. year and will be based on incomplete estimates of the economic outcomes for that year as well. By August, a mini-budget will almost certainly be needed. The final point that I want to make is this: the government has put together a so-called agreement with minor parties. This agreement does two things. First, it reduces the power of parliament because the debating time for the budget is apparently, should the minor parties uphold the agreement, limited to a particular deadline. There will only be four to five sitting weeks for the budget to be considered by the parliament-unprecedented since federation-whereas normally this process lasts for three or four months, and that is a system that has worked perfectly well in the past. Mrs CrosioYour time is up.",76
138,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The more the honourable member for Prospect interjects, the longer I will take. That system has worked perfectly well in the past. The simple fact is that the power of parliament has been reduced by the government through this process. I believe the Democrats and the Greens have made a major mistake in going along with this process because they have absolutely thrown away the power of the parliament in doing so. In conclusion, I want to make it clear that we will simply not accept the Treasurer's proposition that the budget should be brought forward. This is a crude grab for extra tax revenue and it is a procedure which has undennined the power of the parliament. I know that satisfies the centralists of the Australian Labor Party, but it is something that we will never stand by. NA Procedure Committee Debate resumed 25 November, on motion by Dr Blewett: That the House take note of the report.",78
139,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to speak again in this debate. Leave granted.",78
140,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"I wish to speak again in relation to the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure entitled About time: bills, questions and working hours. It is a milestone report. But before I do, I might interest some honourable members in a letter to a constituent that was published in the West Australian newspaper today. This might be topical when we are commenting on the best way of representing our constituents. It comes from a book entitled Honourable Members: A Study o/the british Backbencher and is written by a British member of parliament Antony Henry in reply to constituents who were asking him to voteagainst the budget of 1714. He said: Gentlemen, I received your letter about the excise, and I am surprised at your insolence at writing to me at all. You know and I know that I bought this constitusigned ency. You know and I know that I am now determined to sell it, and you know what you think I don't know, that you are now looking out for another buyer, and I know, what you certainly don't know, that I have found another constituency to buy. About what you have said about the excise; may God's curse light upon you all, and may it make your homes as open and as free to the excise officers as your wives and daughters have been to me while I've represented your rascaJly constituency. I thought that was an amusing letter to a constituent in the 18th century. I hesitate t<;> say that similar arrogance is exercised by some of the members of the government front bench. We have seen in this place over the past 10 to 15 years a tremendous increase in the innuence of the executive vis-a-vis the rest of parliament. I want to make a few comments in relation to that-and the repbrt. The first thing I want to talk about is bipartisanship. There seems to be a perpetual myth in this place that there is bipartisan spirit on some of the matters we examine, particularly in comReport mittees. Unfortunately it has become the case-the evidence bears this out-that this bipartisanship often only exists when the government penn its it. In other words, when the executive allows for there to be bipartisanship it occurs to a certain extent, but when the executive disagrees with the intent or motives of the bipartisan action that is being proposed, the government very quickly stamps it on the head. The most recent example of this was the report on the televising of the proceedings of the House of Representatives by the relevant committee. The Speaker, who was the chairman of the committee, and the government committee members supported the report. It was a majority-I think unanimous-report. Notwithstanding the support of the presiding officer of this House and members of the government, when it came to the crunch, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) decided that the changes being proposed in the report were not acceptable. There was the supreme embarrassment of seeing members of the committee, who had and supported the report-because of their pledge to their political party and the decision of the caucus-vote in this chamber against the provisions of that report. They had supported it prior to its publication. It is to the eternal embarrassment of those members that that took place. It was a supreme example of the limitations of the so-called bipartisan spirit we so often hear about in this House. The theme of my speech is to relate how this touches on the report which was prepared by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure. There is no secret about the modus operandi of the government; the Prime Minister has made it perfectly clear time after time. He has said in this place and elsewhere that members of the government, the Australian Labor Party, won the election-we came second-and therefore they would use the numbers to do what they saw fit. Whether or not that was in the interests of the country, they would do what was in the interests of the ALP. So it is with some concern that I look at proposals in this report. It is quite clear that the government uses every element at its disposal to further its own ends, whether or not that is in the interests of t-e country or the ALP. Invariably, it is in the interests of the ALP more than those of the country. The second theme is the changes that have been made to this place-the symbols and conventions-as part of that process. It is a truism that in any program of change, evolutionary or revolutionary, the symbols, conventions and habits that provide a link to one's heritage and past are seen as being obstacles to change. It is no coincidence that in that process we have seen gradually-in some cases more openly and radically-those changes taking place in front of our eyes. If we cast a look at the chair you are on, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - obviously you cannot-we can see a most glaring example in this chamber of a symbolic change that was made on the move from the temporary parliament to this building in 1988. The plain, russet coated nature of that chair is symbolic of the attitude, modus operandi or program that sees the conventions, habits and symbols of our past links to our constitutional origins as being impediments to the sorts of changes which members of the ALP, the government, want to see occur in this nation. Under those circumstances, one has to look at some of the changes being proposed. This document has a great number of positive answers to our problems of sittings and managing the House of Representatives. It is quite clear that the hours that members are obliged to sit-I suppose that this week is as good a week as any because we will be sitting probably for six sitting days in a row-have been responsible for a decline in some members' health. Some unfortunate health problems have struck members and senators. As a consequence of the strain which is placed on them-this is in relation to the House of Representatives members in particular-there has been a decline in the decision making process, manifested in the sorts of problems we have seen in the drafting of legislation and responses by ministers, parliamentary secretathe ries and others to policy dilemmas or problems. One response-I suppose in a simplistic but important way; we are talking about how these things affect decision making-is that people become testy, impatient and less tolerant when sitting long hours and having to concentrate and work under those circumstances. It is not surprising that, in response to those sorts of stimuli, we see ministers being surrounded by people who are more reticent and less likely to question the decisions they are making, for fear of upsetting them because of the strain and the tenseness that come from the long sitting hours. We have had a bit of a laugh at theimperial nature of the prime ministership in 1993, the development of an imperial household sitting surrounding the Prime Minister. We have talked about the extended royal family of the Labor government. But it is not sutprising that the government is becoming much more authoritarian because, in the end, the Prime Minister-who no doubt has to work extraordinary hours-responds in the same way. After all, he is only a human being, not a super human. The sorts of strains we are placing on our members, ministers, shadow ministers and all the people who participate-the staff are a major element in the operations of this place-lead in the end to a diminished capacity to make rational decisions. At a time when this country is in crisis and the economy is in such dire straits and we need rational, cool thinking and clear decisions to direct us out of the mess we are in, the first place where those changes have to be made is right here in this chamber. Those changes speak for themselves. I think it is important that we recognise the proposal to reduce daily sitting hours is probably the most important part of the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure. However, as I said in my previous offering, it is unfortunate that, in considering the effect of the long daily sitting hours and the opportunities for structuring the daily program within a framework of fewer sitting hours per day, we did not consider the amount of time that we spend in the House over a year-in other words, lengthening the sitting time of this House. I think the real answer to this problem is not to try to squeeze more out of a day or re-jig things to extract the same sort of output as is extracted under the present sitting hours, but to increase the number of sitting weeks. I think one of the great failings of this report is that it did not look at that aspect of our working procedures in the House of Representatives. The most significant change that has been proposed in this report is the creation of a second chamber. I have already spoken about this, but I want to reiterate some of my comments. In the intervening debate, government and opposition committee members have raised a number of points. There has been a certain amount of bipartisan interest in this issue, even within the limitations about which I have already spoken with regard to the provisions of this report. I have severe reservations about the second chamber on the basis that it would diminish the importance of the main chamber.' I am concerned that the procedures of this House, which quite clearly and quite rightly revolve around the main House of Representatives chamber, would be diminished by the creation of a second chamber operating parallel to the main chamber. One could call it the second reading committee, but essentially it will be called the main committee, which will operate parallel to this chamber. A range of issues have arisen out of this proposal, some of which have not been resolved satisfactorily. There are a number of questions in relation to the actual physical problem of the House being in two places at the same time. The original intent was to have the non-contentious legislation moved into the that main committee chamber for the purpose of allowing more time for debate and giving members more opportunity to speak on legislation. In recent times, we have seen the compression of debate; the guillotine has been used mercilessly in the last 12 months. Under such circumstances, it is believed that members would have more time for debate in the second chamber. That may well be the case to a certain extent, but the difficulty arises in the case of the bills. What happens to those bills which get shunted into the second chamber? Do they become less important? We can sometimes pick and choose the bills we will refer to. Some of the traditional, perennial bills which come into this place are not debated and are seen to be procedural or, to a certain extent, not as important as others. But they are obviously important to the community and the people they affect. As a consequence of being moved into a second chamber-a chamber which would quite clearly be seen to be the secondary chamber-their importance in debates in this place would be diminished. It is. my view that, instead of creating a second chamber, we ought to increase the number of sitting weeks per annum. That would give us the opportunity to debate the bills in this chamber much more thoroughly and widely. There are two great disappointments in this report-the first being that the committee did not look at the opportunities for extending the length of the sitting year, and the second being the refusal to survey all members as to their preferences on sitting hours and ideas about sitting weeks and the times that we sit in this place. It is disappointing that that did not take place. It leads me to suspect that bipartisanship was not really there in the first instance. (Time expired)",78
141,Ms HENZELL,COMMITTEES,"Capricornia) (4.15 p.m.)I am indebted to the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) for reading to us that fascinating letter from the 18oos. I think it indicates just how far democracy has come. Thankfully, irrespective of whatever arguments the opposition might run, we are not in the business of buying electorates any more. The abuse of that power has been removed because we have universal suffrage. I think we have a lot to be thankful for. As a new member of the House, I had to ask myself: what am I going to add to this debate? I did not make a submission to the Standing Committee on Procedure. I want to compliment the committee on its excellent report. I say in response to the honourable member for Moore that many committee reports are indeed bipartisan. One very positive aspect of the conduct of our responsibilities in this House is being involved in the parliamentary committee system where I believe members of all parties work together cooperatively for the common good, to further the cause of democracy and to address the concerns and welfare of the people of this country. I was very proud to be involved in the tabling of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs yesterday. In this way, members of parliament of all political persuasions can make a contribution and in fact take the process of government directly to the people. I have attended public hearings of the ATSI committee and the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. It has been a very enlightening experience to be able to represent the parliament directly to the community and see the very positive response of the constituents who are able to come before a formal parliamentary hearing to give evidence. In fact, the family law committee made a couple of innovations. One was the much publicised child support hotline, the second involved the conduct of our public hearings. At the end of hearing formal evidence, We invited people who wished to do so to get up and give a short statement to the committee. This enabled a number of people who would not have otherwise put in a formal submission to do so. I congratulate previous parliaments for instituting this very positive contribution to policy formulation. When we look at any review or assessment of how the parliament runs we have to ask ourselves: what is the purpose? Obviously and most importantly, our focus should be on the protection of the democratic institutions of the parliament and our political process. We should also examine how we communicate the result of our deliberations to the electorate. It must involve some consideration of the people who work here-the political representatives and all of the staff who make up and support the parliamentary process-:-and the media, which is the avenue through which a great deal of deliberation is conveyed to the electorate at large. I would like to say in passing that I have appreciated very much the support that, as a new member of parliament, I have received from all the officers and staff of the parliament. They have made a huge difference. I am sure all of my colleagues, experienced or inexperienced, would remember the sort of learning curve that one faces as a new member of parliament. But it is very encouraging to receive this sort of support and information, which are given so freely and so positively that it is not hard to build one's confidence. I express my appreciation to all parliamentary officers and staff. However, it is also true that we have to look at the reality, which is that in our modem political system we have moved a long way from the liberal theory of representative government. The report has acknowledged this in the opening remarks which state: The committee has not sought to be radical, nor original, nor overly ambitious. The committee does not share the nostalgic view of an idealised House of Representatives· based on the days before political parties. The committee Sees robust adversarial political parties as central to the system, and executive dominance and as a consequence executive responsibility as a fact of life. Obviously, that is a matter of concern to not only the opposition but also, I am sure, the parliament as a whole. It is certainly true that this has developed out of the political system. I would like to quote from a speech given recently by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), who chaired this committee. He was talking about the executive and party government. As he pointed out, this is not just peculiar to Australia; it is true of most representative democracies. With the rise of modem political parties there has been a parallel demise in the liberal theory of representation-although, as we saw from the letter quoted by the honourable member for Moore, that may not always have been so liberal or democratic. The honourable member for Bonython said: If a Government only exists and can only survive with the control of the representative chamber, then the key political imperative is to ensure effective and continuing executive control of that chamber. The rise of the disciplined political party, a necessary phenomenon in mass electorates, has provided the instrument by which a party leadership through democratic elections gains control of the chamber, maintains that control, and seeks to use that control in that forum to continue in office through further electoral success. Some people, particularly those opposite, may not feel particularly comfortable with that, but that is the nature of modem politics and it certainly has an impact on how we conduct ourselves in this chamber. In light of those comments from the honourable member for Bonython, I would like to address my remarks particularly to question time. The majority committee report has suggested some alterations to question time. It is true that question time has become, as the honourable member for Bonython has said, a gladiatorial contest. That has also been dominated by the media's appetite for the 6 o'clock television news and the 6 o'clock radio news. What is reported is at times of concern to most backbenchers. I suspect that the attempt to suspend standing orders in the last hour or so was yet another example of an opportunity to use parliamentary processes to put issues before the media. The honourable member for Bonython in his speech quoted the Prime Minister, who said: I have always' thought that we have effectively cleared national pressures in the clearing house of national pressures: the House of Representatives. In other countries national issues are settled by shots ringing out across the footpaths and through the houses, towns and cities where there is a lot of grief, conflict and human misery. This does not happen here. Big issues are brought to bear here. We have feelings about them and we express those feelings. It does generate some heat, but we do resolve them-if not immediately in a very short space of time. So, while I have some concerns about the hostility and aggression that occurs in the chamber, usually only during question time, which is a piece of theatre, I believe it is also important that we have never was when I first came here. Mr Johns-Oh, Andrew, you are one of the best actors.",81

144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order!,82
145,Ms HENZELL,COMMITTEES,"The honourable member for Kooyong, with a theatrical flourish that I would never hope to",82
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Will the honourable member for Capricornia please not respond to interjections.,82
147,Ms HENZELL,COMMITTEES,"The idea and the notion of question time being a piece of political theatre is not something that the Labor Party or the government suggested; it is widely understood. However, it is not possibly widely understood by the electorate at large, and that is my concern. The sort of aggression and abuse hurled from both sides of the chamber and which is focused on by the media of television, the newspapers and radio, reflects little credit on this place. I am not suggesting that we all become genteel; that is not the issue. But we have to be aware that, when we are dealing with the pressures and robustness of debate, unfortunately the end result is that people in the electorate receive via the media only a small portion of that, which distorts their view of political representation. It is a matter of some concern to me when I go to schools. I am often talking about appropriate behaviour and I have to apologise for the sort of behaviour that school children perceive is acceptable in the parliament from people apparently over the age of 18 who are supposed to be adults and, hopefully, have some degree of sophistication! It is a matter with which we should all be concerned. It is not that we should not have biting and incisive debate, but we should try to move away from the hurling of invective that is personally derogatory to other members. I do not believe that gives any credit to any member of the House. The other issue that is important and particularly evident during the theatre of question time is the importance for those on both sides-from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) down to the parliamentary secretaries and the back benchers-to respect the status of the Speaker. I believe the status of the Speaker is very important as it represents the democratic process of this institution. I just want to make that point in passing. The idea of having some further opportunity for ministers to be questioned is an interesting and useful one. I am not sure that I agree with the idea of supplementary questions because, as we have seen in recent question times, the opposition tends to pursue a policy of-again I quote the report-hunt the minister. There is obviously plenty of opportunity, if the opposition wants to play hunt the minister, for questions to be chosen in that way. It is true that the idea of having a set number of questions for question time could well assist ministers to discipline the time of their answers. While I believe that ministers should have the opportunity to comment on current policy issues and it is very important to get that news out to the electorate, it is important for the government to be disciplined so that a wide range of policy issues can be addressed and canvassed from both sides of the House, from back benchers from the government and from the opposition. This is an idea that I think is certainly worthy of consideration. It is important that, in spite of party discipline on both sides, there are opportunities for back benchers to ask questions that be important in terms of policy and in terms of their own electorates. Providing for more questions at question time may well be the way to address these issues. The report is fairly realistic about this. Within the parliamentary system and, the party system, both sides of the House-(Time expired)",82
148,Mr CHARLES,COMMITTEES,"I would like to remind the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) that the debate this afternoon on the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure entitled About time: bills, questions and working hours really ought not to be about politics. She seemed to spend some time talking about the government's and the opposition's response to this report. I want to assure the honourable member that whatever I say is my contribution as a member representing the electorate of La Trobe, not as a member of the Liberal Party or as a member of the opposition. This issue is far too important for us to introduce partisan politics into this issue or into the debate. I must admit that for some time. I have held concerns about the operations of the House of Representatives-the people's house, the house that represents the people of Australia. Those concerns relate, I think, to a change in the nature of our system, a change over time in how our system of government operates. Importantly, in our arrangements the executive is drawn from within our two houses of parliament-the people's house, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. But the executive being part of the parliament also participates in the operation of the parliament. So the two are not divorced. Increasingly, because the party system does dominate political activity in this country, and rightly so, over time that dominance has meant that the House of Represenalso tatives as a true representative chamber, even as a debllting chamber, has been reduced in effectiveness. That is a matter for concern. I have said in other speeches in this place that it seems to me to some extent that we have become superfluous. That is a shame, because we have a valuable contribution to make. I thank the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) for his report and for the valuable work of his committee. I am delighted that he is in the chamber to hear my contribution in response to that report. The issue, it seems to me, is that we, the members of parliament, need to deal with this issue. No-one else can deal with it. We cannot expect the public, the bureaucracy, the Senate, the states, the Chief Justice, the Governor General or the Queen to deal with this issue. It is only us, members of the House of Representatives, who can deal with it, and we should. We should deal with it on a non-partisan basis because the institution is far important to be trifled with. What has happened is that the executive has taken unto itself increasing power. The executive then determines the procedures and operations of the House, the timing of the bills, h9W long we speak on bills through use of the guillotine, and whether or not we have effective debate. So, in effect, we come into this place and we debate back and forth about bills, but seldom do we really get into the real detail of bills, and then only rarely when we adjourn to form a committee to debate individual amendments to bills rather than individual clauses. It has seemed to me, as I observe the operations of the House, that ministers rarely take .account of statements made by members which might actually improve legislation. We ought to be able to find some mechanism for separating to the greatest extent possible the philosophy behind a particular piece of legislation-and those philosophical thoughts have to do with partisan politics or perhaps even individuals-and the detail or the mechanics of a piece of legislation. Unfortunately, I do not believe that the second chamber proposed in this report will yield that result. I have thought for some time that, in order to partially defuse the power of the executive and to give individual members the opportunity to really contribute to debate about tion, about bills that we are going to make law and that will affect the lives of millions of Australians, we ought to have some mechanism to bring us together to allow us to do that. All of us know that we operate on a bipartisan basis very effectively and very frequently on standing committees. I have participated in three such committees-one of them of major effect being the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. We have brought down a number of reports which have had major national impact. One specifically of interest, as I recall, was a report into Austudy. Notwithstanding that the committee is dominated by government members, the report was critical of the government and highly critical of the bureautoo cracy. We made a great series of recommendations and almost all of those recommendations now-some three years after we tabled our report-have finally been accepted by the minister, put into legislation that has then been debated in this place and are now law. They will make Austudy a better system. It was not just the government's caucus and it certainly was not the opposition's party room that did that; it was bipartisan committee work-looking at the details of legislation as they existed, working together to find solutions, talking to people all over Australia to find concerns and making an effective report that dealt with the issues point by point, and those points were picked up and accepted by the government. We need to find some mechanism for supporting the standing committees of this House, giving them more power, giving them an opportunity to allow us to address legislation in a more positive, detailed way. We have really given away our debating powers to the Senate, and that is a fact. The nation's attention focuses on the Senate once a controversial bill is introduced. That is because all that happens in the House is that we stand and debate the philosophy behind the bill. It is senseless to debate the detail because the government, as distinct from the parliament, is not interested. The executive arm of government, as distinct from the two legislative legisla- houses, is not interested. To demonstrate that point, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will refer to a bill that was in this House last year in the last parliament-the Swimming Pool Tax Refund Bill. That bill should'not have had any politics in it whatsoever. The reason it should not . was that the High Court found that the bill that had been passed was, in fact, unconstitutional. That was the end of the politics. We were dealing with the mechanics to refund the money to pool owners and pool contractors who had paid a tax which was subsequently found to be unconstitutional. In this place I made every effort in a detailed manner to explain to the Treasurer at the time the mechanics that ought to be followed because of my understanding of how the industry operates. He refused to listen either in this place or outside this place. In fact, during the committee stage of the debate a government member tried to convince the Treasurer to listen to me, but he would not. If we had taken that bill between the first and second reading debate to a standing committee of this House which dealt with taxation matters, that committee undoubtedly would have found good mechanical mechanisms to make that bill work properly, would have amended it and brought it back into the House with amendments for the second reading debate. Then we could get on to the politics, except there were not any in that bill. It was a mechanical bill to refund money to people. So that bill went to the Senate. What happened there? The Senate took it to a committee. That committee had a big hearing, and largely its amendments were accepted. An amendment was not accepted in one instance, and I believe that is still hurting us in real life today. There are still some problems in trying to get some refunds through because of that one point which was not listened to. But the point I make is that we need to empower the committees. Firstly, if we establish standing committees by statute rather than by the will of each parliament, and if we make them roughly correspond to the portfolio interests of the executive, I maintain that we could take the legislation from the first reading speech to the committee where it would be considered in detail. The legislation could then be brought back-as it is or modified by amendments-for the second reading debate in this place. That would give members in this place a useful, constructive job to do, and we would not repeat our current history of time after time having to bring legislation into the House to fix up legislative mistakes. Sure, we would still have some. Yes, there would be errors. Yes, there would be unintended consequences with any legislation. But we do not have to have the number that we deal with now. It is not necessary. Those committees, as statute committees of the House, could give their members very useful work. At the same time, I suggest that we allow those committees to establish their own references if they wish to undertake inquiries. There is no reason for their having to be under the thumb of the responsible minister and only taking a reference that the minister says they can have. They should also be able to televise their hearings at their will. If we did that, debate in this place would become more relevant, this House of Representatives would once again become more relevant and we would take some of the attention away from the Senate. The government would still control the numbers. Without any question, we would get the bills through. But the bills would be better. They would be more bipartisan, and the people's representatives would have had an opportunity to participate in the making of legislation, which is what democracy is all about. It seems to me that the biggest and greatest reform that we could make when it comes to question time is to take the office of Speaker and treat it as it is treated in Great Britain. At the beginning of a parliament, we should allow a free vote for a Speaker-that is, a vote not along party lines but a free vote by every member of this place to pick the individual they think is most qualified to be Speaker. Once elected, that Speaker would resign from his or her political party and would not be challenged at subsequent elections until the Speaker determined to retire. Having a totally independent Speaker who was not under the thumb of the executive or the Prime Minister would take the problem out of question time. I will refer briefly to the sitting hours of the report. I am not particularly concerned about the exact time that we sit-when we sit, how we sit-except that it is important that, near the end of the week at least, perhaps on Wednesday and Thursday, we leave earlier than is our current practice. I do not know that it is absolutely necessary for us to leave the House at eight o'clock every night because I am not sure exactly what we will do. In fact, we might wind up staying up as long anyway. But, as we get more tired near the end of the week, our bodies and our minds could use that break on Wednesday night and Thursday night to get a good night's sleep before the rigours of the weekend in the electorate. I fully support the recommendation in this report on disorder in the House. It is largely, as I recall, exactly in line with the procedure committee recommendation from the last parliament, of which I was a member. In relation to the issue raised by the honourable member for Capricornia about the media, it seems to me that one of the things we have done which deflates the value of the House of Representatives is that we took radio broadcasting off prime time ABC radio. It is now on such a ridiculous frequency that nobody can get it. So people no longer pay attention to the debates that go on from day to day, back and forth in this place. I think that that needs to be addressed. (Time expired)",83
149,Mr JOHNS,COMMITTEES,"I would like to make some remarks about the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure entitled About time: bills, questions and working hours. I congratulate the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) and his committee. This is the honourable member's first major piece of work post-cabinet.  too. He has sat in here all the time listening to the debate.",86
150,Mr JOHNS,COMMITTEES,"That is good. I am glad I have been able to sit in on the debate, too. I guess that illustrates part of the question here. part We often rush into debate at the last minute because we are tied up with other things. We care to make remarks about only the things we are interested in, and we do not always get to listen to the remarks of others. I will start by dealing with some of the remarks of the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who is leaving the chamber at the moment. I agree with the honourable member regarding the House's finish time. My view is that, if I am here, one hour and 40 minutes flying time from Brisbane, I may as well work and I may as well work late if that can save me another night away from home. So my argument is that I do not see the need for us to knock off at eight o'clock each night if that is going to extend the days and therefore nights which we spend away from home. That is the most precious thing for me to consider when we come to the issue of time. Maybe there is a compromise. The honourable member for La Trobe mentioned that perhaps we could sit late as usual earlier in the week and then knock off early later in the week. I would be happy to knock off early enough on a Thursday night so that I could fly home to Brisbane. That would suit me. If I worked through to 11 p.m. or midnight on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and could get out of the door here at six or seven o'clock on the Thursday, straight onto a jet and home to see my dear family, I would be a very happy man-believe me. I would not disturb the hours of sitting unless I could see some benefit to me, as a member-not just in being rested but in getting home. Not all honourable members could take advantage of that. I know those from the west are pretty well locked in here. It may be possible but perhaps less advantageous for them to jump on a jet and get home at seven or eight o'clock on a Thursday evening. Nevertheless, they would get home. They could start the new Friday at home in their own town, ready to go up to the electorate office. So if there were to be some variation in sitting hours, I would not care to support the eight p.m. rule running across all days of the week. Perhaps as a compromise between that proposal and the current rule of where we knock off at about 11 o'clock, I would seek to get out early on the Thursday and get home to spend just one more night at home with the family. Having dealt with the issue of sitting times, I will work through some of the propositions here. I made a minor submission to the committee in which I indicated that I was not fussed about the concept of 90-second statements. It uses up only 15 minutes of the House's time per week, so it is not a big deal. Nevertheless, I think that, if members really have something to say, 90 seconds is a bit too brief. Those statements tend to be an exercise in launching invective at the other side. I think there are other opportunities to do that but in a more considered way. I think it takes a couple of minutes to develop a decent argument in any debate here, so honourable members can use the five minutes allotted to them in the adjournment debate, 20 minutes during debate or a lesser amount of time when they take only 10 or 15 minutes in debate. So I do not think 90second statements are particularly useful in relation to the use of members' times. I know it has been tried for a while-not that many members use it. I think a sort of rotating half dozen to a dozen members like it. That is beaut, but 1 do not think it lifts the standard of debate here. '\ I jump now to some bigger questions-first, the question of the dual legislative streams. I do like this idea; we are not unfamiliar with the concept as I believe it has been in the Commons for some years, as well as some other parliaments. Matters of detail can be taken into another chamber whilst this chamber is still working. There is no difficulty there; the committee has obviously thought about this in great detail. Honourable members should not be confused about what debates are taking place in this chamber or in the committee chamber. There will be provision that there should be no divisions in the committee chamber so that honourable members will not be called to different places at short notice. It should allow a continuation of debate here and in the other place, thereby saving some valuable time. It might just allow honourable members to concentrate their minds a little more on the debates at hand in which they are involved. I do not know whether the proposition came about because the clerks might have thought they would get some extra people employed. I suppose clerks would be needed in both these chambers if we were to take up this idea. It might put the Serjeant-at-Arms out of business if he or she does not have to put the mace up and down. Proposals such as this can be tested. They do not have to be put in for ever and a day; perhaps we could try this proposal over a couple of sessions of the parliament. The implication of it is that we can get on with the business of the House, while those who are involved in the committee stages can attend to that in the main committee room and work through the detail of legislation. Those who wish to make a speech only on the second reading or wish to listen to ministers make their second reading speeches can be involved here. I think it is a good idea. It warrants our support and should at least be trialled. The matter of question time is one that exercises our minds. The committee has been brave and sensible in raising in its report the focus given to question time since it has been televised. In my relatively short period here, six or seven years, certainly the focus of question time has changed. Prior to televising we would have .noticed that questions would tend to work their way across most of .the ministers in the course of a week. Now it is rare that anyone other than the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and perhaps one or two others take questions. That is a pity. It does not provide much practice for ministers other than the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and it does not provide anyone watching the debate with a feeling that we are covering the wide range of issues that we do actually cover in this place. So, I applaud the notion that ministers might attend question time on a rotation basis. That will detract from the theatre and from the combative nature of question time something you people have fabricated. It is something that never existed before.",86
151,Mr JOHNS,COMMITTEES,For as long as I have observed the honourable member in this chamber he has been an actor of Shakespearian renown.  that the people,88
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! Will the honourable member for Kooyong just listen to the speaker. If he wishes to engage in the debate, he can put his name on the speakers list.",88
153,Mr JOHNS,COMMITTEES,"The honourable member always raises his eyes to the journalists to whether they are listening. His is a false defence. However, to return to the substance of the matter, the combative nature of question time does not worry me. I happen to like it. It is a place where fair dinkum debate ought to be held, and held in a fairly unrestrained manner. That is the way it is, and I do not mind it. However, if it takes up too much time of the House and we can have an alternative whereby when it is necessary to have that combative and strong debate on point scoring and demonstrating that either leader is doing well or not doing well, or whatever, let us have it-but not every day. There are some days on which we could have a more detailed questioning of other, perhaps more junior, ministers. I am not sure that there is a compromise of that nature contained in the report; I have not had time to read it in detail. I would like to keep both elements there. I like the theatre, however it is tagged by others in this chamber. I like the combative nature of question time because I think we need some strong intercourse in this chamber on important matters. If such debate is the only thing that happens in question time to the exclusion of questions right across the front bench, then that is the pity-not the combative nature of the debate. So, I applaud the proposal for different streams of ministers being brought into the chamber for question time. The other matter I wish to refer to is one raised many times by the opposition-the length of answers by ministers. I, too, have observed over the past few years that the length of answers is too great. It is certainly true that for a time we were getting through fewer answers and therefore fewer questions were able to be asked. The debate has been about the relevance of answers and the length of answers. The committee has suggested, and I think it is right, that it is hard for anyone to write a rule to make answers more relevant, because relevance is always a matter of opinion. The way to tackle it, as the committee suggests, is to put some definite constraint on the length of answers. We will then get through more questions, and it will be possible to drive ministers to answer the matters at hand. The definition of relevance cannot be see imprqved or worked on, but I do like the idea of having a constraint on ministers so they cannot go on and on, so they cannot use question time as a replacement for ministerial statements. That has been a constant criticism by the opposition, and we would make that criticism if we were in opposition. I applaud the intelligent debate written up in the report and the solutions sought on the number of questions and the relevance of answers in question time. I think those are the major matters that I would like to raise in this debate on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure. I am glad we have found time to debate the report. I have enjoyed listening to the comments of others, and I am glad that the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) is here taking notes and taking in these matters. I again congratulate him for his significant contribution.",88
154,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"I paraphrase the saying that the fault lies not in the stars, but in ourselves. If anything is ridiculous, it is that the only opportunity we have to talk about the procedures of parliament is that we are now debating this matter on a Friday afternoon because the government cannot get its act in order. It is absolutely ridiculous. The Senate is debating a bill which the government says it wants to get passed before we rise for Christmas. Everyone else in the community works to the end of next week, but we are marking time. This is a significant paper and I would like to discuss it properly. It is ridiculous to deal with it at 5 0' clock on a Friday afternoon on the eve of the parliament rising for Christmas. The only reason for this nonsense is that the government is incompetent in managing its own affairs. Part of the problem lies in the running of the parliament. When we talk about this business of theatrics and question time, we need to look at each parliament and work out how we can make the parliament work as a legislature. Every government in a Westminster system sees the parliament as the child of its majority. While that is so we are not going to get a government being prepared to do anything other than use the parliament for its own ends. Sadly, in my view this Labor government has done that to a far greater degree than an.y that has preceded it.",88
155,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,Rubbish! What about you?,89
156,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"If the parliamentary secretary had been here in the days when the parliament functioned properly-even under Gough Whitlam the parliament functioned as a parliament-he would know what I was talking about. It does not function as a parliaLet ment now. One of the problems we have now-I cannot see it mentioned in the report from the Standing Committee on Procedureinvolves ministerial statements. We have to do something about making question time work. We have to require that all significant statements of government policy be presented by way of ministerial statement in this place. The situation now is arrant nonsense. Our ministers go to the National Press Club or somewhere around this place and have a press conference, then come in here and tell us that a policy has been announced and therefore they can answer questions on it. We have to start off with a bit of selfdiscipline from members of the government. That does not involve standing .orders; it is about the government behaving as a government should. The fact is that the Labor Party having no clues any more than it has any sense of propriety is part of the problem. We have now a minister who should have been sacked, or at best resigned, who is still a member of the government. Again that is illustrative of the failure of the government to address responsibilities as it should. It is no use talking about standing orders when the government cannot behave itself. We have to understand that under Labor the proper role of the legislature is being debased, and it is being debased because the government does not really want the legislature to function as it should. It is all very well for us to look at revising the standing orders. No matter what new standing orders we adopt, they will not work if the government does not want them to. As far as I can see, that is the intention of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). . Let us look at a few of the things that we can do. I admit that there are a thousand variations to standing orders that many .of us have discussed over the years. This is yet another package. I can see no more inherent virtue in these changes than I have seen in others. I oppose some of these changes vehemently. I suggest that, if some of them were adopted, they would further restrict the powers and functions of this legislature. There are a few little things that we can do. us start with the structure of the place. One thing that I think would be sensible would be to narrow the bar table, to bring the two sides of the House closer. Let us make it more of an adversarial debating chamber. At the moment it is more like an auditorium. Generally, there is only a man and his dog in the chamber-the dog would not be in here. There are not many members in the chamber at the moment. We should make it a forum. If I want to eyeball the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) I can do so because we are more or less in line. It would be easier in a chamber like the original Westminster chambers, which are smaller chambers. Far more members fit in that smaller chamber. The members are actually debating. My first suggestion for getting. proper debate is to have ministerial statements made in this place. Apy major matter of government policy, wherever possible, whenever the parliament is sitting, should be initiated in the parliament. If matters of government policy are not introduced by way of a ministerial statement, they could perhaps be introduced by debate on a green paper or a white paper. Certainly debates should be initiated by ministerial statement. If they were, then the processes of this place would begin to function properly. That would be one way of making this a debating chamber. Sure we have television. I think it is being used as an excuse rather than a reason. To my mind, a lot of the problem lies in the way in which we function. The bar table should be narrowed so that the two front benches are brought closer together. We should try to make it so that honourable members are actually having a debate. They should be talking to each other rather than to the television cameras, the radio microphones or the great world outside. I want now to go through some of the recommendations in the report. I do not think they illustrate some of the problems. Everybody should understand that the discretions available to the speaker are really quite extensive. It depends on the personality of the speaker as to how he interprets the standing orders. The speaker is in a position of absolute authority in this place. I have heard successive speakers question on a number of occasions their capacity to contain the sorts of things said in question time and to contain certain behaviour. I do not agree with them. It is up to the speakers to assert their authority. Honourable members should be able to rely on the absolute, non-written rights and privileges of the person who presides over the chamber. If honourable members could be assured of that, they would not question the authority of the speaker. Sure a speaker will have problems. A Prime Minister and a governm-nt might not like certain rulings. Let us be realistic. We talking about a speaker who is elected by this place. We are not talking about a speaker who is continuing to be responsible to the party mechanism. Sure a party is responsible for that speaker's original endorsement. At this stage we have not adopted the House of Commons practice of providing a non-political person as speaker. That person would have no party alignment and would be guaranteed by the major parties of re-election as speaker. We need to see what mechanisms we can put in place to give a speaker more authority. I suggest that the bare minimum is that, unless a speaker's vote is essential to the survival of a government, a speaker should not cast a vote. Another suggestion is that the speaker should absent himself or herself from party meetings and party forums. The speaker should not be a partisan person. The speaker should be involved dispassionately and should arbitrarily determine how this place can function best as a legislature. The legislature is not always in argument with the government, but quite often it is. If honourable members think that is not so, they should look at the position in the US Congress. There is an absolute division there. Traditionally in this parliament and in the Westminster system ministers are part of the legislature. That does not mean that the legislature has no role to play. I would far prefer to enhance the status of the speaker so that the speaker can exercise authority over the government as he or she can over every member of this place. That means that the speaker has to be given some capacity to be able to perform in a reasonably responsible way without fear of sanction. I would not have objected if there had been a recommendation in this report of the procedures committee that a speaker, having been appointed, should be given a guarantee of endorsement by the party which elected him so that a speaker is absolutely independent throughout the course of a parliament. If we gave that independence to the speaker we would give the speaker the unwritten authority that is needed to enable the speaker to are function dispassionately. Whatever a Prime Minister or a Leader of the House said to the speaker, the speaker could say, 'I listen to you, as I do to every other member'. At the moment there is that fear of making a partisan decision. Whether or not it is partisan might be in the eye of the beholder. There has certainly been on occasions an apprehension that that was so. All one needs to do is to look at the number of members who have been suspended from the services of this House over the years. Very few of them have been from the government side, no matter which party was in power. Mr Braithwaite-When we were there it was different.",89
157,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"Yes, of course it was different. Normally the members suspended are from the opposition. Why? Because the standing orders are not being applied equally. A government can say that all the disruption in the parliament occurs on this side. Mr Leo MCLeay-And the government would be right.",91
158,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"You haven't even brought your bicycle in here, but don't worry, Leo. We need to set up an ambit within which this place can function properly. Honourable members need to be brought closer together. Ministerial statements need to be made in here. We need an independent speaker. I have given the House a few vehicles by which these changes can be made. Let me, in the five minutes left to me, briefly talk about the recommendations of the committee. I am opposed to the idea of a second chamber. I do not think that will facilitate in this place what is essentially the political scrutiny of legislation. I was the one who suspended the old legislation committee system. Why? Because I found that it was inevitable that in this place we deal with politics. That means. that we do not have a worthwhile committee debate. In the legislation committees the ministers were subjected to criticism. The ministers had their staff with them. Mr Leo MCLeay-Terrible!",91
159,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"I would be delighted if the honourable member for Watson were to introduce that system again, but he will not. I will not tell the House why. The report of this committee recommends a second chamber. It will not work. I do not like this idea the first reading presentation. What we have to understand is that, under present High Court decisions, the second reading debate is part of the process of the legislative consequence of any bill that is passed. To my mind, the second reading speech is absolutely essential before this chamber can debate a bilI. It is essential that a second reading speech be made so that honourable members know what is in the bill and know the whole object of the government. An explanatory memorandum does not give reasons for legislation. A second reading speech has a peculiar character, which unfortunately does not come out in this report. That speech gives the purpose of the bill and the background of the bill. It is actually read by the High Court in determining the application of particular sections of legislation where there is any doubt. Therefore, it does not appeal to me to have the first reading and second reading procedures that have been identified in this report. Paragraph 70 talks about cognate bills. I believe that it is totally unsatisfactory for a minister not to have to seek leave of the House for there to be a cognate debate. The position at the moment works quite well. A minister must seek leave. He needs to get the consent of the House. If any honourable member disagrees, the bills cannot be debated cognately. Quite often there are valid reasons for individual members to wish that bills be debated independently. In my view, that practice should continue. The recommendations on question time are absolute nonsense. I do not agree with the rostering of ministers. I do believe in the supplementary question principle, but again I believe that is quite possible now within what I see as the discretions available to the Speaker. The rostering of ministers for question time will not enable our type of democracy to work. We have all this business. We pretend that we are independent and different, and we can be independent and different by sustaining the present practice. We have a unique form of questions without notice. It is not working at the moment, for reasons I have of already given about ministerial statements, but it would work if the Speaker chose to exercise greater authority, if we gave the sanction to the Speaker to ensure that he had that authority, and we enabled all ministers to be here. I have heard several honourable members comment about the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) receiving the most questions. Of course they do-because they ation. accept responsibility for everything. Not having more time on questions does not mean that we would not be able to ask questions of others. In that respect, I think the recommen- to dation of about at least 16 questions is a good idea. There is then the question about dealing with disorder. I do not like yellow card or a",91
160,Mr GEAR,COMMITTEES,Or a sin bin.,92
161,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"A sin bin. There is reason to accept, however, recommendation (f), that the scale of penalties be varied, so that times are 24 hours, three and seven days is a lie. respectively. The sin bin idea seems to be just gimmickry. Again, I think it is more a matter of adequacy of Speakers than otherwise. As for answers to questions on notice, I think that is a good idea. I want briefly to say something about the sitting hours. I am one of those who still believe that three days on, one week off has a big advantage. I know that few in this place agree with me. Too much happens in Australthat is and the world today when this parliament is not meeting. I believe that sitting Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday three days a week and sitting in the evenings ensures that memout bers, 99 per cent of whom travel to this place from afar, get the maximum use of both their weekend and time through the week. People income and go every week, whether we are sitting two weeks on and two weeks off, even though they have two days at home. I think the original principle behind the two-week sitting period that we would have people from afar staying here over the weekends worked. I would go back to three weeks on and one week off and I would sit more bringing through the year. Finally, I do not agree with the routine business. I think that the Labor idea of having question time at 2 o'clock every afternoon has worked well, and I would maintain it. I commend the committee for the consideration it has given to these proposals but, as might suggest, I,do not necessarily agree with the conclusions it has reached. NA",92

167,Mr HORNE,COMMITTEES,"I do not intend to speak for long on this report of the Standing Committee on Procedure. Having just listened to the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), I must admit there is certainly no doubt why honourable members opposite are regarded as the conservatives. As soon as we want to bring some change into the parliamentary process, come all the old furphies: 'Let us go back to the old days. Let us get the macho image back into parliament. Let us narrow the table the centre so it is eyeball to eyeball. Let us get the adrenaline pumping'. That is what parliament is all about according to the right honourable member for New England. That is not what parliament is all about. That is precisely what the people of Australia are has not rebelling against. I believe that this report today is about sense and stability to the process of parliament. It is about allowing debate to take of place that is logical and can be followed not only by people who are interested in particular points or particular bills but also by the people out there who are watching the process on television and reading about it in the one papers. Today, more than at any time in history, the people of Australia have a better level of education-thanks mainly to this government-and they want to know the reasons behind the decisions that have been made. They do not want government by personality. That, of course, is what the right honourable member for New England was referring to. That is what happened before. I have no doubt that the right honourable member for New England agreed with that. He was one of those very strong personalities who participated in the process of government. Of course, he won a lot of respect for that. But my personal opinion is that we have moved on from that. There is no place today for the determination of matters of such importance simply because someone has a stronger personality than someone else. As a new member of this parliament-a permanent one, I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I hope that any new member who wishes to stand up here and comment on the way that business is conducted will be heard. There is no doubt that new members come in here without the accepted values. I appreciate that only yesterday we extended congratulations to the right honourable member for New England. After all, he is the longest serving member and understands the tradition. But members like me who came in here only at the last election are about being objective. We look at the system and see a number of flaws in it. We see a number of ways in which the legislative process can be improved. That is what I believe is the strength of document. It makes a number of suggestions that, undoubtedly, will be accepted by this parliament. I support many of them; there are some there that I do not support. As the holder of a marginal seat, obviously I would prefer to be spending as much time as possible back in the electorate. When I count up the number of marginal seats on the description of electorates that we all received today, it appears that the majority of us certainly do hold marginal seats. What is the alternative? We have all seen the alternative. It is essentially a process of legislation by exhaustion-keep it going, sit late at night. I do not believe that honourable members perform at their best under those conditions. What is being promoted here is a set of reasonable hours that will allow members, of an evening, to have a look at what will be on the business paper for the following day or days ahead and carry out the research that is necessary to allow them to participate in meaningful debate. If parliament is not about meaningful debate and about members having a fair dinkum and worthwhile contribution, it is not about anything. I believe that we must establish the best possible system to allow as many members as possible to participate in debate. I believe that the extension of hours is a very worthwhile suggestion. There is no doubt that honourable members opposite would welcome the quota of questions at question time being increased to eight per 30-minute period. After all, in the first few months I was in this place the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was fairly persistent in racing to the dispatch box to take points of order and complain about the lack of questions. There is no doubt that eight per half hour is a very reasonable number. It might mean, of course, that the honourable member for O'Connor will be able to sit down for most of the time or ask his question and listen to the answer without having to run to take points of order and, of course, interject. With regard to interjections, the sin bin idea has been promoted. There is no doubt in my mind that the sin bin is a very logical extenthis sion of the powers of the Speaker. Without the need for a division and the waste of the five minutes that it takes to get people here, it immediately allows the disruptive influence to be removed from the chamber. It allows for the smooth flow of the discussion, the debate, the answering of the question, or whatever the business is at that time. It is a very logical suggestion. The honourable member for New England pointed out that the Speaker should be independent. If there is one way to encourage him to be independent, it is by giving him that power and waiting to see what happens, because the House would not allow that power to be abused. Essentially, those are all the matters that I wish to raise. I am very supportive of the committee process of parliament. Having been involved in local government, I believe that committee work is very important. It allows for the deformalising of debate. Debate is about increasing participation, allowing for an exchange of ideas and for information to be brought forward. The best way to do that is by breaking down the formal nature of parliament. Actually, there is one other point that I wish to raise. At the outset of his speech, the honourable member for New England asked why this matter had been brought on at 5 o'clock on a Friday afternoon. He said that it was irrelevant. If it is so irrelevant, why is the honourable member for New England here? Mr Crean-You are being broadcast all over Australia.",92
168,Mr HORNE,COMMITTEES,"He is here because he wanted to participate in the debate. Other speakers will present themselves because they want to participate in the debate. Let us look at the legislation. Let us look at the debate that has gone on this week. Let us look at what has been proposed by the opposition and what it has considered to be of such major importance that it has taken up the time of this House. We have heard from the honourable member for New England about the involvement of the press-about ministers making press statements rather than being in the chamber. But what did we see today? We saw the moving of a censure motion against the Prime Minister concerning the alleged activities of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). What was trotted out in that debate? A list of press clippings. There was nothing original, no statement of fact. I believe that in this document there are a number of recommendations that will bring debate back to what people have to say and get it away from the papers. I am sure that everyone here, on a public platform, will say that they believe in government by parliament and not government by the press. But when those opposite are given the opportunity, where do they go? They go straight back to the press and talk to their joumo mates. When they have to present a debate, out come the press clippings.",94
169,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"by leave- Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a pity that the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Home) raised those final points, which were more about current events than about a matter of grave importance to all of us. I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to continue, and possibly reassert, the remarks I made previously in this debate. On that occasion, we had rather limited time to address these matters. Many of my thoughts are already on the record. Added to them is a letter I have since written to all honourable members suggesting that there is probably need for a committee style debate of this matter on a day which is not a parliamentary sitting day-possibly next year on a sitting week Friday-when honourable members could get into a single room, put aside political differences and argue in detail the recommendations within this report. I support a number of the recommendations, some I am ambivalent about, and some I would oppose. Having had some challenges put to us, I now think that it is more a case of getting down to the fine detail of how this might work, thereby avoiding the situation that is more likely to arise. That is when the executive government goes through the list and says, 'They are the ones we want, and they are the ones you are going to get'. That would be a pity. I make that point because it is a matter of history that over time all members of parliament will experience being in government and in opposition. Mr Crean-Not all; a lot.",94
170,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"A large number. I have been on both sides and I could make some remarks about the different activities of both. I believe that the lousiest job in this place is to be a backbencher in government. That might be something that a lot of people would struggle to attain and then discover what it is really like. It is that something with which we all have to live in our various situations. We should tackle this matter from the point of view that it is for the good of all our operations if we attach some personal aspect to the debate. Most importantly, we need to have a situation where we make the best possible use of our time. Consequently-I will not labour this point because I made it in my previous speech-I support the concept of a second chamber, but not as recommended. I do not believe that we need to find some special excuse. I do not believe that we need to call it a committee. I do not believe that we need to change many of the fundamental structures, such as the laying down of a second reading speech. I will come back to that specific point later. All we need. are two sets of debates going on at the same time. The Notice Paper would tell us that the debate on-I used this example last time-the Pig Levy Bill, which is non-controversial but which attracts a large number of speakers, would be in committee room No. 1. The committee room would be restructured properly as a debating chamber, if that were where we chose to put it. Something like the Mabo legislation, however, would naturally be debated in this chamber. Where those debates were to be allocated would be agreed-as many other matters are agreed in this place-between the parties and on the advice from the opposition of the day as to its approach to the legislation. In other words, if the opposition said, 'Look, we are supporting this legislation, but we have a large list of speakers', it could go off to second chamber at whatever times were laid down. That means that there would be adequate time in place for the controversial matters. In all of that there is no need to change our fundamental procedures. That is where I differ with the committee. I see it as a second debating chamber. Mr Crean-You would need more Hansard reporters.",94
171,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"Yes, we would. As has been recommended, we would. also need a new approach to our chairpersons, acting speakers, clerks, et cetera. We would need more television cameras because it would be the second chamber. If there were not enough work to justify the use of the second chamber, we would not use it. It is as simple as that. believe that there are times when that secondary chamber would be functioning as a party room because it would generally not attract a very large audience. All of those factors can be taken into account. We have to be very careful when trying to make some sensible changes that we do not get to the situation where we have added in all sorts of bits and pieces and new ideas that are not necessary. We are basically looking for additional debating time and, in the process, avoiding it being made available at 2 o'clock in the morning. We do not want to greatly extend the amount of time we spend in Canberra because we have electorate commitments. That is another factor. Although, once I am here-as a Western Australian, I suppose that I perceive it a little differently-it does not worry me if I am brought in on Monday morning and sent home preferably early enough on Thursday afternoon to catch a flight at about 4 o'clock that takes me back to Western Australia.",95
172,Mr GEAR,COMMITTEES,How about Saturdays?,95
173,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"No thanks; it conflicts with my other major elected responsibility as a committee member of the Western Australian Turf Club. Tomorrow is one of our big days, but here I am; I have my priorities right. The simple fact is that all we need to do-that is where I feel this other meeting that we should have would work so well-is sit down and address some of the detail of these recommenthe dations. We need to ask committee members, 'How would you make that work? Why did you recommend that we have this sort of committee structure?'. Admittedly, the bills would be passed here. The other chamber would just be another debating chamber. In the end the final decision on the bill would be taken here. We would possibly nominate a point during the day when bills coming down from the other debating chamber would be put to this House in the formal way and a vote would be taken. However, the vote would presumably be on the voices. If, at any time, because of matters arising .in the other chamber, a change of attitude occurred on some legislation, thenfair enough-we can still adjourn the debate I in that chamber and bring it back to this one. That would not be something that would happen all that frequently. Again, I wish to make a comment about second reading speeches. This follows the criticisms of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) of the government's ability to manage its own affairs. I can see no reason, with the exception of matters of urgency, for the legislafive program of a session-if we are to have three sessions instead of two, I believe it gets even easier-to be brought in at the beginning or the end of a session for the next session. I think there should be a process when the second reading speeches are introduced. I agree with the right honourable member for New England; I would not like to ,see the second reading speech discontinued. I think that is unwise, but I do not see that these other measures require that to happen. I think that is going one bridge too far. If we put the matters for debate of a session on notice, we first require the bureaucracy to stop ambushing the government. I have to say that I believe that happens. I do not believe the government always knows exactly what it is bringing to this place when we guillotine 70 or 80 bills at the end of a session, so we should put down the matters for debate and put the public on notice. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Home); talked about the public's confidence. All of us end up having to go to the public or interest groups to get advice on a lot of legislation. My greatest objection to this place is not the time that people frequently give me to make a debating contribution-as much as I enjoy the sound of my own voice-it is receiving a bill on a Thursday and being told that it will be debated the following Tuesday, probably under the guillotine. It gives me no chance to properly and responsibly deal with that matter and gain advice. I know that occasionally people want to ambush the public and not let it have a really good understanding of certain bills. I think that is despicable. I do not care which side practises it-I assume that both sides havebut that is something we should not condone. So let us look at a program where, at the beginning of each session or, even better, at the end of each session, the government puts down its program, including second reading speeches and explanatory memorandums, and goes through it. I would like to touch on the matter of regulation. I certainly will be bringing forward a private member's bill in due course to try to get a better grip on regulation. I know why we shove legislation off to one side: we have not got the time to deal with it. Consequently, if we look at this report, we can see that it is thick for most of,the legislation we bring into the place, but it can result in a stack of regulations so high that frequently never get a word in this place. Delegated law is fine and convenient, and it can keep things rolling along when we get to the stage where minor changes have to be made. But when greenfield legislation is brought to this place, why do we not have the regulations with it? The legislation is useless without the regulations. So why not bring them both in together and let the parliament have a good look? It is my view that we should go a lot further on this matter. In any discussion we have along these lines, I recommend that we should look at the role of the two Houses in more detail. We say that we do not want any duplication between state governments and federal government and that we have a responsibility to ensure that, but we have this massive duplication between our two houses. Some of that duplication, as has been pointed out, is a result of the system and some of it could not be overcome. I put on the record-it will probably mean that I will never get elected leader of my party-that I would not have any ministers in the Senate. I look to the American system where people gain huge importance by being chairmen of committees in the Senate. They are people of great power and influence. Of course, it is a slightly different system, but I think we should have the executive-possibly a little smaller than we have it today-in one House and we should take a slightly different approach to business, particularly committees and committees of review, in the Senate. No doubt people would want to refine that approach. I make it as a pretty general statement. But we could do a lot of things like that where we would see only some of the duplication. I do not object at all to some of the recommendations made about committees, because I think there are times when complex legislation should go to a committee. But, on my point about the introduction of bills and second reading speeches at the end of a session, there would be-some might complain about this-a recess where people could get down to the business of doing some of that committee work. Again, I think that might have some sense. These are the sorts of things we can do to make the whole matter a lot more responsible, and I think that is most important. I think enough has been said about question time. I think the challenge to us is to be reminded, as we have been in a previous report, that the Canadian parliament deals with some 40 questions in 45 minutes. That might be well and truly above our ambition. I am reminded of a particular report printed in a publication of the University of New South Wales in April 1989 which gave us some pretty interesting statistics about the budget session. The publication stated: In the 1987 Budget sitting/1988 Autumn sitting periods, 206 replies exceeded 750 words, with about a quarter of these exceeding 1,000 words. the eight replies which exceeded 1,800 wordstaking about 20 minutes-five are from Mr Keating. That is a ridiculous situation and it is time that it was stopped. I have to say to you, Mr Speaker, that I did observe here for a long time the simple words, 'The minister will resume his seat'. Billy Snedden for one seemed to be able to do it to Malcolm Fraser and all sorts of other people-and, what is more, they responded. I do not want to argue that point much further. I think it is a matter of concern that we see those sorts of statistics published in university publications. It is a question that we have to confront. I have never agreed with the concept of restricting answers. I think an answer should be as long as is necessary. After all, it is to provide information. I hold totally with the view expressed by the right honourable member for New England about ministerial statements. I made the point in my previous speech on this matter that at least one MPI a week should be allocated to the government, hopefully for that very purpose. I do not believe the MPI should be the sole preserve of the opposition, because I think the government must have a few matters of public importance that it would like to raise. I would welcome them because we get ·half the time any way, and it gives us a chance to respond to these things. It might, in fact, have some effect on the eventual outcome of the legislation. That finishes my time and I am sorry, because there are a lot of other things that I would like to say. I hope I get an opportunity to. do that at that joint party meeting that I would like to see held outside our parliamentary sitting times. People might stay around, listen to the various arguments and make a contribution, jumping up and down, and not having to seek leave to do so.",95
174,Mr OCONNOR,COMMITTEES,"I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this debate this afternoon. I commend the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) for his constructive contribution to this debate. I suspect that some honourable members who might have been listening Of would have been tempted to move an extension of time if the honourable member for O'Connor had some matters that he did not cover in the debate. I must say that I am seeing him in a very different light. I extend my congratulations to the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Procedure. the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett). and the committee members who have prepared this rather excellent report. It is certainly not an easy task to balance the views of the government and the opposition; to fairly meet their respective needs and to take account of the dispositions and personalities of individual members. I am a member of the class of 93, so I am not really qualified to comment in detail on many of the substantive recommendations that have been made in the report. I represent the seat of Corio; The previous member who held that seat is the Hon. Gordon Scholes. He occupied the seat you sit in, Mr Speaker, and was an expert in the procedures of this parliament. I am sure he would agree with many of the recommendations made in this report and would keenly contest others. New members are never quite prepared for the demands put on them. I recall aconversation in the first few months of being elected to this parliament. He asked how I was going and I said, 'It really seemed like a good idea at the time'. We have to balance the demands of the electorate, the party and those imposed by the parliament. As members, we are called on to participate in debates, meet our responsibilities to parliamentary committees, make, a constructive input on caucus committees and attend public functions in the interests of the parliament and the nation. It is a fairly demanding lifestyle; it is a very demanding place. The onus is on all of us to try to ensure that the procedures of the parliament work as effectively as we can make them. I would like to comment on three elements covered in this report. The first is question time. Much has already been said in this debate about question time. It occupies one of the central places in parliamentary procedure. It is the theatre of parliament and is a time when the opposition is given a chance to ask questions directly of cabinet ministers. Question time performs a very important parliamentary function. The opposition is allowed to question ministers and ministers must be accountable to this parliament for what they say and for the policies they are putting into place in their executive positions. Question time also has a political function. It is a time when the media and the public are present. Some ministers are made or broken. That has occurred down through the years in this place. It is an opportunity for the opposiinteresting tion to probe the government in a very detailed way. The consequences of that probing can have significant political effects for the government of the day. Question time, as we know it today, has a very important public education role. It certainly provides the public with an opportunity to become more informed on policy matters and enables them to understand a little better the decisions the executive has made. If it is so important, why is it not working as effectively as we can make it? One of the reasons is that during the time allotted members become rather rowdy and their behaviour leaves a little to be desired. It is rather interesting that two of the opposition members who are in the chamber, one of whom spoke before me in this debate and one who might speak on this debate later""-the honourable member for O'Connor and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson)-sometimes in this place are a little unruly and rowdy. One of the other problems with question time is the length of answers provided by ministers to questions asked by the opposition. In the hothouse atmosphere, that glorious one hour of the procedures of parliament when the galleries are full and members are able to posture in a public sense, one other aspect of behaviour that is of concern is the frivolous points of order raised by opposition members. The honourable member for O'Connor, who preceded me in this debate, is quite notorious for that transgression in question time. Over the years a declining. amount of time has been allocated to this very important purpose. The consequence has been that public perceptions have not been enhanced. People are rather critical of question time and the procedures of parliament. The general public has an interesting attitude. I had a conversation with members of my constituency who attended question time. I met them back in the electorate and asked them how they enjoyed their time in Canberra and how they enjoyed the debates in parliament. They said, 'It was absolutely disgraceful to see members acting like children in question time'. But the feature is that they would really not want to miss it for quids. The very important debates that occur in parliament are rarely attended by members of parliament, but we can bet our little booties that at question every day the galleries will be stacked with people wanting to view that proceeding of the parliament. When people come to Canberra they want to see the War Memorial, the National Art Gallery and question time in the parliament. The public has to understand the nature of the process taking place, the hothouse atmosphere in question time and the fact that it is the real theatre of parliament. The report' makes some very sensible suggestions about question time that strike a reasonable balance between the rights of the opposition to ask questions of the executive, the right of the public to be informed of decisions on policy issues and the right of ministers to be heard in their answers without undue disruption. It is a very important part of the procedures of this place. The suggestions.that have been made are reasonable. I think we all agree that there should be more questions. There should be less disruption of question time and there ought to be supplementary questions. That practice is adopted by parliaments in other parts of the world and seems to work quite effectively. I would welcome that here. The committee reported on the problem of disorder. How do we define exactly what constitutes disorder? It is a very difficult for you, Mr Speaker, to give rulings at very important times such as question time. For example, if a member who without fanfare or emotion persistently uses frivolous points of order to disrupt proceedings, does that constitute disorder? What about a member who persistently calls across the chamber while other speakers are on their feet? What about an emotive outburst in the heat of an exchange on an important legislative matter? What about members who continually walk about the chamber and cannot really sit in their seats for any length of time? Do those things constitute disorder? What about the situation where members of the opposition or members of the government join in the cacophony of the sound that is often heard in question time? What constitutes disorder? Speakers down through the ages have had to come to terms with that difficult situation. The penalties that are provided in the report seem to me to be rather harsh. Perhaps we could rethink them. Before I conclude, I would like to make some comment about the hours of sitting. This issue is fairly dear to the hearts of members who have come into this chamber since March 1993. In response to some inquiries as to how I enjoyed the lifestyle here in Canberra, I made the comment at one stage that I work like a dog but I do not have to live like one. I really think we can do much better in structuring the hours of sitting to make this parliament more effective. I welcome the proposals set out in the committee's report concerning the modification of sitting times. We sit some crazy hours. I do not see how anybody could derive masochistic pleasure from making toast and tea in the lobby between one and two in the morning. The report has outlined several objectives to create a more healthy work pattern for members of parliament, to improve honourable members' effectiveness and to enhance community perceptions of the pro cedures of the parliament. I agree wholeheartedly with those objectives. I am very attracted to the model that has been proposed. If it is ever adopteq- I think it will create a more healthy work pattern for task honourable members. I am rather attracted to the proposition that the rearrangement of sitting times will mean less cost to the parliament overall. There could be some modification of the sitting times as they have been proposed. I certainly recommend that we extend sitting times on Monday from 12.30 to 11.00 p.m. and on Tuesday from 12.30 to 11.00 p.m. I think honourable members are fresher earlier in the week and have the capacity to work longer hours. But as the parliamentary sitting wears on and the demands on honourable members increase-in particular, their committee responsibilities bear down upon them. I think we ought to shorten the sitting time. I want to comment on the propositions advanced by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). He has been around this place for a long time and I think we all have a fairly healthy respect for his knowledge of the procedures and the history that he brings to this House. However, he commented that under Labor the proper role of the legislature is being debased. I suggest that he have a long hard talk with his coalition colleagues in the state parliament of Victoria who have mounted one of the greatest abuses of the Westminster system ever seen in that state. I object to his attempt to take the high moral ground on this issue. The right honourable member for New England and the former National Party leader Doug Anthony were quite ruthless in their use of the procedures when they were in government. I guess the right honourable member has mellowed with the years and he wants to make some fairly constructive comments in this debate. But I think he was wide of the mark when he accused the government of debasing the procedures of this place. I think this report is very worthwhile. I commend the honourable member for Bonython on the work that he has done and the consultations he has undertaken with members of this place. It is a very constructive report. I know that other suggestions have been made in other reports, but I think the mood among members is that we should take advantage of this opportunity to make the required amendments to the procedures of this place in order to make it a more effective forum for debate.",97
175,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"I want to join with the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) in complimenting the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett)-a South Australian colleague-on his report entitled About time: bills, questions and working hours. I also compliment the Standing Committee on Procedure on the work it has done in preparing and handing down this report. I do not agree with all of the committee's recommendations, but I think the report gives us an excellent opportunity to review what we do as a parliament and how we might function most effectively in the interests of all Australians. I think there is a touch of irony about the fact that we should be considering this report this evening. I was in this chamber this morning when members of a European delegation were commenting on their experiences in Europe. The honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) all spoke very tellingly of their experiences of standing on the battlefields of the First World War. I could identify with their experiences because I too had stood there as part of a parliamentary European delegation. I was very grateful that I. had grown up in a country which had known only democratic government in which the people had felt they were represented. I suspect that much of the motivation behind this report was the enthusiasm that we as parliamentarians have to try to reassure Australians that this parliament works in the interests of the nation and represents far and away the best forum they have for expressing their points of view. As one who has been in this parliament for 10 years, one of the things that I find most concerning in 1993 as compared with 1983 is the level of scorn and derision that seems to have become increasingly entrenched in our parliamentary attitude toward one another, particularly during question time. I agree with the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns): question time is the theatre of the parliament. Those of us who have been here for a while expect it to be a pressure cooker atmosphere. In fact, we generally consider that to be a good thing. We would sooner have people expressing their points of view and airing the controversies here in that sort of environment. But I regret that, increasingly, in the parliament and in the practice of parliamentary debate we seem to have lowered our standard to. a point where most of the attacks tend to be upon individuals and tend to be derisive. I think it is fair to say, without being partisan, that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been particularly skilled at this. His capacity to be derisive has tended to fuel an equally derisive response from opposition members. I regret that. I do not regret that question time exists or that it is a confrontationist. I agree with the honourable member for Petrie that that in fact is a very healthy way to be. But I do regret the level of individual attack that has now emerged in the parliament. I think we as parliamentarians need to do something about this. The report handed down by the honourable member for Bonython gives the Speaker the opportunity .to have more control over the way in which individual members treat other members. Like the member for Corio, I have had guests and school children in the gallery who have come back and said that they were appalled at what they .saw. I think that is largely a matter of misunderstanding. For too long, we have expected people to see the chamber as nothing more than some sort of educative process. The reality is that the chamber is a place where there will always be a clash of ideas and, so long as that clash is seen as a philosophical and not a personal attack, we have nothing to apologise for. As the honourable member for Corio has indicated, one of the great tragedies is that people of Australia who are so critical of this chamber are nowhere to be seen when the chamber is engaged in constructive debate. Look at the chamber tonight-not only are the public galleries empty, which may be excusable, but the press gallery is all but empty as well. . Mr MCGauran-AAP is always there.",100
176,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"I thank the honourable member; of course AAP is there. But I point out that the press gallery-which is always so full at question time when we would say that, in many ways, the parliament is at its worstis not adequately staffed at the times when parliamentary debates are at their most constructive. I think the people see too little of the cooperation that occurs in this chamber; too little of the good natured humour that we often witness between the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard). We see too little of the cooperation that we witnessed during the wool debate, for example, when, as a consequence of the Garnaut report, both the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and the opposition spokesman on primary industry agreed that amendments ought to be pursued in the interests of the industry. All too infrequently does the Prime Minister stand and acknowledge the cooperation of the opposition. If we take an issue as important to Australia as the GATT reforms and the mutual attitude to reducing tariff barriers, particularly importare ant prior to the March election, I have rarely heard the Prime Minister acknowledge that the opposition has always avoided politicising that essential issue and has largely supported the government in its general trading thrust. It is an acknowledgment that has come from time to time from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. If the attacks that are so personal became more philosophic and there was more recognition of the mutual dependence we have on each other, more, could be done in this chamber and we could become an effective parliament in which the government and the opposition, as far as they are able, cooperated. The thing I feel most passionately about is the a real reform that could be introduced into this parliament by the government. I make this statement recognising my own jaundiced point of view. One of the freedoms I enjoy as a member of the Liberal Party, and a freedom that my National Party colleagues have as well, is the freedom to disagree with what the party is saying, cross the floor and vote with the government-a freedom I have exercised and a freedom that the majority of my South Australian colleagues have exercised. One of the reasons that debate is seen as so ineffectual in this place is that the government, because the people of Australia elected them, rightly determines that it will do something. The opposition, in looking at the government's response, decides whether it will agree or disagree. The lines are drawn and the debate in this chamber therefore becomes largely meaningless because, no matter what I might like to tell myself, I am persuasively saying to the government, 'Noone on the government side will come over here and vote with the opposition'. What is the point of constructive debate? Why should I participate in a debate?'. It is only for the base, egotistic reasons of fearing that at some time my children might pick up Hansard and wonder what their old man had to say, the remote possibility that there is someone in Wakefield listening to this debate or that the Hansard reporters may be looking bored and are entitled to be entertained. Those not the reasons that I am elected. I am elected to put a point of view on behalf of all of those people who failed, for one reason or another, to vote for the government and all the people in Wakefield who are entitled to have me represent them, whether they voted for me or not. My plea to the honourable member for Bonython and the government members is to look again at what has been a plank of their approach to government and to opposition, and that is· this question of absolute party loyalty. I understand why it is there. I recognise that that plank frequently means that the ALP is much more disciplined and is seen as being much more cohesive than the opposition is painted. But that same discipline means that debate in this chamber is eroded because the decision has been made before any individuals representing electors come into this chamber. Much could be done to enhance the standard of debate in the chamber if I felt that any of my comments would have any influence on anyone of the honourable members opposite. We all have to determine where our loyalties lie. Early in my parliamentary life, along with all colleagues, I had to decide that my first loyalty was to Neil Andrew. That was not meant to be a selfish loyalty; it was because I had to live with my conscience. My next loyalty is to the people of Wakefield. My final loyalty is to the Liberal Party. When those three principles are all in parallel, life is easy for me. When one of them falls out, I have to make a decision as to which one has priority. As long as the party has priority over the electorate, it is difficult for me to believe that the parliament will be able to exercise informed debate or represent adequately the views of the people of Australia. Much of the focus of the report of the committee chaired by the honourable member for Bonython has been on the question of sitting times and how much time we effectively spend in this chamber or in this parliament. I do not agree with the recommendation that the House should endeavour to rise at 8 p.m. I do not like the present arrangement where we frequently sit beyond 11 p.m., but I am not an enthusiast for rising at 8 p.m. My view is that, having come from the electorate to be in Canberra-clearly the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) reflects this and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has already made these comments to the House-lam more than happy to sit of an evening. The Andrew body clock would be somewhat happier if we rose at 10 p.m. rather than 11 p.m., but I see no reason for the parliament to rise before the hour of 10 p.m. What am I going to do in Canberra after 8. p.m? Am I to wander back to my unit and switch on the black and white television? Hardly. Mr Carlton-Read a book.",101
177,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"Of course I am quite happy to read a book. I am happy to do that within the confines of my office. I am here representing the people of Wakefield and I have no wish to terminate that representation at 8 o'clock at night. Nor do I feel that I am an ineffectual member if the parliament rises at 10 p.m., allowing me effectively to have as much sleep as I would have if I were in any other vocation anyway. Additional debating time and additional time to participate in the forms of the House can be achieved by allowing the House to rise at what I would regard as a civilised hour, and I would nominate 10 p.m. I take up the point made by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). I am not suggesting that we should suddenly spend every Wednesday evening, for example, in this place until 10 p.m. I think it is very civilised to get up early on some occasions-a point made by the honourable member for MACKellar (Mr Carlton). The decision to regularly rise at 8 p.m. is a discipline that I do not particularly feel any need to concur with. On the question of a second chamber, I have mixed feelings. Such an arrangement could create a feeling that the legislation being debated is second-rate legislation. However, I recognise the valid point that it would give increased opportunities for honourable members to participate in debate. So I have mixed feelings about a second chamber. I come back to my original point. If I am to have any meaningful debate in this place, it has to be in anticipation of some sort of response from members of the government ·as a result of the comments made by members of the opposition. I recognise the number of changes that the implementation of this report would bring into the way the parliament is run. I also recognise that there are time restraints on this debate and that now would be an opportune time fOf me to allow speakers to participate in the valedictory. I simply indicate to the House that my own passion is to have some of the discipline that has been characteristic not of the parliament but of the ALP relieved so that there is a greater opportunity for those of us in opposition to feel the comments we are making in debate are being heard. by members opposite and to generally enhance the standard of debate in this chamber. I commend the report and the opportunity that it has given for an evaluation of parliamentary procedures. Debate (on motion by Mr Beazley) adjourned. NA Valedictory",102
178,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I move: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Saturday, 18 December 1993, at II a.m. This is the time of year when we reflect upon events in the course of the year, and these days for many of us the years go more quickly, maybe because we are busyMr Downer- We are getting older- .",103
179,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"But we are getting older. The years are years of transition, as this year has been-there· has been an important election for everybody here-when the nation starts taking shape again in another parliament and we get. on and run the affairs of the country and try as a group to best manage its interests. It is also a period of change and transition in the personal and parliamentary lives of those who have joined the government .as ministers, those who· have been ministers and· have left and those for whom this will be their last day in parliament. I would like to say some· things about the people who are retiring, and"" will, but before I do so the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has an announcement to make. I will desist so that he can speak, and when he has finished I will take up my remarks.",103
180,Mr DAWKINS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"1 thank· the Prime .Minister (Mr Keating) for yielding to me on this occasion because, as he says, this is the time of the year when we reflect on what has occurred during the year. For those on this side of the House this has been a year of great fulfilment, a year in which we won an election, and a year in which we took the opportunity of an election to do a number of important things and to see that a number of other important things occur. From my own point of view, what we saw was an opportunity to put fiscal policy into shape. In the process of implementing the last budget we have been able to cement in a deficit reduction strategy for the next three to four years. From my point of view, there have been a number of other great fulfilments this year. One of those was the conclusion of the GATT round, a round I was very much a part of starting when, in Punta Del Este in Uruguay, I sat in a room with Willy de Clercq from the European COn:Jmission, and Dick Ling representing the United States of America. The three of us hammered out the terms on which that round would be progressed, including the issue of agriculture, which is so important to Australia. There have been other important fulfilments as far as we on this side of the House are concerned. I think there comes a time when those of us who are in elected office look not only to those things which have been achieved but also to the future. I have observed that most of those who leave executive office do so reluctantly, often bowing to the decision of the electorate or bowing to a decision of their party or bowing to the decision of their leader. But I resolved a long time ago that I would not grow old in this House. I came here for the first time 20 years ago next May. By now I am by far the longest member currently serving on either side, in either house, to come from Western Australia. During the last 11 years it has been my great pride and privilege to be a central part of a government which I think has been the most reforming in Australia's history. There has been a small group of us who essentially have been responsible for putting together not only 11 budgets but also in addition to those 11 budgets, another 10 economic statements of one kind or another. All of them. involved enormous amounts of time, effort and dedication on the part of those of us who were involved in that process. But there comes a kind of natural time in the course of politics for one to reflect not only on the past but also on the future. For me that time has come. Today I have' informed the Prime Minister of my desire to move to the back bench as a step towards leaving the parliament at some time between now and the ne]':t election .. This has been a year of fulfilment. For me this week has been a week in which many of those things that I have sought to achieve have come to fruition. I mentioned the GATT round, the conclusion to which was reached only in the last day or so. I also mentioned the bUdget and the decision that was taken to reform the budget process in a way that I suggested some nine years ago. Some of these great reforms take a while to achieve. Of course, one of the things about being in office for a long time is that we have the opportunity to see those things which we set out to achieve so many years ago come to fruition in a way that is immensely satisfying. Another thing about long-term governments is the responsibility which we all have to ensure the rejuvenation of the party and the rejuvenation of the government. It is well known that I have expressed views about rejuvenation issues within this government. I have expressed views about the appropriateness of departures. On this occasion I am simply taking the advice which I have tendered on other occasions to others. It is important to the long-term success of a government like ours that those of.us who see the moment come to move on to other things should take that opportunity. From my point of view that time has come .. I want to refer to a couple of other things as well before yielding once again to the Prime Minister and the remarks that he wishes to make. I think that the greatest things which have happened during the last 10 years, are the changes which ensured that Australia became a more competitive place, the decision we took in relation to the exchange rate, the floating of the dollar, the reduction in tariff levels; and the withdrawal of subsidies. These. have been the most profound instruments of change within this country. They require all of us, whether we are here making policy, whether we are ordinary citizens, or whether we are part of the work force in other ways, to ,ensure that this country will only succeed by being competitive in what has become an increasingly competitive world and which, as a result of the GATT round, will continue to become an increasingly competitive world. The other' day I read a report prepared for the World Bank on the reasons behind the success of the economic miracle countriesthat is, the tigers and mini tigers-of our region. While it wa,s impossible for the report to point to one single set of poliCies which resulted in the success of countries such as first Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and so on, one of the things it stated was that a common feature of all those countries Was the extent to which they determined to invest in education and training as a priority, particularly primary and secondary education. Those countries recognise that the skills of their workers are central to the success of those economies. I say that in the course of the last 10 years Australia has taken some very important steps, which my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) is taking to new levels in the areas of his responsibilities. It is certainly true that the higher education system is a much bigger system than it,used to be. I hope that it is a better system as well. We now have a billion dollar export industry built around the quality of our education. services which we are providing to the rest of the world. We now. have in place national cooperation on vocational education. I hope. that this cooperation will extend into the primary and secondary areas because this issue of high quality education is crucial, I believe, to the continuing success and the competitive edge which Australia needs to develop and maintain in order to achieve continuing success in the. future. This has been a great government of which to be a part-the government of Bob Hawke as well as the government of Paul Keating. As a cabinet minister one could not have hoped to have served under two such important, helpful, and indeed inspirational leaders as I have. Different though they are, in their own way and in their own time they have made an enormous contribution to the success of policy development within this government. I say particularly to my friend the Prime Minister what a fantastic inspiration he has been to me in the course of the last 11 years. There have been very few occasions on which we have disagreed. We have worked together in the cabinet room and outside the cabinet room. We both believe in the cabinet process. We believed in the business of making policy, not simply as a result of endorsing the ideas of officials but because we were able to develop a foment within the cabinet room. I think we were able to come up with creative ideas which many countries around the world are now looking at in a way in which they never bothered to look at this country in the past. I think that is a measure of the creativity and the dedication that we have put into the process of making policy for this country over the years. Of course, I also want to thank all of my cabinet colleagues, perhaps not for always agreeing with the points that we put but for realising that some of the hard things which were done were necessary for the good of the country. I think that most people are seeing that some things about which they may have had reservations earlier have been utterly worthwhile and beneficial for the country. I do not want to go into a long list of thank yous but Icould not let this opportunity pass, particularly with my wife present, without thanking her for her unstinting support for me. She has been a constant companion over the last 70 years. She has been an enlightened critic of some of my views but also a great supporter and my best friend. I say to the staff I have had over the years as a minister that ministers, in the end, are only as good as the staff who are there to support them. I would like to thank the many staff I have had over the years for having the courage to have followed me on so many adventures, sometimes prodding me, sometimes holding me back-not always successfully. Lastly, I thank the party, both here and in Perth. It has not always agreed with me; nevertheless, it has supported me, encouraged me and certainly given me an opportunity which very few people get to have-certainly very few people who come from my particular background. This has been a wonderful experience for. me. As I said, it will be 20 years next May since I first came into the House, first as the member for Tangney and later as the honourable member for Fremantle. I take this step without any of the rancour, without any of the bitterness, without any of the disappointment that I have seen written on the faces oUhose who have stepped back from executive office. This is the time entirely of my own choosing. It is a time which I think, in the natural course of events, is the right time for me. At the age of 46 it is an opportunity for me to pursue other interests. What, I do not know. I have not had time in the context of this job to consider in great detail what I might do later. Indeed, it would have been inappropriate to do so while I was discharging the kinds of responsibilities which go with this job. But after 20 years in public life I have given all I can give and I now look forward to other pursuits which, I am sure, will be equally enjoyable. I will look back on this period of being a minister in the greatest government I believe Australia has ever had with a great· deal of pride, a great deal of satisfaction and a great deal of happiness. I say to all those who have been part of those 11 years in office, particularly to those who are part of the 20 years I have been in the parliament-there are very few members in this House who were here when I arrived in 1974; there are about four or five on this side of the House who are still looking pretty cheerful and one or two on the other side of the House, like the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who does not look so cheerful these days-that it is a long time to have been around. It is a time. I will look back on with a high degree of satisfaction. I want to thank all of those who have given me this opportunity and made it so worthwhile. Honourable members applauding",103
181,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"by leave-I was saying in my earlier remarks that every year is a year of transition in the nation and the parliament, probably more so this year because of the transition which comes naturally with an election and the one which is now coming in the economic cycle of a country and which induces, obviously, change in the personnel of the parliament and the government. Tonight we have a number of people in that transition of their lives. We have just heard from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) with his view of this. As well, we have the honourable member for MACKellar (Mr Carlton) who has announced that he is resigning from the parliament. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) is resigning and I think I am not telling any secrets by saying that may be the last year we see the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) in the parliament. All of these members have served the parliament with great distinction. Let me take the opportunity to say something about each of them. Let me begin firstly, and perhaps obviously, with the Treasurer. We on this side of the Rouse both recognise and respect his decision even if we will be reflective about it, and some of us quite sad about it. The government has been through a substantial transition. I think there are only five ministers of the original 27. In just on 11 years that is a very large change by any measure. The Treasurer was one of the founqing ministers of the government and the ,cabinet as Minister for Finance in 1983. He held major portfolios but, more than that, throughout the process he was a member of the Expenditure Review Committee which is a clearing committee of the cabinet in tenns of financial resources and policy. His intention to resign his position means that the government is making another significant transition. The transition will be important for him. of us respect anybody who makes a judgment about his life, looks at his contribution and his future, 'weighs these things up and comes to a decision, as the Treasurer has done. Whilst I will miss him very much indeed from the cabinet, in a personal sense I look forward to his leaving that tremendous burden which he has had, particularly through the period of recession, and now into growth, taking stock of his life and being able to enjoy his wife, Maggie, their, new daughter, Alice, and his children and to recover that part of his family life which he has missed, as many members in this House have over the years. In that personal sense the Treasurer has made a very big and important decision and one I know, having taken with a lot of forethought, he will enjoy the outcome thereof. Whatever he turns his hand to he will succeed in. He is such a successful person. Whatever he decides to focus upon he will do well. I would like to record some other things about the Treasurer before I mention other this members. I said recently at a gathering we held for him after 10 years in office that the most significant· position he held, of all the great positions he has held from Treasurer, Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Minister for Finance and Minister for Trade, the key position he held was as a cabinet minister. I know of no cabinet minister who has taken cabinet work more seriously. It is quite easy for ministers who are not in either the prime ministership or the Treasury to focus upon their work and to participate in the cabinet but not to get across all the policy submissions, not understand what every other minister has in front of himself or herself and not to engage fully in that cabinet process. This John Dawkins did. He mentioned in his remarks the role of the cabinet. By implication, of course, he was raising the role of the cabinet minister. I cannot make a commentary on periods of other governments in office, but I can certainly make a comment .on this government. If the expression 'cabinet government' is to mean any thing, it certainly means something in this government. Policy in this government has All been run by, ministers, and the role of a minister in the political system is a key when at one looks at the depth of the transition Australia has made in the last 10 years. That has largely come from the creativity of ministers. That is not to say that we were not well served by creative and energetic departments and officials-we were, and we have been. But I do not believe a bureaucracy can ever change the direction of a country unless the cabinet wants to change that direction. In our system of government-because we do not elect the Prime Minister at a popular election; the Prime Minister is chosen by the parliamentary parties to lead them and is the first amongst equals in a cabinet-the role of cabinet ministers in cabinet is that which they wish to make it. In John Dawkins we saw the cabinet minister's role par excellence, to the point where he had thorough stewardship of not only his own matters but also just about every matter in cabinet. He always made a learned and valuable contribution. The Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet-the instrument that this government developed to run economic policy, be the. resourcing place for public programs of the Commonwealth, the clearing house of policy and the body to set the priorities-worked effectively through all these years, through all of the May statements and budgets, of which there were about 20. It re-sorted the priorities of the Commonwealth and set the modern Australia up to be the competitive trading society that it is today. We did two budgets a year between 1983 and 1991; I think we did a May statement every year bar 1986-and the May statements had more in them than most of the budgets. So we had, let us say, two budgets a year but really the May statements were almost multiple budgets. The Treasurer's role in all of those was to participate in that relatively small group. There are few of the original members left in the parliament. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) is one of the foundation members. Not long after the committee was instituted he was joined by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and myself. Senator Peter Walsh and Senator John Button, both now retired, were principal players along the way, as was Senator Evans. There was a great camaraderie in this group, and the fact that the Treasurer and Senator Walsh came from Western Australia and shared many common values occurred coincidentally as the Treasurer, Senator Walsh and the othersmyself included-had very common views about the direction of economic policy and where it might go. That became the strength of the government through this period. His service· to that group was profound. His energy and dedication over those long nights, over those long years, is almost beyond the capacity of most people to comprehend. Not only did he do that, but also he then became the Minister for Trade. He mentioned the work he did with Dick Ling and Willy de Clercq in putting together the foundations of the Uruguay Round in Punta del Este in 1986. That was key work for Australia. Never before had we taken part in such an international undertaking of this dimension, and never before had we set Australia up to be part of that. The Treasurer, then as Minister for Trade, set up the Cairns Group, and that group has played, with the US and the European Union, a key role in the GATT negotiations over the seven years leading to a successful outcome this week. So, in getting those fundamentals right, in getting agriculture into the round, and in setting the round up properly for discussion, evaluation and negotiation, the Treasurer's role in Punta del Este will have served Australia well not just then and now, but it will serve Australia well for those many years into the future during which the GATT round will bring benefits to this country. He went on after that epoch making period as Minister for Trade to the area of education and training, there taking on a root and branch change to our tertiary institutions to set the place up for the higher participation rates which were then coming through as an expressed part of government policy-a policy he, himself, had played an important part in. The consequence today is that our tertiary institutions are comparable to any in the world. We are servicing about 40 per cent of the output of our secondary schools, and we now have just on eight children in 10 completing secondary school. Hence there has been a revolution in education. After that and many other reforms in the area, he became Treasurer-at a difficult time for the economy, for the government and naturally, 'then, for him. This was during the period after I became Prime Minister, when the economy was stubbornly in recession, when it was hard to promote growth. I think the policy settings which the government - dopted in 1992, in budgetary terms, served the country welL They resparked growth in the economy, to the ,extent that it has now come back. As a consequence the Treasurer, in a sense, to use a .boxing term, hangs up his gloves after the economy has recorded 31/4 per cent in economic growth, after it has recorded two per cent inflation and, as the Treasury indicated this week, we expect to see much more substantial job growth over the year. On top of the 100,000 jobs growth in the last three months, even higher growth is portended for the coming year. He has talked about numbers in the high three-plus per cent area, and perhaps even higher. The Treasurer's career has been a highly significant one. Not many ministers, as he said, have had the chance to serve just on 11 years in public office. That is an honour which has been reserved for few people in Australian public life, and an honour I think not reserved for anyone else from Western Australia. Mr Dawkins-Paul Hasluck.",106
182,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Paul Hasluck, as the Treasurer says, was another. Anyway, it was a very distinguished period and I am sure that the Treasurer has decided that this is the right time in his political career, the right time in his ministerial career after that very long period of service, to take stock, look at the future and decide whether he would go around another parliament and all the processes involved, as well as the commitment that means to people in so doing. Can I say, on behalf of the government, how much we have enjoyed having him as a minister-how much his ministerial colleagues have not just enjoyed having him around but have appreciated the wisdom and value of his advice and the passion with which he has argued cases. The community at large will appreciate his being part of the resetting of Australia to the new era Of an open and competitive country and his doing all the policy things that needed to be done to see that happen and see it work. The cultural change which abounds in the country, across the country, from business through the professions and down through the work force, is something which he can take a lot of pride in. Very few people have had that opportunity. He has had it, and we salute him. We wish him and his wife, Maggie, who is in the gallery, well. Of course we on this side of the House will maintain our association with him always. Government members-Hear, hear!",108
183,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to say some things about some retiring members. I deal firstly with the honourable member for Werriwa, John Kerin, who has announced. his resignation. He came to this parliament in 1972 and in 1974 and was defeated in 1975 in the big landslide against the Labor Party. He came back when Gough Whitlam resigned as member for Werriwa in 1978. He has served in the parliament from that date till this. He is in the chamber now. John came to the Labor Party with a very earthy experience as a person who had been involved in agriculture in this country, who had educated himself professionally to serve in the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and who had other experience in the area of primary industry in Australia, both before he came to the parliament and during the period after his defeat in 1975 and before he came back. He became Minister for Primary Industry in 1983 and distinguished himself in that position until 1991. I am not sure whether that is a record period as Minister for Primary Industry. Mr Beddall-It was.",108
184,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"It was. I was about to say that, if it was not, he would have to be running someone else very close. The great thing about his service was the fact that he brought to the position the earthy understanding of agricultural issues and blended that with an understanding of economic policy and the way markets work and should work. He fitted very comfortably with the prevailing view of the cabinet about how the economy should function. He was of cabinet status. He took part in the cabinet debates on all of these matters. More than that, when he was Minister for Primary Industry, the great agricultural industries got the kick-along that they would not have received in the various policy undertakings that we had-ingrains, in the deregulation of these markets: the wheat industry and the dairy industry. He took an interest in the fishing industry and in the wool industry. As a consequence, Australian agriculture got a basis and a footing to it that it did not have before and a realisation that it was in the world and that policy had to adopt and give these particular commodity markets a place in the scheme of things-one which was sustainable and one which made economic sense. He demystified a lot of policy in agriculture for the farmers and graziers of this country. In so doing, he let them understand the role they cOllld play and had to play in modem Australia and the world. His interest extended to the international environment as well. He has been not just the longest serving but an exceptionally successful minister, particularly as Minister for Primary Industry. He went on to become Minister for Trade at a critical time in the Uruguay Round and very quickly mastered those issues at a time when the round was stuck in a hole and it was difficult to hold on to the positions in the of the intransigence of the Europeans. The work he did with Carla Hills and others from the United States-Clayton Yeutter, if my memory serves me correctly-was very profound work at an important time for this country in keeping the round going and in prosecuting our interests in various fields. As honourable members know, he went on to become Treasurer in 1991, a most difficult time when the recession was most obvious and the remedies were not so obvious. The remedies, even if applied, were difficult to see. During that period-this would have been a most testing time for almost everybody-the economy was really in transition. ,Like many times, these transitions are not easy to see. It is not easy to pick the turns of economic growth or economic change. We are wise after the event; it is very hard to be wise during the event. We both respect and salute the work that he did. He, like the Treasurer, decided that this was the time in his parliamentary life when he should not contest a place in the cabinet again. He has subsequently come to the decision himself that this is the right time in his life to make that transition out of public life after having come here just on 20 years ago,in 1974, for the first time. My colleagues will miss John Kerin as a cabinet minister, as a member around the House and as a sane and decent fellow and for the great cabinet work he did as a cabinet minister during the period of his tenure in cabinet for and on behalf of the Labor Party. He has always believed in the Labor Party's values. That we have always recognised in him. He, like the Treasurer, will, as he leaves this place, always have our respect, our affection and, we hope, a continuing association. Honourable members applauding",108
185,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to say a couple of things about the honourable member for Mackellar before coming to the honourable member for Bonython. No doubt the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) will say some words about the ,honourable member for Mackellar as well. They both came to the face parliament in the same year, in 1977. That is 16 years ago, which in parliamentary terms is a long time. When one looks at the turnover in parliament, there was a large t,urnover in this period. This isa long innings in Australian public life. Jim Carlton came here in 1977 and was appointed Minister for Health in 1982 and Minister for National Development and Energy from the middle of 1982 until the middle of 1983 when the coalition lost office. He went on to become spokesman on health in the shadow ministry, then spokesman on Treasury, on education and on defence, and then as shadow minister without portfolio assisting the Leader of the Opposition on policy' coordination and development and chairman of the social policy and health group of the coalition. Jim Carlton has enjoyed a tremendous friendship with most members of this parliament. He is an exceptionally likeable person. As a consequence, most people like him. Mr Ruddock-You have to be likeable to be liked?",109
186,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Generally you like the people who like you. He has always been regarded as a thoughtful person. He was a party professional. He held an important office as secretary of the Liberal Party in New South Wales before coming to the federal parliament. In holding that office, he came with high professional qualifications for public life. He rose to the position of Minister for Health and Minister for National Development and Energy. It is always a tribute to anybody to make the rank of federal minister and to carry out those roles with distinction. After that period of office he provided of intellectual power to the coalition in looking at policy priorities in the period the 1983 election. The coalition had been in office from 1949 to 1983, bar f01: those three years between 1972 and 1975. Hence the period of opposition was a substantial break for the party from the past and required a view about where the liberal Party had to go in the future. I know that he did focus on those general tasks as well as on the particular ones such as the health portfolio which he hel- from March 1983 to December 1984, at a bme when the honourable member for Bonython, about whom I will talk in a moment, was introducing the Medicare scheme to Australia. It was a radical· departure from the health scheme which happened to prevail during the period that Jim Carlton was Minister for Health. He was given the Treasury portfolio in September 1985, at a time of great change in Australia. It was a time when the government's focus on the policy agenda was very much about economic policy, a time of great flux in the economy and a time of change in the terms of trade when we were witnessing a very large nominal depreciation in the exchange rate. I know that in dealing with that he was always trying to make sense of the changes, again trying, as I said a moment ago of the honourable member for Werriwa, to pick the turns and make judgments while the economy was going through a fundamental transition. I am sure the Liberal Party owes him a debt of gratitude for his work during this period and later in developing other policy in the period coming up to the 1990 election and afterwards. We on this side of the House will be sad to see the honourable member for Mackellar leave the parliament. He had the respect of most people over here. It is another transition in the life of the parliament and an important member of it. It is a judgment that he has made about his own life and his own future and a decision that he has freely made looking at all the factors. As I know his wife, I know he has a very happy life, and it is my most fervent wish that in the decision he has taken, the judgment he has made and the life before him, that he and she will enjoy that a lot life and they will do so in the very firm knowledge that they leave behind not just an after appreciative coalition party but a set of friends in the federal parliament that I am sure will endure forever. Honourable members applauding",110
187,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like now to turn to the honourable member for Bonython, who is a member of the House and has not told us that he is going to tender. his resignation. I do not want to point the bone at him by saying these things but it would be a great pity-I am doing this as an insurance-for him to leave without my having had the opportunity to say these things, so I am taking the opportunity even if he does not leave. The honourable member for Bonython came to the parliament in 1977 and has had continuous service from that time onwards. He· held a number of positions in the then opposition. He was shadow spokesman for health from 1980 to 1983 and, as he was a native Tasmanian, he was shadow minister for Tasmanian affairs during this period. After the election of 1983, he became Minister for Health and, of course, he then introduced the Labor Party's policy of Medicare, which has been a profound and radical change to the health insurance system of this country. He held this position from 1983 to 1987. I do not think anyone has had more pride in putting something into place than Neal Blewett has had in seeing Medicare not just go into place but stay there. As it evolved and changed over the years-and as, indeed, the characteristics of health delivery changed, prices within the system changed, and efficiencies changed-'-he came to the Expenditure Review Committee looking at the savings options which we then faced in t-king down public sector outlays in. this country. It is worth recording that during this period, which is relevant to the Treasurer, the honourable member for Werriwa, as well as the honourable member for Bonython, we cut public sector spending from 30 112 per cent of GOP in 1983 down to 23 1/2 per cent of GOP by 1990, a seven percentage points of GOP decline-an enormous change. They all lived through this flux of change in needing to correct the savings balance of the country in the public sector. Neal would come to the ERC to ward off changes to Medicare which were being proposed by the Department of Finance principally-it was always the villain in the piece-and the Treasury, and he would then stoically defend his positions. But in the doing of it, one understood just how clearly he had seen the model of Medicare established, how he understood its linkages, and how he understood its relationship with the medical profession and service delivery ih this country. . If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, we are now a decade on and health expenditure in this country is around only eight per cent of GOP, which compares more than favourably with most other industrial count ries. It is about half that of the United States and it is built on a fee for service system private practice. In this system it is generally hard to contain costs but it is not just built fee for service in private practice it also delivers, we think, a first class health insurwork ance an9 health delivery system in this counseeing try. Of his many important ministerial responsibilities, in the eyes of the Labor Party, his crowning achievement would probably be the establishment of Medicare and successfully defending it against' marauding attacks by other ministers over a long period. He was a real force to be reckoned with, I can assure you. He would sit there obdurate and stubborn defending his position on these things but, of course, in the end, we listened to him. Peter Walsh and I, and others who had responsibility then-along with the Treasurer in the ERC, the honourable member for Gellibrand and the Deputy Prime Minister-would listen and we would, in the end, take his advice. As a consequence, we have seen the. most stable period of health delivery and health insurance probably in the country's history. For that, we owe him an enormous debt of gratitude, not just we in the government, the Labor Party, but the .whole community. He went on to become Minister for Community Services and Health. He always had a great interest in social security and a very finely developed sense of social equity and social justice. He had a chance to apply some of those instincts again after introducing Medicare in this portfolio of community services and health. We saw some quite important changes to other areas of the general health portfolio in the community servicarea;with other ministers in the development of some other programs, particularly for the aged. He took a great interest in the aged and, as a consequence of that, aged care policy in this country has been advanced materially over what it would otherwise have been, so milch so that now many other countries come to Australia to emulate our programs or to at least take some lessons from them. Neal Blewett was central to the implementation of the Labor Party's child-care pro- gram-another program we were very proud of-and I am happy to say that we have been and able to. carry his great work on this year by advancing it further with a home child care on allowance. In those areas-aged care, child care as well as general health delivery-his was, indeed, profound and we are still those major programs across the social .landscape. He was Minister for Trade Negotiations from April 1990 until February 1991. During this time he was involved-as other ministers have been, as I mentioned earlier-in the Uruguay Round. He used to negotiate and lock horns with the dreaded Carla Hills, United States special trade negotiator but a very charming woman and a very efficient person. She is a Californian lawyer who mastered every detail of the round .. It needed somebody of equal mastery to deal with the issues. Fortunately, she was an ally of ours in the round. Together she. and the· honourable member for Bonython were a very effective and formidable pair during this very difficult period of the round which was, in the long history of it, five or six years after it had begun. It was my pleasure to send him a note this week tabulating the outcome of the Uruguay Round, a round which he had a ·great role in. I want to record our thanks there. He was also Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, and also Minister for Social Security. During this period, he again focused on the continuing improvement in program delivery in the social security system of this country of which we on this side of the House are exceptionally proud. In social policy, there may be some people Neal Blewett's equal; there will be none better. This goes across the range which gave expression to his great social conscience in Medicare, the community service .portfolio and social security. As a consequence, Australi,a has now one of the best social security systems in the wor/d. It is set to serve and look after this community in an inclusive way. When he leaves this place, he can look back with exceptiqnal pride to this period. For a long period he was cabinet minister in these senior portfolios. I pay tribute to his cabinet work. Neal was another one of those people who took the corporate role of government seriously and did not just go into cabinet looking at or worrying about his own submissions, although he always argued fiercely for those. The fact is that he took that corporate responsibility on. He was also a great political judge. Political judgment is something people are born with; they rarely acquire it. I was always able to pick his brain when I thought a judgment was needed and, invariably, he would have something novel to say. I hope, though he will not be with us this time next year, that we will be able to pick his brain when we need to checkmate our friends opposite in the coalition. I know that he will give members of the government the best advice he can give us. Neal, I would like to say on behalf of the government how much we have appreciated your work, how much we respect you, how much all of us have enjoyed your friendship and how much we will miss you. You may be gone at some time, but you will not be forgotten. Honourable members applauding",110
188,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I.apologise to anybody whom I may have forgotten, but I do not think I have forgotten anyone. Let me just recap on a couple of things. We have been talking about the personal transition of honourable members all of whom have been ministers in the life of the parliament and in the life of the COUl1try. I record also the transition which I think the year has brought us in things such as the GATT round, which is historic not only for Australia but the world; in the development of APEC, which Australia has had a particular role in; in the things which the government has been able to do this year such as the introduction of the historic Mabo legislation, the changes to industrial relations, developing a flexible labour market-something which eluded this country for so many years-the reforms to child care that I mentioned and many other honoured commitments in the budget. These are matters of pride for the government and proof of the democratic instincts and institutions which exist in Australia and in the House. It has been a hard year, but a momentous one. This is what a House of Representatives is supposed to do: serve the interests of the people. Mr Speaker, I can assure you that next year we will be equally vigorous in pursuing that. Again, it was a year when the conduct of affairs in the House came in for criticism. I would not deny for a moment that there is good reason for the criticism, but it would be better for everybody if the reality of the process of this parliament were better understood. I am quite sure that a lot of people see a lot, of chaos in the parliament and they think of acrimony. I think that the chamber works and I think probably that most people here think that as well. That is, we think the reality is different. That is not that it cannot work any better. The House of Representatives is, as I have often said, the clearing house 6f national pressures. It is the place of political heft. inevitable that we will get rancour in here from time to time, and a lot of heat and noise. But we always get dorie what has to be done and no-one gets seriously hurt. It is therefore a pity that the work of the House in its serious entirety is not conveyed on television and that what we do see is often small segments of various debates in the parliament, particularly rangement. from question time. . Question time has always been prone to bouts of passion and fury. Unfortunately, since it has been televised, the impression grown that that is all that prevails here. Question time, as we know, is not an episode of Leave it to Beaver. The truth is that one cannot always come out of this place demure and smelling like a rose or a violet-not person wants to succeed, at least. Ohe is not able to wear a tutu in thisbearpit, but one does one's best. Sometimes' the degree of do. difficulty is too great, and the. grizzliest possible grab is given to the public. So long as the public perception of question time is unfavourable, we should do what we can to improve it. There are some things that we can do. 'The honourable member for Bonython has'produced a'committee report on the proceedings of parliament. I recommend the report of the Standing Committee 011 Procedure to all honourable members. The most consistent criticism of question 'time is that. that it does not provide a forum in which genuine information can be genuinely sought and genuinely given. I think that.all honourable members on both sides of the House would make this criticism from time to time. That is why I am prepared to seriously. sider some of the recommendations of the Blewett report as well as some of the other worthwhile suggestions that have been. proArms; posed over time. For instance, the idea of rostering ministers has a degree of appeal as do the various suggestions to streamline committee work and modernise some of our voting procedures. This will require careful consideration and to say discussion between the government and the opposition. It is my hope that this can lead to the introduction of at least some reforms in the new year. I would like to see a move His towards a question time which is conducted more along the lines of the British House of Commons, which has features different from our House of Representatives but. which is based on a roster system. No doubt, if we are about this, then ground will need to be given on both sides. For its part, the government is prepared to seek an acceptable arIn any event,. it may be worthwhile to introduce any such reforms on a trial basis as a se-sional order rather than amending the has standing orders, were we to make a change which wewould regard as immediate and to leave it there. I hope that honourable members on the other side of the House will give some thought to these matters over the next if a few weeks. It should not be beyond our collective capacities to come up with the sorts of changes which will raise the public standing of the chamber, which I think we need to ' . It has been a long year and the pressure on all members and their families has been considerable, most particularly so with an election. There is always the nervous element of expectation coming up to.a poll and the period of change thereafter. 80pes and sometimes expectations are realised and at other times not. This has a very big impact on honourable members and we all appreciate I thank all honourable members for their efforts over the year and extend to them my .best ·wishes for Christmas and the new year. I would also like to thank the people who support us in our offices, most immediately conand obviously the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Lyn Barlin; his deputy, I-m Harris; the assistant clerk; the Serjeant-at and the staff of the House of Representatives. The staff of the Department of the House of Representatives have served the parliament extraordinarily well, efficiently and impartially. This is particularly true of the clerk and the deputy clerk, who provide the leadership to the other officers of the parliament. One knows that this impeccable position of impartiality is something which' all honourable members value. An honourable member can go to the clerk and take advice, and that advice is given freely. The clerk is not running agendas, trying to change the chamber into something that it is not or playing politics. We respect that. These may be old fashioned values, but they are the right values. Let us put on the record how much we in this chamber appreciate that. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",112
189,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the Joint House Department for the food and information, the guarding and the transport. That is always a task. This is very much like a small' town when the House is in session with the number of people here. It is a big logistics task to look after everybody and it is always done with such grace. I thank the Hansard staff for recording our words for posterity. I am not sure how many people back read copies of Hansard, other than to trap somebody with a quote. But I am sure that there are students of our many words out there. They have to be very ambitious to read through the great annals of Hansard but, nevertheless, the good thing is that there is an colourful. accurate record and we thank Hansard. I thank the Parliamentary Library. The library plays a great role for honourable members, particularly for rank and file members of the House. It provides a great service to them and, again, does this graciously, courteously and helpfully. We thank the Librarian and the library staff. To the switchboard staff, I thank Marlene, Margaret, Dalroy, Pam and Gaylene. I do not know about the experience of other honourable members, but one is always dealt with quickly and courteously and we thank them. Even though we do not see them around the corridors, as we see ourselves, we certainly know where they are when we are on the telephone. Thank you. In tenns of the chamber, I thank the government whip and deputy-Leo MCLeay and Ted Grace-for, in our terms, a job well done. They both have a great history of managing people and counting numbers. These great skills are shown to distinction in the positions that they hold. I thank the Parliamentary Liaison Officer and staffAnna. Clendinning, Ruth Adam and Lynn Irby. I thank them as well. I thank the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) for managing the affairs of the House; for fronting for the government for spurious debates, such as today's censure motion, and· for trying to make a silly debate look mildly serious. We than,k him for that and for bringing some grace under pressure and decency to the business of the parliament. I thank John Howard, as Manager of Opposition Business, for his role in the parliamentI am sure Kim does as well-and for managing the affairs of the place. He has had considerable experience in parliament. I think John came here in 1974, nearly 20 years ago. This means that we have two experienced people managing' the affairs of the place and we on this side of the House thank him for that. I thank the Speaker and Deputy Speaker-Stephen Martin and Harry Jenkins. For the Speaker, this is his first term. It is a difficult role in' the' central cockpit of Australian politics. Mr Tim Fischer-His ties are always",114
190,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, he does have an eye for colour. We have appreciated his stewardship of the chamber, as we have done with Harry Jenkins. We thank them both for the forbearance in managing the debates and, of course, to the Speaker in the other heavy administrative responsibilities that he bears with the Department of the House of Representatives. For the departing members-John Dawkins, at some point in the parliament, John Kerin, Jim Carlton and Neal Blewett-let me just again express ,the appreciation I am sure of the whole parliament for their efforts and to wish them well in the future. To the families of all memb,ers who suffer the deprivations of public life, we remember them at this time. I would like to finalise my remarks by saying that I would like personally and on behalf of the government to pay thanks and tribute to John May, who. is the transport officer. Honourable members applauding",114
191,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"He is now in the. gallery of the House of Representatives. He has served 1}11z years as transport officer and 21 years with the House of Representatives department. I think that John has been a man who has enjoyed the respect of all honourable members for his good cheer, grace and the favours that he would always do honourable members if· he could. I know that moving around. is very important for honourable members, particularly· when they have been here for long hours. Helping them to do that, arranging flights and the rest is something which he has done with tremendously good grace. I mention his period during the pilots strike when times were really tough. It was his responsibility, in a sense, to get honourable members here and from here. He did these things and he did them with, again, grace under pressure. I am sure I speak on behalf of all honourable members when I thank him most sincerely. He came in the great tradition of Gordon Pike, his predecessor, who served for a very long time. I am sure that when we put their periods of years end on end, it must cover an exceptionally long period and there have been but two of them. Of course they have had their assistants and offsiders over the period. We have appreciated their work and we have said that on many occasions. But to John, after 11 liz years as transport officer, we thank you and wish you well in the future, most particularly immediately for Christmas and the New Year. I will conclude on this note by saying that this is, again, the end of another year of substantial transition-one that we will all savour and take home with us. I wish all honourable members of the House a happy Christmas and a prosperous and happy New Year. We look forward to the House resuming in February for another important session in the history of the Australian Commonwealth . Parliament and, hopefully, again having the chance to do good things for and on behalf of the Australian people.",115
192,Dr HEWSON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I, like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), welcome this opportunity to thank those who have supported· us; who have helped us in the course of the last 12 months; and to farewell, in most cases with some regret, our colleagues who are leaving the parliament. I think everyone would agree that it has been one hell of a year, not only because of the election but also, obviously, b-ause of the new parliament and the other things that followed in the course of the year. While there is a temptation to take up the opportunity for debate with some of the things that the Prime Minister spoke of-the achievements, as he saw them, of the government over the last 12 months; or in our case, what it has not done-I will not do that on this particular occasion, although it is getting more difficult these days to get a debate in this parliament. I do take up one point that the Prime Minister made about parliamentary standards. I think it is a challenge for all of us. I do not think that the parliamentary standards can go much lower than they have gone in the course of the last 12 months in this place. We have very genuinely looked at the opportunity of reforming the parliament and are happy to look at what might be done, in particiJlar to improve question time and the opportunity for genuine debate in this place and, I think, put the parliament back where it ought to be as a centrepiece of our democratic process. But it has taken a real belting in the course of the last 12 months. For a large part of this session it was closed down, from our point of view, with no censure motions, no opportunities to move matters of public importance and question time becoming little better than a farce. But I am happy to participate and all my colleagues are happy to participate genuinely in trying to reform the standards. A lot can be done, of course, by leading by example. I also congratulate the people on my side of this House for what, as I have said, in the context of a very difficult year I think has been a very good bounce back. It was not easy. It never is easy to come out of an election loss. I congratulate them for the way they have settled down and focused on the task at hand. We had a lot of people who supported us at the last f-deral election and they are counting on us to continue to do our job, to voice their concerns and their anger, and to try to meet their hopes and their aspirations. The democratic process has voted and the decision has been taken. We have a real role to playas an effective opposition. I am delighted with the way my colleagues have played that role in the last eight months. We look forward to doing the same for the remaining period between now and the next election-and perhaps turning up the heat a bit more in the next 12 months. As I look to my side of politics there are a number of people I want to thank. I thank the coalition members and their staffs for the contribution they make to the running of our side of politics. My coalition leadership partners, Tim Fischer and John Anderson, deserve a very special thanks. They are great people to work with and I thank them sincerely for their friendship and support in the last 12 months. I particularly congratulate Tim Fischer for an unusually double: husband and father in the last 12 months. Michael Wooldridge, who has newly acquired the position of deputy leader, is developing a very good working relationship not only with me but with a lot of people on our side of politics. I congratulate him for that. far as the manager in the House on our side of politics goes-John Howard-I put on record my great appreciation for his experience and expertise. He has played a very effective role in this parliament since his election as Manager of Opposition Business. Similarly, I thank Kim Beazley for the contribution he makes to the conduct of this parliament and for the entertainment he provides from time to time. I would also like to thank the whips on our side-Rod Atkinson, Paul Filing, Noel Hicks and Gary Neh!. It is never an easy job and I guess days like this are the most difficult when everyone was planning to be 'somewhere else. They have managed to coerce most people to stay. They have done an outstanding job. As far as the running of this House is concerned, I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in recognising the outstanding contribution of Lyn Barlin as Clerk and Ian Harris as Deputy Clerk and the team. I am impressed by the highest possible level of integrity you show and the honesty and dedication you carry with you to this job-in the best tradition of the Public Service in this country. We find you always courteous; always with time to answer our queries and give us advice; and scrupulously fair, which is a distinguishing characteristic of your performance. I congratulate you very much for that. It is not easy to show cool reason in what is very often a hothouse of emotion. I am _fascinated, as I have said many times, how you can sit there with a straight face through what goes on on both sides of this House. To the Serjeant-at-Arms, David Elder, we offer our thanks for the support you have given us during the year. To the Joint House Department, those who provide our food, information, security and transport-and, in my case, the exercise-gardens, grounds and surroundings of this place, we recognise your outstanding contribution. There are problems from time to time, but I think most of my colleagues would be delighted with the standard of that service and the efficiency of the provision of that service. To John May, in particular, I add our As congratulations for 20 outstanding years. I am told that a few people in this parliament are worried that you might publish your memoirs. We wish you well and congratulate you on your contribution. The Parliamentary Library staff are always professional and quick and efficient with their service. We thank them for their outstanding contribution in helping us perform the job we have to do here. Hansard staff do the unenviable job superbly. We congratulate them for that and thank them for their support.' The parliamentary switchboard operators are a very important part of our lives. We thank them. I sometimes think that if they put _through some of the Prime Minister's calls in the last 12 months they may well still have their ears ringing and may have expanded their vocabulary considerably. They make a very important contribution to what we have to do. We thank the Parliamentary LiaisonOfficer,. Anna Clendinning, and her team. You basically run the place quietly behind the scenes. We congratulate you. Mr Speaker, you have had a baptism of fire, might we say, in the last eight or nine months. I personally know you to be a decent and honest person trying to do a good job. We congratulate you for that. We look forward to the impartiality we know you are capable of in the next 12 months. Apart from his ties, his only weakness is his football team-but I agree to disagree on that as well. Now I would like to say something about those who will not be returning. I will start with Jim Carlton on our side of politics. As I have said a number of times, Jim has made an outstanding contribution to the Liberal Party and the Liberal tradition in Australia. I have had the privilege of knowing Jim for a long time and having him as a close personal friend. While I am obviously disappointed in one sense to see Jim go, I am delighted at the job he is going to as head of the Red Crossa job which I think will uniquely use his talents and experience. Jim has made contributions to our side of politics right from the bottom up, not only as an activist branch member but through the organisation as a state director, as a minister-as the Prime Minister has emphasised-and as a shadow minister. In so many ways Jim has made an outstanding contribution. He is distinguished by the fact that he not only is a participant in politics but also studies and thinks about it. That reflective approach to politics has borne an enormous amount of good fruit over the years. He concentrates a lot more on ideas than on the personalities of the business. In that sense he has made his greatest contribution. Jim will be remembered for the ideas he has generated in a policy sense and the contribupersonal tion he has made to the development of ideas, much more broadly than just on our side politics. He is respected way beyond politics, in the world of academia and the world of think-tanks. In areas where there is an active public debate, you can generally find that Carlton has had a role to play during his in public life. Most importantly, Jim will be remembered for that contribution as a great Downer. and dedicated Liberal. The Prime Minister has also mentioned Jim is a very friendly person. That is true. is distinguished in this parliament as one of the friendliest people, with genuine friends right across the whole political spectrum. That is a great testimony to the type of person Jim is. His wife, Di, who has been an outstanding support to Jim over such a long time, is considered in the spouses association to be in the same vein. She is popular on both sides of the political fence. They are those types of people; they are interested in getting on with the job and making a contribution to this great country. I wish Jim well in going off to the Red Cross. As I said, it is a job that will use all his talents-not only his political experience but the fact that he has well developed managerial talents and experience. It will be a very interesting and challenging task. The thing that probably attracted Jim to it more than anything else is its unique opportunity for him to make a very substantial contribution in a very important area of helping people. He is going into the organisation at a level to do that. I am sure, knowing his managerial interests, that he will shake it up a bit and put it on a somewhat different tack. But the world will be a better place for what Jim Carlton does with the Red Cross. As for the government members that are leaving, I will begin with John Dawkins. We respect your decision. We understand how tough it can be in this business with the time away. As you have said, you have been here for a very long time-approaching 20 years in public life. We will not debate what you have and have not done and achieved in all your ministerial posts. But anybody who makes that sort of sacri flce to make a contribution has to be recognised for that. We congratulate you of for what you have done and tried to do for Australia. We seriously wish you well in your life after politics. You will have many opportunities, I am sure. You will probably sit back Jim and smile at us and perhaps not miss some of time .the elements of this parliamentary life.",115
193,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,He will miss Alexander,117
194,Dr HEWSON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"John, you might miss that Alexander Downer, but I am sure Alexander He will have a way of reminding you that he exists, wherever you might go. To John Kerin and Neal Blewett, we again congratulate for your long standing and respected contribument tions to public life in Australia-in quite different ways, as the Prime Minister has detailed. You should be very proud of the fact that you have made that sort of contribution. It is a great thing in our community that people find the opportunity to move into public life and make those sorts tions. I have not got to know the two of you as well as I might have liked-John Kerin perhaps a little better. But I wish you well what you do and congratulate you for all things you have done or tried to life in Australia. One other person I would like to acknowNational ledge, as we did in the parliament this week, is the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair. He has now chalked up 30 years in this place. I have to honest and admit that Ian Sinclair was one my heroes. In fact, he was one of the people whom I used to follow when I was much younger. He got me interested in the political process. I always remember one thing which I think George Negus said about Ian Sinclair which probably characterises him better than anything else. He said that there are rhinocerHouse. oses wandering all over this earth looking a hide as tough as Ian Sinclair's. I think we can all aspire to that; it is a very apt characterisation of Ian. Over that period he has made an outstanding contribution to our side of politics as well as to Australia in so many capacities. It is good to see that contribution recognised after 30 years. My final comment is about our families. think it is important at this time to recognise the sacrifices they make and the contribution they make to our success in this place. Our families ate the ones who suffer the long absences and, in many cases, our spouses the ones who essentially raise the children. course they put up with us when we come back, a bit tired, distracted and inclined focus on things which are of not the least bit of interest to them. Christmas is a very important time for families. Next year will be a very important one, being the International Year of the Family. I would like to think both sides of regard. this parliament could go into the next parliayou mentary year with a very genuine committo making significant improvements in the lot of families right around this country. I hope to see substantial policy development and debate in the course of that period which will ensure that families in a country as great as Australia can enjoy the lifestyle, the standard of living and the opportunities that they of contribugenuinely deserve. I conclude by joining with the Prime Minister in wishing everyone a very merry, in satisfying, peaceful and restful Christmas the and-on our side of politics-a prosperous do in public and successful new year.",117
195,Mr TIM FISCHER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) arid the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in extending be seasons greetings and a happy Christmas to of all. It has been an interesting year,with developments right up to the last hour and a half-and probably more to come. I commend the fact that the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was made on the floor of the House-not in a press conference, not in Perth, but right here on the floor of the I think that is where the focus should for return more often than it does. In terms of the domestic political scene, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others have covered much of the ground. But I join with them in saluting the dedicated work and service over so many years of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton). I extend to you, Jim, and your family I the very best. I wish you well in your challenge with the Red Cross-a challenge which has been added to in recent times. Once upon a time it was perhaps an organisation where things were straight up and down. It did a lot are of good work here in Australia. and right Of around the world. But with the particular . challenge posed by the AIDS epidemic-with to shocking developments again this week-and the ramifications that has for any organisation operating blood banks, I know that you will not be putting your feet up. In fact, you will be getting on with the important work of the Red Cross and we all wish you well in that I turn to the Treasurer and former ministers-the .honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) and the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett). In terms of the Treasurer, I acknowledge fully the work of the Cairns Group which was initiated by him to a great extent. But it was also a joint Australia-Thailand effort in the early stages. Thailand joined in the effort which led to the breakthrough in getting commitments from other nations which has led subsequently to further developments in the GATT round. Treasurer, I acknowledge your contribution and I certainly wish you well in your retirement from this place. Like me, no doubt you .too have been doing your fair share of nappy changing in recent weeks,. I think I prefer the natural ones to the disposables.",118
196,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,You are misleading the House.,119
197,Mr TIM FISCHER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I do not have to wash them.,119
198,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,We want to know how you fold them.,119
199,Mr TIM FISCHER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I have a very neat method. John Kerin, as a minister you pursued our trade interests in all your portfolios and did well-perhaps with the exception of Saudi Arabia. But I acknowledge the work and effort you put into Asia. Trade also became a major focus of Neal Blewett's efforts, although he went on to other portfolios. In the last few months ly enjoyed your work, as a person of integrity, with regard to the reform of the parliament. I hope that some elements of your report are implemented. I know there will be a lot of speakers on this debate,so my remarks will not be lengthy. I fully accept that the members departing the House will want to have their say in the next couple of hours. I remember 1991 and this debate at other times. I salute the the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair as father of the House. 1 believe the standing orders should be reformed to allow the father or mother of the House to conduct the election of the Speaker at the start of each parliamentary term rather than the Clerk of the House of Representatives. That is something I have always believed in and I will keep working on it. I salute all of my colleagues, including John Anderson, Noel Hicks, the opposition leader, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) and the whips for their help and support. I thank particularly the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia and the National Party Whip. This is not an easy jqb, but I am certainly helped by their dedication and determination. I salute the clerks of the House of Representatives-their whole team not just those present in the chamber-for the many functions that they perform around this place. I salute the staff of Hansard and the staff of the Parliamentary Library. They do an enormous amount of work. We do not see a great deal of it at one level, but the Daily Hansards and the like always turn up. We commend that work and wish Hansard well. Turning to the transport office, John May, you deserve to take a bow. You meet so many impossible commitments for so many people. I am delighted that you have family connections in Albury-Wodonga. I hope that when you have finished living in the north of Australia you might head back that way. We wish you well and salute you for your great work. Sitting near John May is Jim Sproule, an attendant, who retires after a quarter of a century of service to this parliament. We salute your work and wish you well. I point out that a number of attendants are retiring and we thank them for their contribution to I have especial- the parliament. I thank the electorate staff and staff generally, including my chief of staff and my staff team. I thank them for their help, work and support and I extend Christmas greetings to all of their families. The Parliamentary Catering Service has had many changes in recent times. I wish it had had more sausages upstairs, but the service is pretty dedicated in its work. I acknowledge the service and the work of Parliamentary Liaison Officer as well. Mr Speaker, I wish you and your wife and family a happy Christmas and I hope that you will enjoy the break at Wollongong or elsewhere changing your ties. On the eve of the - nternational Year of the Family I also salute our families. In the leadup to Christmas our spouses have seen their husbands and wives locked away in Canberra for extended sittings of both houses of the parliament. It is not easy, I acknowle?ge that, and I acknowledge the help we receIve from our spouses. In that context, this will be the first January that there' will be no working visit to Asia or any defence grouping around the world. My life pattern has changed. I am happy about that. It will be a case of home sweet home. I wish everyone else who might be travelling over the Christmas' period safe journeys on the roads and highways. For the public at large it is always a time of heightened concern on our highways. I urge everyone to drive safely over the Christmas period and adhere to the road safety messages. We look to next year, with tran-ition and further changes in the cabinet and in the world. Who knows, let us hope there will be a breakthrough for peace in Ireland, perhaps Bosnia, the Middle East and elsewhere. But we will have to watch the situation in Korea also. There have been some extraordinary developments in that country in recent weeks which I think are of the utmost concern. I· extend greetings of the season and best wishes to everyone. I wish you all a happy Christmas.",119
200,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I do not want to go through the list again of all the people to whom we owe a great deal. The fact that they have been mentioned by the leaders of all the parties in this House more than adequately reflects the sentiments of the House. But there are one or two people that I would like to isolate for special mention. I note that Tim Fischer has deprived me of the opportunity to invite him to another defence Christmas dinner somewhere aro.und the globe. We still have many people overseas and the invitation would have been there but domestic duties call him. There was one failing in the valedictory he gave. Generally speaking, when there is something to be said about anyone in this House he mentions military service. I recollect the speeches given here on the condolence motion on the death of Patrick White, the great Australian author. Tim alone managed to dwell on his service with the RAAF in the Middle East during World War II-a point in his career that very few other people noted in the course of their remarks. In his valedictory remarks to the Treasurer (Mf Dawkins), Tim neglecteq to mention the Treasurer's military service-five years as a private with the CMF. No doubt,. there will be an opportunity for. him to refer to that on another occasion. He can include that as part of the noted public service of the Treasurer on the occasion when he actually leaves the House. Many people are experiencing transitions. John May has already been referred to. I had a great deal to do with him in the course of the pilots strike and I know that the service he performed for members was extraordinary. When I was the defence minister I changed the entitlements in relation to the VIP aircraft to permit members of parliament to travel on them more frequently. I was influenced by his views. He was constantly seeking the best possible arrangements for honourable members with the maximum possible convenience to them, and in an extraordinary parliament like ours that is an essential service. Jim Sproule is a House of Representatives attendant that those on the government side know well because he serves on the corridors of this side of the House. He retires today after 26 years of service. Those of us who have been members in both Parliament House bUildings-I .am one, and there are ma!ly others-will have had a great deal to do WIth Jim Sproule over the years. He has served in a number of positions in both buildings and, in the manner of the attendants, does so with great dedication and kindness. It is also appropriate to acknowledge the 30 years in parliament of Ian Sinclair. I once likened him-I still think it is the image that most resembles him-to a photograph of a World War II heavy cruiser. It had lost all its guns, its stacks were over the side, its. bridge had been shot away, but it was still movingand there were still some men left on the deck. It still looked impressive, even with all those essential bits and pieces shot away.",120
201,Mr SINCLAIR,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"·Oh, come on!",120
202,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, he.is not in that bad a shape. Let me speak up for him.",121
203,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"We will all have the opportunity in the new year to pay like tributes at a roast-they are calling it a recognition dinner-that members of the National Party are arranging for him. The Clerk of the House has my special thanks. There are only a few of us-I include my opposition counterpart and, of course, Anna Clendinning of the PLO-who really understand what the Clerk of the House actually goes through, particularly at this time of the year when we play table tennis with the Senate. It is an extraordinarily burdensome job that he, and his assistants, perform with great capability. I also want to thank the lady whom I just mentioned-Anna Clendinning, who does such a sterling job as PLO-and her assistants. They really keep the business moving through the House. I particularly want to thank the whips. What an extraordinarily fortuitous thing it has been for me, as Leader of the House, that Leo has stepped down from where you sit, Mr Speaker, to where he now sits because he is, without doubt, one of the most formidable whips I have come across. He has done an extraordinary job for us all. ",121
204,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Leo can count; he certainly can do that. We on this side all owe a great deal to him, his deputy Ted, and occasional deputy Rod Sawford. I also want to thank all government members here for what they have done for the government in the course of the last year. I particularly want to thank them for what they are likely to have to do over the next couple of days. They have shown great forbearance over the years. As a government, we are made much more effective because of the capabilities of those who serve on the back bench. I also want to thank you, Mr Speaker. Without doubt, you have the worse job in this place. It is a job in which scarcely anyone succeeds, and scarcely anyone gets through a baptism of fire unscathed. I must say that you have, and, in doing so, you have earned the respect of both sides in this place. For those of us who serve in government we always feel a special sentimentality and a special concern for those who have been amongst our numbers and have decided to leave. The Treasurer, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), is someone I have known since I was at university. He has never stepped out of his front door, whether it be of his flat, of his house, or wherever he may be living, without some idea of reforming something in the course of the day. He was like that when he was a student; he has continued ever thus. It is not easy to participate in national politics from Western Australia. Western Australians are different. They experience great difficulty attaching themselves to national politics. This has been an historical feature of political and social life in.Western Australia, and it continues to be so. With the obvious . exceptions of people like John Curtin and Sir Paul Hasluck, very few Western Australians readily impact on the national scene. Many, of course, have served in ministries,but if you took the top half dozen of those, you would have tei include among them John Dawkins. While it is the longevity of this government which has allowed him to be so outstanding, he has contributed overwhelmingly to the longevity of both the Hawke and Keating governments. He has been a reformer in every position to which he has turned his hand. He has also been a rapid reformer. That means that he has had the personal delight of seeing implemented many of the things in which he most dearly believed. While they are not Western Australians they are beloved colleagues nevertheless-John Kerin and Neal Blewett. I find it very difficult to talk about Neal Blewett. He enjoined me strictly not to talk about him because he did not think that he was in a situation where valedictories should be delivered about him. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister belled the cat and everybody else has followed suit, so I must do so as well and pay tribute to his contribution. Neal Blewett is another very thoughtful man of politics; a person who not only participates joyously and effectively in the governing process but who spends his life thinking about it. Unfortunately for all of us, he keeps a diary. Most of us in politics make an attempt at that but drop out. He, as a thoughtful student of politics, was inspired by Richard Crossman, and it is a very depressing prospect for many of us indeed if and when he chooses to exit this place because of his diligence in that regard. I believe he has a counterpart in John Kerin because he kept at least some notes from cabinet meetings over the years. Both men have been extraordinary contributors to Australian public life and will be a great loss to us when they decide to leave. I say that also of Jim Carlton who in many ways is also unusually a man of politics in that regard. Of course, my first recollections of him do not go back as long as they do in the case of John Dawkins. But we served together on the defence subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. We virtually co-authored a report on threats to Australia's security. are very few documents that will stand the test of time, but that one will. It was a very useful report, if I may say so. In that time. I learned something of the intellectual rigour of the man as described by the Leader of the Opposition. He will not be missed around these halls because unquestionably one of the duties as the director of the Red Cross will be to appear here regularly and to make his views known on the topics which interest him. However, it will be an unusual experience for the Red Cross to have him as its director because it will be the first time the Australian branch has had a foreign policy. It will be interesting to see where that takes it. As I said at the outset, I thank all those people who have served us so well. I think Ossie deserves a mention on these occasions. He is unofficial and therefore does not normally get on the lists that are handed out but, as somebody who occasionally uses his excellent facilities, I have to say that is a diligent servant of our interests. Finally, I thank my counterpart, John Howard, in this chamber. He is a most effective Manager of Opposition Business, as we would expect as probably the most distinguished parliamentarian on the conservative side of politics, and he makes a contribution to the running of this place. This chamber does not operate effectively wi.thout a minimum of cooperative activity between both sides. I wish him and his family well over Christmas, as indeed I do all honourable members, and for the few weeks that we now get relatively free of pressure, to enjoy life as it is enjoyed by the average Australian citiz-n day in, day out.",121
205,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to make a very brief contribution to this debate. I am not going to repeat the general thanks that have been made to the so many people who make this place work. Merely let me lend my support and endorsement to all of them. There are a couple of people whom I would like to single out to especially thank. First of all, to Lyn Barlin, Ian Harris and their colleagues, I want to reiterate everything that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader There of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) have said about your professional impartiality. I have the utmost regard and respect for the way in which you have done your job in all of the years that I have been here, and most particularly over the last eight or nine months that I have been Manager of Opposition Business. It is a credit to the tradition of your calling that you enjoy such confidence and respect from both sides of the House, and I warmly associate myself with what both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have said. I would also like to thank Anna Clendinning for her courteous and unfailing assistance to me and my staff. I could not ask for anybody who is more genuinely cooperative and of impartial spirit, and I look forward to that continued association over the months ahead, Anna. It has been greatly appreciated. To John May I also extend my warm thanks for all the assistance he has given me and my he also colleagues over a long period. I also thank Kim Beazley, a man I respect and like. He is a trustworthy bloke. The fact that we come from different sides of politics does not prevent my seeing the quality in man. He has an abiding interest in all aspects of politics and that is very important. a feel for the place and a love of this place which I share. Perhaps that is something that makes us appreciate each other. To those who are departing I say a number of things. John Dawkins has taken a very understandable personal decision. Anybody who for any period has the range of office Treasurer knows the rigours of that are four people who sit in this parliament at present who have held or hold that positionhave and there is already a book running on our side as to who the next will be; but that will be a matter for the Labor Party and its deliberations. But I wish John well. I send my best wishes to Neal Blewett and John Kerin. I say to you, Neal, that I have always found you to be a person of instinctive courtesy and decency and I respect very the conscientious contribution that you have made to your party and to the sorts of policies that you believe in. They are not always ones that I support but I respect the vigour and integrity that you have brought to them. John Kerin is respected for the job that he did as minister for primary industry. The Labor Party over the last 25 years has protion duced two men who have gone into the lion's den of the rural communityMr Anderson-Hang on. It is a great tariffs. place.",122
206,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The lion's den, I mean those politically. Both of them in difficult portfolios have done well. I think of Ken Wriedt John Kerin. John Kerin is somebody whom we all respect enormously. I notice the current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is looking a little bit wistful You are still in the firing line, Simon, have to take a slightly different tack to you. But to you, John, I very genuinely wish well. You are one of nature's humorists around this place-and we need them. To both you and Neal I send my personal good wishes. Finally, I would like to say something about Jim Carlton. Jim Carlton and I have had very long association. He became General the . Secretary of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party in 1971. He inherited the He has job from a man, John Carrick, who had become something of a legend. He had not lost one election in 21 years federally and the place was very much made in the image of John Carrick, and it was not easy for somebody to take it over. But Jim, with his tremendous intelligence, charm and good huof mour, succeeded in doing that, and we built job. There a very close friendship. There are two qualities of Jim Carlton that not been mentioned yet. One is that he is an outstanding mimic and the other is that he is a marvellous cook. I have experienced own both. I have not in his presence been the victim of his mimicry-but I am sure in my absence I have-but I can tell you that he does a passable Hawke and he did a very good Doug Anthony, an absolutely superlative much MCMahon and a brilliant Gough Whitlam. Jim Carlton has brought to this parliament a wit and a humour which all of us have appreciated. He brought to the councils of the Liberal Party, particularly in the debates about economic policy, a great deal of intellectual rigour. One of Jim Carlton's greatest contributions to the ongoing debate inside the coaliabout the direction of economic policy was when he assembled 33 signatures of backbenchers at a time when the Fraser government was debating the question of car Would that some of those 33 signatures had been available in the room in which policies were being debated. But in those years Jim did play a very key role in and stimulating people to the importance of freedom in economic theory and he brought to it a personal charm and intellectual rigour that we all very greatly appreciated. Janette there. and I wish Jim and Di every happiness in so we their time with the Red Cross. The final thing I want to say is to join you everybody else in expressing to those who associate Christmas with its origins a very holy Christmas; to everybody else, a very happy holiday time. I hope you all have a very pleasant time with your families and I hope, along with Tim Fischer, that the new a year may bring some peace and solace to the world's trouble spots and that it may not be too much to hope that those who think it worthwhile might pray for peace in places such as Northern Ireland and Bosnia.",123
207,Mr KERIN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"First of all, may and I thank myoId friend John Dawkins for stealing whatever remaining bit of thunder.I had left in me. This could be the last time speak in the parliament and, as people are aware, I have decided not to spend ment here with Andrew Peacock and Ian Sinclair! After 12 campaigns as a candidate it is time to say farewell and thanks-but people have been so nice to me in recent days that I might yet change my mind. Luckily, unlike all previous speakers, I do not have be nice to anyone here tonight. There are many people I wish to thank, but there are so many observations I would like to make and so many memories crowding in that I have no choice but to try to make this mercifully short. Hopefully there will be other occasions when I can thank members of the ALP, people in the unions and those people in the business and farm organisations and in the bush-not all at one gathering, though. should write a book, but the one I would to write would have a readership of about three. It would be entitled 'The formation agricultural policy in Australia'. I am sure June would read it; I am not sure about Mum. I joined the ALP in 1965 mainly because the issues surrounding the Vietnam War, but also due to the erosive influences of tertiary education I became seized by economics and environment. The reason I joined was really disgust with Liberal Party lies about Vietnam. It took me about 18 months to find the ALP where I grew up and I was elected president of the Mittagong branch at the second meetLooking ing I attended. I only got into parliament first time by accident. The second time was not by accident, it was with a lot of help the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). On the first time, I must say that only Bob Whan knows all the facts about that. As has been stated, I am one of the five remaining Labor members in the parliament who were here during the heady days of Whitlam Labor government. Gough got me in, Gough and Kerr got me out and Gough's seat. I have been extremely privileged to have represented constituents, that is people, in the seats of Macarthur and Werriwa in the case of people living in the city of Campbelltown for all of the past somewhat over 18 years. As I said in my maiden speech, I Macarthur was named after one of the greatest rogues in Australian history and has always my retirebeen represented by one. Few people join a political party and become a minister for 10 years. I have been enormously privileged and lucky to have been Minister for Primary Industry, Minister for Transport and Communications and Minister to for Trade and Overseas Development and privileged, but not so lucky, to have been Treasurer. I did not get on top of all aspects of the economy or solve the economic problems of the Western world, but it was interesting because in 1991 I had four jobs but lost only three. I had to remind the Governor General on one occasion that it was me again, but I do have a good stack of bibles. The Hawke and Keating governments have I been very different from the Whitlam governlike ment. After 23 years of somewhat sleepy, irrelevant Liberal-Country Party governments, of it was time for a change and Gough certainly gave us that with an intellectual depth and vigour that will always be remembered. He transformed the notion of national governof ment, Hawke gave us legitimacy and Keating will give us Labor as the natural party of government in this country. I used to say to Gough, if only he had read Samuelson. Joe Berinson was my close mate and at one stage we decided that he could not run his chemist shop like the way we were running government, nor could I run my chicken farm. back on those times, my proudest the moment was walking down a corridor from the caucus room in the old Parliament House from singing Solidarity Forever the day Kerr sacked us. We learnt a lot from the Whitlam experience with Lionel Bowen, Mick Young, Paul Keating, and Bill Hayden being ministerial survivors into the Hawke government. We miss Mick's wit; there is not much humour in this place now. Lionel was a the wonderful, gentle man in an environment where the thugs generally win. His Excellency then I took was also not a thug. Times change. I have learnt a bit about politics and I am still learning. The real buzz for me in politics has been that no two days are quite the same, you can grow and you get enormous opportunities. Last year I was away for only 149 days and visited only 45 countries. I am not really picking on the honourable member for Watson, but I had only four trips this year and he still denies me any on the caucus ballots. As is painfully obvious to those who know me well, I still have a lot to learn about politics-I was always happier with policy. I still think that all those who are not true believers have not necessarily lost their way. There will always be new ideas, syntheses and approaches coming forward and I hope the likes of Langmore, Melham, Tanner and Carr can provide some additional intellectual furniture for the ALP Left now that the New South Wales Right is so much in the ascendant. The parliament has changed. The new Parliament House is less intimate than the old one. I use the word 'intimate' in a sense not having anything to do with the antics of the younger members on Thursday nights. I am now in drop-out alley with views over Queanbeyan. I am reminded of the Japanese analogy that, as you get older and more and more useless, they move you closer and closer to the window. Out there in drop-out alley only the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) has been restored. But I see he is spoiling on the native title question. During my time, I think it is fair to say that the executive has become more powerful. Media interest, partly because of the changes in technology and its youth, concentrates on question time and issues of conflict and personality to the exclusion of dreary policy and .the hard work of the parliament which is increasingly being conducted in committees. The Senate as ever is still gearing up to take over the whole parliament and although I understand concerns about party and factional discipline, the committee system is an enormously sensible way to deal with issues without such disciplines. Another thing I have noticed is that the ALP factions are disciplined much for the better in terms of us as a government compared with the Whitlam years. I have been in every faction except Graeme Campbell's and they all represent patronage too much-except Graeme's! I am not so much anti-factional as anti-authoritarian. But the good thing-I am being serious here-is that I can never recall an issue discussed in the cabinet or ministry being settled on factional grounds. And the caucus is disciplined-leaking disciplines it because even the most ambitious, devious, ego and media-prone member eventually realises what side he or she is on by the time he or she gets here and looks around, particularly at the opposition.' One thing I will not miss is the constant personal and factional manipulation at the local level in ALP politics, particularly in my seat, and particularly as the result of the work of some members. But that is another story. The government's caucus now is quality and the best educated and knowledgeable that I have seen. As an aside, although I loathe, detest and despise the media like most of us-but not many of the individuals in it-it, too, is better due to the impact of better education and training. It still hunts in packs and is not a pretty sight when in feeding frenzy but, to re-emphasise, although it just about always gets things wrong, it is getting a lot better. Members are getting younger and many are now sacrificing careers, as well as their families, to be in the parliament. While I still believe it is best for people to have actually done something other than politics before they get here, we are seeing more career politicians in our ranks. Some new members are quite mad, some apparent, some not yet, but even the mad ones are not always wrong, particularly on my side of the House. The first Hawke ministry was the best I served in because we were the most economically literate ever and most of us knew something about the portfolio area we were ministers for-somewhat of an heretical thought upsetting some theories but, to my mind, still no bad thing. I would have been the fourth last person to have defected from Bill Hayden. I still believe loyalty to the leader is not a sin. Bill Hayden probably saved four of us: Walsh, Dawkins, Blewett and me-and we did okay. The ALP has only just found out how hard it is to change leaders when in government-but then we never expected to be a long-term party of government and this probably is a task for the party to get the change when it is necessary. Apart from Bob Hawke's truly staggering incapacity to understand my jokes, he gave me the best years of my political life. During the 1980s when the economic paradigm was very properly dominant-there were people in regulation review committees that wanted to run airports without air traffic controllers, privatise fresh air, and all those sorts of things, and people swearing obeisance to Adam Smith, Alfred Marshall and Milton Friedman all in the one breath-John Button and I had to dance some pretty complicated steps to salvage the vestige of a non-protectionist industry policy that allowed industries to renew, replenish and look outwards. We were happy to corporatise, deregulate and lower protection but mainly on a case by case basis. Industry policy means consultation and decision and rules or policies being set to give a measure of certainty or predictability on behalf of the government of the day. John Button could actually walk through thunderstorms without getting wet. I generally got drenched but straightened out some primary industries and rural matters and changed a few things for the better. The Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, supported Button and me in all of this-he could recognise good ideas and, in my case, had some notion of the 'bush' in Australian politics where national problems such as, for example, unemployment are worse than in the cities. He even recognised the role played by women in the bush. I am told constantly, now that I am getting about a bit, that business does not really understand Canberra. It is very simple-it is a combination of theory, egomania, megalomania, mediamania and the rules of Gaelic football in a derived environment, without any bottom line, where you have to deal with a Senate that is partially populated by feral individuals with the sense of humour of hub caps. I still do not know why business does not understand this. Even though politics is a friendless game, I would like to thank those I served with in the cabinet before we got the parrot prints. I would first of all like to thank Kim Beazley and Ralph Willis for their generosity of spirit, understanding and friendship, and. for the superb job they have done over all the years, particularly since 1983. Kim Beazley, the strategist, gave Australia a decent defence capacity, defence policy and outlook. Ralph Willis steered the accord through and as a long-suffering Minister for Finance has always been our best economist by far. I would like to thank Senator Gareth Evans, particularly for his support last year when I was his junior minister. The job I did has been split, and half of that job is now in the cabinet so I could not have done too badly last year even though, much to Leo's chagrin, I was overseas 149 days. But because I like an intellectual approach to policy formation rather than doing deals or conforming to the desires of a particular constituent group, Gareth Evans is probably one of the people I admire mostdifficult so-and-so that he isbecause he has never dropped the policy ball. He has produced two books, with his department, and has a well-earned worldwide reputation. Australia is a respected regional power because of, as much as anything else, the work of Evans and the officials he leads, especially when we consider Cambodia, the chemical weapons treaty, APEC and GATT. When he was Minister for Resources and Energy, it was he who set up the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. I thank some of the people I have been particularly friendly with: the honourable member for Holt, Michael Duffy, who never really thought that he could pick his own media megalomaniac; Peter Morris, the honourable member for Shortland-a man that I knew way back in the Whitlam days and who is as tenacious as a bull terrier; and Barry Jones. You cannot help but like Barry Jones. He made science live. I will bever forget the time when Barry, Michael Duffy and I were in New Zealand and I asked Barry a question about Mozart. I did not expect to be told about Mozart for 2 11z days. But Duffy handled communications very well, and Morris handled transport very well. I always thought the super ministries were never as successful in many ways-some are just too big. Hawke never asked us about it after we got the super ministries, and transport and communications was one of those. I have seen Barry Jones lose $10 million a minute in the ERC. Peter Morris only ever lost about $8 million a minute, but he kept on trying. When I talk about being in New Zealand with Duffy and Jones-I must say I am noted for my diplomatic coups around the world-I remember the time the New Zealanders took us up into a mock castle above Christchurch. Suits of armour were everywhere, and 1 said to Mike Moore-who has a wit almost as bad as mine-some silly comment like, 'I hope you don't have any chinks in your armour'. 1 did not know at the time that his chief trade negotiator was Chinese. I now turn to the ministers who worked with me in the portfolios. One was Peter Morris, who had been totally on top of transport and had to suddenly take on fish and all these delightful things. Peter Cook was excellent. He is a very good negotiator. He dealt with greenies who were seriously mad. It was only the efforts of others that brought some of the deals unstuck. Alan Griffiths is another, and let me just say that he will be an outstanding industry minister, Mr Speaker, if he can only get a bit more ambition about him. Before the honourable member for FremantIe (Mr Dawkins) made his announcement tonight, 1 was going to say a lot about him. We became bonded on a trip to Japan once. But Dawkins was the innovator and has been the innovator of this government in the tough days in finance, when we had to take really tough dec.isions. He set up Austrade and the Cairns Group. 1 know. 50 people whose original idea the Cairns Group was, but I will give. it to John Dawkins and Alan Oxley. 1 . was at Palm Cove when we set up the Cairns Group. 1 will never forget it. We sat around the pool for three days with about 10 TV cameras, none of us game to have a swim because you could imagine the shot when dived in. 1 acknowledge all that he has done for the universities. 1 think it is wonderful that Peter Cook is there as the GAIT deal comes together, and due credit is being given where it is due. 1 remind honourable members that Peter Cook was the person who set up Landcare when he was working with. me. in that ministry. John Dawkins always needed a good bucket and shovel man-he had so many portfolios. That has been provided and has been done exceptionally well, and 1 will miss John Dawkins. I must say a few words about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He has been saying nice things about me. Paul Keating is the best bit of raw political talent that 1I have ever seen. I have been very. privileged to meet people in politics all over the world. 1 would rate him very much with James Baker III when he was US Secretary of the Treasury. He was probably the most impressive politician that 1I have been privileged to meet. The Prime Minister is an ace political salesman. He is the master of spin. Ideas can change 180 degrees in a sentence without compunction, and he can convince the media of a new line once every half year or so or morning and afternoon. But, quite seriously, the Prime Minister is right on Mabo, Medicare, APEC and the republic; and his contribution to this party, this parliament and the nation will be something that we will all praise in the years to come as the achievements become increasingly greater. The Prime Minister is very hard to toss in an argument in cabinet. 1 will never forget the time when the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, was grasping for a few arguments, although he certainly had the better of the debate, and he picked up a piece of paper and said, 'This is what 1 think', and the Treasurer of the day, Paul Keating, said, 'Where did you get those ideas from?'. He said, 'It is in my brief from PM&C'. 'Oh', said the Treasurer, 'PM&C. Yes, yes, PM&C. They are like a dog in a country town. They like to pee on every Iightpost'. And he won the debate . There are so many others that 1 would like to remember. Neal Blewett's contribution has 'been absolutely tremendous and credit has we been paid to it tonight. Also, Don Grimes, Sue Ryan, Brian Howe and Peter Staples, who never put a foot wrong apart from killing some chemists. I would also like to thank all my colleagues in the rural and provincial seats. There lot of us here who do enormous amounts work that go unsung in the electorates. Ego and ability to handle the press is not quite sufficient. We all have to work very hard. do not think you can ignore the departments, but they have to be stirred regularly to get most functions out of them. Anyone as minister with an institutional memory who . round as well. thinks he knows more than a thousand individuals is pretty mad. One of the great efits that I had in DPI was that I had hunterrible dreds of researchers in ABARE, BMR and BRR and I grew to get a great appreciation of science even though I was a lapsed econoport mist. There is much I could talk on, but I want to take too much more time. Detail important in government; follow-up is essenneed tial. Breakthrough is one thing; the hard yakka is another. There is a difference betogether. tween subtlety and arrogance and I believe that all ministers soon realise that. There have been some things that have disturbed me quite seriously in my time in politics. For example, the combination of Family Law Act, legal aid and the Child Support Agency, when combined with some of the ideologues in the bureaucracy, has certainly wounded many families and people, and I know of at least one little girl Christmas who will never know her father. She will never grow up with her three brotion; thers, and her father will be kept in poverty. I feel strongly about some of those things. Can I just pay credit to some of the great public servants that I have been privileged to work with. Geoff Miller was the longest serving head of a department with me. I also knew him privately from quite a while back. Also, Peter Field, from the Department Foreign Affairs and Trade, Michael Duffy and Neal Blewett would know that those· two gentlemen sometimes had different never perspectives on the same issue. Their contriwhether butions have been absolutely immense to agricultural policy and, in Peter Field's to the whole GATT round. The names just tumble out if you really look at all the people who have been involved in that round, but there is Field, Oxley, Hawes, Hall, Thompson, are a Grey, Jordana, Kenyon, Joan Hird-many of people working over many years. Lindsay Duthie was the first head of the department that I had to work with. He eventually went I to London and continued to work. in trade, which was in many ways his first love. He regarded himself as a paperback ambassador, but he did a lot of work with the GATT Graham Evans, whom I worked with twice benwhile I was a minister, and who had the job of setting up the super Department of Primary Industries and Energy then jumped out of the frying pan into the fire with Transand Communications. I also worked with Tony Cole in Treasury, Dick Woolcott in do not Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Peter is Wilenski. When we talk about APEC, we also to recognise the fact that Dick Woolcott did a heck of a lot of work putting all that Anyone who has been a minister would realise that staffs come and go. They are all scattered to the winds. I would not remember all their names. The senior private secretaries, the or senior advisers-Julienne Mackay, now with the Commonwealth Bank in a senior position; Tony Gleeson, now consultant; Jim Groves, senior adviser to the Minister for Social Security and here tonight; Dick Wells, this who is behind me, now working for APEAthe Australian Petroleum Exploration AssociaDavid Cox, who went from me to save the South Australian Labor government; and Gordon Gregory, now of the national rural health alliance-are all people without whom I could not have done half the work that I did. Some of· the people have gone on to other governments. John Tanzer, Sue Johnston and Bruce Turner are all trying to run the· of Queensland government. I would like to ·simply s-y that I have tried to treat the people in the parliament-I have done one of these valedictories beforethey be cleaners, cat drivers or clerks, as people and they have done that to case, me in turn. Mt Speaker, I have been so impressed by your role as Speaker that I have been thinking of learning the standing and sessional orders of late, but I have not quite got around to it. I have always drawn the line at dealing with the Senate. It is still a great mystery to me. I met some new ALP senators the other day and I did not know they were there. I once went on a trip with Jim Odgers to London and I did not think he was too bad, but I must say that I have great concerns about the Senate Procedure Office. It is institutional anarchy with an Irish twist. There are many things that I could talk on. I do not have time to talk about the opposition. John Howard is' obviously the most outstanding person in the opposition. I miss Jim Carlton. I am sure none of us will miss his· successor. I worked with Ian MCLachlan when he was President of the NFF. The NFF is an adornment to agricultural politics in this country.. I have been misunderstood on many things aqd have had many disappointments. Now is not the time to go .into them. I have had a long-term commitment to the environment. The only stories I can tell about that is that, when we had the Tasmanian forest issue, I got up here .and waxed lyrical about glycine latrobeana and the 40-spotted pardalote. Everyone thinks I thought the poor t-ings had only 40 spots. I am sure the present Minister for the(Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Keliy) understands. I knew about the pardalotes because they were breeding with the lesser spotted pardalotes and some of them had fewer than 40 spots. I did know about it. I set up the Resource Assessment Commission-it was. my idea-and the ESD process, because I really did think that we needed to get a scientific approach to it. Most of the things that have made us aware of the environment have come from the scientists. We will either get.a scientific solution the problems or we will not. We have to face the fact that the population on this planet is the greatest problem. If we look at issues such as the, fact that developing countries will double their population by the third decade next century, we can understand how much science and technology we are going to have to bring to bear. I will never explain my position on economics. I just think it is not the only paradigm or discipline to use in government. Powers of prediction are not there. I find it strange that we give so much strength to economics these days when we all realise as politicians that leadership, style, seizing opportunities, external events-all of these. things-are just simply so significant. The economists are not wrong in the long term. That is why this government has been very economically sensible. The macro-economics-the macros as they call them-do count in the long term. I will not get on to will some of my favourite hobbyhorse about wine taxes and things like that. I think that applied micro-economics needs to be given more emphaSIS and that ther,e. is a role for government in industry policy and it is. not picking winners and it is not about goirig back to old protection. , I must apologise for being terribly wrong when I used the wrong acronym when I was Treasurer. There were two terms: gross operating surplus and gross profit share. I wrote down 'GOS' on the day and I am blowed if I could think whether it was surplus or share. That was a great tragedy and I am sure the economy has never recovered from it. I did not front the media once when we dropped interest rates one per cent for the second time. I had figured out that we had dropped them so many times it would not change a damn thing. As it turned out, it did not. When I became Treasurer we had decided the budget strategy. Treasury, Finance and the Reserve Bank were all of the one opinion about the figures before us, and that was that if we stoked up the economy we would have a boom th-t we could not control. They were right. We did not have a boom and there was to many of no worry about controlling it. For my time in politics, considering the generation that I came from, the bursts of terrible unemployment have been the matters that have concerned us most, including all of the Hawke and Keating cabinets. In 1975, I think that we learnt something about the causes of linemployment. In 1982-83, and then in 1990-91, there were different situations, prescriptions and worldwide conditions; and still it is the biggest bother of Western governments. We are working on it. I look forward to what is done by this government in the new year. Other people have mentioned spouses and families. I have had two wives since I have been in politics, and a family of four kids. In politics, kids do suffer. I do not know how to handle spouses in this crazy game that we are in. There seems to be only three ways they survive: as totally compliant, totally convinced and part of it and thinking that the political party that is represented is the pants or trying to lead a separate professional life. Even that has been difficult in my case because Mrs John Kerin has lost jobs in the Public Service because of being married to me. The implication is there that somehow there are less ethics or less integrity just because people are married to politicians, and it particularly applies in my case. Women have a long way to go in our society and in the parliament. I see the parties trying to address that, but it is not going to be easy. We give a lot of lip-service to the role of women; we never do enough. People are concerned to know what I am going to do and, although I am an associatenot a full tribal member-of the New South Wales Right, I must assure everyone that is not obligatory to have a job for the boy to go to, any more than it is obligatory to fall off pushbikes, scald myself or rort travel entitlements. But can I finish with one joke against myself, because I am sure some honourable members want to go dinner some· time tonight. Wlten I first became shadow minister I went to Renmark and was interviewed by a young journalist on the 'Renmark Daily Irrigator'-I know that was not the name of the papen But she must have left school the day before, because I wrote the story out in longhand for her, explained what I was doing, where I came from and that there were other political parties bar the one in the Riverland. At the end of the interview, sitting there by the river, I said, 'Do you want a picture?', and she said, 'What of?'. Honourable members applauding",124
208,Mr CARLTON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"fvfr Speaker, I have to thank John Kerin for putting me in the position of keeping everybody hungry for a bit longer. But it could not come. from a nicer fellow and one of the. people I certainly regard as a good friend in this parliament. It is indeed something of an honour to be going out in the same wave. I express my very deep appreciation of the nice things that have been said by the Prime Minister (Mt Keating); my good friend John Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition; Tim ant's Fischer; Kim Beazley; and John Howard. In fact, like John Kerin, I am so moved by these remarks that I even considered not handing in my resignation, but I did see Bronwyn in the gallery and I did not want to. cause any trouble there. I thought that might be a bit difficult. In all the stages of my life I have enjoyed what I have done. I have had three, four or five careers. I did not go into full-time politics until I was 36, and I had done quite a lot before then, and at each stage I have always had a view about when it was time to leave where I felt that I could contribute more somewhere else. I am disappointed in not having had another opportunity to be a minister, but the people of Australia decided that last March-that was their prerogativeand I felt that I could be more useful somewhere else. Indeed, I am just· very pleased to be going to such a wonderful humanitarian organisation· as the Australian Red Cross, which will have both national and international operations to worry about. Just going back to what the Prime Minister was saying earlier, I ran into Richo the other day at the airport. I do not know whether honourable members know that Richo and I went to the same school. Richo and I were both state secretaries of our respective parties and· we overlapped for a couple of years. There. is something of an association there, although honourable members. would not think so-he is a hell of a lot younger than I am. I said, 'I hope,. Graham, that I will be able to have a chat with you about various health matters and that you will treat me in·a friendly fashion when I take over the Red Cross'. He said, 'Mate, of course. We have always been pals. I don't. think you have many enemies around here at all, have you? You've got a lot of friends'. I said, 'I think so, on your sid-. Sometimes I have thought Paul hasn't liked me all the time'. He said, 'Mate,)ou are not Robinson Crusoe'. So I am hopeful of getting a reasonable reception from my various friends in the government. When I first came into the parliament 16 years ago, I often ran into Kevin Cairns, the late member for Lilley, in the queue waiting for cars to go to the airport. Kevin used to look me in the eye and say, 'What did you do for Australia this week?'. I am a pretty impressionable sort of fellow and it really went to the heart. I did worry each week about what I had done for Australia. If you think about it enough, then it does improve your performance: I suppose at the end of 16 years in parliament and 22 years in full-time politics, I have to say, 'What have I done for Australia?'. I reckon I have done a couple of things. In the organisational wing of the party, when I took over in 1971, I was absolutely amazedhaving come out of general management first in a world competitive company and then out of MCKinsey and Co. Inc. which is a world competitive consulting firm-that I was running the 1972 federal campaign for the Liberal Party in New South Wales with a separate advertising agency from the one used by all the other states, with almost no communication with the other parts of the organisation. I could not believe that that was I regarded it as an absolutely top priority to try to build a national campaigning organisation. With the help of some of my former MCKinsey pals, and with the help of people such as John Atwill, Bob Southey, the then leader Bill Snedden and, of course subsequentlyMalcolm Fraser, John Howard, who was a mover and shaker in the New South Wales division organisationally, and the fatherly help of John Carrick, whom I succeeded as general secretary, we managed to build the first genuine national campaigning organisation for the Liberal Party. I really enjoyed doing that. In 1975 when we had Tim Pascoe and then Tony Eggleton, I believe we did have the best national campaigning organisation and it was a great privilege to be part of that. When I came into parliament, I had the same kinds of social objectives as I had had as a student. 1 was involved in student politics. I was the president of the SRC at Sydney University, I was president of the Liberal Club and I was concerned essentially with social issues. I was doing science and engineering. I did not know anything about economics; we did not seem to have to worry about it in those days. In 1956 I got the New South Wales State Council of the Liberal Party within about a dozen votes of overturning the White Australia Policy. They were the kinds of issues that I was interested in, and I still am. Since I have been in parliament, I have had to become more concerned with the shift that needed to be brought about in Australia from an essentially inward looking and somewhat protectionist society into a liberal market economy that was capable of standing in the world as an equal with anybody else. I had worked as a manager up to general management level with an internationally competitive firm based in Britain, but run by an Australian, and I also worked with an American firm that was internationally competitive. So I was not worried about the fact that Australians can compete internationally. I suppose I looked at it more from a micro-economic point of view, from a manager's point of view, but I found so. So that I did have to learn something about economics. Over this period it has worried me that I have been characterised as being solely concerned with economic issues, but I have only ever regarded these economic issues as a means to achieving social outcomes. That really is what it is all about and in that sense I am with John Kerin. We only use these things as a tool, but we have to understand them because compassion without understanding of these things is really compassion that fails to deliver to the customers. If I were asked what sort of economic views I have come to accept - and one is accused of being Thatcherite, Reaganite, this 'ite' that 'ite'-I would say that the person I m-st admire iri tenns of economic progress and perfonnance is Ludwig Erhard. Ludwig Erhard put forward a theory based on the intellectual work of WaIter Eucken of the Freiburg school. That was a wonderful group of lawyers and economists who tried to build during the Hitler period a view of the modem world; how you can make a modem soci.ety, with a basis of morality and compaSSIOn, function in the interests of citizens. Erhard, in fact, managed to do that. The economic miracle in Gennany was no miracle. It was based on a whole economic framework which was of profound importance for humanity. It has been very much pervertsince Erhard within the European Commumty and now the European Union. The common agricultural policy would never have survived had Erhard continued forever, nor would the inward lookingness that we have had in these GATT negotiations, which thankfully have been mainly overcome-and I acknowledge the work of John Dawkins and others on that. These things are against all Erhard's principles. Erhard's social market economy was a compassionate framework for the use of market forces for social good. That is why, I suppose, I have felt it to be a disadvantage when some inadequate versions of that have been tried and not been wholly successful. In Thatcherite Britain, for example, there was a certain Darwinian element to what was done; which I found unacceptable. Also, Reagan's macroeconomic policies, despite a number of very good things that were done, were disastrous. In the modem world, the closest one could get would be the policies of two very good friends of mine, Roger Douglas and Ruth Richardson in New Zealand. They are being used now by Vaclav Klaus in the Czech republic, bringing that communist s-ciety i?to a free market-but on a basis of social eqUIty. That is really the kind of framework that I have tried to work on. I have tried to convince my colleagues that before they do political trade-offs they should first analyse and first try to understand. After that, the political trade-offs are made. To be. too pure on the economics, as some early Treasury documents were, when we were trying to break down the tariff barriers, is to lose friends and simply not get there in any realistic sense. Coming into the parliament I found that it was a pretty lonely business trying to pursue this particular road and there were a couple of people in the cabinet who were sympathetic in this area. Certainly John Howard was leadirig those. John Hewson was working in John's office and was one of the strong forces in this regard-but it was pretty lonely elsewhere. We did not have the loneliness that Bert Kelly had when he was arguing against protection and being beaten over the ears by John MCEwen-but we had to search for friends. John Hyde, Peter Shack and I used to meet over cups of Chinese tea in my funny little office in a corridor leading down to the canteen in the old Parliament House. We used to try to work out how we could impr-ve debate in the coalition party room. I thlOk over a period we actually did. We had surreptitious support from certain cabinet ministers. We had a lot of support from outside bodies such as the Centre for Independent Studies, the IPA in Melbourne and so on. Gradually we believed we could have some movement in the policies of the coalition parties. When I first came into parliament both parties were essentially protectionist, both supporting the classic, original Deakin lab-ur movement compact of the early 1900s-which was a great social compact but it had become outdated. To us it was a question of how soon that would be understood and how soon the parties would be shifted away from th.at. Both parties have now moved away - rom It-bo-h major political groupings-in qUIte a dramatIc way. This change has been tremendous. We did not get much understanding or support from the Labor Party in those early days. I think Peter Walsh, John Kerin and John Button were three who were very sympathetic but, fortunately, when the Labor government came into office a band of people seemed to become converted to the necessity of moving Australia into a more competitive mode. A lot has been done. It has been very frustrating to be in opposiKeating) tion during this p-riod. It has been good to welcome changes as they have occurred. The big single change that still has to occur is in the labour market. Until we have freedom of contract in the labour market, until we break the monopoly position of the unions with coverage assured by somebody else on their behalf, we have not got to the heart of the matter. The Employment Contract Act in New Zealand has got the heart of the matter and I think it is a benchmark for the necessary reform. As a former industrial manager, I know what it is like to manage on the shop floor at successive levels, with small numbers of people and large numbers of people. To do it with compulsory third parties present is very much more difficult. The government will get half the reform it needs with enterprise bargaining in the collectivist way in which it is doing it but until it gets down to genuine freedom of contract and eliminates that monopoly power-it is not eliminating unions, it is merely making them compete for members-it has not got to the heart of that matter. I hope that that will be dealt with in the near future. The reform of public administration is another area that I have taken a great interest in. I have always been very concerned with the management of the public sector and I have to acknowledge again that great strides have been made in this area over the last 10 years. The minh;;ters have sertainly been supportive. The work of the public servants Mike Codd and Michael Keating. in this respect is quite noteworthy. Certainly the machinery of government is a lot better than it was 10 years ago. There is still a way to go but quite a lot has been done. The other area that worries me is the area of the parliament. I will not go on at great length about this. I welcome very much the report of my good friend the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) because I think that that starts us along the way. He has tried very hard to convince colleagues, I know from private discussions and so on, that something has to be done about this. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister (Mr and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) remarking about this. But the fundamental requirement in the parliamentand I gave what I thought was one fundamental requirement in the labour market-is that this chamber has to become a true legislative chamber. I do not think it will until it has committees examining legislation, including with public hearings, and until it has committees monitoring the performance of departments continuously and building up a corporate memory about the performance of those departments. The committees of this House are essentially creatures of the government. Legislation is not considered here at all. In this sense this chamber is almost worthless and the Senate is having to do a double job of both primary and secondary treatment. It is important that this House becomes a primary treatment area for legislation and that issues are properly aired and legislation cleaned up, including with public he,arings, before it goes across to the Senate. I know this horrifies many people in the executive, but I think that, with the nature of the Senate as it has come out over recent years, the Senate will be easier to deal with if it receives predigested legislation which has already had public hearings. It will be cleaner stuff to deal with and its role of review will be properly met. But at the moment it has to do everything in a great indigestible lump at the end of each session, and it is simply not working. I have published some material about parliamentary reform and, before I go silent as a totally non-political person in the Red Cross, let me once again draw attention to the very peculiar nature of this House. Just look around. If honourable members do not think it is peculiar they have a big problem. In fact, the simple realisation that it is very peculiar is a major turning point in one's thinking. Just about every other area of human activity, beginning with one's own family, is actually a combined exercise-male and female. I do not believe-and I say this as an ex-party secretary-that the parties themselves are going to be able to handle this internally. Just think through the practical problems of achieving a 50-50 representation across a series of individual member electortary ates under a party preselection system. Just think through how inequitable it would be.to go about that process. The Labor Party is struggling with this and certainly we have·had a lot of it in Victoria recently, with a great deal of pain for the leader down there. The Prime Minister has raised it at a national for the ALP. But the internal problems of achieving that through the party processes, I suggest, almost insuperable. But they also lead to severe denials of basic justice for both sexes on a geographical basis. If we think that through-I have not got time to go into now-then I think we will have to agree that this cannot be done through the parties. That is why after a very long period of worrying about this-it is something that I have wordisagreement ried about since I was state secretary back the 1970s-1 think it can be done only by legislative means, and I have put forward proposal to do that. It is very radical by most people's thinking but in fact if result-and I am talking about representation, not executive-of equal representation in the chambers it will have to be done legislatively. I do not think it needs constitutional change. I refer honourable members once again to the proposal I have put forward and ask them to have a close look at it. That would make an enormous difference to the culture of this place. All of the reasons for that I explained in articles, and I have one article yet to be published-posthumously, as it were-which will deal with this. I do not want to keep honourable members and generally. much longer. One thing I forgot to do was to thank Professor Wolfgang Kasper who is a long-term friend and ally, for acquainting with the work of the Freiburg school and the detailed history of Ludwig Erhard and I commend to the house Erhard's book ProsMay perity through Competition. Also, the .late Austin Holmes, whom Whitlam appointed to would his Priorities Review Staff, you might recallover not, I suspect, knowing quite what he was doing; but that was a wonderful thing for to do-had an enormous influence on my 12 thinking. I also want to thank Malcolm Fraser for having made me a minister. As a party secreI had it very good association with Malcolm Fraser. I also had a great admiration for Malcolm Fraser for his work in foreign affairs. On economic matters it is well known that we did not agree. It is interesting when we look back historically that Adenauer, who provided all the stability and predictability level that Erhard's eConomic framework required, in fact hated Erhard;s policies. Adenauer was a great interventionist-he was an old toryare and yet he allowed Erhard to pursue this very framework. Had Malcolm Fraser with his stature and all those sorts of things had the same relationship with John Howard then the it history of our economy might have been different. But that was not to be because Malcolm did want to interfere with economic matters and it was in those areas where I had with him. Nonetheless, he is a in very substantial .Australian and somebody that, in retrospect, I notice many members a opposite see more of the good in. Certainly his policies on Africa were bold, adventurous we want the and absolutely correct. I would like also to pay tribute to my predecessor in Mackellar. It is only twice in 44 years that the Mackellar seat is changing hands, and after 28 years it went from William Charles Wentworth to me, and now after 16 years it is almost certain, and absolutely certain in my view, to be going to the distinhave guished woman senator from New South Wales, Bronwyn Bishop, who is in the gallery. Bronwyn, I am sure, will represent that area well and will make a major contribution to the parliamentary life, both in this chamber I will not be able to go through all the me thanks to everybody, although there are so many I would love to mention. But I will not, and others have mentioned them before. John and I· are going out at the same time. That is great; he is a wonderful fellow. But I like to thank particularly my loyal staff the years-they have been absolutely wonderful-represented tonight here by Carrie him Elton who has been with me the longest, for years. 1Welve years on a person's staff is quite a long time. Finally, I thank my family and, above all, my wife, Diana. Di married a businessman 29 years ago, and she has spent 22 years with a politician. She has been wonderful,. and she has also been wonderful to others. She is higply respected in. the electorate. But also, you know, she had a major role in reactivating the spouses network because she f«1t very much about the difficulties for spouses in this really extraordinary life. That arose very much out of the extraordinarily difficult time she had in the first two years that I was here, and she decided to really do something about that. I think that has had a good effect and I hope it will be continued. So she has been a wonderful wife and we are looking forward very much to a life outside politics. Mr Speaker, I am proud to have served in this place. I am sure that John Hewson and his team-it is a very talented team-will be able· to do all the things that I have been doing for a long time, and I am sure they will do them better. I wish them every success in getting the line next time, and I am sure they wilL I am proud to have served here but also, Mr Speaker, I am looking forward to seeing you on 14 January.

209,Dr BLEWETT,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I will keep the House for only two or three minutes. As the. Prime Minister (Mr Keating) hinted, I will be returning t6 the House early next year and will have an opportunity to thank everyone then. But I would just like to acknowledge tonight-it would be remiss of me not to do so-the very generous things that have been said about me on both sides of the House. I must say, of course, for anyone else on this side of the House, if the Prime Minister had made a pre-emptive announcement of the kind he has made tonight it would be a matter of great an.guish and concern, but for me, of course, it is considerable encouragement. I remember in my, I suppose, rather arrogant and· optimistic young man's-or at least middle aged man's-maiden speech I ended with, 'Tomorrow belongs to us'. We had to wait some five years for that tomorrow in the Labor Party but I must say that in the 1980s we in the Labor Party were extraordinarily fortunate in the opportunities that were offered us. And it is an extraordinarily humbling experience for me, and I think all of those who served in the Hawke-Keating cabinets, that we have had greater opportunias ties than given to any other national Labor politicians in the lifetime of this country. And I am very thankful for that, and very humble about it. I would just also like to say of John Kerin, a colleague in cabinet who is leaving us: he was a wonderful cabinet colleague, not least because of that wry humour for which he is noted, but also for his caricatures. In the midst of an extraordinarily dull cabinet debate, suddenly this devilish portrait of one our colleagues would arrive before us with a little bubble indicating some comment on the intending debate. He also had a kind of spontaneous wit-I do not think he planned these things. I can remember many occasions, but the one most clearly in my mind is when we were arguing about the dairy plans. John was having a battle to get his dairy plan through. The Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, said, 'Look, John, this is an interesting plan but we've had a lot of critical comments from Jim Snow and Keith Wright, those agriculturalists'. And John replied spontaneously, 'Look, I've had enough of Snow Wright and the seven dairy plans'. These things relieved the cabinet and he was a great person to work with in that way. It is all, of course, recorded. I would just also like to say to Jim Carlton that I think he taught me how a minister should behave. He was health minister when I was shadow health minister and I have got to thank him for the courtesy, for the willingness to open up his department, for the readiness to provide information and for the way he treated a shadow minister as an alternative government minister. I hope that I learnt from him and I hope that I behaved in the same way to thy counterparts during the years in which I was a minister. All I want to say is to wish all my colleagues a happy Christmas, and I will see them in the new year. Honourable members applauding",135
210,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"May I just, on behalfof the House of Representatives, take this opportunity, briefly, to thank one or two people, some of whom have already been thanked. But I think that it is important that it again goes in Hansard. I would like to thank, on behalf of all members, those people that have contributed to the smooth operation of the parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) have referred to most so I will not traverse all of them, but I would also like to record my thanks personally to the President of the Senate for the relationship that we have established and to the Deputy Speaker and the deputy chairmen of committees who have filled in during this last seven months since the parliament has come together. I also thank the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard), the whips and, of course, the clerks. I can only echo the sentiments that all that have spoken this evening have expressed. There is somebody, in the person of Lyn Barlin, with whom you can immediately feel relaxed, and in my role it is something which has given me great confidence. I also extend the thanks of the parliament to the Serjeant-at-Arms, the whips and the secretaries and staff of the various departments with whom we deal on a regular basis. To those members that we are farewelling tonight, may I say that personally I will miss them all. I have, in the nine years that I have been here, come to know them all reasonably well. I had the great pleasure of serving John Kerin in the last parliament as his parliamentary secretary-but the photographs from Japan, John, will always remain buried! On behalf of the parliament we express our sincere best wishes to John May and to Jim Sproule. Much has been said about John and the work that he has done on our collective behalf for the past 111/2 years as transport manager. He has done it superbly. Some appropriate words were said to John the other evening. I again echo the ptofoundthanks of all of us for his work and dedication over a long period. Jim Sproule has given 26 years of excellent service to the parliament as a parliamentary security attendant. Jim, thank you very much, we are going to miss you. I will miss you opening the door when I come in of a morning or of an afternoon. We wish you all the best in your retirement. . Honourable members-Hear, hear! Honourable members applauding",136
211,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"On a less serious note, I have only one Christmas wish. My staff took out some statistics on questions because question time is so important to us all and honourable members have been commenting about it all afternoon. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was asked in this past session some 92 questions, the Prime Minister was asked some 85, and muggins here comes in third with some 49. My Christmas wish is: do not worry about it any more, just put them all on notice, because that is how I want to treat them in the future. On behalf of our parliamentary staff and on behalf of all members, I wish everybody a very happy and holy Christmas and a very happy festive season. I look forWard to seeing you all back here tomorrow morning. Question resolved in the affirmative.
