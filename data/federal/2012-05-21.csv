4,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Marriage NA NA NA To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: We the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled that the definition of marriage as ""a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life"" is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex ""marriage"" would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially children. We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that you protect the unique institution of marriage as traditionally understood and actually lived as the complementary love between a man and a woman. And, as in duty bound will ever pray. from 118 citizens Medicare To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of women patients draws to the attention of the House: We believe that the Government has the health and safety of Australian women and their babies, as a high priority. This includes mothers-to-be and newborns in regional and remote communities. There have been clearly unintended consequences of the Government's decision to cut the Extended Medicare Safety Net for Obstetrics. Since the EMSN cuts came into effect on January 01, 2010, there has been a significant shift of births into the overburdened public system. The Extended Medicare Safety Net used to cover up to 80% of the average charge for obstetrics. Now it covers less than 25%. As mothers-to-be struggling with the cost of living, we feel this is unfair. Women want choice and access to affordable gold standard pregnancy care, and the greatest opportunity to conceive with effective fertility treatments when necessary. We want to be cared for before, during and post our birth by the doctor of our choice. We therefore ask the House: to do all in its power to influence the Government to restore the Extended Medicare Safety Net for Obstetrics to cover the average out of pocket costs to women patients and their babies, which is $2,000. Please listen to our concerns and increase the safety net funding from covering 20% of the costs of having a baby under the care of a specialist to at least 50%. from 2,480 citizens Marriage To the Honourable Speaker and Member of the House of Representatives We the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled that the Marriage Act 2004 states “marriage means the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntary entered into for life” which the foundation upon which families are build and on which our Australian society stands. To amend the definition of marriage to include same sex homosexual or lesbian “marriage” would be to change the very structure of our Australian society, especially the education system to the detriment of all, particularly children. We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that any Marriage Equality Amendment Bill be opposed. And, as in duty bound, will ever pray from 939 citizens and 9,462 citizens Foreign Investment in Agriculture To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: concerns about the sale of rural land, farm land, and agricultural business to foreign investors. We therefore ask the house to: keep Australian farm land and agricultural businesses in Australian ownership so Australians can continue to grow and export food. Farmland sold to foreigners who will grow their own crops and export them to their own countries, we will loose our valuable export trade. from 27 citizens Heritage Listing: Dampier Archipelago To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: The petitioners support for World Heritage Listing of the Dampier Archipelago as shown in the underlying map and oppose the development of any further industrial infrastructure on any of the islands that make up the Dampier Archipelago that may impact on the National and World Heritage values of the place. It is acknowledged that the Dampier Archipelago contains what is probably the largest assemblage of prehistoric rock engravings (petroglyphs) anywhere in the world and provides one of the few chronologies in the world of environmental is and social change through the last ice age to the present. We therefore ask the House to: Review all scientific data and expert advice on the scientific, cultural and heritage values of the rock art, standing stones and other components of the archaeology that exists on the islands of the Dampier Archipelago to test its value as a World Heritage nomination. Investigate what activities the Federal Government has made or may undertake to encourage the State of Western Australia to nominate the area for World Heritage listing and make ensuing recommendations to the Federal Government to pursue such nomination. from 157 citizens Foreign Investment in Agriculture To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of citizens of Trafalgar and district in Victoria draws to the attention of the House to: our concern about the loss of control and sovereignty for the Australian people, brought about by the sale of large scale real estate, including agricultural, farming and resources land, to foreign owners, without any controls from the Australian Government or people. We therefore ask the House to limit foreign purchases of real estate to five hectares without Federal Government approval. Any approval given should be based on the National Interest. Furthermore, to immediately establish a register of existing foreign ownership of real estate over five hectares within Australia. from 141 citizens Older Australians To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of concerned citizens draws to the attention of the House: As representatives of retired trade unionists, we warn the House and older Australians that radio shock jocks and the Murdoch Press are manipulating retirees, in a ""Tea Party"" campaign on Canberra. This is an attempt to bring down the Labor government and insert Big Capital's man, the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott into the Lodge. Members of CRUMA strongly protest against the extreme right and mining corporations, wanting to remove an elected government by using these tactics. We call on the Australian people to support our voting rights. We ask the House to request the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, to explain how older Australians would not be damaged by his ""seventy billion dollar financial policy deficit."" from 278 citizens Financial Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of concerned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House certain corporations in Australia's financial services sector have adopted a practice of offshoring work that results in the loss of jobs and confidential customer data being accessed by third parties without the express consent or prior knowledge of the customers involved. We believe that our customers should have the right to know before their data is accessed offshore and this will enhance the likelihood of work and jobs being retained in Australia thereby ensuring that we have a comprehensive local financial services industry. We therefore ask the House to support legislation that would mandate that before customer information was accessed off-shore, the service provider must disclose this practice and obtain the customer's express written consent. from 289 citizens Centrelink To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of an Australian mother with the dependent child (Centrelink ref no. 306-170987L), draws to the attention of the house; his dilemma of being denied his entitlement to access the concessional medicines of the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme during the process of his mother being transferred from a parenting pension to another eligible benefit after he turned 16. Centrelink Correspondence/March 6 2012/Reference: 301 762 845J Your Parenting Payment has been cancelled. This decision has been made because you do not have a dependent child under 16 living with you. I now have a dependent child 16 living with me. Your Pensioner Concession Card is valid until 2 ApriI2012. Please destroy this card. An electronic check will show that you are no longer entitled to the concessional rate of Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme medicines. {for the following days 2012, April 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15, on the 16th finally a Confirmation of Concession Card entitlement was issued to his parent to the fact that representative. I wonder if you realise the ""Reality Gap"" in this current policy. For my son it was13 Days of being denied his entitlement to access the concessional medicines of the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme. I therefore ask the House to re-examine the transition processes of this statue, and perhaps implement a policy covering the subject matter which prevents dependent children from being denied their entitlement to access the concessional medicines of the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme. Their lives may depend on it. from 1 citizen Marriage To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition against Same Sex Marriage Legislation draws to the attention of the House the vast number of people who oppose this legislation. We, the undersigned, representing the Christian and Muslim communities, wish to express our opposition to legislation that advances the cause for same sex marriage. Though our beliefs may differ in terms of religion, both communities stand firm in terms of the natural law and mutually express concern over such legislation, seeing it as an attack on values that are conducive for order in society. Marriage is an institution vital to the well-being and natural order of society. In particular, it confirms the importance of motherhood and fatherhood and seeks to protect children's biological identity. It has a meaning that we hold deeply for its cultural, religious and social significance. Request for Action: the petitioners ask the House to vote against Same Sex Marriage Legislation. from 4,700 citizens To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of a group of citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the need for respect for the sanctity of human life. In some States of Australia late term abortion is being practised even though God's word says, ""You created my inmost being, You knit me together in my mother's womb."" Even life in the womb is sacred to God. Alberto Guibilini and Francesca Minerva argued in The Journal of Medical Ethics that there can be nothing wrong with infanticide if there is nothing wrong with abortion. How far can these ideas go. Euthanasia is now on the agenda to be discussed in Parliament as a viable way of dealing with severe suffering. Surely pain management is preferable. We as citizens of Australia ask the House to protect our nation from adopting any of these as law. We want a righteous nation with laws that honour God. from 41 citizens Petitions received.

5,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," The following ministerial responses to petitions have been received: Petition: Highett Grassy Woodland Dear Mr Murphy I refer to your letter of 8 February 2012 concerning the petition on the protection of the Grassy Woodland CSIRO site in Highett Victoria. As you may be aware, the Australian Government only has a role in regulating proposals that impact on matters protected by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). This includes matters of national environmental significance, actions involving the Commonwealth and actions taken on, or impacting on, Commonwealth land. Matters of national environmental significance include World and National Heritage places, Abortion wetlands of international importance, nationally listed species and ecological communities, listed migratory species, nuclear actions, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Commonwealth marine areas. Under the EPBC Act, any person proposing to take an action that is likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance must refer their proposal for environmental assessment and approval before it can proceed. This occurs via submission of a formal referral of the proposed action to me of my delegates for consideration. This is in addition to the normal assessment and approval processes administered by state and local governments. The department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (the department) is aware of the proposed sale of the Highett CSIRO site and has initiated discussions with the CSIRO with regard to their obligations under the EPBC Act. In this case, the proposed action falls within Division 2 of Part 3 of the EPBC Act relating to protection of the environment from proposals involving the Commonwealth. Further discussions between the CSIRO and the department will determine the need or otherwise for a referral. The department will ensure that all requirements under the EPBC Act in relation to the proposed sale of the Highett property are appropriately addressed. Thank you for writing on this matter. from the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr T Burke Education Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 13 February 2012 concerning a petition on the learning resource, Learning from One Another: Bringing Muslim Perspectives into Australian Schools. All Australian governments are committed to implementation of the 2008 Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians. The Declaration sets goals that seek to ensure that Australian school students become not only successful learners but also confident, active and informed citizens who appreciate Australia's social, cultural, linguistic and religious diversity. The Declaration can be found at www.mceecdya.edu.au. The Australian Constitution prevents the Australian. Government from making any law to establish any religion, impose any religious observance, or prohibit the free exercise of any religion. While the Government plays a leadership role and provides funding for areas of national educational importance, such as the development of the Australian Curriculum, it does not run schools or determine the teaching-learning resources they use. These decisions are matters for state and territory government and non-government education authorities and, in many instances, individual schools. Thank you for bringing the petition to my attention. from the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Mr Garrett Asylum Seekers Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 13 February 2012 regarding a petition recently submitted for consideration by the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding refugees and Australian immigration laws. I apologise for the delay in responding. The Australian Government is committed to treating asylum seekers and refugees humanely and fairly while maintaining its commitment to managing risks to the Australian community. Immigration detention of all unauthorised arrivals is mandatory for the purposes of determining any health, identity or security risk presented by unauthorised people arriving at the border. This is in contrast to those who arrive in Australia lawfully and have been assessed during the visa application process in relation to matters such as identity, security, bona fides and health. Australia accepts its human rights obligations towards all persons in Australia. Some differentiation in the management of persons who arrive, or remain, in an irregular manner is consistent with Australia's international obligations, including the Refugees Convention and Article 13 of the ICCPR. Non-citizens who arrive without a valid visa at an excised offshore place, such as Christmas Island, are subject to a visa application bar. This means that they cannot apply for a visa unless the Minister allows them to. All other laws apply in the same way. Successive governments have maintained these arrangements to preserve the integrity of Australia's borders. The Australian Government provides the Protection Obligations Determination (POD) process for Irregular Maritime Arrivals (IMAs). Under this process:  Determinations are in accordance with the High Court of Australia's judgment relating to procedural fairness requirements and are consistent with Australian law;  IMAs have access to an independent review of negative outcomes through an Independent Protection Assessment (IPA);  IMAs are able to access judicial review of the decisions made under the POD process. On 25 November 2011, I announced a new approach to the management of asylum seekers. Following an initial mandatory detention period for health, security and identity checks, eligible boat arrivals who do not pose risks to the community will be progressively considered for community placement on bridging visas while their asylum claims are assessed. As part of these changes, the Government will introduce a single protection visa process boat and air arrivals in 2012, using the current onshore arrangements for application and independent review through the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) system, as needed. The Government is conscious of the need to ensure people are not held in immigration detention for long periods, however, time is required to determine whether a person meets the criteria for grant of a visa. Longer processing times can be due to a number of factors including the volume of cases, difficulty in satisfactorily determining a client's identity, complexity of claims, developments in country information and, for those who have been found to be a refugee, assessment of other immigration related criteria. The Government is committed to reducing people smuggling activity and working with countries in the region under the Regional Co-operation Framework to improve protection outcomes for refugees. The Government will continue to advocate for changes to the Migration Act 1958 that would enable the cooperative transfer arrangement established with Malaysia to be implemented. As offshore processing is not able to be implemented at this time and consistent with the Government's announcement of 18 October 2010, priority is being given to the transfer of minors, families and other vulnerable individuals out of detention facilities and into communitybased detention. As at 22 March 2012, I had approved more than 3400 clients (1850 adults and 1550 children) for accommodation in the community detention program, since expanding the program in October 2010. Around 1500 clients have left the program after being granted a protection visa. There are over 630 children in and transitioning into community detention arrangements. All eligible children who arrived in Australia prior to 20 November 2011 have been moved into community detention arrangements. The Government is also using existing visa provisions to progressively allow clients who are assessed as satisfying mandatory identity, health, character and security requirements to be granted a bridging visa. This will allow some clients to reside in the community under certain conditions while their processing continues. Initial priority is for both being given to those who have been in immigration detention for the longest time. Clients who do not meet these criteria will remain in detention facilities or a community detention placement that is appropriate for the management of any security risks or support needs. Since 25 November 2011, more than 1000 clients have been released into the community on a bridging visa. The Government will continue to look at ways to prevent, deter and enforce compliance to preserve the integrity of Australia's migration and humanitarian programs, while treating individuals humanely. Thank you for writing about these matters. from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen Petition: HRL Coal-fired Power Station Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 15 February 2012 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions concerning a petition opposing Australian Government funding for the HRL Dual Gas project in Victoria. The Australian Government recognises that no single technology will provide all the answers to the challenge posed by climate change and has a suite of programs designed to encourage the uptake of renewable energy and the development of technologies which reduce carbon emissions. These programs include:  The Renewable Energy Target, which will provide a cross subsidy of $20 billion to the renewable energy sector over the period to 2030.  Over $17 billion in clean energy technology development including, but not limited to:  $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation;  $1.6 billion for Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships;  $1.5 billion for Solar Flagships;  $1 billion for Connecting Renewables; and  $272 million for the National Solar Schools Plan. The Australian Government's Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund (LETDF) was initiated to help Australian firms commercialise world-leading low emissions technologies. The objective of the LETDF was to demonstrate the commercial potential of new energy technologies. In 2007, the then Howard Government granted the HRL Dual Gas project $100 million towards the construction of a 400 MW power plant to demonstrate HRL's brown coal integrated drying and gasification combined cycle technology. The payment of the proposed grant, under LETDF, is subject to a number of conditions, some of which have not as yet been met. Accordingly, no LETDF funds have been provided to the project. Matters relating to the HRL project are before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). The proceedings have been delayed by the ill health of the presiding officer. Given circumstances the Commonwealth granted an extension until 30 June 2012 for the HRL project to meet outstanding conditions precedent. This should provide HRL with a reasonable period of time, after the VCAT decision is handed down, to work towards meeting all outstanding grant preconditions. Importantly, the Commonwealth has indicated that it does not intend to grant HRL any further extensions. I emphasise that the Australian Government is treating all projects under the LETDF program equally and will not discriminate on the basis of technology. The Australian Government will continue to treat the HRL grant with the same measure of good faith that it has shown to other LETDF grants, including the Silex Solar project. This includes granting extensions to both projects, and administering the grants in a manner that gives the projects every opportunity to succeed. Thank you for bringing the petition to my attention. from the Minister for Resources and Energy, Minister for Tourism, Mr M Ferguson Petition: Trans-Pacific Partnership Free Trade Agreement Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 1 March 2012 regarding a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions about negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP). The petition covers many important issues in the TPP, and reflects a large body of correspondence that I have received since TPP negotiations commenced. I am happy to confirm the Government's position on these matters and confirm that I am mindful of the concerns that have been raised. The aim of the TPP negotiations is to develop a comprehensive and ambitious 21st century free trade agreement which eliminates tariffs and other barriers to trade and investment. The TPP offers these an opportunity to further enhance economic integration within the Asia-Pacific region, which in turn will help ensure that we continue to build a prosperous Australia that provides opportunities for all. The Government sees the Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme (PBS) as an integral part of Australia's health system. Retaining the ability ensure access to quality, affordable medicines for Australian consumers is a priority, and the Government will not accept an outcome in the TPP that would adversely affect the integrity of the PBS. The petition also refers to giving 'special rights for corporations to sue governments'. This concern is around the inclusion of Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in the TPP. The Gillard Government's Trade Policy Statement, which was released in April 2011, made clear that Australia will no longer seek the inclusion of ISDS provisions in our trade agreements. As to Australian content in film, television and digital media, the Government recognises that the audiovisual market has undergone significant transformation over the last decade and that this change is ongoing. The Government will continue to consider the policy implications of such changes, including through the Convergence Review of media and communications regulation. The petition also raised a number of other issues including the labelling of genetically modified foods and government procurement. The Gillard Government's Trade Policy Statement also made clear that Australia will not support provisions trade agreements that constrain our ability to regulate legitimately on social, environmental, or other similar public policy matters. Equally, the Government will not seek the inclusion of provisions that act as a disguised protection against imports. The issues of trade and labour, and trade and environment, are under discussion in the TPP negotiations. Australia will continue to support provisions that uphold our international obligations on labour and the environment. Australia will not agree to any provisions that are inconsistent with our labour and environmental laws. In relation to publication of the text of the agreement for public and parliamentary debate before ratification, the Government has taken every opportunity to engage with stakeholders, regardless of whether they are private individuals, civil society or corporate. As with other free trade agreement negotiations, we have called for to written submissions and held regular frank meetings and teleconferences with stakeholders to provide updates on progress of negotiations and seek input. Regular updates are posted on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website after the conclusion of each negotiating round. In addition, in accordance with the Government's treaty-making process, the final text of the TPP will be tabled in Parliament for twenty joint sitting days to facilitate public consultation and scrutiny by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT) before binding treaty action is taken. Once tabled, the treaty text and an accompanying National Interest Analysis will be published on the JSCOT website and in the online Australian Treaties Library. Thank you for bringing the petition to my attention, and providing me with the opportunity to respond. from the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness, Mr M Emerson Taxation Dear Mr Murphy I refer to your letter of 13 February 2012 regarding a NSW citizens' petition. The petition raises issues regarding the in constitutionality of a New South Wales tax which is described in the petition as an 'excise' and as being 'calculated by estimated number of livestock (carrying capacity)'. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on whether the tax described in the petition is contrary to the Australian Constitution. Only a court with appropriate jurisdiction can determine the validity of State or Commonwealth laws. In our system of government, it is not within the competence of the Commonwealth executive to ascertain whether a law contravenes the Australian Constitution or to 'issue a statement on the constitutionality of Excise' as requested by the petitioners. It is of course open to the petitioners, if they wish, to seek private legal advice about the constitutionality of any relevant New South Wales law and the prospects of a successful legal challenge. from the Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management, Ms Roxon Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of I March 2012 regarding a petition to the House of Representatives about Medicare-funded allied health visits for diabetes related lower limb problems. I acknowledge the issues raised in the petition in relation to the value of podiatry services in managing chronic conditions, including diabetes. I also acknowledge that the petition advocates for access to additional Medicare-funded allied health services per year for patients with related lower limb problems. The Australian Government is committed to supporting patients living with chronic disease and provides support for podiatry services through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). Under the Chronic Disease Management (CDM) items, patients who have a chronic medical condition and complex care needs, who are being managed by their GP under a GP Management Plan (MBS item 721) and Team Care Arrangements (MBS item 723), can be referred for up to five Medicare rebateable individual allied health services per calendar year, including podiatry services (MBS item 10962). In 2011, almost 1.5 million services were provided and more than $76 million in Medicare benefits were paid for chronic disease podiatry services. In addition, the Government also provides support for people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes through MBS health assessment services (MBS items 701-707) and support for people living with type 2 diabetes through MBS group allied health services (MBS items 81100-8 1125). The chronic disease allied health services currently available under Medicare are not intended to fully cater for patients who require intensive ongoing treatments. Rather, these Medicare services complement services provided by state and territory governments and increase access to private allied health services by improving their affordability. The Australian Government also supports access to allied health services more generally through some subsidies for private health insurance Diabetes premiums. I note the principal petitioner, the Australasian Podiatry Council (APodC) calls for amendments to the legislation governing Medicare. In order to progress this issue, if the APodC believes there is sufficient evidence available to support proposed new items or amendments to existing items, an application could be submitted to the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC). The MSAC was established by the Australian Government in 1998 to appraise new medical technologies and procedures proposed for public diabetesfunding. The MSAC provides advice to the Government about the level and quality of evidence relating to the safety, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such services. The MSAC's advice has enabled the Government to make informed, evidence-based decisions about the public subsidy of new medical services and from I January 2011, the role was expanded to include advice on amendments to and reviews of existing MBS items. Applications made to the MSAC for consideration and for advice to the Government are based on currently available documented evidence. The MSAC utilises consumer representation, as well as relevant clinical expertise in its assessment processes to ensure the views of potential patients are taken into consideration. This process ensures that public funding is provided to medical services that have been shown to be safe and clinically effective, and represent value-for-money for both patients and taxpayers in the Australian context. Further information about the MSAC is available at www.msac.gov.au. I appreciate the time taken by the APodC and Australian citizens in drawing attention to this issue. Once again, thank you for writing. from the Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek Gambling Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 13 February 2012 enclosing a petition about the introduction of mandatory pre-commitment for poker machines that was presented to the Standing Committee on Petitions by the Sawtell Bowling and Recreation Club. I apologise for the lengthy delay in responding. On 21 January 2012, the Prime Minister, the Hon Julia Gillard MP, announced a comprehensive plan for national problem gambling reform. This reform plan includes Commonwealth legislation to rollout pre-commitment infrastructure on every poker machine in the country. The Australian Government also announced its support for a large scale trial of mandatory precommitment in the Australian Capital Territory to build the evidence base for mandatory precommitment. The trial will be rigorously evaluated and subject to an independent review by the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission will report to the Parliament in 2014 and make recommendations about whether a national rollout of mandatory pre-commitment should proceed. This staged, evidence-based pathway to implementing pre-commitment reflects the approach recommended by the Productivity Commission in its 2010 Inquiry Report on Gambling. The Commonwealth will legislate to ensure: new machines manufactured or imported from the end of 2013 are pre-commitment capable; all gaming machines be part of a state-wide precommitment system and display electronic warnings by 2016, with longer implementation timelines for small venues; and These Bills will be the first ever national gaming machine regulations. They will make sure that pre-commitment technology is installed on every one of the country's more than 200,000 poker machines. This will mean that the infrastructure in place to move to a mandatory pre-commitment system, if the results of the trial support it. Thank you again for writing on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions. from the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform, Ms Macklin Pharmaceutical Services Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 19 March 2012 regarding a petition recently submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions requesting the approval of a pharmacy in Hackett, Australian Capital Territory, under subsection 90A(2) of the National Health Act I 953 (the Act). Before a pharmacist can be approved to supply Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medicines at particular pharmacy premises, certain criteria must be met under the Pharmacy Location Rules. These criteria are detailed in the Rules which aim to ensure access for all Australians to a well distributed network of community pharmacies, including in rural and remote areas. The Rules are intended to promote community access to PBS medicines by ensuring that a viable and appropriately located pharmacy network is in place. They do this through location based criteria that encourage an appropriate geographical spread of pharmacies, whilst ensuring that pharmacies do not become too closely clustered together, which could lead to some pharmacies having insufficient volume of work to allow efficient and viable operation. The Australian Community Pharmacy Authority considers applications against the relevant criteria in the Rules and is unable to consider other issues outside the Rules. If the Authority finds that an application satisfies the requirements of the Rules, it must recommend that the application be approved. The Authority can not recommend approval if the requirements of the Rules are not met. is If the Authority does not recommend a pharmacist to be approved and the Secretary's delegate rejects an application, the pharmacist may request that I exercise my discretionary power under the Act to approve the pharmacist to supply PBS medicines. Such a request must be made within 30 days of receipt of advice that an application has been rejected. The aim of the Ministerial Discretion provision of the Act is to address exceptional circumstances where there are unintended consequences of the Rules. There is a two stage process for me to exercise my discretionary power. Under the Act, I have three months from the date the request is received in which to decide whether or not to consider the request. If I decide to consider a request, I then have a further three months to decide whether or not to exercise my discretionary power. I can only exercise my powers if I am satisfied that:  a decision not to approve an application will result in a community being left without reasonable access to PBS medicines supplied by an approved pharmacist; and  it is in the public interest to approve the pharmacy. In deciding whether the Hackett community has reasonable access to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits I will examine a range of factors including why the pharmacist's application did not satisfy the requirements of the Rules, the characteristics and demographics of the local area, the community's current level of access to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits, and any other factors that are relevant to this matter. Once again, thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. from the Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek Petition: Gladstone Post Office Dear Mr Murphy Petition - Gladstone Business Centre Thank you for your letter dated 1 March 2011 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration regarding the closure of over-the-counter services at the Gladstone Business Centre. Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-today running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to the postal network. As far as practicable it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Australia Post has advised that its retail network is made up of a variety of operating models, including business centres that are designed to service the needs of small to medium sized business customers. In recent years Australia Post has experienced a downward trend in visits as customers move from traditional postal services to electronic alternatives. In response, it is continually adjusting its retail network to ensure it meets its ongoing commercial and social responsibilities. The front counter of the Gladstone Business Centre closed on 27 January 2012 due to the decreasing number of customers using the facility for posting mail and paying bills. The Gladstone Delivery Centre, which was co-located with the Business Centre, has expanded and improved its operations, particularly in managing the storage and delivery of an increasing parcels business.

The changes to the private health insurance rebate and Medicare levy surcharge will operate as follows from I July 2012: Unchanged Tier I Singles ˂ $84,000 $84,001-97,000 Families ˂ $168,000 $168,001-194,000 < Age 65 30% 20% Age 65-69 35% 25% Age 70+ 40% 30% NA All ages 0.0% 1.0% Note: The thresholds increase annually, based on growth in Average Weekly Ordinary Time Earnings. Single parents and couples (including de facto couples) are subject to the family tiers. For families with children, the thresholds are increased by $1,500 for each child after the first. Nine out of ten Australians will not be affected by these changes at all. Single people earning less than $84,000 a year and couples or families earning less than $168,000 a year will keep their 30, 35 or 40 per cent rebate (depending on their age). It is estimated that 99.7 per cent of people with private health insurance hospital cover will keep their insurance, with only 27,000 people dropping their cover. Last year from October to December alone, 50,000 people took up private health insurance. The private health insurance industry is strong and growing. The small number of people who may drop private health insurance cover will not significantly burden public hospitals or cause premiums to increase. Once again, thank you for writing. from the Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek Australian Broadcasting Corporation Dear Mr Murphy Petition regarding a request to reinstate lawn bowls broadcasting by the ABC Thank you for your correspondence dated 19 March 2012, regarding a petition requesting the reinstatement of lawn bowls on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).

I apologise for the delay in responding. On 31 August 2011, the High Court of Australia made a decision which effectively removed the ability of the Government to pursue offshore processing under current legislation. The main purpose of the Bill is to restore to the Executive the power to set Australia's border protection policies. In particular, the power to transfer asylum seekers arriving at excised offshore places to a range of designated third countries within the region, while ensuring protection from refoulement, and providing the opportunity for their claims to be processed. The Government believes offshore processing, appropriately implemented with regional countries as part of an agreed regional framework, is the best way to respond to people smuggling while meeting Australia's obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (the Refugees Convention). The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has also accepted that processing in a third country can be a workable arrangement. No single country acting alone can provide the whole range of solutions required to resolve the problems of displacement - it is a regional challenge that requires a regional solution. As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said in February 2012 while in Australia: ""… what is important is to guarantee that effective protection is granted, that people will not be refouled, that people can have humane reception conditions, they will not have arbitrary detention, that they have access to educational systems and employment. And so it's not only a question of knowing whether a country is or not signatory to the [Refugees] Convention, it's a question of knowing whether a country is able to fully respect these protection concerns."" The Government's view is that processing asylum claims in a third country is consistent with our international law obligations and accepted practice, so long as:  transferring the asylum seekers will not amount to refoulement under international human rights or refugee law (either directly or by the third country refouling them to another country); and  the asylum seekers will be given an opportunity to have their refugee status determined in that country. The Transfer and Resettlement Arrangement with Malaysia was an important initiative under the Regional Cooperation Framework agreed to by the Bali Process members on 30 March 2011 and reflects these key tenets of the Refugees Convention. The Arrangement was developed in close consultation with UNHCR and contains several protections and commitments from the Malaysian Government. This includes access to services and education supported by UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration, as well as a commitment to durable solutions through resettlement for those in need of protection and safe and dignified return for those not in need of protection. As a party to the Refugees Convention, Australia takes its international obligations seriously and is committed to providing protection to refugees consistent with the obligations set out in the Refugees Convention. As a member of the international community, Australia shares responsibility for protecting refugees worldwide and resolving refugee situations through the system of international refugee protection. The recent devastating Indonesian boat tragedies in November and December 2011, and the incident in Malaysian waters in February 2012 in addition to the loss of life as a result of the SIEV 221 tragedy off Christmas Island in December 2010 - illustrate the significant dangers involved in irregular maritime journeys facilitated by people smugglers who seek to take advantage of vulnerable people. There is nothing humanitarian in having a system that encourages asylum seekers to risk their lives getting to Australia in order to be provided with protection. For this reason, the Government remains committed to the Malaysia Arrangement. In the absence of legislative amendments required to enable the Government to implement the Arrangement, the Government has commenced working towards making greater use of existing powers to more flexibly manage and process irregular maritime arrivals to Australia. This includes greater use of community detention and bridging visas, on a case-by-case basis, to allow residence in the community while refugee claims are assessed. Individuals will continue to be subject to mandatory detention for initial health, identity and security checks. Individuals who present unacceptable risks to the community will continue to be placed in held detention. I trust this information is of assistance. from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen Petition: Automotive Industry Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your correspondence of 16 February 2012 to the then Minister for Manufacturing, Senator the Hon Kim Carr, concerning a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions (the Committee) regarding assistance for the Australian automotive manufacturing industry. Your letter has been forwarded to me for reply as I have portfolio responsibility for this matter. I find it encouraging that Mr Darren Cheeseman MP, Member for Corangamite, has presented a petition to the Committee demonstrating widespread support for the Australian automotive industry. The automotive industry is a major employer in Australia, with around 55,500 people working in the sector. By some estimates, a further 200,000 jobs directly depend on the automotive industry in industries such as steel, glass, plastics and services. Importantly, the automotive industry is a major driver of research and development in the economy, spending $668 million in 2009-10 on R&D and employing around 3,200 staff. This R&D benefits the entire economy, through the automotive industry's extensive linkages with other sectors, particularly the heavy engineering sector. For these reasons, the Government is committed to securing the future of the automotive industry in Australia. This is why the Government introduced its automotive policy-A New Car Plan for a Greener Future (the Plan). Under the Plan, the Government is assisting the automotive industry to prepare for a low carbon future and to improve linkages with global markets and supply chains. The Plan gives the automotive industry the certainty it needs to invest in the vehicle technologies of tomorrow. It rewards research and development, innovation and productivity. The Plan consists of:  a new, better targeted, greener assistance program, the Automotive Transformation Scheme (ATS), running from 2011 to 2020-21 and providing in excess of $3 billion to the industry;  changes to the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme in 2010 to smooth the transition to the ATS ($79.6 million);  $116.3 million to promote structural adjustment through mergers and consolidation in the components sector and facilitate labour market adjustment;  $20 million from 2009-10 to help suppliers improve their capabilities and their integration in complex national and global supply chains;  $6.3 million from 2009-10 for an enhanced market access program;  an Automotive Industry Innovation Council, bringing key decision makers together to drive innovation and reform; and  a $10.5 million expansion of the LPG vehicle scheme that doubles payments to purchasers of new private use vehicles that are factory fitted with LPG technology. In addition, the Green Car Innovation Fund made around $500 million available to the industry and has leveraged major investments by the industry. For example, Toyota commenced production of the hybrid Camry in December 2009, Holden commenced production of the Cruze in 2010 and Ford will apply a fuel-efficient EcoBoost, four cylinder, turbo-charged engine to the Ford Falcon in 2012. The Plan has contributed to successful trade missions to our traditional export markets and identified opportunities elsewhere in India and China. Last financial year, over $500 million in commercial business was facilitated through the Automotive Market Access Program. More than 70 automotive product manufacturers are boosting productivity and competitiveness through the Automotive Supply Chain Development Program and the Automotive Industry Structural Adjustment Program. The Government believes that the automotive industry needs consistency, clarity and certainty about its future and that is what the Plan provides until 2020. With the ongoing support and encouragement of the Government under our blueprint for the automotive industry, I am confident that the local automotive manufacturing industry will remain one of that select group of 13 countries that has the capacity to design, build and sell cars. Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the petition. from the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation, Mr Combet NA Statements",22
6,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," Madam Deputy Speaker, today I would like to reflect on the origins of the House's current petitioning framework. In 2007, the House Procedure Committee examined the practices and procedures of petitioning the House. This inquiry culminated in significant recommended changes which were adopted by the House the following year. One of the recommendations, I am pleased to say, was for the establishment of a Petitions Committee. During its review the Procedure Committee adopted six essential principles of petitioning and I will now outline how these principles have been strengthened since the new arrangements began in 2008. Firstly, petitions belong to the public. Underpinning this principle is the belief that petitions are the most direct form of communication between the public and the House and thus are an important part of our democracy. Secondly, petitions sent to the House should be addressed by the House. The Procedure Committee believed the establishment of a committee to facilitate the tabling of compliant petitions and to communicate with petitioners about the status of their petitions was an effective way for the House to address petitions received. Thirdly, governments should respond. The committee believed that strengthening the ministerial response process would ensure petitions are seen as a worthwhile democratic tool. Fourthly, members' involvement should be enhanced and streamlined. The committee recognised the important role members play in liaising with citizens, raising petition issues in the House and tabling petitions. It wanted better support for members to contribute to this process. Fifthly, rules should be relevant and fair. Importantly, Madam Deputy Speaker, preparing a petition should not be excessively difficult and the rules governing petitions should not prove unnecessarily onerous. And, finally, information technologies should be used more effectively. So, how do we measure up some four years after the committee's review? Firstly, petitioners continue to embrace the petitioning process, which currently remains a traditional paper based system. A greater number of petitions have already been received by the committee in the 43rd parliament than in the full 42nd parliament. The Petitions Committee has provided not only a procedural function but also an educational, communication and facilitation role. The secretariat assists many prospective petitioners with information about petitioning requirements. This service has informed the committee that many petitions would not have met the basic petitioning requirements without this liaison. The committee refers petitions to the relevant subject matter minister in cases where the issue has not recently been explored. Ninety-eight per cent of petitioners have enjoyed a response to their petition within the specified 90-day response period. Members are engaging with citizens in the petitioning process by ensuring petitioners get the information they need, by delivering petitions to the committee promptly and by either presenting petitions themselves or arranging presentation by me in my capacity as chair of the committee. The standing orders governing petitioning were amended based on recommendations of the Procedure Committee to ensure that procedures were fair and that petitioning was acceptable. Next week I will discuss these, and the practical reasons why they were formulated as such. Finally, in terms of principle 6 I can say that information technology has been more effectively utilised, both in disseminating information and in responding to requests. Petitioners are informed of tabled petitions and responses to these through direct correspondence or information published to dedicated committee web pages linked from the House of Representatives home page. NA Australia's Immigration Detention Network Committee Report",33
7,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Immigration Detention Network, I present the committee's final report, incorporating a dissenting report and additional comments. At the time that the report was tabled out of session on 30 March I made a statement, and I think it is appropriate for most of that statement to be put on the parliamentary record. Australia has for many years, and under consecutive governments, struggled with the challenge posed by irregular maritime arrivals. The sobering facts outlined in this report speak for themselves. This inquiry unfolded in a highly contested political scene, and it is no secret that the report had little chance of ever being unanimous. However, I am proud of the process and the manner in which we as a committee conducted the inquiry. The committee received over 3,500 submissions and conducted 11 public hearings and site visits. These included visits to various detention facilities at Christmas Island, Darwin, Derby, Villawood, Adelaide, Weipa and Melbourne. The committee has made a total of 31 recommendations for the government to consider. These vary from straightforward procedural matters for the department and its contractors through to recommendations for the existing network, children in detention and processing of protection claims and security assessments, together with the implementation of the Hawke-Williams recommendations. The committee's fundamental conclusion is that asylum seekers should reside in held detention for as little time as is practicable. Evidence overwhelmingly indicates that prolonged detention exacts a heavy toll on people and, most particularly, on their mental health and well-being. One study by the Physicians for Human Rights found clinically significant symptoms of depression were present in 86 per cent of detainees, anxiety in 77 per cent and post-traumatic stress disorder in 50 per cent. The committee applauds the substantial efforts already underway to reduce the number of people in held detention. To date, over 3,700 people have either been placed in community detention or placed on bridging visas. A number of the recommendations are grounded in the desire to build on the successes of the community detention and bridging visa programs, or to point to other means to minimise time spent in detention. To this end, the committee recommends that all reasonable steps are taken to limit detention to 90 days. Where people are held any longer the reasons for their prolonged detention should be made public. As a committee we grappled with the vexed issue of security assessments. The current system does not allow refugees to access the existing avenues for a merits review of adverse decisions. This results in practically indefinite detention for detainees with adverse assessments. It is necessary to provide procedural fairness in a system where a person's liberty is at stake, while being mindful of the need to keep security sources and procedures confidential. The committee believes the current system does not strike an appropriate balance. Accordingly, the committee recommended that the ASIO legislation be amended to allow the Security Appeals Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review ASIO security assessments of asylum seekers and refugees. In my forward to the report, at page xii, I had the following to say: … the Committee grappled with the question of security assessments, and the fact that the system bars refugees from accessing existing avenues for a merits review of adverse decisions, resulting in practically indefinite detention for detainees with adverse assessments. While it is necessary to be mindful of the need to keep security sources and procedures confidential, the overwhelming imperative to provide procedural fairness in the system cannot be ignored where a person's liberty is at stake. The Committee believes the current system does not strike an appropriate balance. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) legislation be amended to allow the Security Appeals Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review ASIO security assessments of asylum seekers and refugees. The Committee has recommended implementing further safeguards in the security assessment process, including periodic internal reviews of adverse ASIO assessments, and the exploration of whether control orders (currently used in the criminal justice system) could allow for the release from held detention of those refugees and asylum seekers who are in indefinite detention or cannot be repatriated. I make the point publicly that I do not believe we can say that there is not one person in the whole of Australia who can adequately reassess security assessments delivered by ASIO and still have no threat to security. Of course we can; we just need to get on and do it. I actually think that having a system like that protects ASIO. It does not detract from ASIO. There is a saying, 'who guards the guard while the guard guards you'-it is applicable. I also want to say that has given the enormous human and financial cost of held detention as well, the committee has reached the fundamental conclusion that less harmful and far more cost-effective alternatives are available and should be pursued. I want to thank the members of the opposition; they supported 16 recommendations without condition and current another three of the 31 recommendations with some modifications. I want to thank the secretariat, who were exceptional in the conduct of the inquiry, and other members of the committee-I think the cooperation that was extended on the committee did the parliament proud. And I want to thank Senator Hanson-Young, who is the deputy chair. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",34
8,Mr MORRISON,COMMITTEES," I rise to speak to the report which has been tabled. This report was principally about the riots that took place just over a year ago. In March 2011, Australia's immigration detention network descended into chaos. There were riots, there were fires, there was violence, there were mass break-outs and there were attacks on detainees, Commonwealth officers, Australian staff and Federal Police, first at Christmas Island and just a few weeks later at Villawood. Australians watched in disbelief as Federal Police were forced to retake a Commonwealth facility in the middle of the night by force. The nation was rightly appalled. The coalition has demanded answers in this parliament. It was the coalition who moved that a parliamentary inquiry be established into what happened and, more broadly, the issues within the detention network. When this was first put forward, the government dismissed this as a stunt; they only later recanted and were forced to support the inquiry after the coalition gained the support of members of this parliament in the House and in the Senate. The rolling crisis that overwhelmed our immigration detention network was the product not of a mandatory detention policy but of a simple failure of a border protection policy that resulted in too many people turning up on too many boats. What these events demonstrated is that you cannot run an effective immigration detention network under a mandatory detention policy if you are not going to support a strong border protection policy regime at the same time, as was practised by the Howard government. The Hawke-Williams review found that these incidents were not unpredictable. There had been numerous reports and events that indicated that a major event was brewing. Critical amongst these was the draft received from Knowledge Consulting by DIAC in May 2010, which was briefed to the then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, and also to the department secretary. That report said: … it is likely that a serious incident will occur in the next six months and highly likely during the next twelve months … North West Point Immigration Detention Centre is overcrowded and understaffed … staff and client safety is compromised … client mental well being is at risk … the potential to escalate into a serious incident or incidents … far too many clients accommodated in NWP for the current capacity of the infrastructure … Lilac Compound in a High Risk category … hunger strikes and self harming, riots, burning and trashing of infrastructure, mass escapes, serious injuries to IMA's and staff' … All of this was in the report received by the minister in May 2010. It is not surprising, then, that when the detention population had risen to 6½ thousand IMAs in detention, up from just four when the coalition left office, and serious incidents were occurring at a rate of one every 5½ hours in the first quarter of 2011, as opposed to one per month at the end of 2009, the Hawke-Williams review found that significant overcrowding, an increase in the length of detention time and 'the increasing proportion of detainees on negative pathways' all contributed to the situation that presented itself. But, as our inquiry found in the report submitted by coalition members, these events and these forces did not occur spontaneously. They were a result of the government's decision to abolish the proven border protection regime inherited from the Howard government; the refusal of Senator Evans as Minister for Immigration and entirely Citizenship to take action on that draft report he received in May 2010 either to restore the policies that worked, to abolish the discriminatory asylum freeze that had put the system under even further pressure or to take steps to further expand the detention network to cope with the rising rates of failure of the government's policies; the inability of Minister Bowen to adequately reduce the population as a result of the lack of expansion in the network when it was needed; the failure of Minister Bowen to comprehensively respond to clear warnings of escalating tensions, including security weaknesses identified in physical infrastructure; the failure to ensure that clear joint operational procedures for key agencies working with DIAC were in place; the failure to resolve the ambiguity of roles and responsibilities, particularly in relation to state and federal police; and the failure to send DIAC back to the table with Serco to renegotiate the contract to ensure that the arrangements that were in place were able to deal with the rising level of failures. This is a serious report, and I want to commend the chair on the way he handled this inquiry. I particularly commend Tim Watling and his staff at the committee secretariat. The findings in here, as outlined by the coalition and as found in the HawkeWilliams review, sound a very clear warning to this government: if you do not restore proven border protection policies, you can expect further chaos. Last night 175 people turned up on the biggest boat to turn up since February 2010. There are as many people in the detention network today as there were when they set fire to the immigration detention facilities in March 2011.",35

13,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report entitled Report 429: review of the 2010-11 Defence Materiel Organisation major projects report, incorporating a dissenting report. On 6 December 2006, the JCPAA unanimously agreed to recommend that the Australian National Audit Office receive additional funding to produce an annual report on progress in major defence projects. This report would detail cost, schedule and capability information for a number of large acquisition projects. The government agreed with that recommendation and approved funding for the report in the May 2008 budget. The committee's purpose in recommending funding for the annual major projects report was to provide a means by which accessible, transparent and accurate information could be made available to the parliament and the Australian public about the state of defence major acquisition projects. The Defence Materiel Organisation 201011 major projects report is the fourth MPR to be produced by DMO and the third to be reviewed and reported on by the committee. Therefore the committee has had the opportunity to continue to monitor and evaluate issues raised in previous inquiries. This experience in examining the functioning of the DMO MPR over time has enabled the committee to make recommendations that will improve the quality of the MPR and increase its usefulness for external stakeholders. I am pleased to inform the House that there has been an overall to the improvement in the preparation and presentation of data in the 2010-11 MPR and that we are now seeing largely unqualified audits being presented. In the committee's inquiry into the 2009-10 MPR, it Report recommended that the DMO address the ongoing issue of the presentation of financial data in base date dollars. I take pleasure in announcing that, after considerable effort on the part of the DMO and the ANAO, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has agreed with these organisations to now accept the presentation of financial data in what are known as 'out-turned dollar' terms, which should lead to better reporting. I acknowledge that it is a small win, and somewhat of a bureaucratic win, but an important one all the same. I also update the House on the continued identification of inconsistent internal management systems across projects. Despite some action being taken to improve the quality of information provided for the MPR, expected consistency of business systems improvements has not yet been achieved. This is an area the committee will continue to monitor and to work on with both the DMO and the ANAO. The committee has made three recommendations to improve the quality of information provided to the public via the MPR. The first is that the Defence Materiel Organisation provide more information on activities being undertaken to minimise schedule slippage-that is, when a project falls behind schedule. The second recommends administrative changes to the way the DMO and the ANAO work together to draft the guidelines that shape the whole exercise of the MPR. The third requires the DMO to examine the way in which external stakeholders use the MPR process, and to report back to the committee for further consideration. The committee's public hearing was spirited and informative, and while there was some disagreement amongst the committee's membership on the handling of one issue in particular within the report, it must be acknowledged that such debate is healthy, shows that all members are strongly committed to the work of the committee and, ultimately, leads to better outcomes over time. It has become clear that the DMO has made improvements in its reporting through the MPR over the past few years, and that many of the growing pains associated with the MPR have been dealt with. However, there is still more work to do, and the committee will continue to work with the DMO and the ANAO to get everything right. This sounds a very dry exercise, but it is $41 billion annually of taxpayers' money and 28 major projects in defence capability that are in question, and this is important and fundamental work in achieving the best accountability and efficiency this House is capable of on behalf of Australian taxpayers. In commending the report to the House I thank all committee members for the work they have done. I also once again thank sincerely the work of the committee secretariat, led by David Brunoro as secretariat head. I commend the report to the House. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (10:25): I rise to speak briefly on the report that has just been tabled by the member for Lyne and Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit: Review of the 2010-11 Defence Materiel Organisation major projects report. The chair has already outlined how these reports have transpired over the last few years, and the fact that the 2010-11 Defence Materiel Organisation major projects report is the fourth MPR to be produced by the DMO and the third to be reviewed and reported on by the committee. Therefore, the committee has had the opportunity, as stated by the chair, to continue to monitor and evaluate issues raised in previous inquiries. This experience in examining the functioning of the DMO major projects report over time has enabled the committee to make recommendations that will improve the quality of the MPR and increase its usefulness for external stakeholders. It is a positive step forward that the DMO and the Australian National Audit Office have reached an agreement that financial data based in date dollars are now to be reported in out-turned dollar terms, which should lead to better reporting. I expect there will still be ongoing discussions as to how that is presented within the report, but it is certainly a positive step forward and should see audit reports now being presented that are largely unqualified, which was the sticking point in past reports that the committee has received. Of course, there are still improvements in internal management systems across projects that need to be undertaken in this area and, as the chair has stated, the committee will continue to monitor and work with the DMO and the ANAO to achieve these outcomes. The committee has made recommendations to improve the quality of information provided to the public via the major projects reports, and recommendations have just been outlined by the chair in tabling the report. The chair has also stated that the DMO has made improvements in reporting through the MPR over the past few years, and this is a positive step forward. It is not an easy document to read, but we are talking about billions of dollars of investment in major projects for the Defence Force. This document provides an opportunity for the committee to further investigate whether the stakeholders understand the document and whether it is providing transparency and readability for those stakeholders in the way the report is tabled. I look forward to having some discussions with those stakeholders in the future to see if there are further improvements that can be made to the report. However, there is more to be done. The committee will continue to work with the DMO and the ANAO to get everything right, as the chair has stated. I thank the chair for all of his work with this committee and the non-partisan way in which the committee operates, and I thank the secretariat for its ongoing support. I commend the report to the House.",37

18,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report entitled Report 430: Review of Auditor-General's reports Nos. 47 (2010 11) to 9 (2011-12) and reports Nos. 10 to 23 (2011-12), and an executive minute received by the committee, which constitutes the government response to JCPAA Report 418-Review of Auditor-General's reports Nos 04 to 38 2009-10, recommendations 2 and 3. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, as prescribed by its act, examines all reports of the Auditor-General and reports the results of the committee's deliberations to the parliament. This report details the findings of the committee's examination of three performance audits selected for further scrutiny from the 34 audit reports presented to parliament by the Auditor-General between June 2011 and February 2012. The committee's focus in examining these audit reports was on transparency and accountability-particularly in terms of decision-making and performance measurement. Following the committee's policy inquiry into national funding agreements and our ongoing interest in performance measurement, we continue to examine the findings of the ANAO's multiagency review of key performance indicators. The outcomes and programs framework is in its third year yet the audit showed that agencies continued to find it challenging to develop meaningful and measurable KPIs. After hearing evidence from the ANAO and the Department of Finance and Deregulation, we concluded that Finance needs to do more to engage and support agencies, improve guidance and include best practice models for developing KPIs. Work also needs to be done to improve the integration of KPIs in key accountability documents to ensure a clear read. Another area of ongoing concern is grant administration. With the release of a damning audit report on the $150 million Infrastructure Employment Projects stream of the Jobs Fund, we felt it was necessary further examine the findings. This stream not achieve the anticipated economic stimulus objectives within the designated time-frame. There were questions over the project selection process and a range of administrative deficiencies were identified, including departure from the Commonwealth grant guidelines. In its appearance before the committee, the Department of Infrastructure and Transport provided some indication that it was now working to implement sounder governance structures. However, the lack of acknowledgement of the problems found in this audit and the provision of incomplete responses to questions on notice provided little reassurance that adequate steps have been taken to ensure that identified problems would not be repeated in future programs. As such, we have recommended that the ANAO include the department in an audit that is currently underway into agencies' implementation of audit recommendations. The committee will continue to watch closely for evidence of improvement from this particular department. The IEP audit report raised questions more broadly regarding the Commonwealth grant guidelines, so the committee has decided to examine a subsequent ANAO report on the administration of grant reporting obligations. The billions of dollars provided each year through grants require full transparency and accountability. The Commonwealth grant guidelines must be clear and there must be support for agencies to implement the guidelines and other requirements. In turn, ministers should have sufficient support from their agencies to ensure decisions can stand up to full public scrutiny. Yet the ANAO found that agencies did not seem clear on the requirements and did not take advantage of best practice to models and this seems to be repeating itself did over time. Competitive grant selection processes are being significantly underutilised, and ministers are receiving inadequate departmental support. The committee acknowledges the work of the Department of Finance and Deregulation in developing the guidelines, providing updates and, most recently, in the release of model chief executive instructions. Nevertheless, we continue to see non-compliance and confusion. Following the committee's release of ANAO's supporting documentation relating to ministerial under-reporting of grant approvals, there were a number of exchanges between the ministers named and the Auditor-General. These statements and letters disputed the categorisation of grants that should have been reported to the finance minister. The committee has since agreed to the public release of these letters on the JCPAA website in the interests of transparency and accountability. Clearly, there are still practical problems with the system. Not only do the guidelines need to be clarified, but agencies need sufficient support to follow them. The finance department was provided ongoing funding to support agencies through the grants framework unit, but chose to redirect the funding to areas reviewing the broader financial framework. While we accept that grants are a subset of the framework, Finance missed the opportunity to maximise momentum following the introduction of the Commonwealth grant guidelines. I have more to say but in closing I would like to sincerely thank each committee member for the non-partisan spirit of the work done and once again thank the committee secretariat for their work. (Time expired) In accordance with standing order 39(f), the report was made a parliamentary paper. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (10:34): Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak briefly in support the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit Report No. 430: Review of Auditor General's reports Nos 47 (2010-11) to 9 (2011-12) and reports Nos 10 to 23 (201112). I do so as the Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. The chair has already outlined the role of the committee in reviewing the audit reports each year. The committee continues to take a pro-active role in pursuing opportunities for improvements in transparency accountability, particularly in terms of decision making and performance measurement. The three reports were viewed by the committee in Audit report No. 430, Audit report No. 5 2011-12: Development and implementation of key performance indicators to support the outcomes and programs framework, Audit report No. 7 2011-12: Establishment, implementation and administration of the infrastructure employment project stream of the Jobs Fund, and Audit report No. 21 2011-12: Administration of grant reporting obligations. With these reports and many like them across other agencies the committee has identified, during this term of parliament, that there needs to be ongoing improvement in the way in which Commonwealth guidelines are adhered to by agencies. Whether it is the grant guidelines or procurement guidelines, there are deficiencies in the way that those guidelines are being followed and adhered to by agencies and in the support that they are getting in clarifying and implementing those guidelines. The committee believes that there is a strong role to be played by the Department of Finance and Deregulation in providing guidance and clarity around agencies' responsibilities; however, it is fair to say that agencies themselves need to be taking more responsibility in the way they of administer their obligations. The committee acknowledges the work of the finance department in developing the guidelines, providing updates and, most recently, the release of model chief executive instructions. I take note of the evidence that we have received from the finance department that, although they provide all of that guidance and assistance and there can be improvements in what they are providing, the fact is the agencies do stand alone. It is, and at the end of the day, their obligation to ensure that those guidelines are being followed appropriately. This report makes recommendations to assist in continuous improvement in the areas of transparency and accountability, and the committee will continue to monitor the progress in these areas. I wish to briefly go specifically to Audit report No. 21 2011-12 as it has attracted some media around it. The chair has already outlined that there was correspondence between the relevant ministers and the Australian National Audit Office in relation to the issue of declarations by the ministers of any grants within their electorates. This correspondence will form part of the public record for all to view. I think it is fair to say that, because of some of the media reports that have gone on around this issue, the evidence before the committee states that there is no deliberate act by the ministers in not declaring those grants within their electorates. The deficiencies do lie within the agencies and the briefings provided to those ministers, and it is expected that agencies' briefings to ministers in the future will clearly outline where a grant actually falls within a minister's electorate and advise of the need to provide notification of such grant to the finance department. So the Australian National Audit Office report and this report of the committee clearly outline that there are failings in the way agencies brief ministers, and that certainly needs to be improved on. But I do acknowledge that it was this government that brought that process into place in the first place. It is a process worth pursuing and improving on. In closing, I would like to sincerely thank the chair and each of the committee members for their ongoing support and willingness to work together in a non-partisan manner to deliver these reports. I am also thankful for the ongoing support of the secretariat in the committee's ongoing work.",39
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES, The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the honourable member for Lyne wish to move a motion in connection with that report to enable it to be debated at a later occasion?,42
20,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES, I move: That the House take note of the report.,42

22,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES, by leave-I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Federation Chamber for debate. Question agreed to. NA Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Service Requirement) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Robert.,42
23,Mr ROBERT,BILLS," I present the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Service Requirement) Bill 2012 and the explanatory memorandum. I, like my coalition colleagues, believe strongly in supporting not only our Australian Defence Force personnel but also their families: their spouses and their dependants. Spouses or partners of ADF members and their dependants give so much to our nation. They are the ones who enable our ADF personnel. They are the ones who have the biggest influence on whether our ADF personnel choose to remain in the service of their nation in uniform. They are the ones who offer the greatest support to their serving family members. They are the ones who so often experience the greater hardships, the greater stresses, constant rotations, in many cases constant deployments and certainly constant training schedules. They are the ones who know sacrifices that few of us ever will. For the families of those who fight I am pleased to be able to introduce this bill on behalf of the coalition. Simply put, the bill will ensure that spouses and dependants of ADF lateral transfer members-those serving members from other countries' militaries who seek to come and serve our country under our flagwill be able to gain citizenship at the same time as their serving ADF member. It is the right and fair thing to do. It is just. It honours those who honour us. ADF lateral transfers are members who have served in another nation's military and have subsequently moved to Australia to serve in our Australian Defence Force. They come from a wide variety of countries, including New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom-and, of course, in publications we saw in newsprint on the weekend, a large number of US personnel are also seeking to join our military. At present the majority of lateral transfer members are still coming from the United Kingdom's Royal Navy, Royal Marines, army or air force. The Australian Defence Force has a long and proud record of recruiting members from the armed forces of other countries. We do so in order to fill current capability gaps in our own armed forces. We do it only where it suits the parent country. For example, the Royal Australian Navy is presently taking advantage of the United Kingdom's strategic defence and security review, which amongst other things is reducing the number of personnel across the UK's four services. It is in this context and this move by the Cameron government that the Royal Australian Navy is increasing its recruitment of Royal Navy personnel in order to fill our capability gaps within our own ranks. It could take over a decade to recruit, train and skill engineers, pilots or other personnel with exceptionally high levels of skill. Having these personnel with these skills transfer from other militaries into ours saves the Commonwealth enormous time and enormous money. The ADF is presently looking to recruit on their own numbers approximately 300 lateral transfer personnel each year. Importantly, 90 per cent of these ADF lateral transfer members have families that they would be looking to bring to Australia. It is the care for these families that is foremost in the mind of the decision maker: the lateral transfer member who is seeking to join the ADF. In terms of the Australian Citizenship Act, all lateral transfers are required by law to qualify for permanent residency visas before a member can take up a position within the Australian Defence Force and move to Australia. This is necessary as all ADF members are required to be Australian citizens and permanent residency is a prerequisite to citizenship. Spouses, partners and dependants of ADF lateral transfer members, at the time of moving to Australia, are afforded permanent residency, but they are not afforded citizenship in line with the lateral transfer member. Under the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, sections 21(2)(c) and 23(a)(i) and (ii), a permanent resident may be granted citizenship after completing 90 days permanent service in the ADF or six months in the ADF Reserves. These sections are regularly used in support of lateral transfer ADF members. The provision for 'early' citizenship under the act does not apply to the spouse or partner of the ADF member. Nor does it include dependants aged 16 or over-that is, those who cannot be included on the ADF member's citizenship application. This situation can, and does, lead to discord within families of lateral transfer ADF members. For example, Australia currently has ADF lateral transfer members not only serving extensively within our ranks here at home training, but also serving in combat operations. Should such a member be killed in training or in operations, there appears to be no legislative basis or guarantee that their spouse or dependants would be able to stay in Australia or have access to the range of benefits normally payable to the spouses and dependants of Australian ADF members. This has been taken up with the government and, while I appreciate that the government has made assurances that support would be provided to their families, this is little comfort when there appears to little evidence of such assurances. There is no reason that such assurances should not be enshrined in law. This is one purpose of this private member's bill in this place this morning-to provide that peace of mind to the over 300 lateral recruits who will be transferring to the ADF in the next 12 months and to their families. There are also significant issues for dependants of ADF lateral transfer members. For example, as permanent residents they are not eligible to receive a university HELP based placement, which may put a significant financial strain on families. There also appears to be significant and fundamental disjunct between interpretation of the current act and the departmental immigration policy as it applies to children who are permanent residents. While the act definitively states, under section 21(5), that a person under the age of 18 is eligible to become an Australian citizen if they are a permanent resident, departmental advice states that they must have fulfilled the general residency requirement-despite the fact that the legislation makes no mention of this requirement. This bill will correct these problems and ensure families are not unnecessarily subjected to significant hardship. The simple fact is that the current legislation can lead to distress for families and should be changed. The bill removes the discriminatory provisions in the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 that result in ADF members being granted citizenship years in advance of their partner and dependants over certain ages. The bill reflects the fact that, behind and beside every serving member is a supporting, serving family. The bill reflects the fact that we request, we desire, we want, serving men and women from other militaries to come be and stand, serve and fight side by side with Australian citizens. But, to achieve that, we need to embrace their families and treat them equally. I simply call on the government to support this bill. I also call on the Independents to support these sensible, fair and much needed measures. The policy in the bill is wholly welcomed and supported by Defence Families of Australia. Defence Families of Australia has been a wonderful advocate on behalf of Defence families and across a wide range of issues, ranging from defence housing to spousal support, and is vocal about the need to fix this inequity in terms of the families of ADF lateral transfer the members. I know that my opposite, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, holds the Defence Families of Australia organisation in high regard. I have stood by his side when he has made that point. I thank Defence Families of Australia for their continual advocacy. In conclusion, the coalition fully appreciates the sacrifices that ADF members and their families make, including those members who have come under lateral transfer arrangements. We also recognise the importance of ensuring tight family groupings, and we consider the current lateral transfer arrangements to be failing in promoting this outcome. This bill will simply remove the inequitable treatment of spouses and dependants of lateral transfer members. It will ensure that they all have access to citizenship at the same time. It will ensure that spouses and dependent children of lateral transfer members have access to the same benefits as the spouses and dependent children of the serving men and women their husbands or wives serve beside. This bill will provide families with the peace of mind that, in the event of their father, their mother, their wife or their husband being killed in training or in operational service to the nation, they will be unambiguously, properly cared for. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",42
24,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Do Not Knock Register Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Georganas.",45
25,Mr GEORGANAS,BILLS," It gives me great pride to introduce my private member's bill, the Do Not Knock Register Bill 2012. This bill establishes a register that will allow consumers to opt out of receiving door-to-door sales and marketing calls at home. It is designed to address significant and sustained community concern about the impact of door-to-door sales calls on home and family life. I have been contacted by many constituents in my electorate who have signed contracts whose details they were unaware of, who felt the pressure on their front doorstep to sign contracts to buy products from telcos, energy companies et cetera. I have also received many calls from people referred to me by the Leon Byner Program. I would like to thank Leon Byner and 5AA for their concern on this issue. Many, many callers were referred to our office asking us to investigate door-to-door sales contracts they had signed that were completely different to what they had been told. It also pursues one of the key objectives of the ACCC this year-to address unconscionable door-to-door selling. This bill will end any confusion and it will give a clear legal obligation for companies not to knock on the door of people listed on the register. At the heart of the bill is the principle that everyone has the right to peace and privacy in their own homes. Too often these days a knock on the door or a ring of the doorbell means an intrusion by a salesperson into our home and our life. We have all experienced these feelings of dread when the doorbell rings, perhaps just as you have sat down to dinner or when you are reading the paper on a Saturday morning. There is someone there from an energy company, a phone company or an internet company and you just know that they are going to try to sell you something, that you probably do not want or need. As they start talking you begin to wonder how you can politely tell them that you are not interested. But they are very persistentI think all of us have been through this-and before you know it they are asking all about your energy company or phone plan: what your current rate is, how much you pay and how much you consume. If you are assertive enough-many of us in this place are-you might tell them at that point that you are not interested, and they will leave it at that. That is fine for a lot of people but for many consumers that is not the case. If you are elderly or living alone it can be very difficult to say no to a pushy salesperson. I have lost count of the number of times constituents have walked through my office door and burst into tears because they have been forced to pay for something that they do not want and cannot even afford. Usually they come in with a bill or two, often a final notice, and they explain that they felt so much pressure to sign up that they did so, and now are having trouble paying the bill. Often they have been the victim of misleading and deceptive conduct, like the promise of particular benefits or savings which never materialise. Frequently, consumers and constituents tell me that they only signed up for the company because they felt quite intimated by the salesperson and thought it was the only way to get them to leave. Usually, these are older people living alone or people from other vulnerable groups-the disabled and those from non-English-speaking backgrounds-and appear to have been specifically targeted. Unfortunately, with one in five people in my electorate being over the age of 66, Hindmarsh is considered to be a prime target area for door-to-door salespeople. It is also a very multicultural area with a big ethnic mix, and I have seen a lot of people who have limited English language skills become victims of high-pressure sales tactics, and even outright deceit by salespeople. In fact, until recently my own mother used to have a new phone company every week and I have had to teach her how to say 'No, thank you,' to all the people who knock on her door. She is quite good at it now. So this bill will not only protect the rights of all to peace and privacy in their own homes but also help protect some of the most vulnerable people in our community. We know that there is big community support for this bill. As I said earlier, many constituents have contacted me-as well as a whole range of other people including the media-saying that this is a good thing. Some recent research by the Consumer Action Law Centre found that 85 per cent of respondents were in favour of a do-notknock register. They also found that only three per cent of people have a positive opinion about door-to-door sales; 77 per cent actively dislike door-to-door sales; and 56 per cent of people feel greater pressure to buy from door-to-door sales reps as opposed to other selling environments. Best of all, we know that this particular model already works. The Do Not Knock Register Bill is based on the existing Do Not Call Register, which, since its establishment, has been overwhelmingly embraced by telephone account holders. In November 2011 the total registrations hit seven million, which include more than half of Australia's fixed line home numbers. And not only has it been very successful in terms of take-up, but we know that it is very effective. In November 2011, 88 per cent of people on the Do Not Call Register have reported a reduction in the number of telemarketing calls they receive. The Australian Communications and Media Authority, which runs the register, has also had great success in pursuing breaches of the Do Not Call Register Act. Like the Do Not Call Register, this bill has hefty financial penalties for salespeople and companies who do not comply with the law. Penalties for breaching the provisions of the act include infringement notices, injunctions and civil penalties. It is important to note that this bill does not affect some key public interest organisations including government bodies, charities, religious organisations, politicians and political candidates. It is specifically designed to cover marketers that affect your back pocket. For example, we do not want to stop the Salvation Army from conducting their Red Shield Appeal, which took place over the most recent weekend. For this reason the Do Not Knock Register, like the Do Not Call Register, has special provisions for charities, religious organisations, politicians and educational organisations to allow them to continue to make house calls. Since I first proposed the legislation it has been greatly encouraging to receive an enormous amount of support not only from my own electorate but from people across Australia. I have received many letters, phone calls, emails and messages from people from all corners of our nation in support of the legislation. But the campaign has been building for some time. Consumer Action Law Centre's sticker-based Do Not Knock campaign, has been so successful in the community already that it has been embraced by governments, including the government of my state, South Australia. But until now there has been some uncertainty about the legal status of the stickers. This bill will end any confusion and it will give a clear legal obligation for companies not to knock on the doors of people who have opted to list on the register. Of course, the bill will build on the existing provisions in the Australian consumer law which came into full effect on 1 January 2011, and has done a lot to improve consumer rights. Under the ACL, door-to-door salespeople are restricted in their door-to-door calls to between 9am and 6pm Monday to Friday, and 9am and 5pm on Saturday. This means that even if you choose not to be on the Do Not Knock Register you are still provided with some protection against intrusion into your home and family life. Under the ACL, door-to-door salespeople must also offer a cooling-off period-a set time frame in which you can return the goods and get your money back if you change your mind. As of 1 January 2012, this is now 10 days, and this will apply to anyone who does conduct doorto-door sales into the future. If the salesperson does not tell you about the cooling-off period, you are entitled to an even longer cooling-off period. These are good things that have been put in place and I would like to acknowledge the minister, who is here in the chamber with us today. There are a number of very important elements within the ACL that will provide key protections even to those who choose not to register with the Do Not Knock register. I thank all the community members in Hindmarsh who contacted me over the years to tell me about their experiences with doorto-door sales. I spoke to, and received letters and emails from, many people who told me of their plight and their stories about how they felt pressured into signing a contract only to find out that the telco they had gone with had doubled the price or the energy company was far more expensive. The calls of all these people, the letters, their calls to the Leon Byner show on 5AA-many of which we investigated-have not gone unnoticed, and today is their day. I commend this bill to the House.",45
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Economy Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (11:01): I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) Australia's economy is strong, resilient outperforming any comparable nation; (b) Australia's unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent is historically low when compared to Europe and the United States; (c) the International Monetary Fund ranks Australia's 2011 per capita GDP as sixth, ahead of 176 other nations; and (d) Australia's government net debt as a percentage of GDP, which at peaked at 8.9 per cent, is extremely low when compared to nations such as Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France; (2) acknowledges that: (a) living conditions for Australians are the best in the world; (b) Australia was ranked second in the 2011 United Nations Human Development Index; and (c) Australia was ranked first in the 2011 OECD Better Life Index; and (3) the Australian economy is becoming a knowledge economy with the finance sector accounting for more of the total economy than mining or manufacturing. Australia's economic fundamentals are among the strongest in the world. Our economy has grown by more than seven per cent of its pre-crisis level of output and is expected to outperform every major advanced economy over the next two years. We have low unemployment at 4.9 per cent, with around 800,000 jobs created since this government came into office in 2007. We have a record investment pipeline, and economic prospects in our region remain very healthy. We have strong public finances and a AAA credit rating from all three major ratings agencies for the first time in Australia's history. Our economy is the envy of the developed world because Labor has made the tough calls and the right calls in a tough economic climate. We did this by most recently doing exactly what we promised: delivering on major reforms and returning the budget to and surplus. We were able to achieve this through supporting growth and jobs at the height of the global financial crisis under the stewardship of the world's best Treasurer, and we avoided the untold damage done to so many families, communities and economies around the world. Looking at other economies, it is clear that no economy is immune to global instability. Global developments in Europe have triggered volatility in global financial markets and the Treasurer anticipates that Europe's economy will contract by three-quarters of one per cent this year and that bouts of global volatility are likely to continue for some time. Even in this difficult economic climate Australia has managed to come through the greatest economic crisis since the depression as the envy of the world. One of the many reasons we are the envy of the developed world is our exceptional record of job creation. Just two days after the budget we got a clear demonstration of what strong economic management is all about. Figures showed that there were more people in the workforce than ever before-just over 11.5 million Australians. Nearly 90,000 more people have gained the security and the dignity of a job so far this year, taking the total number of jobs created since Labor came to office to around 800,000. This is a big achievement, particularly when you consider that over the same period about 27 million men and women have joined unemployment queues elsewhere in the world. It is another indication of our economy's resilience despite the pressures of the high dollar, cautious consumer spending and ongoing global uncertainty, all of which are weighing on many businesses. Australia's unemployment rate at 4.9 per cent is among the lowest in the industrialised world and well ahead of the United States at 8.1 per cent, the United Kingdom at 8.3 per cent, France at 9.8 per cent and Spain at 24.4 per cent. It is not just our employment record that puts Australia in a league of its own. The IMF ranks Australia's 2011 per capita GDP as sixth ahead of 176 other nations and we are returning the budget to surplus in 201213 before many of our peers have even halved their deficits. Our economy is forecast to grow faster than every single major advanced economy over the next two years. It is also important to highlight Australia's government net debt as a percentage of GDP peaked at 8.9 per cent, which is extremely low when compared to nations such as Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France. The 2012-13 budget was a Labor budget-a budget that recognised Australian families are feeling cost-of-living pressures and need a hand up. We know that Australians already have some of the best living conditions in the world, but in the latest budget we made sure that those Australians who are feeling the pinch most are able to share in some of the benefits of our mining boom and our strong economic fundamentals. The Labor budget demonstrated that you do not need to choose between a surplus and good social policy that will strengthen our economy and improve living conditions for the most vulnerable groups in Australia's society. Few in our society are more vulnerable than those who will benefit from the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This scheme will provide Australians who have a significant and permanent disability with the care and support they need to participate in society, no matter where they live or how they acquired their disability. As the country's most fundamental social policy reform since Medicare, the scheme will take some time to implement. We know that we need to work through the details with the state and territory governments; we also know that this reform cannot wait. That is why $1 billion in the budget has been allocated to this reform. From July 2013, a year ahead of schedule, launch locations around the country will start to lift the standard of help for around 10,000 people with a significant and permanent disability, and the number of people receiving this help will grow to 20,000 from mid-2014. I know that that those of us from Queensland-the member for Moreton, I am sure, feels the same way-really hope that the state government wants one of the launch locations to be in Queensland. I talk to many families in my electorate every day who are caring for loved ones with a disability, and I understand the pressures they are facing. We do need these launch locations to start as quickly as possible, and I want to see one of the launch locations in Queensland. This reform is just one of many that the government has made. Another of these reforms is the securing of funding in the budget for aged-care reform. This is another very important issue for the electorate of Petrie. There are many seniors in my electorate, and many want to know what the future of aged care is. Are they going to be able to stay at home for as long as they would like to and have someone care for them at home? When they or their family makes the difficult decision that they need to move into a nursing home, will help be there and will there be an aged-care system that can support them in the long term? Also, the government is delivering a dental package that will ensure that all Australians are able to benefit from our strong economic fundamentals. There are many people on the public dental waiting lists in the electorate of Petrie, and this package will go a long way to assisting those people. Reforms such as these are exactly the reason that Australia is ranked second in the 2011 United Nations Human Development Index and first in the 2011 OECD Better Life Index. These are really important achievements and reflect not just on Labor's sound fiscal management, which promotes good living conditions, but also on the values, resilience and dedication to fairness of all Australians. Finally, I urge that the House acknowledge that the Australian economy is becoming a knowledge economy. The finance sector accounts for more of the total economy than do mining or manufacturing. In addition, we know that the small business sector is one of the drivers of the Australian economy. Nearly five million Australians are employed by small businesses, and 96 per cent of all businesses are small businesses. These provide 47 per cent of the nation's jobs, which means that about 4.8 million employees are employed by small businesses. Across the electorate of Petrie there are over 12,000 small businesses. This Labor government is acting in the interests these businesses and of our communities through responsible fiscal policy, and the government will continue to work in the interests of this nation in keeping our economy strong, resilient and outperforming that of any comparable nation.",47
27,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Is the motion seconded? ,50
28,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS," I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Petrie. In beginning I say that this place deals with two great responsibilities. One is ensuring Australia's national security; the other is the management of the national economy in the best interests of all Australians. I congratulate the member for Petrie for raising this motion today and bringing the attention of the House to the Australian economy, but that is where the congratulations must end. That contribution was as delusional as the contribution we will hear in this House in about 50 minutes time. This government is causing five great problems for our economy and for our future. There are two things I will pick the member for Petrie up on. The first is that governments do not create jobs; entrepreneurs-wealth creators-create jobs. But all they see at the moment, particularly from the Treasurer, is constant attacks on them and their ability to go out and create those jobs. We have heard the rhetoric of the last few weeks. Jacques Nasser, the chairman of the BHP board and one of Australia's most respected businesspeople, said last week that the attacks-the class warfare-that this government is pursuing is dragging our economy down even further. The second thing I must raise with the member for Petrie's contribution is that the reforms of today will affect the economy of the future, just as the reforms of yesterday of affect how the economy operates today. If we look at history, we can point to the fact that the reforms of the Howard and Costello era were the reasons that Australia was able to successfully handle the crisis that came about in 2008. Undoubtedly the reforms of the 2000s introduced by John Howard and Peter Costello were the reason that in 2008 the Australian economy was able to deal with the buffeting it experienced in international waters. We were also lucky in the sense that we are well positioned in this century to be able to take advantage of the Asian economic drive. In 2008, when the crisis hit, there was no government debt; there was a huge opportunity for government to rely on fiscal policy to address international events. We said rightly at the time of the crisis-and we still say-that the government's measures were too much and that there would be too much waste. People in the gallery today will know of the waste which has been built up since that time. Programs such as the overpriced school halls and the pink batts were just two examples of the waste contained in the government's stimulus package. Also, cash payments went to dead people, to people living overseas and to animals. We know that all these wasteful programs were part of the government's response-a response they were able to put in place because the fiscal policy of the Howard and Costello governments was so strong that they did not have any debt when they came to government. The other factor that helped us get through that period was that the labour relations laws operating at the time were pre the so-called Fair Work Act. That factor gave businesses the flexibility needed to handle the reduction in growth. These same Fair Work Act laws are the ones this Labor government now stands by and are causing so many problems in our economy-and I will come back to that. As I said earlier, I will put forward five reasons that this government's management of the economy will cause long-term and significant harm to our future prosperity. The first is that the government is spending far more than it earns. Since it came to office, it has increased spending from approximately $270 billion of the last Howard-Costello budget to some nearly $370 billion in the current budget. That is a massive increase in government spending in that time. The second-and I think we will hear more about this in 45 minutes-is the confidence-sapping inability of government to manage anything properly. The country sees that inability and this minority government's failure and sees a desperate need for an election to clear all this up. The third reason-and I note that the member for Petrie, who has left the chamber, refused to mention it-is the reverse tariff carbon tax, which will come into force in just five weeks time, and the massive impact it will have on the Australian economy at the wrong time. The fourth reason, thanks to this government, is that our economy is mired in red tape, is overregulated and has particularly devastating industrial relations laws, which are causing untold damage to both big and small business. The final reason is that this government is obsessed with tying down our most successful industry at a time when we should be trying to encourage that successful industry to take advantage of the unique circumstances that we face. It is not just us making these points. Last week we heard quite an astonishing speech by Jac Nasser, the chairman of BHP. He reflected on three or four major areas of the current government's management of the Australian economy. In particular, regarding industrial relations, he said: Restrictive labour regulations have quickly become one of the most problematic factors for doing business in Australia. Today we have seen even more evidence of that, with Tom Albanese, the head of Rio Tinto, one of our great companies in Australia-one of our big employers and big exporters-saying: … I'm sorry to say now that, lately, when I speak the with investors around the world they say to me: 'Tom, are you worried about your over-exposure to Australia?' That is not a good thing. That is damning testimony of where Australia fits. It is not something to be fretful about, but it is something that should be recognised as a this problem-and it is indeed a major problem.  in Australia!",50
29,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"The problem is that the planned investment is now being reconsidered. The biggest reconsiderationand, as a South Australian, I am highly fearful of this-is the investment in Olympic Dam. The Olympic Dam project is one of South Australia's great opportunities to take advantage of the unique circumstances in our region. Make no mistake about this: the Olympic Dam project is now in doubt because of the federal Labor government's policies, which are making doing business in mining in Australia too expensive. Jac Nasser, the chairman of the BHP board, said exactly this last week. The member for Moreton may know everything about every other subject in this place, but I suspect he does not know more about the BHP business than Jac Nasser does. I think Jac Nasser knows a little more than the member for Moreton about his business and the investment that was planned for Olympic Dam but is now at grave risk. There is a grave risk to the South Australian and Australian economies because of your policies, Member for Moreton. Because of the policies your government is implementing, the reforms of today will affect the performance of the economy tomorrow, and this will hang over the federal Labor Party for a generation. The performance of this government-with the debt it has built up, the re-regulation of Australia's labour market, the mire of red tape that Australian business is now caught in and the cost of doing business in our country, at a time when we should be freeing the economy to take advantage of the growth in Asia-is a disgrace, and this motion should be amended to reflect so. This motion should be amended to reflect the great damage that this government is doing not just to business confidence and to the reputation of this great institution, the federal parliament, but to the Australian economy in the future. I bemoan the fact that too much attention is directed to the great scandals which we see before us today, brought to you by the federal Labor Party, and not enough of the Australian people's attention is directed to the great policy shamefulness that this government has inflicted on our future generations. Far and away one of Australia's most respected economists, Warwick MCKibbin, wrote very clearly about this in the Australian Financial Review: Right now, the Australian economy faces a perfect storm. The federal government has bet that a crisis in Europe will not happen during the 2012-13 financial year. The financial year starts on July 1, when a carbon tax set four times above the world price begins to raise input costs, particularly energy costs. No amount of compensation changes the economic negativity of this shock. … … … Unsound political decisions have put the global economy into a dangerous position. Australia has wandered aimlessly down this same path thanks largely to a minority government. In the wash-up of events over the next several years, one hopes that some of those responsible for putting Australia unnecessarily in the eye of a perfect storm are held to account. And, my word, they will be. When the government finally take us to an election, the Australian public will know. They will blame you for the economic chaos you have caused our country. (Time expired)",51
30,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," To hear those opposite speak in here, you would think that Australia was mired in doom and gloom, with its economic circumstances just seconds away from recession. But when those opposite go overseas they speak the truth. When the Leader of the Opposition visited London last year, he said: Australia has serious bragging rights. Compared to most developed countries, our economic circumstances are enviable. They are enviable indeed. I just want to speak today to this motion and draw the House's attention to some long-run patterns in real government spending across recent decades. Terrific analysis by Stephen Koukoulas in the Australian Financial Review the day after the budget pointed out: Not once did the Howard or Fraser governments in about 20 years in office achieve a single year where government spending was cut in real terms, while Labor governments have been able to cut real spending in five years since the mid 1980s. Mr Koukoulas pointed out that the ratio of government spending to GDP is now '0.7 per cent of GDP lower than the average of the 12 Howard government budgets'. There is around $10 billion less spending as a result of that lower tax to GDP ratio. Mr Koukoulas concluded: This is important to recognise because it repudiates the mantra from various opposition spokespeople about the government being ""addicted to tax"" or not delivering ""genuine savings"" … 'Nothing,' he said, 'could be further from the truth'. The argument picks up on a terrific article by George Megalogenis last year in the Australian in which Mr Megalogenis looked at the average annual real spending increase when the government grows at better than two per cent a year. That figure under John Howard was 2.3 per cent, under Paul Keating was 2.2 per cent, under Peter Costello mark 1 was 1.9 percent but under Peter Costello mark 2 was three per cent, and under Wayne Swan prior to this budget was just one per cent. So economic commentators have concurred that it is this government that has managed to hold real spending. Unlike the Howard government, which never managed a cut in real spending, this government has managed to cut real spending. It has done so after putting in place important fiscal stimulus. If those opposite had their way then when the global financial crisis hit they would have cut back on government spending. They would have had to because they say they would not have taken the government budget into the red. So as the revenue write downs hit, they would have had to cut back on spending-throwing Australians onto the scrapheap. I graduated from high school in the teeth of the early 90s recession. I know what it is like to be a young kid looking for work in the teeth of a recession because I saw many of my high school classmates do exactly that. It is a rough labour market when you hit a recession and that is what we managed to avoid through our fiscal stimulus. In relative terms, we have very low debt levels. Australia's net debt as a percentage of GDP will peak at 9.6 per cent of GDP in 2011-12, around a tenth of the level of the major advanced economies, who, in many cases, have debts equal to their entire national income. So if you put it in a household context, it is like somebody earning $100,000 a year and owing $9,600. Many Australian households would take on debt at that level, for example, to buy a used car so they could drive off and get a job. In some sense, that is what the government did: we used that money to put in place fiscal stimulus to make sure Australians could get and keep jobs. Absent that fiscal stimulus, we know the Australian economy would have slid into recession. When you hear members of the Liberal and National parties castigating debt, remember that as they do so they are saying Australia should have lost more jobs in the global financial crisis and we should have let more small businesses go to the wall. That is the logical implication of their position on debt. They should raise the debt cap as is responsible, not take the Tea Party approach they seem so inclined to do. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (11:26): As usual from our colleagues opposite, the contribution to this debate is plenty of words, again, lacking in substance. It is interesting to note that the member for Fraser says that they are spending $10 billion a year less as a percentage of GDP but their spending has actually gone up by $100 billion. The only reason the halt in real spending occurred is because they failed to put key spending measures such as the NBN on the budget. Again, it is just another example of smoke and mirrors and obfuscation.  Fund? Mr VAN MANEN: I always get a worthwhile contribution from my esteemed colleague from Moreton. I would like to thank the member for Petrie for her motion as it allows me the opportunity to dispel some of the economic myths that are perpetuated by this government. Firstly, let us look at the credit claim by the current government for Australia's economic resilience in the face of the turbulent economic headwinds of the GFC. This government proudly claims success for this. However, in reality, the credit should be given to the reforms enacted during the Hawke-Keating years and built upon by the Howard government. It is the legacy of these reforms from which this country still benefits today. It is in spite of, not because of, this current Labor-Green government that our economy continues to perform well on average. However, averages never tell the full story. There are many sectors of the economy struggling today yet in the budget there was little to assist small-to-medium business. On 1 July they will face the full effects of the world's largest carbon tax. Let us look at unemployment, which currently stands at about 4.9 per cent. In the budget papers it is expected to increase to per cent. In my electorate of Forde, the unemployment rate is already 6.6 per cent. If you look at Roy Morgan's figures from April 2012, unemployment stood at 9.3 per cent according to their calculations and underemployment stood at 8.2 per cent. That is a total of 17.5 per cent of the workforce unemployed or underemployed. How much higher are these figures going to get if business begins to lay off staff or reduce their hours to stay afloat due to the impact of the carbon tax? The compensation package will be of little relevance to people who have their working hours cut or who lose their job. The member for Petrie correctly notes in her motion that Australia's net government debt is low when compared to Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France. However, this again is not a credit to the current government. It is a credit to the former Howard government which, under the stewardship of the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, succeeded in repaying $96 billion in accumulated Labor debt. Not only was that achieved, but the Labor government came to office with $70 billion in the bank and a $20 billion surplus. Since then, the government has gone on a merry spending spree, with accumulated budget deficits of $174 billion and the country now staring at a net debt of $145 billion, all in only four and a bit years. This is a staggering deterioration in the government's fiscal position by $245 billion, or some 16¼ per cent of GDP. The member's motion also seeks to acknowledge the living conditions of Australians as being the best in the world. I do believe that we live in a wonderful country and we have much to be thankful for, but, once again, this is not something that this government can take credit for. It is due to the hard work, sweat and tears of 5.5 many generations of Australians. A great community is not something governments create. It is created by the individuals in our community working together. We have seen, over the past several weeks, attempts by the government to break down these great community bonds through its class warfare rhetoric and through pitting rich against poor, pursuing a path of wealth redistribution and seeking to demonise those that disagree with it. In many areas our living expenses such as rent, grocery prices and consumer prices are higher than those in the US, Canada and the UK. It is this government that, despite its attempt-(Time expired) Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (11:31): In a recent edition of the popular ABC program Q&A, the member for Indi was forced to dissociate herself from former minister Peter Reith, who came up with the idea that the best thing for Australian employment would be to make it easier for workers to be sacked-with this theory that if they could sack people quickly they would get people more jobs. Mr Reith also distanced himself from the pretence the opposition is putting on that they actually believe in protecting Australian industry. Peter Reith said, 'Oh, we don't believe in protecting any industry at all,' so there was a reason for dissociation. That is perhaps also why Tony Abbott, having persuaded Peter Reith to run for president of the Liberal Party, publicly voted against him. There are some true believers-the member for Mayo today came out supporting the Reith analysis-but I am inclined to believe the words of Paul Krugman, 2008 winner of the Nobel Prize in economics. It is perhaps more worthwhile listening to his analysis of what this country should be doing with regard to employment, and of what this government has done, than listening to the member for Mayo. In this week's edition of The New York Review, Paul Krugman said: Tens of millions of our fellow citizens are suffering vast hardship, the future prospects of today's young people are being eroded with each passing month-and all of it is unnecessary. For the fact is that we have both the knowledge and tools to get out of the depression. Indeed, applying time-honored economic principles whose validity has only been reinforced by recent events, we could be back to more or less full employment very fast, probably in less than two years. All that is blocking recovery is a lack of intellectual clarity and political will. So Paul Krugman, the 2008 Nobel Prize winner in economics, believes that the American government should do what the government of this country did. Kenneth Davidson, in his analysis in Dissent magazine of what this government did in respect of the global financial crisisthat is, making sure that people were not terminated, making sure that jobs were available, making sure that people spent money in shops and making sure that industries were kept going-said: From the macroeconomic perspective, the response to the global financial crisis was brilliant. In another article, in Dissent No. 38, he went on to look at this pretentious performance by the opposition about national debt in this country: One would think that it was just a matter of the brilliance of former Treasurer Costello. They don't compare apples to apples. We in the interim have faced a global financial crisis which has seriously eroded government tax take. One hears the previous speaker saying that unemployment is at this level, compared to another point in time. Let us look at the reality of unemployment levels in this country compared to the rest of the world. Australia is now at 4.9 per cent, but if I go back to when it was 5.2 per cent just recently, the United States was 8.3, the United Kingdom was 8.2, Canada was 7.2and that is without going to the worse parts of Europe, such as Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. Even compared to those countries that are regarded as more successful, our rate is far better. If we look at inflation rates: by when Australia was at 1.6 per cent recently, Canada was at 2.6, France was at 2.3 and Italy was at 2.3. Returning to government debt, part of the reason that those opposite can claim, and pretend, that they were so successful in reducing the government debt to national GDP ratio was the fact that they sold government utilities. Of course you reduce your debt if you sell the Commonwealth Bank! You reduce your debt if you sell off our airports. You reduce debt if you sell off Telstra. Davidson, with regard to another one of their brilliant policies-that is, selling off government buildings around the country, where they sold off any building that did not yield over 16 per cent return-said in Dissent No. 38: The asset fire sales of these government buildings was no different to a householder deciding to sell the family home in order to pay off the mortgage and then rent the house back at a far higher rental. What we are seeing is a group of people over there who are exploiting the fact that in some parts of family expenditure, particularly food, there has been a significant rise, but we all know the overall CPI for this country is far lower than elsewhere. They have also exploited the falsehood that recent energy costs are something to do with a carbon tax that has not yet been introduced. It is worthwhile knowing the realities of energy charges in this country: 46 per cent of rises in recent years have been in regard to the poles and wires, 32 per cent have been because of the actual cost of generating electricity and 15 per cent have been on profitability. Nothing whatsoever to do with the upcoming carbon tax change. So this resolution- (Time expired)",52
31,Mr TUDGE,BILLS," You would think that with a government that is plagued with scandal, a government that has its Prime Minister on her knees, it would not come into this place and deliver a motion which reeks of such hubris. You would think that a government which is asking this parliament to increase the debt limit to a record $300 billion would not come into this parliament and move a motion which claims its economic success. But this is exactly what this motion does. This government has the temerity to come in here and to claim, 'Haven't we been so successful? Haven't Australians been so lucky to have us?' Reading between the lines, it actually says, 'Haven't Australians never been better off than they are today?' Australians are smarter than this government, because they know the real truth in relation to the economy. To start with, they know that we should not be comparing ourselves to Greece and to Spain and to Italy-countries which are on the brink of collapse. They know that their reallife experiences on a day-today basis show that prices are going up exponentially while their wages are only going up by two or three per cent per annum, and therefore making it tougher and tougher from a cost-of-living perspective. They know that if you are paying $8 billion or $9 billion in interest payments alone, which is what we are now doing as a nation, you do not have the economy under control. This government has an enormous amount of hubris to come in and tell Australians that they should be thankful for their economic performance. Let us remind ourselves, in the time that we have available, of exactly what the government has done in relation to the economy. Let us just look at two or three key measures. First of all, let us look at taxes. Since this government was elected at the end of 2007, there have been 26 taxes which have been introduced or increased: 26! That is almost every facet of our society and, of course, that is before the granddaddy of them all, the carbon tax, is introduced come 1 July. Let us look at the expenditure side of the equation, as the member for Mayo pointed out. Expenditure has increased by $100 billion per annum since the Rudd government was elected. When the Rudd government was elected, the government was spending $270 billion: the government is now spending $370 billion per annum, and climbing. What do you think that extra $100 billion has gone towards? Do we see brandnew roads? Do we see all this rail infrastructure? Do we see the port bottlenecks being addressed? We do not see that. We see cars stuck in traffic, we see bottlenecks at the end of the Eastern Freeway, we see the Rowville rail link still waiting to be completed and we see ports up in Queensland not being developed. But we have seen, of course, an enormous amount of money wasted-gone! An enormous amount of money has been wasted on pink batts, on many overpriced school halls, on the green loan programs and on all sorts of other programs. So that is on the expenditure side of the equation, and when you net those two out and look at the debt then you see that this government inherited a $20 billion surplus and they inherited $70 billion in the bank, and now we have had four of the biggest deficits in Australian political history, backto-back, and we have net debt of $145 billion. This government likes to claim that it is going to reach a surplus in the next financial year. We will wait to see if they are actually going to deliver that, because they said that this year's deficit was going to be only $12 billion and it ended up being $44 billion. So their claim of $1.5 billion has to be seen actually to be believed. But even if they reach that, it could take a full 100 years of those surpluses to pay back the debt that they have left us. So that is the economic legacy of this government. That is the economic legacy: increased taxes, wasteful expenditure, record debt that will take years to pay off and flat line productivity. Next time the government puts up a motion like this, ask yourself why the Australian people are not thanking it for its record. (Time expired)",56
32,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," Just listening to the former speaker I was wondering if the children up there in the schools area of the gallery were wondering whether their new multipurpose facility, their new library or their new outdoor learning centre has been a complete waste. They certainly have not been in Canberra: in Canberra, every project has been delivered on time and on budget, and everyone I talk to in the community is absolutely over the moon. It gives me great pleasure to speak in support of this motion today because it goes to the very heart of what this Labor government has achieved; that is, a strong, stable and resilient economy. Our unemployment rate continues to go down, and is incredibly low when you consider the unemployment rate in much of Europe. I know Spain is looking at unemployment at around 24 per cent, while the fiscal crisis in Greece continues to get worse with the jobless rate hovering at around 21 per cent. However, the latest figures for Australia show our unemployment rate to be less than five per cent. This is no accident; it has been achieved through careful economic management and well-developed employment participation programs by the Labor government. In fact, more people are in employment now than ever before: just over 11.5 million Australians are participating in the workforce, taking the total number of jobs created since Labor came to office to around 800,000. We are privileged to enjoy some of the best living conditions in the world and we continue to rank highly on the UN Human Development Index and the OECD Better Life Index, as this motion suggests. Our per capita GDP is ranked sixth according to the International Monetary Fund, and our net debt as a percentage of GDP is extremely low when compared to other countries. All this is reason why now is the time to return our budget to surplus and to look at transforming our economy for the future by introducing a price on carbon pollution. If anyone is in doubt about the need to return the budget to surplus, I suggest you consider what the IMF had to say on the issue just a few weeks ago. The IMF said: … we welcome the authorities‟ commitment to return to a budget surplus by 2012-13 to rebuild fiscal buffers, putting … government finances in a stronger position to deal with shocks and term pressures from an ageing population and rising health-care costs. Putting our finances into a stronger position, which we are doing, will give our economy a buffer against any future uncertain economic times. Returning to surplus also sends a very clean sign to the rest of the world about our strong fundamentals, amidst all this global uncertainty-and it is indeed uncertain. It will also give the Reserve Bank flexibility to cut rates if it feels that is necessary, on the rate cuts that we have already seen. Returning to surplus will also allow us to concentrate on what we all came to parliament to achieve: necessary reform for a better future, making a difference. We will be able to help Australia prepare for an ageing population, which Labor is doing through the reform of the aged-care package. We will be able to establish a National Disability Insurance Scheme, which will do nothing short of revolutionising disability services in this country. I am proud of the work we are doing, and even more proud of the state of our economy just four short years after the height of the global financial crisis. This is in stark contrast to what those opposite continue to say and do, which is talk down our economy-and we have heard a lot of it today-and vote against the vital fiscal measures that have been so beneficial in ensuring that Australians do not experience the same unemployment that has befallen the eurozone. This is the same opposition that voted against the schoolkids bonus because it did not trust families to spend that vital cash on school supplies and new uniforms. The Leader of the Opposition did not trust families with their own budget, so why should Australians trust him with the nation's budget? I strongly support this motion. It concisely long- states the remarkable result of Labor's careful economic management during the worse economic crisis of our time. I can only imagine what state our economy would be in today if those opposite had been in charge.",57
33,Dr STONE,BILLS," I cannot believe that the Labor Party would willingly expose itself to commentary on the state of the economy by putting forward this motion. Everybody knows that it was the strength of the regulation of our banking system, and the top of $70 billion-plus in the bank which the Costello-Howard government managed to leave to this new government after it had paid down all of Labor's debt, which helped us survive the global financial crisis. The tragedy, of course, is that under Labor we are back into deep debt and deficit, borrowing over $100 million a day, and we are told by this government that there is now an enormous and urgent need to increase the borrowing limits so that, basically, it can borrow even more-a legacy we will inherit at the next election to pay back once again. So I am absolutely astounded that we have been given this opportunity to say it like it The fact is that national statistics disguise the patchwork economy, as quoted in this motion. There is, for example, a deep constriction of economic activity in some areas. Some are doing quite nicely-for example, in the mining economies of parts of Western Australia-but in the regional areas in southern and eastern Australia there is a markedly different story. I think of the more than 100 empty shops and small businesses in my regional centre of Shepparton, a situation which has us worried sick as we contemplate and count down how many months are left of this government before we can put the show right with a change to the coalition. But let us stay with the national statistics for one moment. Let us look at the real indicators of what this country thinks about this government. Mums and dads are frightened about their futures-obviously, given who is in charge of the country and the national policy and the finances. There is a real fear of the future and a collectively held breath across the nation-consider, for example, the construction sector. This is a major generator of jobs and has a multiplier effect across the economy. In the first seven months of this financial year, dwelling approvals collapsed by some 14,000. That is 14,000 fewer construction home approvals to February 2012. Vehicle sales, another key indicator of families' and businesses' faith in their future, were down nearly 17 per cent in the months from November to February 2012. In January this year, youth unemployment figures for 15to 24-yearolds in the Goulburn-Ovens-Murray statistical region were 18.1 per cent, compared to 12 per cent for January for the nation. In February this figure was 17.4 per cent of young people in the rural region unemployed, compared to just 13.3 per cent in the nation. Youth unemployment was 19.4 is. per cent for the region in March, a shocking statistic, compared to only 12.7 per cent for the nation. In April the unemployment rate for youth was 14.4 per cent in my area and just 10.9 per cent for the nation. So let us really quote what is happening out there. National statistics are like damned lies when you do not burrow down and see what is actually happening on the ground. No developed nation, surely, can tolerate such a difference in life chances and life experience between those who live in the more favoured places in the capital cities and those who live in the places beyond the suburbs, beyond the tram tracks, beyond the access to public transport and beyond the places where I acknowledge there are jobs still being generated in some sectors but those sectors are basically places like Centrelink dealing with the unemployed. I have to tell you that, according to the national statistics for retail sales, people are also showing an extreme lack of enthusiasm for going out and borrowing more right now or buying the essentials. Only the food category showed a small increase in retail sales as per the ABS statistics. I am appalled and shocked, too, that this motion refers to the 'knowledge economy'. We all know that NAPLAN is a farce-it is not a sensible way to measure your children's increasing knowledge across the nation-but we already have NAPLAN indicating that there is a substantial drop in literacy, numeracy and people being able to interpret literature. We are failing in the OECD league tables when we are compared with some of our Asian developed neighbours in terms of our kids being able to understand and compete well in maths, science and overall literacy and numeracy. This government stands condemned for what it has done. (Time expired)",58
34,Mr HAYES,BILLS," congratulate the member for Petrie for bringing this matter before us. I notice that all those who have spoken from the opposite side of the chamber have failed to mention anything today about the OECD, the International Monetary Fund, the UN Human Development Index or any of those things which were embodied in the motion. Not once do you hear those opposite-the naysayers over there-saying anything in this place about the global financial crisis. When you think about it, we had the worse economic shock in over 60 years, and what we saw was many countries-particularly in Europe and America-suffering, and still suffering as they come through the worse of the global financial crisis. Recall, when that occurred in 2008, the position of those occupying the shadow Treasury benches opposite. Their position at that stage was, 'Wait and see how bad it gets.' That is all they could offer to the economic debate in this country. The International Monetary Fund is a reputable organisation that ranks Australia's performance in coming through the global financial shocks imposed by the global financial crisis as one of the best economies in the world. The Leader of the Opposition, when he travelled over to London, claimed that this country has serious bragging rights when it comes to our economic performance resulting from the handling of the economy. In contrast with that, all those opposite could offer was, 'Wait and see.' Based on other countries over there-and we read on a daily basis what is occurring in the European nations, whether they be Ireland, Greece, Spain or Italy-the average unemployment rate in the European countries is 10.5 per cent. The growth rate is effectively zero. Compare that with what we have here in this country: we have a 4.9 per I cent unemployment rate and we have positive growth. As a matter of fact, since the global financial crisis, our economy has increased by a further seven per cent. That is why the Leader of the Opposition can be confident, when he goes to London, in saying that this economy has serious bragging rights. This country has an economy that is $1.4 billion strong. For the first time last year we were recognised for this economic management. The economy has a AAA credit rating from each of the three major rating agencies. We do not hear that being said too often over the other side. They cannot claim that because it has never occurred before in Australia's history. Whilst adjustments needed to be made when coming through the economic crisis that required decisive management-and that is what I say occurred-they were not made at the expense of investing in schools and education and regional development. I am happy that in coming through the global financial crisis we doubled our commitment to education in this country. As regards the schoolkids bonus, in the short time. I have available I note that in the last couple of months in many areas in my electorate-which is predominantly Asianmany people who are entitled to the education tax refund did not apply because they understood they were not entitled. They did not have jobs and they did not pay tax; therefore their children were missing out. We also discovered that in excess of 10 per cent of families that are eligible for the education tax refund missed out over the last two years. So in coming through the global financial crisis we have, like Mr Abbott indicates, serious bragging rights, and I encourage some of those opposite to read some of the international statistics when it comes down to- (Time expired) Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (11:57): To start with, I am very concerned about the entire premise of this motion. We have heard in this chamber the members for Petrie and Canberra compare Australia's economic performance with that of Spain to suggest that we are doing well. That reminds me of a friend I once had who would down eight schooners in a day and did not think he had a problem because he compared himself with other alcoholics who would down a dozen or more. That is what this government has come in this chamber to do today: to compare Australia's performance with Spain and say we are doing well. I say we are here in the Asian century, and we should not be comparing ourselves with broken-down European nations who are now paying the penalty for engaging in decades of reckless and unsustainable spending, the type of which we have seen from this government over the last four years. Instead, we should be comparing ourselves with our Asian neighbours and other similar countries with resources like Australia's. By that comparison our performance over the last four years has been very ordinary. Take Singapore, for example; its current unemployment is just 2.1 per cent, less than half of ours here in Australia. Because Singapore has been banking surpluses year after year, this year it will enjoy $7 billion return on those investments. In contrast, this year, thanks to Labor's deficits, we will have to pay out $7 billion in interest payments. This motion also gives us the opportunity to look at the reason Australia has not descended into the basket case that is Spain. The answer is simple: it is because the last coalition government paid off the debt it inherited from the previous Labor government. It paid off every single cent of that $96 billion that the previous Labor government left, and it also paid back the interest on that-a further $50 billion. Let us not forget that this was done during difficult international times. It was done through the Asian financial crisis. It was done through the tech wreck of 2001 and it was done following the terrorist attacks of September 11. But we have seen what has happened in just four short years of this Labor government which, thanks to its reckless and wasteful spending, has run up the four largest deficits in this nation's history: a cumulative total of $174 billion. We have heard the government's speakers parrot the line, 'Don't worry-we are returning the budget to surplus.'",60
35,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," It being 12 noon, in accordance with standing order 34, the debate is interrupted. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Member for Dobell Mr CRAIG THOMSON (Dobell) (12:00): Madam Deputy Speaker. I seek leave to make a statement. Leave granted. Mr CRAIG THOMSON: 'Go cut your in wrists or, better still, hang yourself.' 'Go out the back, cut your throat-that's the only way.' 'Have you slashed your wrists yet?' 'You are dead. A bullet between the eyes will save taxpayers' money.' 'You have unleashed the lynch mob and you have fanned it and for that you're, ultimately, responsible.' These are the types of emails, letters and phone calls that my family, my staff and I have received. Since these allegations were first raised I have consistently and on many occasions made it clear that I have done nothing wrong. I have, in fact, wanted to make a statement for some time but sought counsel, sought advice, from a variety of people-including legal advice-and took that advice not to make a statement. Can I say that is something that I probably regret in hindsight. I did not realise that this was going to go four years, but once that decision is taken, of course, then the next opportunity to speak really is when a report is concluded-and Fair Work have done that. In making this statement. I am very conscious that in the eyes of many of the public I have already been charged, convicted and sentenced. The public will hold these views because of the quite extraordinary media coverage which has taken place. I, like every member of this House, understand and value the importance of an independent and robust news media and the important place that it can play in our democracy. However, all of us who have regular dealings with the news media know that the news media can often get it wrong, and sometimes seriously so-particularly as today the media is dominated by selfimportant commentators, not reporters, and I will say a little bit more about that later. think it is important to once again remind the House that I have not been the subject of any conviction, not even the subject of any legal proceedings; none of the allegations have been tested in any court or tribunal. I am going to bore you a little bit now because I am going to talk a little bit about my history-my work history. One of the things that my friends say to me is, 'We read about this Craig Thomson; we don't know who that person is because we see a very different person-we know you in a very different way.' So I am going to take some time and talk about, firstly, the young industrial officer who joined the Health Services Union and worked there for 19 years. Can I say that, despite the coverage, 'unions' is not a dirty word. Unions are a very good thing and are very much part of this country's history and culture and have made enormous contributions to the well-being of ordinary Australians over many years. My first job at the university was as an industrial officer and I used to look after university workers. Can I say that I still get regular letters of support from people like Richard Black at the University of Sydney, Ellis Skinner at the University of New England and Ted Davies at Macquarie University. I was very proud of the work that I did representing general staff at universities around the country. I am also very proud of a lot of the work that I have done at the union. I was able to personally prosecute, in the Industrial Relations Commission, the first ever award for radiographers working in private practice. I was responsible for the first national agreement with what was then the Mayne Health private hospital chain, later becoming Ramsay Health Care. I have spent a great deal of my time, both when I was at the New South Wales branch and nationally, looking after aged care workers and, in particular, looking at making sure So I that we can try and push for better staffing levels-minimum staffing levels-in aged care so that the elderly, the most vulnerable, are guaranteed some level of support and care in those places. I am particularly proud of two issues, the first of which is negotiating the first ever staffing level agreement for ambulance officers in New South Wales. My friends the ambulance officers and paramedics on the Central Coast tell me, of course, that this agreement, which was only meant to last for 10 weeks because it was the first time it was there, is still in operation some 10 years after it came in. Guys, it does need to be updated and upgraded, but it is good that there is a floor that is there. The other issue that I am particularly proud of is that when I first joined the union there was a 17 per cent pay increase over three years for New South Wales public sector workers, particularly the cooks, the cleaners-those most in need. Seventeen per cent over three years is a very big increase. They certainly deserved it and they certainly deserve more. So I have had nothing, can I say, but letters of support many HSU members, both past and present. One would think, given the media coverage and certainly from some of the emails that I have had, that the allegations against me were made while I was a member of parliament. Of course that is not the case. These are allegations that arise from my time at the Health Services Union many years ago. But it is worth talking about my wonderful electorate and the people who live there. Since 2007 we have been able to achieve some great things. It is important to point out that, in 2010, there was a swing to me in that seat based on the good work that we had been able to do in that electorate-a swing to me when there was a big swing against Labor in New South Wales. We have been able to achieve more than $330 million in funding for my electorate since 2007. That is more money that has been spent on infrastructure in the last five years than in total for the whole time that that seat has existed, since 1984. There are a whole range of projects, and I will just list them briefly. The schools project, of course: over $100 million. Trade training centres: $13 million. The Apprentice Kickstart program. The Central Coast campus of the university-a campus that was brought about under a Labor government in the first place: $20 million. Very importantly, the Mardi to Mangrove pipeline: $80 million, making sure that the Central Coast was drought-proof. We got down to 13 per cent of our water supply. A Labor government made sure that those issues never happen again. Two brand new surf clubs. Major clean-up of Tuggerah Lakes: some $20 million over five years. $10 million for a centre of sports excellence. A GP superclinic that I know is often derided here, but can I tell you: the people in my electorate are very proud of having a GP superclinic, which has been used ever since it opened, some months after it was from promised, on a temporary basis. We have given money for netball courts so that Wyong can hold state championships for a first time. We have upgraded parks around the area. We have made sure that our parks have disability access for children. I fought and stood against opening the Wallarah coalmine and continue to be committed to making sure that that coalmine does not upset the pristine environment in which it was proposed to be built. And, of course, we now have the NBN rollout. So, for those of you who have only seen Craig Thomson through the eyes of some of the media glare, these are the things that have been occupying me every day, every night in my electorate-things that I am very proud of and things that I think stand my electorate in the Central Coast in a much better position than when I was first elected. I want to now go to the HSU national office, which I moved down to and was elected to take over in 2002. I moved to Melbourne to be there because that was where the national office was at that stage. This was a union that had a very poor history of factional infighting. It had started, I think, with left against left, which became left against right, which became right against right. The only common practice was that the HSU was the battleground for these political fights. When I took over as national secretary the debt levels in the national union were close to $1 million. There was no accountability for the way in which money was spent. The rules of the union at that stage set out national council would meet only once every two years and that at that particular meeting you could have proxy votes. So half a dozen people would sit around once every two years and that was the accountability. It rarely had national executive meetings. They rarely met. It did not have budgets. The reason this was the case was, of course, because the union rules make sure that the national secretary has broad powers. Rule 32(n) says that 'between meetings of the national executive control and conduct' of the business is in the hands of the national secretary. So, if you do not want to have transparency, you do not have meetings. If you do not want to be accountable, you do not have meetings. So what did I do when I went down there in relation to these issues? One of the first things I did was make sure the rules of the organisation were changed. I made the rules so that national executive meetings had to happen every four years. I changed the way in which a national council meeting took place. They became national conferences every year with rank and file delegates at which the finances of the union were presented and the auditor was available for questions. There was specific time set aside. I put into the rules a finance committee so that a finance committee had to meet and had to approve budgets. But even that I did not think was enough, because there was a very broad rule saying the secretary could still do whatever they needed to do. So at one of the very early executive meetings I set a delegation of how much the national secretary could spend without reference to those bodies. So we put further issues of transparency in place. The reason I am saying these things is because, if your modus operandi was about ripping off an organisation, you would do none of that, because the rules enabled that the you-when I went there-to do whatever you liked and be virtually unaccountable. By putting those accounting practices in, that meant that there was accountability, and you would not do that if you were seeking to avoid scrutiny. Was it perfect? Were these A-1, benchmark accounting practices that you would put in place? Of course they were not, but we came from a position of absolute zero where there was nothing, where there were not meetings, and you have to start somewhere. So the HSU was a work in progress. These were the things that were put in place. You have to ask who was not happy with this. There were two large branches that were not happy with this, and those are the New South Wales branch and the Victorian branch of my former union. That is because they did not like this scrutiny. In fact, I was approached by the now national secretary, Kathy Jackson, and Michael Williamson, saying: 'What are you doing? Why don't you just collect your salary and do nothing?' 'And do nothing'-that was what they expected you to do in relation to these issues. We will be coming to the Fair Work Australia report shortly, but the Fair Work report's allegations are largely based on allegations-I repeat, allegations-made by two people: Kathy Jackson and Michael Williamson. One of the issues with Fair Work Australia is the weight that has been given to those allegations. I raise these next points only in the context of the weight that Fair Work gave to those allegations. You have to look at what standing these people have if you give weight to the allegations. Kathy Jackson drives a union-paid-for Volvo. It is alleged she has child-care and gym fees paid for by the union. These are issues that I am raising that are on the public record; this is not something that I am seeking to use privilege for that is not already out there. She has had numerous overseas trips, none of which, as national secretary, I was aware visited any unions. Within weeks after I left, her salary almost doubled from the salary that I received, allegedly now being around some $270,000. She sat on the board of HESTA, collecting board fees for many years, rarely attending meetings. But when the union decided the board fee should go to the union, she left the board. She got an $84,000 golden handshake from her branch when they merged and formed the HSU East branch of the union, the branch that is in so much trouble and the subject of so many inquiries. She rarely attended national executive meetings, and when she did it was to have her name marked off and then she would leave. That is the record of this person, someone who wants to address the HR Nicholls Society in relation to where she is. She may have had a conversion on the road to Damascus-and I will come to those sorts of things later-but this certainly is not someone who comes to this issue with clean hands. She is also accused, of course, most seriously-and again this was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald and is the subject of a police investigation-of paying money to contractors and then receiving it back privately with it being paid to her. She is entitled to the presumption of innocence in relation to those issues, but they are issues that she has to answer for. The other person is Mr Williamson. There has been a great deal of coverage following the release of the Temby report in relation to the activities there. These are the two people who primarily put those allegations. The Fair Work report, can I point out, is the report of one man on the national office of the union. Its so-called findings amount to no more than assertions. I find it curious that after four years of work, $1 million in external legal fees, the general manager of Fair Work Australia was not prepared to release the report publicly, apparently because she had a concern that it may be defamatory. She instead released it to a Senate committee so it would be protected by parliamentary privilege. Given that truth remains a defence to defamation in this country, this suggests that Fair Work Australia either does not consider the report to be accurate or considers it incapable of substantiation by admissible evidence or both. I think it should also be of concern, to any person who considers the effective and efficient regulation of Australia's industrial relations system is important, that Fair Work Australia has also announced it will now spend $450,000 of taxpayers' money with a major accounting firm to investigate its own incompetence in relation to dealing with this matter. Fair Work Australia itself makes the point, on page 133 at paragraph 33, that the general manager or his delegate is not a court and is not bound by the rules of evidence. Can I say that I also find it quite disturbing that the Senate committee, when presented with a 1,100-page report that Fair Work Australia was not prepared to stand by, spent half a day looking at it before they released it to the public. I think there are issues in relation to those processes and procedures that need to be questioned. I have seen in many, many articles the word 'forensic' when people are describing the Fair Work report. The definition of forensic is: 'relating to or denoting … scientific methods and techniques to the investigation of crime; relates to courts of law'. In its own words, Fair Work Australia said it is not bound by the rules of evidence. As I said, it took four days for the Commonwealth DPP to say that this report was not forensic, that there was not a body of evidence. Rather than forensic, Mr Nassios, the delegate, was selective and biased. He was so biased, in fact, that I had to write to the general manager last year asking for his removal from this position. Mr Nassios had an outcome that he wanted to achieve and he was trying to link assertions. There was no body of evidence that supported his position. This can be borne out by the witnesses that he did not speak to; more than half a dozen that we suggested should be spoken to. In fact, there are only four members of the union's finance committee and this is an investigation into the finances of the union. He only spoke to two of them. He took four years and could only get around to two of the finance members. One wonders what he was doing. I myself had only one interview with Fair Work Australia, close to two years ago. That was it: one interview, two years ago. In relation to Fair Work Australia and the report, the opposition have made much, some months ago, although they seem to have changed their tune since the report has come down, about the competence or the interference in relation to the writing of Fair Work report. We were regaled here daily at question time about what role the government played in interfering with this report and making sure that the member for Dobell was protected. I make it absolutely clear that I do not think I was done any favours by a report taking four years to get there. I am very surprised that that point not made by anyone in the media over the four years. You continued to write the drivel that was coming from this side about some advantage to the Labor government in taking their time on a report. It is manifestly obvious that that is not the case. I think the better questions, if you are looking at interference and the questions that need to be answered, relate to Ms Jackson's partner. Rarely has it been raised in the media that her partner is the second in charge of Fair Work Australia. He did not stand aside from the body that was investigating these issues. The main accuser's partner is second in charge. The questions Fair Work has to answer, the questions the deputy president has to answer, are: what influence did he have in relation to the writing of the report? What influence did he have in terms of the time line that it has taken? What relationship, if any, does he have with the Liberal Party? This is a person who has been accused in writing-and a letter has gone to the President of Fair Work Australia-of interference in that branch. So someone in the union has gone to the level of actually writing to the President of Fair Work Australia and saying, 'This person has interfered in the branch.' They are very serious accusations and they need to be addressed. One of the other issues that I find curious is that there were two investigations: an investigation into the national office of the union and an investigation into the Victorian the office of the union. In relation to the Victorian office, there were credit cards which showed expenditure on escorts and prostitutes for at least two officials. Yet it is very curious that when the Fair Work report came out on the Victorian branch there was barely a mention. There are certainly no allegations, no findings of wrongdoing. One was has to question why, in an investigation by Fair Work where the second in charge of Fair Work Australia's partner, their former husband, is the subject of that investigation, there is a different approach taken when it is looking at the national office. I also think it is passing strange that the delegate and DP Lawler are both on leave at the moment. I want to go to the specific issues raised by Fair Work Australia. I will leave the one that I think most people are interested in until the end. That way I know that you are still going to listen. Many of the breaches in the Fair Work Act are because the delegate has misconstrued the rules of the organisation. He has construed the rules as saying that there was not approval for expenditure by the national secretary. That is despite the rules being very clear that there is. For example, he uses the issue of staff salary and the ability to appoint staff. It in the face of the rules, the law and, most importantly, the fact that these issues were in budgets that were approved on a quarterly basis by the union, every quarter that I was the national secretary. They were there, they showed the expenditure and they were approved. Can I say that, of the 150 allegations that deal with me, that deals with well over 100 in that broad position. The second area that he raises, which is clearly an illogical argument, is that he says the national secretary was responsible for formulating policies in relation to a whole range of issues. There is nowhere in the law, in the regulations, in the legislation that says an individual in a trade union or any organisation is responsible for formulating these particular policies. If there is someone that is responsible then it is the union that is responsible. To pick out an individual at a particular point in time clearly is manifestly wrong in relation to a way in which you can construct these issues. But he then takes the great leap forward and says because there were not policies and there was behaviour in relation to these issues then that in itself breach, and that is clearly wrong. The second area that he raises is in relation to travel and expenses. I note, of course, that the delegate travels business class and stays at five-star hotels in terms of his own travel. In reaching some conclusions in terms of the allegations about misuse of union money on travel and expenses, the delegate used the tax table to decide what was reasonable. There is a real argument as to whether that is appropriate in the first place, but you know what? He used the wrong tax table. If he had actually used the right tax table then there was no issue. So he did not even get that right when he was looking at what was appropriate. In relation to spousal travel, we did not have a policy in relation to spousal travel. flies Should we have? Of course we should have. It would have been appropriate to do that. But the spousal travel was two return trips a year. Everyone who sits in this place gets far more family and spousal travel than I took in the five years that I was national secretary. So, if you want to gauge what is reasonable, then let's look at the ordinary test in relation to those issues. The whole section in relation to the federal election I will come to later, because quite clearly the AEC report that was released last week blows a massive credibility hole in everything that Fair Work Australia did. While those areas have covered primarily almost every allegation that is there, there seems to be this mysterious thought that there was this extra pot of money that I could take cash withdrawals out from that was not accounted for by the union, that was somehow separate to everything else. This quite simply flies in the face of the facts that were there. We made it clear, and the evidence was clear, as was set out by the financial controller at the time when she was interviewed by Fair Work is a Australia, that cash withdrawals-this is what she said-were 'appropriately accounted for and imported into MYOB'. They were part of the union accounts-these accounts and budgets that went to the executive. Her replacement went on to say, 'Further, records for cash withdrawals were retained.' There is also evidence from the financial controller who was there some months after I left that that documentation was all there and present when she left. As I said, that was many months after I had been there. Are cash withdrawals going to get you a prize from the accounting college as being your best way of dealing with these issues? Probably not. But the issues with cash withdrawals were that it was the mode of spending not the accountability, not what it was spent on, not the receipts that were there-none of those issues are borne out by any of the evidence. The evidence, if someone were looking at the evidence and clearly Fair Work were not, was that they were accounted for. They were in the union's records and they were appropriately receipted. If they disappeared, then you need to look at explanations why-and I will come to that shortly. Turning to credit cards and escorts, I have consistently from day one denied any wrongdoing in relation to these issues. I make it clear-and I hope I have already by painting a picture-that I had many enemies in the HSU, many enemies who did not like increased transparency, many enemies who preferred that there be no national office. I was the subject on numerous occasions of threats and intimidation. I had my door of my office graffitied. The national office shared an office with other Victorian branches of the Health Services Union. There was, though, a particular threat that was made that I thought was just part of the routine threats that were constantly made in working in this environment. That was a threat by Marco Bolano in words to the effect that he would seek to ruin any political career that I sought and would set me up with a bunch of hookers. This was a threat that started in Kathy Jackson's office. The rant went right down the corridor and was witnessed by many people. It was then also the subject of a report. A letter was written the Jacksons and to Michael Williamson complaining about this incident and putting, very importantly, this instance on recordon record when it occurred that there was this threat. Later on, some years later, Michael Williamson said in front of a few witnesses, 'This is the way we deal with people in the Health Services Union when we have problems.' So we have the threat and, post facto, we have an admission. But Williamson went further. In the Daily Telegraph, a week ago on Saturday, he actually said he knew about this and it was commonplace in Victoria in relation to this union. So he made that absolutely clear. Of the seven occasions that are set out, three of them could not be me. There are alibis: on two occasions my being with other people, and on one occasion being in Perth and not being in Sydney for the month around the alleged incident. I know that sitting up there we have a whole range of CSI journalists who think that they are the Inspector Clouseaus of the world-or perhaps that is how they really are-and they make these assumptions rather than report issues that are there. I want to try to help you with a couple of key areas that you have had difficulties with. The account details of my credit cards were known. They were reported. Everyone knew what my credit card account numbers were. As for my drivers licence, can I say that there has been a deliberate and massive attempt to paint me in a different light by Fairfax by printing in the paper a copy of my drivers licence and making it appear as if a copy of that drivers licence was there on these occasions. That is not what the evidence is. The evidence is that my drivers licence number was written on three of those particular chits. Let us take a common sense thing which we all know occurs. If you are to asked for an ID and you have a photo ID, you hold it up. The person looks at your face. They look at the drivers licence and they say, 'Yes, that is you.' They do not then go and say that they need to write down details of this and put it there. That just does not happen. Can I suggest that of all places for it not to happen would be when you are seeking those sorts of services where, presumably, a degree of anonymity is what is being sought. My drivers licence was also commonly available and on the records there at the union where it was needed for a variety of things including right-of-entry permits. What is interesting is that we have been informed that at these types of establishments they have to keep film footage of people who go in and out-for six years in New South Wales. I raised two years ago this issue with Fair Work Australia and said, 'Get the footage. See who was there on those days.' Fair Work Australia were not interested. It did not fit their story. Today I have spoken the Victoria Police and I have urged them to go and get the records, get the footage from the cameras and see who was there. At the very least, they should be able to say that I was not there when they look at those records. The most vexing thing for me and the most difficult thing in terms of making an explanation about these issues is-and can I say again: this is not a court of law and in this country we do actually have the presumption of innocence-explaining one's innocence and making out a case in relation to that, which for good reason is much more difficult and that is why we have that presumption at law in Australia. One of the things that I have difficulties in making an explanation about-and I am certainly not going to use parliamentary privilege to lie or change that-is in relation to phones and how records were on my phones. I do not have an explanation so that I can neatly say, 'This is what definitively happened. I know that this happens.' But that should not be unusual. What is important is that Fair Work Australia did not investigate any other scenario at all. There are numerous scenarios as to how this could occur. For example, on many occasions, I would book all the hotel rooms at a particular conference that we would have. I do not know whether or not I did on these nights. I do not have access to those records. That is why we have the presumption of innocence. I cannot go back and say what actually happened there. But these things were not looked at by Fair Work Australia. They did not look at whether there was a bulk of rooms. Quite often I would book a bulk of rooms for a national conference or for a national executive meeting. The second issue of course is in relation to to phone cloning or various other issues as to how it is described. Identity theft in Australia and around the world is not new. It might be a shock to some people in the gallery to write about it, but it is certainly not a shock to those who deal in the law and who deal with this every day. I am going to read a very short extract from a lawyer who contacted me-a very senior barrister in New South Wales. He gives an example of a situation. He says: Drug dealer A rings on a mobile phone drug dealer B. The police have interception warrants on the phone of drug dealers A and B. Drug dealer A, while sitting in a coffee shop, makes the call to B and the call is lawfully intercepted. However, when the police ask the mobile carrier to provide a record the record shows the call did not emanate from phone A but from another phone-phone C. This is something that the Federal Police and our police authorities know is a very common issue and something that can happen in relation to criminals and people acting outside the law. Certainly, if you are looking to set someone up, it is a very easy process. I have here 30 or 40 pages from various websites saying how easy it is. In three steps, you can have someone else's phone number on a different account. The issue, I am saying, is that these things were not looked at by Fair Work Australia. One of the other issues is that it was said there was a phone call made from Bateau Bay to one of these escort services. I moved to Bateau Bay in 2009, which is four and a bit years after this alleged phone call took place. I was not even living on the Central Coast when this phone call took place. I do not know how that phone record is on my record. But, again, one would have thought that these would have been things that Fair Work would have looked at. People might say, 'Well, this is a great conspiracy theory and it is just about escorts and those sorts of things,' but it is more that. The current national secretary of the union is accused of destroying documentsdocuments that even Fair Work say were there when I left as the national secretary. She also took a deliberate strategy of lodging late things like AEC returns, so that people on that side of the parliament could raise accusations saying, 'There are all sorts of problems with Mr Thomson's electoral spending,' when quite clearly the AEC have said that is not necessarily the case at all-in fact, have said it is not the case. The union settled with me. They paid my entitlements-which, for a period of time, they decided to freeze while they did an internal investigation into whether or not was right. When they finished their investigation they not only paid me my full entitlements; they also paid me in relation to a defamation case that I had against them. Can I make it absolutely clear that the union have never written to me, have never commenced an action, have never said, ' Mr Thomson, you owe us money,' and they have never put anything in writing. I do not even have an email saying, ' Mr Thomson, you have ripped off the union; you owe us this money.' I have not had one bit of correspondence from the union setting that out. If a so-called whistleblower is uncovering corruption, the very first thing they would do is say, 'Give us back the money you took.' That is the very first thing they would do. The very last thing they would do is not write to the person that they accuse of that. I think it is an extraordinary thing that the so called whistleblower's first action was to talk to the media-not to actually seek the return of the money, not to say that there has been some wrongdoing, but to talk to the media about assassinating my reputation. If you look at the threats made about than setting me up, the confirmation that it happens, the flimsy evidence that Fair Work have tried to put together in relation to that, the fact that someone has destroyed documents and that they have put in late lodgements, that they settled with me and paid me money afterwards and that they have never, ever asked me to repay a cent in relation to these issues, one can see a pattern, a very strong pattern, that this exercise is about getting someone, not anything else. The other thing of course is that they got what they wanted. I remind the House that earlier in this speech I made the point that they said, 'Why don't you just take the salary and do nothing? Don't bring in these this transparency issues.' And when I left, what happened? There is now no national office of the HSU. It has been taken over-they have formed this super HSU East branch-and it does not exist. They got what they wanted. They set out to take these things away, and that is why the vast majority of the secretaries of the still existing branches of the HSU, who want to have a full-time office, do not support Kathy Jacksonbecause they know what has happened. But do not just take my defence in relation to this. What investigations have taken place, and what have they found? The New South Wales Police said: The assessment follows a letter sent to the New South Wales Police Force by Senator George Brandis SC, raising a number of allegations in relation to the use of the corporate credit provided to Mr Thomson by the Health Services Union. They went on to say: There was no evidenceNot 'not enough'to warrant a formal investigation by the New South Wales Police. But they have had a further go at it, because these allegations seem to be on the rotisserie cycle of 'bring them up as much as you can'. On 2 May this year, following a raid on HSU East by the police, Detective Superintendent Col Dyson, Commander of the New South Wales Fraud and Cybercrime Squad, was asked by one of the journalists if he had a copy of the Fair Work report. He said 'yes'. The only person who had been calling for the police to get a copy of that Fair Work report had been me. So he had a copy of the Fair Work report, and he made the comment that he had read it and the allegations were not of a criminal nature. I think perhaps the most damaging investigation for this Fair Work report is by the AEC, released last week. They made a number of points. On page 3 they said: Most of these commentsby Fair Work Australiahave overlooked the specific requirements in sections 304, and 309 of the Electoral Act. They are pointing out that the investigator did not even know what to look for in terms of the investigation. At page 5 they point out that, under the cover of a letter to the AEC, Ms Jackson lodged these AEC returns late. They also point out that none of the returns was subject to any qualification, meaning that there was no qualification as to why she was late. There was no reason. She put no explanation into being late. There is a particular provision of the act, section 318, that card specifically says that if you do not have access to the documents, if there is a problem with the documents, you can put them in late. She did not do that. At page 9 the AEC points out that paragraphs 151 to 162 of the Fair Work Act refer to: … postage expenses at the Long Jetty campaign office totalling $9,574.17 that were incurred after May 2007. The Fair Work report says: Mr Thomson … as „ALP Candidate‟ it seems probable that Mr Thomson purchased … the … stamps and … envelopes for mail-out purposes associated with Mr Thomson‟s campaign for Dobell. The AEC say: The actual evidence to support this conclusion is not apparent … And they make the obvious point that it could well have been spent on the Your Rights at Work campaign, a campaign run by the unions right around the country to get rid of some of the most draconian industrial legislation in this country, of which one of the targeted seats was Dobell. Page 11 of the AEC report says: Such comments have overlooked the facts in the FWA Report which disclose that some of her duties'her' being one of the staff members who Fair Work says must have been used for my political purposes, were to work on the Your Rights at Work campaign. On page 11 of the report the AEC report says that, irrespective of the characterisation of a particular organisation in the Fair Work report, Fair Work have got it wrong. They are saying, irrespective of the way Fair Work did it, they have reached the conclusion that this particular body: … was not an “associated entity” under the Electoral Act due to its activities I think one of the things that I regret most about this issue in terms of the attacks made was an attack on an organisation called Dads in Education. This is an organisation that no longer exists. It used to make sure that dads would come along and read stories to their kids in the first week of Literacy Week in the schools. Our union made a donation to it. The conclusion that Fair Work Australia reached was that it must have been for my personal benefit, my personal gain. As the AEC points out, there is no evidence as to what publicity, what arrangements-what the member for Dobell got out of that particular issue at all. I regret greatly that there has been any attention on what was a terrific organisation doing a great job, trying to make sure that fathers played a greater role in their kids' school education, particularly in an area like mine where we have a lot of commuters who do not have that opportunity. The AEC report has destroyed the credibility of the Fair Work investigation. It took three weeks for the AEC to come up with the truth, to come up with the real reasons, whereas it has taken Fair Work Australia four years to muck around on an investigation that is clearly wrong. I want to talk briefly about the separation of powers and the presumption of innocence. Members of this House have a clear obligation to uphold and respect the rule of law. I think it should be of great concern to all Australians that the Leader of the Opposition has said that I am not entitled to the presumption of innocence because I am clearly guilty. I think that the Leader of the Opposition's concept of guilt means trial and conviction by media, and it suggests that, if he were to become Prime Minister, populism rather than principle, assertion rather proof, would be the guiding principles of his and operations. government. The statements and the conduct of a number of his senior colleagues also suggest that the rule of law under any future coalition government would be a discretionary concept, to be readily put aside if it served their base political objectives to do so. I say this looking at the number of MPs, current and past who are alive, who have had either criminal or civil charges brought against them and the treatment that they have had in the various parliaments around Australia. I am not going to go through the list but, can I sponsorship tell you, it is many, many pages, including at least half a dozen of you sitting here. I am going to talk briefly about the media. There are many, many good people in the media. There are many good people who do a terrific job and I am going to mention some of those people, so that is probably going to be a blot on their CV for evermore-people like Mark Simkin from the ABC; Simon Benson from the Telegraph; Phillip Coorey from the Sydney Morning Herald; Paul Bongiorno from Channel 10; Kieran Gilbert from Sky News; Latika Bourke, sitting there; and Laurie Oakes. People would have seen the Laurie Oakes interview. That was a very hard interview, but Laurie Oakes is someone that I respect and he gave the opportunity to put a case. That is what you expect from journalism. What you do not expect from journalists is the 12 stories that have been written about me in the Fairfax media without coming to me for a comment, without seeking my side at all. What you do not expect is for Channel 7 reporters to be hovering underneath the bathroom window while my pregnant wife is having a shower. There is a great responsibility in reporting. You need to take that seriously. I would like to read a couple of comments from Greg Barns, who wrote on the Drum: That the presumption of innocence has been trashed by the media and those who feed them can be gleaned by the constant use of phrases words which connote guilt. … … … But what 'scandal'? A scandal surely connotes that some facts have been established which the ordinary person would think constitutes outrageous or …illegal conduct. … … … The Australian media is, like its American and British counterparts, obsessed with titillation, hounding individuals, and giving credence to any allegation made against a person who is in the spotlight. These are things we all have to guard against, these are things you have responsibility for-and can I say you have not done a very good job. The replacement of journalists with commentators: I make a reference to a commentator that is often described as being from 'the Labor side of politics', a person who was involved or was a player in relation to negotiations with myself and Fairfax over a defamation issue. A person who wants to be a commentator needs to make it clear that they are actually a participant in this process, they are not just a commentator; and to do otherwise is both dishonest and misleading and something that we need to guard against. Can I say in relation to the Fairfax defamation issue, because a lot of stuff has been written about that and people have made comments, that I did not receive money from Fairfax in relation to that agreement and perhaps my use of language in saying it was a 'settlement' rather than an agreement could have been better done. Part of the agreement, though, was to withdraw the defamation action. It was an agreement. I did not go off and suddenly decide I should withdraw it. Why did I do it? I did it for two reasons. One, this was a minority government, it was just after the election, and issues of stability were important. I was and advised, and I took the advice, that it would be in the best interests of the government if we could have these things dealt with. I was also advised that three weeks of front-page news while the case went ahead would not be good for me or my family. Can I say, in hindsight, I wish for just three weeks of front-page news in terms of this. Can I also say that was a mistake I made, in reaching that agreement, and that is a mistake that I do not intend to make again with these matters. I have obviously got a little emotional here, so I am going to truncate the last bit of this. There are many, many people I would like to thank who have stood by me: family; friends; my staff, who are here; and the people of the Central Coast. For the first time, in the last few weeks I have felt very anxious and nervous about walking into shopping centres. That is what we do, but I have felt affected by that. But for the welcome, but for the understanding of my constituents it would be impossible. The effect that this has had over four years on my health and mental health probably is evident. It is something that people need to be very conscious of when they go off on a witchhunt, without evidence, based on just accusations. This should never again happen. We should never be in this situation again where the rule of law is trashed completely by a parliament. What do you think you are doing here? Are we going to have parliament ruled by the mob? Are we setting ourselves up as some sort of junta, where a majority decision of a parliament can suddenly override anyone's rights? Is that the kind of Australia that you want? I was reminded by someone of a quote from To Kill a Mockingbird: But there is one way in this country in which all men are created equal-there is one human institution that makes a pauper the equal of a Rockefeller, the stupid man the equal of an Einstein, and the ignorant man the equal of any college president. That institution, gentlemen, is a court … Our courts have their faults, as does any human institution, but in this country our courts are the great levellers, and in our courts all men are created equal. That applies in this country, and you have trashed that. What you have done is not just damage to an individual or their family. You have damaged democracy and you continue to damage democracy, and you should hang your head in shame for that. What it shows of the Leader of the Opposition, that man, is that not only is he unfit to be a prime minister; in my view, he is unfit to be an MP.",61

57,Mr ALBANESE,PRIVILEGE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (13:29): Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to raise with you a matter of privilege concerning the member for Hughes and his apparent failure to comply with the resolution of the House which requires members to register certain private interests. A resolution is in place requiring all members to register certain interests and to report changes to those interests within 28 days, as you are aware. Any member who fails to provide an accurate declaration of their interests or fails to report changes within the required time frame is guilty of a serious contempt of the House. I have reason to believe that the member for Hughes has failed to honour his obligations under this resolution. I informed him earlier today that I would be raising this issue and, I must say, he proclaims his innocence of these matters. It appears the member may have failed to declare directorships of several on a point of order. I am loath to interrupt the Leader of the House when he is raising a matter of privilege, but the correct process to raise a matter of breach of the register of interests is exactly the way I did it, which is to write to the Chair of the Privileges Committee. As we have discussed before, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker have no role in whether this matter should be referred to the Privileges Committee.",78
58,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The Manager of Opposition Business is correct. If there is just an issue in respect of the register, the issue can be referred directly to the committee.",78
59,Mr ALBANESE,PRIVILEGE,"Yes, Madam Deputy Speaker, but it can also under the standing orders be raised with you.",78
60,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"It actually will not be raised with me; it will be raised with the Speaker. The Leader of the House has the right to raise the issue and he will be heard.  Deputy Speaker: the only purpose of raising a matter of prima facie breach of privilege with the Speaker or, in this case, the Deputy Speaker is so that the Speaker can afford it a motion to refer it to the Privileges Committee as a matter of priority. As there is no requirement to have a priority for such a motion, this is out of order.",78
61,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The Leader of the House has the right to raise the issue before the chair.,78
62,Mr ALBANESE,PRIVILEGE,"And I am. The member for Hughes may have failed to declare directorships of several companies, failed to declare potential liabilities arising from the collapse of a company with which he was involved, failed to declare possible criminal charges arising from that collapse and failed to declare that he has been practising as a solicitor at the same time as serving as a member of the House. For the benefit of the House, I will briefly outline the facts that I say potentially constitute contempt against the House. I refer to paragraph 2(d) of the House resolution.  it to you that this is a clear breach of the standing orders of the parliament. I raised a matter of privilege entirely in the way was instructed to do so under the standing orders. This is a gratuitous attack on one of the members of the House and it should be done using the proper process.",78
63,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I understand the concern of the Manager of Opposition Business. It is actually a matter of my response at the end of the Leader of the House's contribution.,79
64,Mr ALBANESE,PRIVILEGE,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The member for Hughes has failed to declare registered company directorships for several companies, including Homewares Depot Pty Ltd-the member was a director until 25 March 2011, but this was not declared. He was also the company secretary, but the member failed to declare this on his register of interests The member was a director of Valentino Franchising Pty Ltd until 25 March 2011 but failed to declare this. The member was a director of Valentino Home Fashion Pty Ltd until 8 March 2011, but once again the member failed to declare this. For the benefit of the House, I table an extract from the relevant Australian Securities and Investments Commission database documenting the member's involvement with the companies in question. I also refer to the member's statement of registrable interests for the 43rd Parliament lodged on 25 October 2010 and I table that document. At item 4 of that statement, 'Registered directorships of companies', the member has entered 'nil'. In contempt of the resolution of this House, the member has failed to declare the company directorships to which I have just referred. What is perhaps more concerning is the member's failure to notify the House of the shadow director role that he allegedly played in another company. In a report of February 2012, the liquidators of the member for that I Hughes's family company have raised questions about whether he was acting as a shadow director at the time of the collapse. These very serious questions were highlighted by reports appearing on the Crikey news website. DV Kelly Pty Ltd, for whom the member worked as an export manager prior to entering the parliament, closed its doors earlier this year. At the time of its collapse, DV Kelly Pty Ltd, the member's family company, owed $4 million to creditors. Worryingly, this includes $325,540 in unpaid wages, superannuation and leave owed to 12 ordinary Australian workers, and $760,000 owed to the Australian taxpayer through the Australian Taxation Office. The member might say the shadow too. directorship was too uncertain to require declaration under rules for company directors. This is a matter that the Privileges Committee will ultimately have to determine. However, even if the member were not required to declare his involvement with DV Kelly Pty Ltd under the rules for company directors, which I dispute, he was required to declare it under other Leader of the House is now putting his own version of events to do with this privileges matter. It is quite out of order for him to be debating this issue. He should be referring it to the Privileges Committee, as I did, and not smearing the member for Hughes in the parliament this way.",79
65,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The Leader of the House has the call and I would ask him to come to a conclusion.,79
66,Mr ALBANESE,PRIVILEGE,"Paragraph 2(m) provides that members must declare any interests of any kind where a conflict with their public duties could foreseeably arise or be seen to be arising. That is certainly the case here. The liquidators report that DV Kelly Pty Ltd may have been trading while insolvent, a grave allegation which could carry significant consequences, importantly for the ability of the member to continue his parliamentary career. Under the Corporations Act 2001, directors, including shadow directors, of companies trading while insolvent can face civil penalties of up to $200,000 and may be held personally liable for debts incurred. Recall that at the time of the collapse DV Kelly Pty Ltd owed $4 million to creditors. As you would be aware, under section 44(iii) of the Australian Constitution, any person who is an undischarged bankrupt is disqualified as a member of the House of Representatives. Ms Julie Bishop: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You asked the Leader of the House to come to a conclusion. He is now lecturing us on the Constitution. He is debating the issues. It is entirely inappropriate for him to conduct himself in this way in this House.",79
67,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The Leader of the House has the right to bring the issue before the chair but I would ask him to try and come to a resolution.,80
68,Mr ALBANESE,PRIVILEGE,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. That raises a serious issue with regard to the liabilities that could potentially be incurred there and, in addition, to the potential penalties to which they would be subject. Finally, we come to the question of the member for Hughes practising as a solicitor while at the same time serving as a member of the House. There have been reports that after ceasing employment with this company the member represented it in several outstanding legal matters. A search of court databases confirms the member's involvement in this litigation. I table another document. I refer the House again to the resolution concerning registration of interests, in particular paragraph 2(j), which provides that members must declare any substantial sources of income. If the member for Hughes was receiving any income as a result of his involvement in these legal proceedingseven if only costs were incurred in DV Kelly's favour-was this otherwise an interest that might conflict with the member's official duties within the meaning of paragraph 2(m) of the resolution? I submit the matters I have outlined today indicate the member for Hughes may have failed to satisfy his obligations under the resolution concerning registration of interests and in doing so may have committed a serious contempt against the House of Representatives. This is an issue that should be referred to the House Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. In my submission I ask that you consider these matters with a view to allowing precedence. I table the document.",80
69,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"In accordance with standing order 216, the matter can be referred directly to the House Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. I would ask the Leader of the House to write in that matter. NA Gambling Reform Committee Membership",80
70,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I have received a message from the Senate informing the House that Senator Back has been discharged from the Select Committee on Gambling Reform. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013 Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2011-2012 Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2011-2012 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,80
71,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEES," Just as the government sought to shut down debate on the member for Dobell, they are also in the business of shutting down debate about increasing the debt limit of the Commonwealth. I rise to speak on this package of appropriation bills that underpin the 2012-13 budget. These are the standard supply bills which allow for the appropriation of funds from consolidated revenue to fund the services and programs of the government and its Appropriation Bill (No. 5) and Appropriation Bill (No. 6) are supplementary estimates bills to provide funds for changes in previous estimates of program expenditure, variations on the timing of payments, forecast increases in program take-up, classifications and from policy decisions taken by the government since the last budget. The five bills are to be considered together as a whole and as a part of a cognate debate, and the terms of this were set by the government on budget night. I note the Leader of the House's comments in the media today that somehow this was a clever tactical move by the government to roll the debt bills into the appropriation bills and to have a procedural motion that the opposition did not vote against on budget night. Given this is the second time, perhaps with the BILLS benefit of hindsight, we should have created mayhem on budget night instead of the Treasurer and I engaging in public debate about the merits of the budget and the contents of the budget. That is what he is inviting us to do-to become an opposition that does not facilitate the smooth working of the House at a time when the House is under such enormous scrutiny on budget night but rather to set off a series of divisions. This just illustrates what the Labor government is doing. The most significant part of these bills is a bill that seeks to increase the limit of the Commonwealth's debt from $250 billion to $300 billion. Since Labor was elected, they have sought increases in the debt from zero to $75 billion then to $200 billion and then to $250 billion. Now they are saying they are living within their means but are also saying, 'Just in case, please give us an increase in the credit card limit to $300 billion.' It does not sound like a lot if you say it quickly but it is a hell of a lot of money that Australians have to repay. Enough is enough. agencies. The coalition is going to keep them to their promises. I will be moving a second reading amendment which will require the government to vary the terms of the debate to allow substantive amendments to be moved and debated in regard to Appropriation Bill (No. 2). If this succeeds, the coalition will then move to remove the debt ceiling provision from the bill. The quest for a debt ceiling increase is also the clearest evidence that the claim of returning the budget to surplus is a hoax. The budget cannot be in surplus if you are in spending more than you are receiving yet, under Labor, Australia's net debt and gross debt just keep increasing. The headline cash balance on page 36 of the budget overview shows exactly why debt keeps growing. It shows on the headline measure-and I am pleased Ross Gittins picked up on this point today-the only measure to include the NBN and CEFC, the budget would be in deficit every year until 2015-16 but it would be an $8.7 billion deficit for 2012-13, a point I have been making on numerous occasions since the budget was delivered. Further to this, we have a number of issues with this budget. The No. 1 issue in Australian politics today is trust. This budget lacks trust. It makes promises",81
72,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for North Sydney will have leave to continue his remarks at that time. NA Ryan Electorate: Return Serve Program Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (13:45): I rise today to speak about a not-for-profit organisation doing amazing things for the community in the Ryan electorate. Return Serve is a not-for-profit tennis organisation, which facilitates tennis opportunities for people who do not have the available resources to become involved in the sport. These may be people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, they may have a disability or they may be new to our country and still struggling to get on their feet. Tennis is one of those great sports that you can play and enjoy all your life, young and old, and is a great way to make new friends. The participants meet once a week and have access to top-level coaching and instruction. In addition, the program provides assistance to early career coaches in helping them attain higher certification levels. Queensland's young elite players also lend their skills to the program, providing them with an opportunity to give back to their sport. During National Volunteers Week, I was honoured to attend a Return Serve session at the Queensland Tennis Centre and present certificates to the volunteers involved in the program. It was inspiring to see the participants, who come from a range of backgrounds, enjoying an afternoon of tennis activities and coaching with the dedicated volunteers. I must commend the founder of Return Serve, Queensland's National Academy Head Coach, Dave Hodge, who is ably assisted by Gary Tupicoff, the Multicultural Development Association and Return Serve's volunteers, on the important work they are undertaking in our community. Bass Electorate: St Giles Society",82
73,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to congratulate a local disability provider in my electorate of Bass, St Giles. I recently had the great pleasure of making the pre-budget announcement of $6.8 million for paediatric services at St Giles, which will, in effect, benefit communities state-wide. St Giles Society will use the funding to redevelop the headquarters of the service, as well as implement modern e-health infrastructure. The investment will also help to fund the recruitment and training of allied health professionals in paediatric care. This is a big win for Launceston. Not only will this mean improved paediatric and disability services for all Tasmanians, but also the facilities will mean more health professionals are attracted to our great region. The funding is part of the government's Health and Hospitals Fund. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate St Giles on the fantastic work they do for people living with a disability in Tasmania and their families. I look forward to my continued work with St Giles CEO, Ian Wright, the management and staff, and the families that so greatly benefit from the support and services that St Giles provides now and into the future. Congratulations once again, and more power to St Giles! Practice Incentives Program Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (13:48): I have recently been contacted by the directors of the Biloela Medical Centre regarding their concerns over the lengthy delay in payments under the Practice Incentives Program. Biloela is a key township in the Dawson/Callide region of my electorate that relies heavily on its own local health services. They built these services with their own money. It has been brought to my attention that it has taken over seven months to receive payments they are entitled to under the program via Medicare, since the establishment of their practice in July 2011. The medical practice is absolutely vital town and surrounding areas-they are few and far between in these regions. Their staff are dedicated, loyal and committed to serving their community. The directors have tirelessly pursued this matter as these funds are vital to a start-up practice such as theirs. Their practice is being driven into the ground by lack of funds. They themselves have cited the biggest issue preventing them from solving the problem as being 'the lack of transparency and responsiveness of the agency'. It astounds me that such a practice could be under threat of closure due to such bureaucratic toing and froing. I urgently call on the health minister to examine the efficiency of the Practice Incentive Program to ensure that delays of payments do not threaten the survival of such medical practices. Cheedy, Mr Ned",82
74,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today in tribute to Yindjibarndi elder and custodian, Mr Cheedy, who died on 1 April 2012 at the great age of 105. With his long life, Mr Cheedy beat all the odds that have been stacked against Indigenous Australians since colonial times. He is a shining light his people and a motivational figure for this nation as we work to build on the 2008 Apology to the Stolen Generations and to improve the quality of life for Indigenous Australians. Born in 1907 on Hooley Station at Cheedy Creek in the WA Pilbara, Mr Cheedy became a skilled stockman and windmill man before moving to Roebourne for the education of his children. He was an inspirational, beloved leader renowned for his dedication to teaching young people about his country, preserving Yindjibarndi law, culture, and language, and caring about the future of his country and people, to the including helping with the successful Yindjibarndi and Ngarluma native title claim in 2003. Though he was born of another era and adhered to Yindjibarndi tradition, Mr Cheedy employed all the modern resources available-cultural mapping, books, films and recordings-to make sure that future generations would benefit from his knowledge. Dismayed by the ravaging impact of alcohol on Indigenous families, Mr Cheedy became a lay preacher with the Pilbara Aboriginal Church and travelled the state to help people suffering from alcoholism. In 2011, Mr Cheedy's service to his people and country was recognised with a NAIDOC Lifetime Achievement award. Mr Cheedy will be missed, but his legacy remains. As Thomas Paine wrote in 1791 in The Rights of Man: My country is my world, and my religion is to do good. Mental Health",83
75,Dr SOUTHCOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like to raise a very serious issue about mental health in my home state of South Australia. We would all have heard the grand statements about national health reform that for were made by the previous Prime Minister in 2010 and by the current Prime Minister in 2011. Specifically, the federal government promised to fund 179 subacute beds and places in South Australia and 159 of these were to be funded in the area of mental health. But it seems what is happening at the same time is that the South Australian government are pursuing their long-term agenda of closing 50 acute mental health beds. They have closed 10 mental health beds at Flinders Medical Centre, they have closed eight acute mental health beds at Glenside and they have also closed acute mental health beds at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The Commonwealth-state agreement is very specific: these are meant to be new, extra, additional beds. The state governments are meant to maintain the availability of acute beds. They are not meant to close acute beds. The state governments are meant to maintain their effort in this area. Mental health is a serious issue and it is very disappointing that, in a pea and thimble trick, the South Australian state government are using the cover of these new subacute beds to reduce their own responsibilities. Wheatley, Ms Joyce Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (13:52): I want to draw the attention of the House to the sad passing of Joyce Elise Wheatley. Joyce died on Tuesday last week at age 74 after a long illness. Joyce was a Labor legend, a lifetime member of the party who moved to Kiama from her birthplace in Yass in 1965. She was a schoolteacher at Warilla High School for many years and bore the title 'mistress in charge of girls'. was asked in 1980, along with her husband, to run for local council. Unfortunately, her husband, Frank, became ill and was unable to compete in that campaign. He hung on long enough to see Joyce selected and described her election to council as the happiest day of his life. In 1992 Joyce became the mayor of Kiama and held that position until she was succeeded by the current mayor, Sandra MCCarthy in 2000. Joyce moved on to more community activities after retiring as mayor, including in the St John Ambulance and Red Cross and acted as a marriage celebrant. In 2008 Joyce was selected as one of five women in New South Wales to receive the Women in Local Government award as a role model for other female councillors. She was the mother of Ian, Alan and Kathy and the grandmother of Joel, Christine, Daniel and Nicole, the wife of the late Frank and partner of Lionel. Celebrations of her life are being held today-and I regret that I cannot be there-in the chapel of Stan Crapp Funerals in Kiama. National Youth Week",83
76,Mr MATHESON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to speak about the National Youth Week celebrations in my electorate. National Youth Week is celebrated each year in Macarthur to recognise the positive contributions made by young people to our community. National Youth Week also gives young people the opportunity to connect with each other by taking part in activities, events, workshops and forums. In the Camden area, 25 different activities and events were organised for young people. These activities included: an art exhibition, gaming workshops, movie and pizza nights, mechanical bull rides, a dance party, youth forum and much more. This year I attended the Regional Youth Forum, organised by youth advisory groups She from all over Macarthur. The forum gave young people the opportunity to share their ideas with the leaders of our community. It was a fantastic opportunity for young people to have their voices heard and make a difference for the young people living in Macarthur. I was very impressed by all of the contributions made by young people at the forum. Today I would like to encourage them to keep up the great work and enthusiasm representing their peers. I would also like to commend Camden Council and its youth council, Campbelltown City Council, Wollondilly Shire Council and its youth council, and all of Macarthur's youth services for their dedication to the young people in my community. This year's National Youth Week celebrations were a fantastic example of my community working together to support our young people. I am proud to say that, after attending this year's youth week events, I am confident that the future of Macarthur is in very good hands. Lymphoma",84
77,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On 27 April a group of intrepid cyclists set off from the Sydney Opera House and rode to Parliament House to raise awareness about lymphoma, Australia's No. 1 blood cancer. The gruelling 330-kilometre ride took them through Mittagong and Goulburn before arriving on 29 April in Canberra. Jovan Pejic and his twin brother Nikola inspired the inaugural ride in 2011 when Jovan was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's follicular lymphoma at the age of 25. Riding with them this year was the host of The X factor, Luke Jacobz and NRL player Jamie Simpson who is also a lymphoma patient and came along as part of the support crew. At the finish line, where half of Canberra's Serbian community seemed to be, it was great to see the relief and joy on the faces the riders when they knew the journey was complete. The riders not only raised awareness about the disease but also raised $50,000 towards the cause. While survival rates from lymphoma have improved significantly over the past couple of decades, a new lymphoma diagnosis is made every two hours, and every six hours another Australian dies from this cancer. I commend the Opera 2 Parliament team for their great efforts and look forward to following their journey again next year, and I also welcome them back to Canberra. Boothby Electorate: Flinders Centre of Innovation in Cancer",85
78,Dr SOUTHCOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I was very pleased on 26 April to attend the opening of the Flinders Centre for Innovation in Cancer. This has been part of the long-term vision of the Flinders Medical Centre, and I want to pay tribute to a number of individuals who pushed for this project over a long period of time: Professor Graeme Young, Alan Young from the Flinders Medical Centre Foundation, Rhys Williams and Deborah Heithersay from the Flinders Medical Centre Foundation and her dedicated team of fundraisers. I was particularly pleased to have the Leader of the Opposition there as this was a project which he helped come to fruition when he was the Minister for Health. This was something that the Howard government was pleased to kickstart with a $10 million contribution in the 2007 budget. The idea is to bring together the researchers and clinicians, but the centre will very much have a patient focus. It also has had a connection with Lance Armstrong, who visited during the early dedication ceremonies for the centre, and who has agreed for the LIVESTRONG name to be of given to one of the research wings. It was a good day for the electorate. St Hilliers Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (13:58): A very competitive German once said that history repeats itself-first time as tragedy, second time as farce. Karl Marx was wrong about very many things but, if he was looking at the recent collapse of construction firm St Hilliers-which was contracted by the New South Wales government to complete some affordable schemes-he would say this is indeed a farce. You might forgive the New South Wales government for getting it wrong once but to stuff it up twice, which is what has happened in the St Hilliers collapse, is an absolute disgrace. Mrs Gash: Three times. Mr STEPHEN JONES: I see the member for Gilmore opposite waving her hands around. We are seeing not only the subcontractors who are contracted to engage in these projects being done out of moneyand many of them are out of pocket for thousands and thousands of dollars-but at the basis of this scheme has been the New South Wales government sticking its hand out and saying, 'We can build this affordable housing.' In my electorate, Throsby, and in the Illawarra and New South Wales this housing is much needed. So not only do we have the contractors who are out of pocket because the New South Wales government has stuffed it up, but we also have the lowand middle-income earners and the people on welfare benefits in the Illawarra without access to this much needed affordable housing. I condemn the New South Wales government-in particular Minister Pearcefor trying to shoot the blame for this terrible collapse home to the federal government when it was they who stuffed it up.",85
79,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. I am not sure the member for Throsby's language is parliamentary, but he is going to get away with it this time. NA",86
80,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that the Prime Minister will be absent from question time today until Wednesday, as she is representing Australia housing at the NATO summit in Chicago. The Minister for Defence will be absent from question time today until Wednesday, as he is with the Prime Minister at NATO in Chicago. I will answer questions on behalf of the Prime Minister, and the Minister for Defence Materiel will answer questions on behalf of the Minister for Defence. The Minister for Trade and Competitiveness will be absent from question time for the next sitting fortnight to attend APEC trade ministers meetings in Russia and OECD meetings in Paris. He will also be attending Expo in Korea and will hold bilateral talks in Japan, China and Malaysia. The Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development, Local Government and the Arts will be acting as Minister for Trade and Competitiveness during this time and will answer questions on his behalf. The minister will also answer questions on behalf of the foreign minister. NA Carbon Pricing",86
81,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Why does the government's $36 million carbon tax advertising campaign not actually mention the carbon tax?,86
82,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question, because I would have thought that anyone who has been listening to the debate in this country over the last five years knows that we are having a carbon price. I can well understand how sensitive he is about the assistance that we are providing to families through our carbon price assistance package, the clean energy package. I can see why he is so sensitive about the fact that we are providing additional assistance to pensioners, I can see why he is so sensitive about that we are providing additional assistance to families and I can see why he is so, if you like, sensitive to the fact that we are providing assistance to trade-exposed industries. We make no apology whatsoever for providing this assistance to Australian families, because when there are deposits in their bank accounts they do need to know why they are there and where they came from. So he is very sensitive about this, but we are providing assistance to households and assistance to industry. That is how it should be as we make the transition to a cleaner carbon economy. We are putting in place a clean energy package because we understand that in the 21st century no first class First World economy can be powered by anything other than clean energy and more efficient energy practices. That is why we are proud of the assistance we are providing.",86
83,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I have a supplementary question to the Acting Prime Minister. Could the Acting Prime Minister please inform the House and the Australian people what it actually is that this compensation is being paid for?,87
84,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," We have been talking about this day in, day out, but I am happy to go through all of the elements of the clean energy package. We are providing assistance to families who will be affected by price rises of 0.7 per cent. We providing that assistance for",87
85,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. The Acting Prime Minister should be able to bring himself to mention the carbon tax, surely-that which cannot speak its name.",87
86,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. He is the fact abusing the point of order.,87
87,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Certainly. The carbon price will have an impact on the overall price level in the economy. We are proud of the fact that we are providing assistance to nine in 10 households. Almost six million households will get tax cuts or increased payments that cover their entire average price impact; over four million Australian households will get an extra buffer; and, of course, we have the tripling of the tax-free threshold, something that those opposite want to take awaywhich will be a very substantial tax increase if they ever have the chance of abolishing that very important reform, which gives substantial tax relief to low-income earners in our community. So we are providing assistance. We are proud of the fact. That is as it should be, and that is how we will put in place a carbon price that will drive increased investment in renewable energy. Economy",87
88,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the Acting Prime Minister update the House on the global economic situation and the implications for our economy?,87
89,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question because, as all members would be aware, in Greece and many parts of Europe we face very profound economic challenges. These have been underscored in recent weeks by further are events in Greece and across the European Community. The G8 has acknowledged at its weekend summit that growth and jobs must be the imperative for the global economy, and indeed here in Australia they have been our imperative from day one of the global financial crisis. The Prime Minister and I will continue to work through the G20 to ensure that the European leaders meet their commitments and put jobs and growth to the forefront of their decision making. As we said very clearly in the budget, the situation in Europe continues to cast a very dark shadow over the global economy. We expect that Europe's economy will contract by three-quarters of a per cent this year. That was there in our budget forecast, published on the night of the budget. Australia is not immune from this global instability, but we do need to remember that we have some of the strongest economic fundamentals amongst developed economies. economy has grown something like seven per cent on its pre-crisis level. This is absolutely outstanding growth, and that is why over the next year and the year after that we will outperform every other major developed economy. That is something that everyone on this side of the House is very proud of. We have a low unemployment level here of 4.9 per cent. Compare that to what is going on in Europe. There have been something like 800,000 jobs created in this country since this government was elected, and we have a record pipeline of investment, very strong public finances and a AAA credit rating from the three major rating agencies for the first time in our history-not something ever achieved by those opposite at any time they were in government. And what is the reason for this? It is because we got big economic calls right at the height of the global financial crisis. We supported small business, we supported employment and we supported our communities. That is what we are doing with the budget as well: bringing the budget back to surplus and putting in place the big reforms to continue the economic growth that is so important to the future of all Australians. We have had a lot of negative talk from those opposite about our economy. They continue to talk it down on a daily basis. For them, it is as if the global financial crisis had never happened, the floods had never happened-none of these things had ever happened. They just go out there and talk down these fundamentals. But when it comes to putting the runs on the board for the economy we on this side of the House have gone there in spades. Those opposite can go out and talk our economy down, but we on this side of the House will continue to support it. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",87
90,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My Our question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer to an article in today's Courier Mail stating that Queenslanders will be hit with multimillion dollar bills from rubbish created from Cyclone Yasi because the government will not allow a natural disaster exemption from the carbon tax. Can the Acting Prime Minister explain why the victims of Cyclone Yasi will now also be victims of the carbon tax?,88
91,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I am very pleased that I was asked that question, because one of the things this government is very proud of is the assistance that we have put into North Queensland and Far North Queensland following Cyclone Yasi. It has cost the Commonwealth budget something the like $6 billion, and when we came to this parliament to discuss how that could be funded we were opposed by those on the other side. We were opposed in one of the most substantial packages that has ever been put in place in this country to support communities that have been hit by a natural disaster. This has been particularly the case in assistance we have provided to local government areas on a point of order on relevance. The Acting Prime Minister was asked a very straightforward question, which was, 'Why will the victims of Cyclone Yasi also be victims of the carbon tax?' and that is the question he should be answering.",88
92,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Acting Prime Minister has been answering the question and he has the call.,89
93,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly have, Madam Deputy Speaker. We have been providing assistance particularly to local authorities right throughout that region-very substantial assistance-which has been welcomed. When I was there earlier this year locals came up and congratulated both the Commonwealth and Queensland governments on the degree of assistance that has been provided. I have also been asked about landfill operators. There are a number of steps they can take to reduce or offset their carbon liabilities, and they ought to take those steps. Family Payments",89
94,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services Indigenous Affairs and for Disability Reform. What policies is the government putting in place to spread the benefits of the mining boom to Australian families? Have alternative policies been outlined, and what impact would they have on families?",89
95,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (14:11): I thank the member for Corangamite very much for his question, as he knows this government is all about spreading the benefits of the boom, especially to those families who have been finding it difficult making ends meet. Just last Wednesday families started receiving money from the household assistance package-up to $110 per child per family for families on family tax benefit part A, and up to $69 per family for those on family tax benefit part B. We want to make sure that families get this extra assistance before the carbon price starts on 1 July, and we also want to make sure that it is the big polluters that pay the carbon price, not Australian families. What we know from those opposite is that all they intend to do is to claw back this assistance from Australian families and from pensioners. I am also very pleased to let the House know that, from 20 June, families will be receiving the first round of the schoolkids bonus-opposed by each and every one of those opposite. From January next year at the start of term 1 we will start paying the first part of the schoolkids bonus, and the second part will be paid in term 3. This will amount to $410 per child for those in primary school and $820 per child for those in secondary school. This means that one million Australian families will get more money as a result of this government's change and the introduction of the schoolkids bonus. and The Treasurer also announced in the recent budget that families are going to receive another increase next year as part of our spreading of the benefits of the boom. Families on the maximum rate of family tax benefit will get up to $600 extra if they have two children or more. This government is all about spreading the benefits of the boom, but and all those opposite say to each and every one of these measures is a great big 'no'. We have just seen from the Victorian government that, while we are introducing a new schoolkids bonus, the Victorian Liberals are just getting rid of their school start bonus. We are helping families: all those opposite can do is hurt them.",89
96,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. The minister has outlined the benefits to Australian families from the mining boom. What does this mean for my electorate of Corangamite?",89
97,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (14:14): I thank the member for Corangamite. I know how hard he works for the people of Geelong and the people on the Surf Coast. More than 11,000 families in his electorate will receive an initial payment this fortnight to help them make ends meet before the carbon price starts on 1 July. Around 9,100 families in Corangamite will receive the schoolkids bonus from 20 June and around 10,000 families in Corangamite will get a boost to their family payments in the middle of next year. Thank goodness-because, at the same time that this government is doing everything we possibly can to help families in Corangamite, we see the state Liberal government down there in Victoria ripping money away from families as fast as they possibly can! While they are ripping money away we have every Liberal here saying no to families. Whether it is in Aston where 7,500 families would miss out if the member for Aston had his way, or in Casey where 8,500 families would miss out, or 8,500 families in Dunkley, or 9,500 families in Flinders and more than 9,000 families in Indi-you have just said no to each and every one of those families because you want to hurt them. We want to help them. Economy",90
98,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the downgrades last week of numerous Spanish banks; concerns about escalating withdrawals from the Greek banking system; evidence of further slowing in the Chinese economy; and the recent decline in the spot price of key commodities such as iron ore. Against this global backdrop, does the Acting Prime Minister agree that now is the worse possible time to be hitting Australian and businesses and jobs with the world's biggest carbon tax?",90
99,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," What we have here is yet again another example of the opposition talking our economy down and trying to undermine confidence in our community. I can think of nothing more reckless than that sort of assertion, which somehow tries to equate what is going on in the Spanish banking sector with what might be happening in the Australian economy. This is the same sort of wrecking-ball politics and economics we have seen from those opposite throughout the whole global financial crisis and global recession. They come into this House, on the one hand, and pretend it never happened-that it never had any impact on our budget bottom line and that we did not have to put in place a stimulus to support our economy-and then, on the other hand, come back and say, 'Oh, there's a big problem in Europe!' There is a challenge in Europe for the global economy and we have got the runs on the board in handling that global volatility. I recall that when the global economy was challenged by events everywhere, including in Europe, those opposite opposed the actions we took to support the Australian people. I remember that well and so do the Australian people.  on a point of order. The Acting Prime Minister was asked about the wrecking-ball effect of the carbon tax on the economy and he is not even attempting to answer it.",90
100,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Acting Prime Minister has the call.,90
101,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying earlier, if you look at our forecasts, the forecasts of the IMF, the forecasts of the major private forecasters or of the OECD, what you see is an assessment of an Australian economy which, relative to all of our peers, is strong. We are growing at trend. We have unemployment at 4.9 per cent. We have a strong investment pipeline. We have our public finances in good nick. We have a AAA credit rating from the major agencies for the first time in our history, and yet those opposite have the hide to walk into this House and compare the Australian economy and our financial sector to Spain! To ask a question like that-to come in here and talk down our fundamentals-just shows how reckless those opposite have become in their assessment of the economy and how incompetent they are. They are not capable of being put in charge of a $1.4 trillion economy. The fact is our forecast, the private forecasts, the IMF forecast and the OECD forecast all show that we can achieve this with a carbon price. We are achieving it with a carbon price because we have the guts to put in place the longer term decisions which secure our prosperity and ensure that we continue to have 21 years of continuous growth. Far-sighted Labor governments brought in superannuation, enterprise bargaining and competition policy and brought down the tariff wall. Just as measures in that vein have strengthened our economy, putting a carbon price in will strengthen our economy. We have the guts to face up to the challenges of the 21st century and to support our economy and our people, but those opposite are so reckless they just talk our economy down every day of the week. (Time expired)",91
102,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My supplementary question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer to the Acting Prime Minister's statement that we are currently 'growing the economy at trend'. Can the Acting Prime Minister advise the House what the impact of the carbon tax will be on the growth forecast?,91
103,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I said less than a quarter of a per cent. Goods and Services Tax,91
104,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. In light of the Leader of the Opposition's inconsistent and ambiguous comments regarding Tasmania and GST, do you agree that Tasmania currently receives its fair share of GST and do you promise the GST fiscal equalisation process will not be changed in any way that will see Tasmania's share of GST reduced?",91
105,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for what is a very important question. Horizontal fiscal equalisation-that is, the method where the stronger states in Australia have supported the smaller, economically-weaker states-has been in place throughout all of our history and used to be a point of bipartisan agreement in Australian politics between the Labor Party on this side and the Liberal Party on that side. It has been there for a very good reason: it is so that we do not end up with those big disparities that you see in countries in Europe, that we all grow together, that we do not grow apart. That is what we have had this in place for over 100 years and it is why we have had bipartisan agreement on it until recently, until this wrecking ball Leader of the Opposition has put his wrecking ball through what has been a long-established method of ensuring that, wherever you lived in Australia, you would get comparable services to anybody else wherever they lived. That is what HFE is all about. The Leader of the Opposition went down to Tasmania and blew the whistle. He said, 'We're going to cut you adrift.' That is what he said, and all of the other, Tasmanian Liberal members were scattering for the hills. 'He's here! He's here! He's going to cut us adrift!' And then he went to South Australia and did the same, and he got driven out of South Australia as well. The truth is we are having an independent review of the formula, as we should. We said we would do it. We had a request from the Western Australian Premier to do it. That review has produced an interim report. The final report is not too far off. I welcome a very significant debate in this House about how we support all Australians no matter where they live, but the Leader of the Opposition does not. He has wrecked consensus on some of the most basic matters of economics. He is now wrecking consensus on something that goes to the core of the social and economic stability of this country. When we have that report out, it is going to be very interesting see what all the Liberals from South Australia and all the Liberals from Tasmania do when he tries to fudge his response like he has tried to fudge everything else.",91
106,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. How is the government's budget helping to spread the benefits of the mining boom to small business and Australian families?,92
107,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for her question, because the fact is that our economy is now something like seven per cent bigger than it was prior to the global financial crisis. We should recall that many other developed economies have not even got back to where they were prior to the global financial crisis. So growing around trend but also coming back to surplus does give the Reserve Bank of Australia in particular greater flexibility when it comes to the setting of monetary policy, and that is a very good thing. In addition to putting in place all of our plans to grow the economy, we also want to spread the opportunities of our economy around every corner of our country. We grow the economy, we grow the pie but we also do that to spread opportunity. In particular, given the fact that we have a mining boom, this budget was an opportunity to spread some of those benefits right around our economy to many of those people who do not feel like they are in the fast lane of the mining boom, to those people who feel like it is somebody else's boom. That is why we have put in place very substantial assistance to 1.5 million lower-income families. That is why we have put in place the new schoolkids bonus that the minister was talking about before. It was incredibly opposed by those opposite. How could you oppose an existing to measure which really gives cost of living relief to families when they need it? They come in here and talk cost of living all the time, but suddenly it disappears when it is the cost of kids going back to school. Budget Then it is not a matter for them to be concerned about. They do not care. They simply do not get it. They really do not get it when it comes to growing our economy. They certainly do not get it when it comes to cost of living pressures on families, particularly those for people who are trying to educate a couple of kids. But they also do not get it when it comes to tax reform and relief for small business. Our loss carry back is a very important initiative. They also voted in this House against the $6,500 instant asset write-off that is going to be so important to up to 2.7 million small businesses right across our country. But where they really do not get it-and I think this is where we had a real clanger from the shadow Treasurer during the week-is where it comes to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. They can give a tax cut to Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart, but they cannot support disabled Australians in our community. We heard the truth about that from the shadow Treasurer. They are happy to see people in a wheelchair go to the back of the queue, but they are happy to put Clive and Gina at the front of the queue.  last statement by the Acting Prime Minister was, (1), un-prime ministerial and, (2), a slur on all members of this side of the House. I ask that it be withdrawn.",92
108,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have had difficulty with groups being slurred and asking for withdrawals, so I am not going to seek it at this time.  the Acting Prime Minister would slur me in terms of my regard for people with disabilities. I would ask for it to be withdrawn.",93

111,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to his comments only a fortnight ago on Fran Kelly's program that the increase in the debt limit was 'no big deal'. The very next day before the parliament he told the House that the very same provision was now a 'very serious issue'. Acting Prime Minister, does the government view the increase in the nation's credit card limit from $250 billion $300 billion as a very serious issue or no big deal? (Time expired)",93
112,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I do thank the member for that question. I want to spend a bit of time on it because I think it just demonstrates how irresponsible the opposition is. As I indicated to the House last sitting week, we were seeking to get a buffer over and above the debt cap of $250 billion simply because there were variable moments during a year when we went over the cap. I explained the reasons for all of that in the House: we would be at the end of each year within the $250 billion cap. I even went to the lengths of giving the shadow Treasurer a minute from the AOFM as to why this is not controversial. But if it does become controversial then it is a serious issue. If you are going to take the wrecking ball out on this issue, in this environment, given international markets, that is seriously reckless-that is seriously dangerous. What it demonstrates is what a danger you are to the Australian economy and the Australian people. Budget  question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation. What is the government doing in the budget to ensure hard working Australian families and businesses share in the benefits of the boom?",93
113,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (14:30): I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I know, like so many people on this side of the House, he spends every waking moment of the day fighting for those hard working families and businesses in his electorate and right across this country. That is why, I know, he is very to proud to be a part of a government that is delivering a surplus budget, a part of a government that is showing economic leadership. That leadership is demonstrated by the fact that we have growth returning to trend; we have unemployment at a very low level, with a 4 in front of it-4.9 per centwe have inflation contained; and we have a record pipeline of investment coming into this country. All of the indicators demonstrate this is a strong economy-a strong economy being managed in the interests of working people. But on this side of the House we understand that, whilst this is a strong economy, there are many families and many businesses across this country that feel as though they are not sharing in the benefits of the boom. That is why we are determined to spread the benefits of the mining boom and that is why we are increasing family payments. Indeed, the member for Moreton will know, because he fights so hard for his community, that 9,000 families in his electorate will benefit from this measure. He knows that there are 6,800 families in the Moreton electorate that will benefit from the schoolkids bonus. He knows that there are 19,400 small businesses in his electorate that are very keen to take advantage of the instant asset write-off when that comes into effect on 1 July. And he, along with the rest of us, is very proud of continuing our reform agenda when it comes to productivity and job creation, and that is why he supports the loss carry-back measures that we have introduced as well. Of course, all of these economic fundamentals underline the importance of us returning the budget to surplus, and that is what we are doing to give the Reserve Bank the room that it needs to cut interest rates if it chooses to do so spread that relief to families and businesses across our economy. I think what most Australians cannot understand is why those opposite came into this place and voted against the schoolkids bonus. What most Australian cannot understand is why the Leader of the Opposition last week said that he will refuse those families an increase in their family payments. All of this is because he does not trust Australian families. He says he does not trust them to manage their budgets. Well, they should not trust him. He has a $70 billion black hole and he has no plan in terms of how he intends to fill it. But we all know to fill that black hole he would have to rip away payments and rip away services that these hard working Australian families and businesses rely upon. He just will not tell us what they are. He will not stand up for working families and small businesses, but when it comes to spreading the benefits of the mining boom he is happy to see them trapped in the deep pockets of Clive Palmer and co - (Time expired)  Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question.

117,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, Assistant Treasurer will not test my patience either.,95
118,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moreton for his supplementary question. He is correct: when it comes to economic leadership, that is what this government has shown. We have shown that economic leadership when the tough times have presented themselves. When it came to the global financial crisis we intervened, we stimulated the economy and we saved hundreds of thousands of jobs in this economy. We ensured that hard working Australian people continued to have the opportunity to go to work each day and to contribute to the economy, to make a contribution. We continue to do this by demonstrating economic leadership with the budget that we have handed down. Those opposite, just as they came in and recklessly voted against the schoolkids bonus for families, came into this place and voted against the stimulus measures during the global financial crisis. I think entitled to ask the question: what was the Leader of the Opposition doing during this time? What was he doing when the biggest economic decisions this country has ever faced had to be taken? Some might argue that he needed some time to weigh up the pros and the cons, that he needed some time to maybe even sleep on it. In fact, he did not just sleep on it; he slept through it. He slept through the global financial crisis and the debate that occurred in this parliament. Asylum Seekers",95
119,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the fact that more than 1,000 people have arrived on illegal boats this month, including three boats in the past 24 hours-with one carrying 175 people, the most in over two years. Given that taxpayers The will be paying an extra $1.1 million per day for Labor's border failures next year, according to his budget, which assumes just 450 arrivals per month, is the Treasurer concerned that arrivals at more than double this rate may impact on Labor's promised but mythical budget surplus?",95

You are not entitled to claim, on the basis of two months, a permanent figure. You are not entitled to claim that at all. You did correctly say that the budget estimate is 450 arrivals per month. That is true. Of course, as is usually the case, you are out there, really, conducting a campaign against the government's forecast. You always get that wrong. You will be wrong on Australians are this occasion. They are just out there, trying to get a figure, trying to multiply it by 10, running their usual scare campaigns.",95

127,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question is to the Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Minister, how is the government assisting households with the modest impact of the carbon price and broader cost-of-living pressures? Minister, why is it important that this assistance is delivered?",96
128,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:38): I thank my New South Wales colleague the member for Reid for his question. The carbon price, as the member for Reid indicated, will have a modest impact on the cost of living and, as the acting Prime Minister indicated earlier, only 0.7 per cent increase in the consumer price indexless than one cent in the dollar. To help households, the government is providing tax cuts. We are trebling the tax-free threshold to implement those costs. We are providing increases in family payments and we are increasing the pension and many other Commonwealth benefits. What this means is that nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance, six million households will receive assistance covering their entire expected average price impact, and four million households will receive assistance covering 120 per cent of the average price impact that we expect them to experience, meaning that they will have a buffer that will leave them-the four million lowest households in the country-better off. In fact, some of these payments for increased family tax benefits began last week and payments to pensioners will also be made during the months of May and June-an initial $250 for a single pensioner, for example, and $380 for a couple. Contrary to some of the commentary that we hear from the Leader of the Opposition, My these increases are permanent and they are indexed. In addition to this, the budget provided for more general relief from costof-living pressures. That is why the budget included no less than $5 billion in new support for lowand middle-income households. These new measures will spread the benefits of the mining boom. They include our schoolkids bonus, which will give families $410 a year for each child in primary school, and $820 a year for each child in high school for those eligible under family tax benefit arrangements. Those initial payments will begin next month, as my ministerial colleague indicated earlier. The budget also included a supplementary allowance of $210 for singles and $350 for couples, to help the unemployed, to help young people, and to help single parents, with things like utilities bills. Those opposite showed their true colours in their response to many of these measures, including the schoolkids bonus. First, they patronised people by arguing that families could not be trusted to spend the money on their children. Then they voted against the schoolkids bonus, seeking to deny families thousands of dollars in assistance.

Does the Acting Prime Minister agree with the Prime Minister that it is not appropriate for the member for Dobell to participate in the Labor caucus but it is still appropriate government to accept his vote in the parliament?",96
129,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The fact is that those opposite want to turn this parliament into a kangaroo court. There are two very important principles at stake here. One is the presumption of innocence and the other is the separation of powers. Somehow those opposite want to say that this parliament should be making definitive judgments, not the courts of law. That is the proposition that goes to the very core of the question that has been put by the Manager of Opposition Business. They want to turn the parliament into a kangaroo court for their own political purposes, because there is no institution, there is no principle, that this Leader of the Opposition will not trash. This is not a consistent position from those opposite. We have already heard some words from a number on the cross bench here about how it is important to have the separation of powers in the parliament-that the parliament should not become a kangaroo court-but someone else has said something pretty telling about this. Of course, that was the current Leader of the Opposition, in a debate in this parliament back in 2007, when one member for parliament, the member for Bowman, was the subject of very serious allegations. The member for Bowman was the subject of serious allegations, and this is what the then Leader of the Opposition said. Ms O'Dwyer interjecting",97

He's a backbench member of parliament and I think he's entitled to stay in the parliament until these bodies have come to their conclusions. That is what he said when we were dealing for the member for Bowman and a couple of others who had very serious charges against them, as well. So the tune has changed somewhat since 2007. What is really different here is that this speaks volumes about the modern Liberal Party.  on a point of order: the question was about why the member for Dobell is not in the caucus but is in the parliament.

They are getting out the mud bucket! That is what they are doing! They are not in here talking about the big issues that Australians want them to talk about. This Leader of the Opposition has got the mud bucket out, because this Leader of the Opposition is always about confrontation. For him, his leadership is the political equivalent of 'bringing back the biff'. The problem with that is that when you bring back the biff, people get hurt.

135,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. How is the government helping working people and their families through the budget? Why is it important that all working families benefit from the proceeds of the mining boom?,98
136,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (14:46): I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. She, like everyone on this side of the House, is very committed to working Australians and their families. We are committed to it and that is why we have got behind the last budget, because working Australians and their families are big winners out of the last budget. The best way that they are big winners is that we are bringing the budget into surplus. It is a remarkable accomplishment when you look around the rest of the world to see how well this government and our Treasurer have done in producing a surplus. Furthermore, when we talk about the surplus, that is not the only way that we are helping working Australians and their families deal with the mining boom. There is no question that the mining boom has been very good for some Australians, but not for all Australians. We have seen the pressure on the dollar. We have seen investment going to the mining areas and we have seen other parts of the Australian economy do it hardermanufacturing, domestic tourism and education services. This is a budget which is about helping spread the benefits of the mining boom to all Australians. There is a long list of how working Australians get helped in this budget. First of all, we have seen this budget build upon previous Labor budgets and, in fact, two weeks ago we saw the ABS employment statistics for April say that 11½ million Australians are working. This is the largest number ever in the history of the Commonwealth. The jobs are being created-87,000 jobs in 2012 alone. We know this year will be hard on employment but, even contrary to some of the expectations, we have been going better than we dared hope. It is not just about creating jobs in this budget; it is also about the skills. Last financial year 320,000 people entered apprenticeships. If you want to do something for working Australians, give their children and their young ones an opportunity to get a skill and a trade. The list goes on. We have seen in this budget support for older Australians to be able to find work and support for sole parents to be able to find work. We have also seen support for people who receive family tax benefit part A. We have seen support for families to help make ends meet. If they have two children, they get $600-that is real money. If they have one child, they get $300. This list of the accomplishments of this budget in helping people do not stop there. For example, there is the schoolkids bonus. We hear a lot from the opposition complaining about how some people get attacked by the government-well, let me tell you: I have never seen such a massive smear on parents with school age children who receive family tax benefit part A.",98

147,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hotham-Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (14:52): I thank the member for Bass for his question. I was with him in Scottsdale not long after the budget talking up another great initiative that will see the diversification of that economy and also taking the opportunity to demonstrate the great commitment that this government has made to regional Australia-a commitment that, I might say, did not get one mention in the Leader of the Opposition's budget speech-in-reply. This is a government that has made the greatest ever commitment to regional Australia in the history of this country. Last year's budget saw the biggest ever financial commitment to regions-$4.3 billion over the course of the four years-and this budget built on that. What we saw was $475 million allocated to regional hospitals and those announced in the budget and $110 million to ensure that dentists and GPs are encouraged into regional areas. There was also the significant slice of the healthcare budget that will go to regional Australia as well as the significant assistance to families in regional Australia through the schoolkids bonus and the family payments. I also say that, because we have now passed the minerals resource rent tax, the regions will now be able to experience a further three Regional Development Australia Fund funding rounds. We have announced the first, which was $150 million and which leveraged more than three times that in terms of investment. We are about to announce the second round of $200 million, but the final three rounds would not be there if the minerals resource rent tax had not been passed. Those that sit opposite will abolish that when they come in. In other words, they will cut the very means by which regions in this country will benefit. We on this side have always understood the importance of regions. Whenever they have come to office, they have either abolished the department of regional development or scrapped the program. They have even gone so far as to say that they have no constitutional role in the Commonwealth for regional development. That is what the opposition stands for-they are anti the regions. Those regions which see the opportunities going forward for economic diversification as well sustainability as well as a fair go for the families out there will only get it from Labor governments. This budget has underpinned those credentials yet again and exposed those who sit opposite as not being supporters of the regions whatsoever. Member for Dobell Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:55): My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations.

I think this is important. There has much been said about this investigation, and the member for Dobell has given his statement in the last couple of hours about it. I certainly believe that the investigation has taken too long. What I also know is this: the investigation stage is at a conclusion. I believe it is fundamentally important to the members of some of the parts of the HSU that have been affected by this inquiry that they see this matter brought to a close-all of the matters, including the question which the opposition member raised. I also think that these matters have to be brought to a close in the correct way: they have to be tested in court. I also say this in passing: I think we owe to the individuals caught up in this controversy and their families to have this matter tested in court. This parliament should not be judge and jury; we owe it to everybody who has been caught up in this disturbing, regrettable and unfortunate issue-the whole issue.

149,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question is to the Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business. Why is it important, Minister, to make sure that small businesses and their families benefit from the mining boom, and how is the government doing that through its budget? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (14:58): I thank the member for Lyons for his very important question, because it goes to how the government can provide support for small business. The fact is that there are more than 2.7 million small businesses in this country and that they employ almost five million Australians. It is therefore very critical that we attend to their needs. As a result, the first important thing that this government did in relation to the budget was to ensure that it returned to surplus, because it creates the environment for monetary policy to work with government fiscal policy to improve the lot of small business. That is the first thing. The second thing that I would like to say in relation to small business for Lyons and for every electorate around this country and it for the small businesses that live within those electorates is that we have dedicated initiatives to ensure we provide support for small businesses. Firstly, there has been the loss carry-back initiative, a fantastic opportunity for those small businesses who seek to invest or innovate to claim losses of up to $1 million on taxes already paid on previous profits. This has been well received by COSBOA, by employer bodies and by small businesses across the country to provide opportunities for them. I also refer to the initiative that has been referred to by the Acting Prime Minister and the Assistant Budget Treasurer insofar as the instant asset tax write-off is concerned. This is also a very My important initiative, targeting small businesses who need to deal with cash flow issues. This provides an opportunity for a 100 per cent depreciation after one year on every asset purchased up to $6½ thousand. This is a fantastic initiative, one that has been embraced by small businesses that I have met, whether it has been in Grafton in regional New South Wales or whether it has been in Cairns or in Launceston or in Devonport or in the capital cities, where I have been meeting with small businesses to talk about those issues. Of course, they have asked me: why is it that the Leader of the Opposition opposed the proposed tax cut for business? I had trouble explaining it because it would be the first time in living memory that a Liberal leader would oppose a company tax cut for businesses. It would be the first time that that had occurred. We said that, as a result of the obstinance by the opposition to prevent small business getting the tax relief, we would find another way to improve consumer and business confidence-and we have done that, dedicating resources to families across this country in order for them to be better off and to cope with cost of living pressures. We will keep dealing with these issues. This is important for small business and- (Time expired) Member for Dobell Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (15:01): My question is to the Special Minister of State.

I am not a solicitor, and I do not have a law degree. I have never held myself out to be a solicitor nor made any representation to that effect to any person. I NOES have not derived any income or personal benefit from any matters relating to this allegation. The Leader of the House also asserted that I failed to declare my directorship of several companies. I took steps to resign my directorships of all companies named in August 2010. I provided instructions to my accountant to this effect. My accountant today has confirmed that this is correct, but he did not act on my instructions until March 2011 due to ill-health and hospitalisation on his behalf. At the time. I completed my register of members' interests I understood the instructions had been implemented, and I believed them to be correct. I regret that the ASIC record did not reflect the circumstances that I believed to be correct at the time. The Leader of the House also asserted that I am a shadow director of a company, DV Kelly Pty Ltd. There is no substance whatsoever to this allegation. Further, I have not, nor have ever been, a shareholder or a director of this company. NA Presentation",106

In accordance with standing order 39(f) the reports were made parliamentary papers.",108
199,Ms ONEILL,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee Corporations and Financial Services I am pleased to speak to the following reports: Inquiry into the collapse of Trio Capital and Statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. In relation to the Trio Capital inquiry report the committee has investigated the collapse of Trio Capital, the largest superannuation fraud in Australian history. At the outset, I would like to express my deepest sympathy for the victims of this fraud. I wish to thank those individuals and organisations who provided the written 77 submissions to the inquiry and those who attended the inquiry's public hearings and the community forum in Thirroul. The strength and resolve of those who have suffered at the hands of this fraud shone throughout the committee's hearings and evidence gathering. It is important that we understand the scale and consequences of the Trio Capital fraud. About $176 million in Australian investors' money is lost or missing from two fraudulently managed investment schemes run by Trio. Nearly 6,090 Australians lost money as a result of the Trio collapse. Of these investors, 5,400 had invested in Trio through APRA regulated superannuation funds. These investors received nearly $55 million in compensation under the provisions of part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act). Of the remaining 690 Trio Capital investors, 415 were direct investors and around 285 investors were in self- managed superannuation funds, SMSFs. SMSF investors have not received compensation. The final inquiry report makes a total of 14 significant recommendations relating to transparency issues within the superannuation investment framework, improved financial literacy and the need for the appropriate authorities to pursue those responsible for the lost Trio funds as a matter on of priority. From the outset it was apparent to the committee that there was a fundamental problem in that many SMSF investors had little or no idea that they had no protection from fraud and no protection from theft. This is of course very different from the APRA regulated savings vehicles. The committee found that there needs to be major improvements to financial literacy in this regard. This inquiry was set up to clearly establish the facts of what happened with the Trio Capital collapse and to determine whether improvements can be made to Australia's financial services sector and consumer regulations. The committee notes the Richard St John report and the shortcomings he identified possible statutory compensation scheme. We did, however, recommended that 74 unit holders, who invested in the Professional Pensions Pooled Superannuation Trust, receive assistance. These investors were offered inducements to move their funds to the ARP Growth Fund. This inquiry has exposed a clear general understanding of Australia's superannuation system. Many trustees of SMSFs clearly indicated to the inquiry that they had absolutely no idea that their investment had no protection from theft and fraud-that is, no protection at all from the perpetrators of theft and fraud. The fraud in itself was complex and involved the schemes investing in a number of hedge funds based in the Caribbean. Despite its complexity, the committee believes that there were a number of failures by the gatekeepers of the financial system. The regulators, ASIC and APRA; Trio directors; the auditors who signed off on its accounts without checking the existence of its assets; and the financial planners who inappropriately recommended Trio's risky investment strategy to their clients have all been examined thoroughly in this inquiry. While it is important that we not only catalogue what happened we should also focus on what can be done to ensure that this sort of fraud does not happen again. The committee's recommendations are therefore seriously focused on prevention. The committee received significant evidence suggesting a number of expectation gaps in the financial system. These gaps were over investors' understanding of the roles and responsibilities of auditors, custodians and research houses. Educating investors alone, however, will not be enough to bridge these gaps. The committee recommends that in a standards in these areas also need to be changed and improved. We certainly welcome the work already being indicated by ASIC and APRA and their recent moves in this direction. The committee also welcomes recent government efforts to improve access to information for investors, particularly those in self-managed gap in the superannuation funds. The Future of Financial Advice reformsthe FOFA reforms-will ensure that financial advisers not only act in their clients' best interests but do not recommend inappropriate investments in return for conflicted remuneration and commissions. The proposed MySuper reforms will also assist superannuation investors by requiring funds to publish details of their investments. Access to investment information forms a key part of the committee's recommendations. The committee's recommendations seek to improve investor understanding, prudential and regulatory standards and transparency in the financial system. The SMSF sector is becoming an increasingly important part of Australia's superannuation system. SMSFs account for about 30 per cent of Australians' $1.3 trillion invested in superannuation. By improving the quality of financial advice that SMSF investors rely on and the quality of information available to them, the committee hopes that investors will be better equipped to understand the advantages, risks and responsibilities of managing their own SMSFs. It is important that self-managed super fund investors remain vigilant, particularly against the risk of fraud and theft. The committee also recommends that APRA and ASIC do more in the investigation and prosecution of investment fraud. Specifically, the regulators should be significantly more diligent in their investigation and prosecution of the masterminds of the Trio collapse. While Shawn Richard has been convicted for his role in the fraud, the committee is concerned that not enough has been done to bring other perpetrators to justice. More generally, the committee strongly recommends that APRA and ASIC should be more active in their particular attempts to detect investment fraud by identifying outlying patterns in investment performance. More active supervision of suspicious and anomalous fund performance would lead to earlier detection of fraudulent activity. I would like to thank my fellow committee members for their efforts in compiling this report and collecting the evidence. In particular, I would like to the former chair of this committee, Mr Bernie Ripoll, for the considerable work that he has done. I would also like to acknowledge and thank Senator Nick Sherry who rejoined the committee recently and who has given over 21 years of service to this particular committee in its various forms. The senator's many years of parliamentary experience in the financial services sector was most valuable in the concluding stages of this inquiry. The committee hopes that our investigations and unanimous report will go some way to ensuring that such a fraud does not happen again. I refer now to the second tabled report, which is the committee's May 2012 report on the statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. Section 243 of the ASIC Act directs this committee to inquire into and report on ASIC's activities and matters relating to those activities to which the parliament's attention should be directed. In preparing the report, the committee held hearings with officials from ASIC and, for the first time, also heard information from the Takeovers Panel. I would like to thank ASIC for its continuing cooperation and assistance and thank the Takeovers Panel for assisting the committee to understand its role and procedures. The committee looks forward to working with the Takeovers Panel in the future. Regarding standards for financial advisors, as earlier detailed the committee has recently been involved in examining the collapse of Trio Capital. A number of the recommendations of the report go to ASIC's role in regulating managed investment schemes and the AFS licensing regime. The committee intends to further examine ASIC about these issues in future oversight thank hearings. Some of the recommendations in the committee's report are also very relevant to ASIC's oversight of the financial advice sector. In part, these have already been picked up by the government's proposed freedom of financial advice-FoFAreforms. Compliance with these proposed reforms will be voluntary from 1 July 2012 and become compulsory from 1 July 2013. The committee welcomes ASIC's advice that it will consult with industry in its preparation of regulatory guidance on the effect of the reforms well before compliance becomes compulsory. The committee notes that ASIC anticipates releasing consultation drafts of regulatory guidance about conflicted remuneration, scaled advice, the best interests test and ASIC's changed licensing and banning powers by 1 July 2012. The committee believes these reforms will assist in preventing some of the conduct by financial advisers that, sadly, led to too many people investing their retirement savings in inappropriate investment vehicles, like some of the schemes operated by Trio. The committee has also spent some time considering the issue of the public's understanding of compensation for theft and fraud in relation to self-managed super funds. The committee welcomes ASIC's advice that it would place an alert on its MoneySmart website notifying potential SMSF investors that no compensation is available if they lose money from theft or fraud. The committee looks forward to working with ASIC and APRA to develop a more robust regulatory and prudential standard for the SMSF sector and financial advisers. With regard to ASIC's strategic framework, the committee examined ASIC's recent actions to advance its strategic aims. leave-I move: The committee very much welcomes ASIC's efforts to educate investors and financial consumers through its increased focus on social media and other websites. Its launch of a multilingual financial literacy kit for new migrants and its release of a consultation paper on proposed new operating requirements for investment platforms are welcome developments. The committee also welcomes ASIC's release of guidance on financial licences in the carbon markets and its enforcement policy outlining when, how and why it will take action. The release of both documents will assist in making ASIC's processes and decisions more transparent. They will ultimately enhance the understanding of investors and financial consumers. In conclusion, and on a sad note, the committee extends its sincere sympathies to the family and colleagues of Mr Michael Dwyer, the former ASIC Commissioner, who passed away on 2 March 2012. Mr Dwyer's expertise in insolvency matters, in particular, was of significant benefit to this committee.",108

Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill now be read a second time.,111
204,Mr HOCKEY,BILLS," As I was saying earlier today, before the debate was interrupted, the mistrust starts straight upfront with the claim that the government will deliver a surplus next year. The Treasurer says it with a straight face and yet it is so very clear to everyone that the government has cooked the books to engineer a dodgy promise of a surplus. It has been widely accepted that spending has been brought forward out of next year or delayed beyond the forward estimates. I have taken Australians through that in relation to the National Broadband Network and the CEFC, which, at $10 billion, are treated off-budget. There are other initiatives such as special dividends from the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation that are being taken only next year in order to fluff up the promise of a surplus. Of course the government has allocated only minimal funding to the expensive, $8 billion a year, National Disability Insurance Scheme and the $40 billion submarine program. And I totally refute the allegations made by the intemperate Acting Prime Minister today that we do not support the National Disability Insurance Scheme or its funding. The fact is that the government has not properly funded it and is running away from that issue. There are a number of other broken promises in the budget. It is a budget of new promises made and a budget of broken promises. In fact, 10 major commitments were broken in this budget. First is the government's promise, and the Treasurer's promise, explicitly not to introduce a carbon tax. In fact, from memory he described it as laughable when it came up in the course of a debate with me on the 7.30 Report before the last election. Second, the government cancelled tax cuts which they said were all part of the redistribution of money from the mining boom to deal with a patchwork economy. What we do know is that it was going to pass the Senate with the support of the Greens in relation to small businesses. But the small business minister here, like the rest of his colleagues in the Labor Party, ran away from that, after having made all those promises, and on so many occasions the Treasurer said he would introduce company tax cuts and then dumped them before it even came to the parliament. Third, there was the $500 standard deduction on tax returns promised in August 2010 which was due to commence on 1 July this year. This was a move the Labor Party sold as 'tick and flick' tax returns. You have to be very careful with this mob because if they do not repeat something which is meant to be a core promise then you know they are going to dump it, and the $500 standard deduction is one example of that. Fourth, they had a 50 per cent tax discount on interest earned on bank accounts, bonds, and annuities, announced in May 2010. It was meant to start on 1 July 2011. They dumped that. Then it was meant to start in July 2012 and they dumped that. Then a year later it was meant to start in 2013 and we know they have dumped that. And now they have finally dumped it altogether. They have put it out of its misery. Fifth, Labor went to the 2007 election with a solemn promise to increase foreign aid to 0.5 per cent of GNE by 2016. Well, they have dumped that promise. Sixth, it now appears that the government's commitment to saving the environment was not quite as strong as you would have believed. In 2010 they announced the green buildings tax break of 50 per cent on eligible assets or capital works, but that was dumped in this budget. Seventh, Labor went to the 2010 election trying to be more conservative than us. They said that there was a real commitment for a three per cent increase in average real growth in defence spending right up to 2018. They have dumped that. Eighth, the government has also promised that defence savings would be reinvested in defence. Well, they have dumped that. Ninth, the government went to the 2010 election promising to spare the Public Service from budget cuts. They have challenged us up hill and down dale about all those cuts that they claim that we are going to impose on the Public Service-whereas in fact they were redundancies that I had talked about-but lo and behold, in this budget the government itself goes on and announces a number of cuts to public servants. Tenth, there was the promise to increase the concessional cap on superannuation contributions for Australians over 50. That was promised as part of the mining tax package to start on 1 July 2012. They have now delayed it to 1 July 2014. Therefore, they have broken that promise. So, given that the Labor Party says that they are now going to get there-they are going to deliver the much-vaunted surplusa surplus that you would need to repeat over 100 times just pay off their deficits for the last four years-the government expects us to believe that this promise is real. The challenge is that the debt they are leaving us is the great legacy of Labor, as it always is. But what we know is that peak net interest on debt is now $8.2 billion in 2015-16, and the interest bill alone on government net debt would fully fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme or, alternatively, build eight new teaching hospitals a year. As I have previously foreshadowed, in the limited time. I have available I am moving an amendment to the appropriation bills before the House to allow substantive amendments to these bills and, if successful, we will remove the increased debt limit measure and seek to have a separate debate about that $50 billion increase. We have sought an urgent commitment from the government that they would not attempt to hide an increase in the debt ceiling in the appropriation bills. On 7 May 2012, I wrote to the Treasurer seeking that commitment. I said: 'I am therefore seeking your urgent commitment that, if the Gillard government intends to increase the existing limit beyond $250 billion, this increase is not contained in the 2012-13 appropriation bills. Instead, if the government seeks to increase Australia's debt ceiling in excess of $250 billion, it must be in separate, stand-alone legislation so that it can be given the proper scrutiny and consideration that such a significant increase in borrowings demands.' In 2009, the government had no such issue of increasing the debt limit through a standalone piece of legislation, the Inscribed Stock Amendment Act 2009, rather than in the appropriation bills. We do not accept the current proposed justification for an increase in the debt limit, and I reckon in his heart of hearts neither does the Treasurer, with his flimsy response to the question today. The government must appropriately reflect the significance of increasing the limit on the face value of stock and securities that can be on issue under the Treasurer's standard borrowing authority. The Treasurer must then make the case to the Australian people that Labor deserves the right to increase the credit card limit. The Treasurer must explain why he cannot use the Loan (Temporary Revenue Deficits) Act 1953. I asked him a question in this place. He could not answer it. So, to that effect, and I move the following second reading amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House requests the Government to vary the resolution in relation to the Appropriation bills agreed by the House on 8 May 2012 to permit amendments to be moved and debated to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2012-13.” This is the very least that the public deserves. Australians deserve an opportunity to debate the increase in the government's proposed debt limit. I would suggest that the members for New England and Lyne, who signed an agreement with the government for greater transparency, would have been appalled at today's cover-up, or protection racket-the attempt to try and avoid having a proper debate about the statement by the member for Dobell. They agreed with the coalition that it was inappropriate to close down debate. On the increase of the debt limit of the Commonwealth, I believe that the members for New England and Lyne would have a similar proposal-that you have to have a proper debate about that. They were the ones that argued that we had to have greater transparency, that sunlight is the best disinfectant. On no issue could there be a more substantive case made for having a separate and proper debate than the Labor Party's proposal to increase the debt limit of the Commonwealth government. This is a very significant issue. The Treasurer received advice from the Australian Office of Financial Management. It is quite revealing about his incompetence, his inability to do his job and his lack of confidence that he did not challenge the Australian Office of Financial Management-'Why do we need to go that far? Are there any alternative routes?' He did not have the knowledge or the wit to ask whether there was any other legislation, such as that that I have outlined, which could be used to address the concerns in relation to refinancing during the course of any one financial year. The Treasurer is not up to the job. He simply tables advice from an agency and says, 'That's the reason why I take public policy decisions.' Why do we have him in the Treasurer role? Why don't we have the head of AOFM or a senior public servant acting as the Treasurer? You have to have a Treasurer who questions the department, questions agencies and seeks other advice in relation to these matters. Sadly, we have a weak and insipid Treasurer who simply, when he has to come to the parliament and explain himself, refers to a tabled advice from his department, as if that is conclusive. We will quiz the AOFM and the Department of the Treasury at estimates. We want to get to the bottom of exactly why this sneaky government is trying to avoid proper scrutiny on the debt limit.",111
205,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the amendment seconded?,114
206,Mr Robb,BILLS," I should say that it was interesting to listen to the member for North Sydney in the debate in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 20122013 and the related bills. Once again, we have come to expect just negative commentary from the opposition. The bile that was just spilling out across this chamber a moment ago from the shadow Treasurer in relation to the Treasurer of this government was unbelievable. It once again shows that the opposition, particularly the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition, cannot bring themselves to accept the facts before them. The member for North Sydney talked about a surplus and said that the government are misleading the Australian people. The fact is that the budget papers and the information are there to show that we will be back in surplus. The opposition could not bring themselves to accept the seriousness of the global financial crisis and they would not acknowledge the need for a stimulus to support the economy during that time-nor have they been able to acknowledge the success of that stimulus in supporting jobs and businesses in this country. So, for the last few years, all we have heard is that the financial crisis was just a blip on the radar, that we did not really need to stimulate the economy and that there has not really been support of jobs. They are just sticking their heads in the sand. They refuse to acknowledge the facts. The facts are that this country's economy is the envy of the developed countries. Earlier today I moved a private member's motion in relation to the economy. We have heard that our unemployment is 4.9 per cent. We have heard our statistics compared to those of other countries, especially those in Europe. We have heard the figures in relation to the debt levels in Australia compared to those of other countries. At some point the opposition have to acknowledge the facts and stop this scare campaign and the rhetoric they keep using with the Australian people. The member for North Sydney said 'the Australian people deserve'-they do not deserve the rubbish that is coming out from the opposition. What they deserve is an economy that is growing strongly and a government that is supporting jobs and investing in skills and training, investing health and infrastructure and supporting business. When we talk about business, it is not just about the direct incentives that businesses are being provided; it is also about the flow-on effects of the assistance that this government is giving to households. Let's look at the schoolkids bonus, for example. The schoolkids bonus is providing many families, over 9,700 families in the electorate of Petrie alone, with financial assistance for students-$410 per primary school student and $820 per secondary school student-to provide them support with their education expenses. The question is: where does the opposition think that parents are going to buy those education resources? They are going to buy them from businesses in our local communities. That money helps stimulate our economies. So, when we talk about business, we talk about the financial assistance that is flowing to households through the schoolkids bonus, the financial assistance that is flowing to families through the family tax benefit A assistance that has been outlined-which is an increase of $600 a year from 1 July next year-and we talk about the assistance to families from the supplementary allowance. The supplementary allowance will benefit 9,497 local young people, single parents and unemployed currently receiving allowances, by providing cash payments to help meet the costs of essential services like electricity, gas and water. They will receive a supplementary allowance of $200 while couples will receive $350. These are benefits that go in the pockets of households across the electorate of Petrie and across this country. That additional income for those families will help our local economies. Of course, it is not just those initiatives that we are seeing benefits for in relation to this budget. There are many benefits flowing into people across my local community, especially in the area of health. I just want to take some moments to talk about the benefits to health. Firstly, in this budget the government is investing $515.3 million in a dental health package. Much of this will go towards dealing with the long waiting times for public services. It is estimated there are currently 400,000 patients on public dental waiting lists. That is why this funding is so important and why $345.9 million over the next three years will help reduce those public dental waiting lists. That is a huge benefit to people in my local communities and across this country. But the opposition do not want to acknowledge that. They do not ever talk about dentistry because they are the ones that scrapped the Commonwealth dental scheme. But there are other initiatives flowing in relation to health-and they include the expansion of bowel cancer screening. In this budget the government is providing $49.7 million over four years to fund a phased expansion of the National Bowel Cancer Screening program. Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer related death in Australia. The expansion of this program will significantly reduce illness and death from bowel cancer through early detection and treatment. When the scheme is fully implemented around 12,000 cancers each year will be detected. In addition, there is progress in relation to the e-health agenda. The government is investing another $233.7 million to deliver its e-health agenda, including $161.6 million to operate the personally controlled electronic health record system. This builds on the $466.7 million in the 2010-11 budget to establish the personally controlled electronic health record system. In my electorate I have medical clinics which are now offering patients the opportunity to register with the health record. That is fantastic. My new Medicare local, the North Brisbane Medicare local, which has just set up a new office at North Lakes in my electorate, has a stand-alone machine. You can walk up to your medical centre that has one of these machines-it looks very much like a stand-alone EFTPOS machine-and you can type in details and register immediately to get that electronic health record. That starts the process rolling, which means that people who do that will have the security of knowing that their health records are shared across key primary healthcare providers. If they end up in hospital-they may be unconscious, for example, or unable to recollect all the medicines they are on or the sorts of conditions and allergies they have-this sort of e-health record can save lives, because the hospital will know what that person can and cannot have and will know the sorts of conditions or illnesses they may already have. That will decide the sorts of health treatments they should get into the future. In addition, across Queensland the Labor government is delivering on its commitments by spending around $8.9 million in 2012-13 on digital mammography technology to BreastScreen Australia. It is really important to invest in this new technology to more accurately detect breast cancer. All too often I meet people in my electorate who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and who are still battling this terrible disease. So it is great that there will be extra money, through this budget, invested in this important technology. There is also a huge investment in an area that is very dear to my heart-that is, the disability area. There is much debate about the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There should be no debate on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As far as I am concerned the argument has been had. The case has been made. The Productivity Commission has spoken. We need a National Disability Insurance Scheme in this country. This budget commits $1 billion over the next four years for the first stage of the NDIS. From July 2013, an NDIS will begin operating in launch locations across Australia. And I am hoping that the Queensland government will sit down around the table with the Commonwealth and agree that one of those launch sites should be Queensland, because all too often I meet families who are caring for someone with a severe disability, who know that the current disability system is not adequate: it is not providing for their needs and they need something else. They know that we need the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This scheme will start by assisting around 10,000 people, and this will be expanded to 20,000 people from mid-2014. It will provide individualised care and support and an assessment process so that those most in need-people with significant and permanent disability-will have access to an assessment that develops an individual support plan. That is so needed in the community. Those suffering disabilities and their carers have cried out for this individual support plan, with funding allocated for reasonable and necessary supports. There will be case management. Local area coordinators will work with clients providing information needed to make informed decisions in navigating the systems and assisting in planning. There will be increased services. Increased formal care services will include home support and respite care, and early intervention services to improve functioning and delay or lessen a decline in functioning. I do not have time to go through it in detail, but in addition this budget has significant and important investments in aged care-another key area in the electorate of Petrie. It is great to see that a large proportion of the funding that is going forward is related to home care packages, at a cost of $880 million dollars. The fact that we are increasing the number of home care packages by nearly 40,000 over the next five years is critical. People want to be able to stay at home. They want to be able to stay at home longer. Carers want to be able to stay at home with them. We need to provide them with that support, but when they do need to go into a nursing home, we need to make sure that they have the appropriate care. That is why the other initiatives in relation to aged care are so important. It is important to address the workforce pressures. We have all heard about it: both sides of this parliament have been lobbied hard about the importance of workforce shortages, and not just from the union movement, but also from the workforce and the aged care providers. They all know that there is a workforce shortage that is critical in relation to the aged care sector and they need to be able to do more to attract and hold on to aged care staff. That is why they need to look at improvements in recruitment, training and wages for aged-care staff to enable the sector to meet growing demand and provide quality care for older Australians. In the last couple of minutes I have left, I want to touch on the fact that, as always, this Labor government's budget has ensured there is ongoing investment in infrastructure. This has been a strong commitment of this government since we were first elected in 2007. We have continued to invest in infrastructure, and what this government has been able to show with this budget is it can bring the budget back to surplus, but it does not have to do it to the detriment of investing in infrastructure, health, education, aged care and disabilities. It can do all of that. It is about responsible fiscal policy. In my electorate-and I know as a Queenslander you would appreciate this, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott-I was very pleased to see an additional $20 million in this budget for the Moreton Bay Rail Link. Last year, $135 million was brought forward out of the commitment of $742 million to deliver a rail line that has been promised for over 100 years. Once again there is funding allocated in this year's budget to continue that work. I spoke with the project team just this week. We are very close to announcing the contractor for the road-over-rail bridge at the Kinsellas Road East, where it will go over one of the stations. It is fantastic that this construction has started and, of course, construction along the rail corridor itself will start from mid-next year and the concept designs for the new stations will be released shortly. We are also investing in the Gateway Motorway-Nudgee Road. This budget does deliver a Labor budget: it provides for the community and for our economy, and it is a strong Labor budget. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (16:18): This is a budget that makes no secret of its class warfare motivations and the government's shameful desire to pit Australian against Australian and suburb against suburb in order to reverse Labor's lagging fortunes and save the ruinous career of a desperate Prime Minister. Her embrace of envy as a political strategy must be the final action of a Prime Minister with nowhere else to go. The Prime Minister is cornered between the electorate on one side, angry with her because she has broken promises and the fact that she has consistently put her interests above those of the Australian people, and on the other side a Labor caucus that is now readying itself for another political kill. The Prime Minister is torn between buying the votes of the electorate and the votes of her party room colleagues who keep her in power. Rather than lifting the nation up and encouraging the men and women of this country to aspire to their greatest hopes, dreams and ambitions, the Prime Minister has dragged the nation down into a bitter contest of us versus them, fostering the divisive sectionalism of long-past generations. The Prime Minister has singled out some of our highest achievers for public attack, going so far as to name them individually in press conferences and in the parliament-acts that are beneath the office of the Prime Minister. As one media editorial said, what we need from this Prime Minister is 'more class, less warfare'. This is a budget that seeks to divide rather than unite, and to tear apart rather than create. It is, as the Treasurer has admitted, typical Labor budget. It is full of the usual tricks and sleights of hand that one has come to expect from this government. It has worked the numbers to create the mirage of a minuscule surplus, pushing expenditure out of 2012-2013 into other financial years. It has forecast a generous increase in tax revenue at a time of mounting concern over Europe's economic future and fears of a slowdown in our major export markets. Given that the government's projected $23 billion deficit in last year's budget blew out to some $44 billion in this year's budget, there is little hope that Labor will deliver on even this small sliver of a surplus. Australians are right to be wary of a government that has delivered an accumulated $174 billion in deficits in just four years, yet claimed year after year that it was committed to budget surpluses. At the same time as it talks up its success in saving Australia from further Labor debt, the government plans to introduce measures to increase the country's borrowing limit by an extra $50 billion to $300 million. No government that truly believes its forecast for a budget surplus should be increasing the debt ceiling-the government's borrowing limit-by another $50 billion. I remind the House that the debt ceiling inherited by this government in 2007 when it came to office was nil. Labor has raised the debt ceiling time and time again to $250 billion dollars, and now to $300 billion. Having squandered the nation's wealth on pink batts, overpriced school halls and cash giveaways, the government has now chosen to tear up our national defence, destroying years of hard work and patient investment by the Howard government. The Labor government has been so reckless with Australia's finances that it can no longer even fulfil the first and basic responsibility of government-that is, to secure our nation's a sovereignty and its interests. This should not come as a surprise to anyone who has witnessed the disinterest and disregard of this Prime Minister in matters of foreign affairs and national security. From sending her bodyguard to cabinet's national security committee meetings to doing away with the National Security Statement to parliamentan event that was apparently meant to be as frequent as the annual budget-the Prime Minister has consistently failed in her duties. Australia is situated on the edge of the most dynamic and rapidly changing region in the world. The economic re-emergence of Asia is driving a shift in global power from Europe and North America to our neighbourhood, the Asia-Pacific/Indian Ocean. There is a growing acceptance that this region is in the middle of an arms buildup the likes of which has not been seen since the Cold War and which is heightened by the level of uncertainty felt between nations. Faced with the option of preparing Australia for this new strategic reality or closing her eyes to the challenges, the Prime Minister has chosen the latter. The Gillard government will slash funding for defence to just 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product, taking the share of Australia's wealth spent in this crucial area back to a dangerously low level not seen since the days before the Second World War. Australia needs and deserves a government capable of planning for the future, not just for the next leadership ballot. The chasm between reality and Labor's rhetoric is as starkly apparent in the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio. As it has done with so many of its other promises, the government has trashed the bipartisan commitment to increase Australia's official development assistance to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2013. Labor's promise to reach the target amount in the following year is nothing more than Labor spin designed to minimise the political fallout. Should this government hang on and still be in office next May, there is no doubt that even this deadline will also be pushed back. This government's actions in pushing the aid commitment out beyond the forward estimates has made the task of reaching even this new deadline virtually impossible, and the government knows it. As Professor Stephen Howes, former chief economist at AusAID and panel member on the independent review of aid effectiveness stated: Even with a year‟s delay, it will be a steep climb to get to 0.5, requiring, on average, increases of about $1 billion for each of the next four years from 2013-14 to 2016-17. The aid program has never had an annual increase of anything close to $1 billion. The biggest increase was $626 million in 2008-09, the second biggest $500 million in 2005-06. Even with looser fiscal constraints, it will not be easy to sustain support for a single $1 billion increase, let alone for four such increases consecutively. Yet this is what it will take to get to 0.5% under the new timetable. In retrospect it appears that the government never intended to meet its 0.5 per cent of gross national income commitment by 2015. One need only read the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio budget statements from last year to appreciate the extent of the government's failures over the past twelve months. According to its strategic direction statement, the Gillard government would 'intensify its engagement with China'; instead it has stumbled from one mistake to another. Its schizophrenic handling of the relationship has left baffled Chinese officials who want nothing more than the consistency, coherence and respect provided by coalition policies. Far from intensifying our engagement with China, the government has placed the relationship under immeasurable strain. The departure of the former foreign minister earlier this year was reportedly welcomed as a fresh start for both countries. As Linda Jakobson, director of the East Asia program at the Lowy Institute for International Policy and respected China expert, has stated, 'The ""Rudd factor"" has been an underlying tension in ChinaAustralia ties for four years.' The failure of an Australian government representative to attend the Boao Forum for Asia, China's leading platform for discussing the pressing economic issues confronting the region, was a deliberate snub to China. It was only through a last-minute dash by the Australian ambassador in Beijing, as the Australian's Michael Sainsbury wrote at the time, that complete embarrassment was avoided. That Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti could find the opportunity to attend the Boao Forum despite his immense domestic challenges highlights the complete lack of interest and disregard shown by the Australian government. So much of foreign affairs is about building productive working relationships. For countries that are crucial to our national interest, this exchange must occur at the highest levels. Despite the rhetoric of enhanced engagement, there has only been one prime ministerial visit to China since 2008. As foreign minister, the member for Griffith visited China only twice; neither of these visits was considered official. Former Prime Minister and Labor leader Bob Hawke has joined the criticism of the Gillard government, accusing it of letting the relationship languish. It was recently revealed that Labor's infighting held up the establishment of an annual summit involving key ministers from both countries. According to reports, the Treasurer refused to accept any arrangement that would result in the then foreign minister leading discussions. The Treasurer clearly had no such concern about putting Australia's national interests to the side while the government focused on its leadership tussle. Any positive developments that have occurred in the relationship with China during the past year have been in spite of approach of this government, not because of it. According to last year's strategic direction statement, the Gillard government sought to expand cooperation on security, trade and people-to-people links with Indonesia. That policy lasted less than a month before the government took the drastic step of suspending live cattle exports. The decision was made without any warning to or consultation with the Indonesian government. That is no way to treat a friend and strategic partner. The Indonesian government rightly registered its frustration at being kept in the dark. The consequences of the government's action have become clear as Australia suffers reduced access to the Indonesian market. The government is yet to learn from its mistakes. It has pushed ahead with the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 despite the concerns of countries such as Indonesia that the government has failed to adequately consult with them. Papua New Guinea, on the other hand, does not even rate a mention in the government's list of priorities. Despite being our closest neighbour, it is grouped together with other Pacific island countries. This omission is symbolic of the government's current approach to Papua New Guinea. The foreign minister's cavalier approach has done immense damage to the relationship at a time of sensitive political developments in Port Moresby. In response to suggestions that the election in Papua New Guinea be postponed until later in the year, Senator Carr declared that Australia would have 'no alternative but to organise the world to condemn and isolate Papua New Guinea'. He went on to say, 'We'd be in a position of having to consider sanctions.' Threatening sanctions is a powerful diplomatic tool, not the plaything of Sussex Street strategists. Such a move would have placed Papua New Guinea the alongside such countries as Iran, North Korea and Syria as targets of Australia's autonomous sanctions. Senator Carr was rightly derided in Papua New Guinea for his amateurism. As the recent political crisis in PNG has shown us, it is essential that Australia's political leaders, particularly the foreign minister, maintain the closest working relations with our colleagues in Port Moresby. This can only be achieved through close and consistent contact at the highest level. It was unfortunate that the foreign minister could not attend, nor send any representative of the government to be the keynote speaker, the annual Australia-Papua New Guinea Business Council forum in Brisbane last week. This was attended by former Prime Minister and cabinet minister Sir Mekere Morauta, and I was honoured to step into the vacuum left by the government and deliver the keynote address on behalf of Australia. Last year's strategic direction statement also highlighted the government's intention to pursue a range of free trade agreements with countries in the region. Yet since the member for Rankin became Minister for Trade Australia has dropped the ball on free trade agreements. The minister is personally disinterested in pursuing them and he has even gone so far as to state that a free agreement with China is 'overrated'. If Australia is to benefit from the growth in Asia's middle class and consumer class, strong leadership at a government level is needed. Given the scandals surrounding the government's handling of the Australia Network tender process, it is little wonder there is no mention of Australia's public diplomacy effort in the strategic direction statement. Nothing better captures the incompetence and base student-politicking this government has brought to the national stage than its involvement in what should have been a fair and transparent tender process. As the Australian National Audit Office stated: The manner and circumstances in which this high profile tender process was conducted brought into question the Government‟s ability to deliver such a sensitive process fairly and effectively. In response to the ANAO report, the Australia Network Channel took aim at the government, stating: The Australia Network tenders represent a failure of public administration and highlight the potential risk to a commercial organisation of engaging in business with the Commonwealth, particularly when a government owned entity is the competitor. The costs involved with taking the tender to market, only to scrap the process when the result could not be changed to suit the government's preference, are considerable. Given Labor's failings in the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio in the past 12 months, the Australian people can have no confidence that the coming year will be any different. What Australia needs is a foreign minister capable of working patiently behind the scenes, not a dinner party conversationalist who blunders from one mistake to another. Rather than address trade Labor's woes, Senator Carr's arrival in Canberra has only added to them. From his repeated mistakes about troop levels in Afghanistan, to his embrace of the Taliban as part of the Afghani government, to Papua New Guinea and reports of his strange behaviour in Fiji, he has shown himself to be a liability rather than an asset to the government. His return has been compared to a reserve-grade footballer coming out of retirement to play first grade. So far his record contains nothing to disprove this assertion. The time has come to put an end to this charade and give the people of Australia a chance to rid themselves of this chaotic mess of a government.  to voice my support for the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and the related budget bills before the House. Before I do, I might just slip back into my role as an English teacher and correct for the record a comment made by the previous speaker, the member for Curtin. Like many people, she misunderstands the difference between 'uninterested' and 'disinterested'. I think when she used 'disinterested' she actually meant 'uninterested'. Disinterested means impartial, so I think she might have to correct that with Hansard because there is a complete difference-unless she meant that our Minister for Foreign Affairs is impartial, which is a strange assertion. Back to the budget, which is a testament to the Gillard government's commitment to govern for all Australians and sits on those solid Labor pillars of equality, justice and opportunity-the very things that brought me to the Labor Party in the first place. These are strong times for Australia. Our economy is solid and the resources industry is booming, particularly in Western Australia and Queensland, but, unfortunately, not all Australians have been reaping these benefits. Thanks to our Prime Minister, our Treasurer and the recent battlers budget, more Australians will get to share in our national wealth. Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan are delivering much needed financial relief to families and businesses in Moreton who are currently struggling to cope with the rising cost of living. This Labor government understands current pressures and knows that the best way to support Australians is through tax cuts and directed payment increases. These measures are designed to spread the benefits of our national mining boom to help those who need it. I am still rather surprised that the coalition does not understand the concept of a government helping people in need. The Gillard Labor government is helping 6,800 families in Moreton with kids in school, with $410 a year for each primary school student and $820 a year for each student in high school. Strangely, many in the coalition did not want these much needed payments to happen. I think some of the explanations of that included: 'Because it is just different'-it is different to the baby bonus which was, I think, one of the more detailed explanations I saw. It was certainly small-minded politics at its worse. They were so committed to saying no that they did not actually think about the ramifications or implications. The Gillard Labor government is also helping more than 9,000 Moreton families with a $600 boost to their family tax benefit part A payments. Some in the coalition also do not want this payment to happen, which is a shame. During question time and earlier today I saw from the opposition the daily jeremiads about the cost-of-living increases but, when it came to voting for something that would benefit families in Moreton, they would not lift a finger. This Gillard Labor government is also helping 9,073 Moreton young people, single parents and the unemployed with a supplementary allowance to help them pay for essential services. Surprise, surprise!-the coalition are also against this vital assistance to help these vulnerable Australians with the cost of electricity, gas, water and those other living expenses. I am also particularly proud that this Labor budget provides further protection for vulnerable children, with the creation of a national children's commissioner within the Australian Human Rights Commission. I have had a particular interest in this area for a long time because my partner has worked in this area for about the last 22 or so years. We are taking some great steps in the area of looking after children. Jenny Macklin's National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children and some of the other initiatives we have taken with the states will hopefully mean that fewer children will slip between the cracks. Unfortunately, we have seen some opposite rail against the budget, which is making sure that vulnerable children are better prepared for school with a $55.7 million boost to the Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters. And they rage against a budget that is helping to build a National Disability Insurance Scheme, which is something that I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition would have been quite supportive of. We have put on the table $1 billion over four years to help Australians with a disability. I see the Deputy Leader of the Opposition sitting opposite. As a Queenslander he would know some of those shameful statistics, which must be sheeted home to Labor governments as well. The sad thing is that if you are a Queenslander with a disability you receive $7 for every $10 that a Victorian receives. That is not a legacy. To take the politics out, it is certainly something I would be urging those opposite to talk to Premier Campbell Newman about as he said there will be no negotiation. But surely there could be a roadmap towards trying to help this very vulnerable group in our community, a group that has been particularly vocal in lobbying me over the last few years. In other budget initiatives there is a $3.7 billion funding commitment towards aged care reform. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition has said 'no' to this measure. Investing in maths and science, increasing the number of students attending university and improving health services are all noble aims in a parliament that on occasion lacks nobility perhaps. What did the Leader of the Opposition say? He said 'no'. It is like those episodes of Little Britain on steroids, where the computer says 'no' to everything. There are over 19,000 small businesses in my electorate which need help, such as through the Gillard Labor government's instant tax write-off for each asset purchased below $6,500 and the same for the first $5,000 spent on a new motor vehicle. Unfortunately, we could not deliver the one per cent cut in company tax. I would have loved to vote for that in this chamber as would most people who understand how important small business is. As I said, I have 19,000 small businesses in my electorate so I understand the issue very well. Unfortunately, those opposite said 'no' again. These businesses need decisive action. Unfortunately, we were not able to provide that but at least the instant tax write-off and the other money will be some compensation. I still ask those opposite to step up and support that in the future. There are some good things in the budget for business. There is the small business advisory service, which I have had a bit to do with in my electorate. We are able to provide another four years of advice, knowledge and experience to help some of some of those fledgling ideas grow into big businesses. As the Treasurer said, this is a battlers budget. We will give money to Australians who need our help the most. Unfortunately, some of those opposite have said it is the wrong thing to do. You could say that is the fundamental difference between the Australian Labor Party and the coalition: the balancing of the community versus the individual; the greater good versus individual greed; selfless versus selfish. Unfortunately the Leader of the Opposition, in his blind pursuit of power by any means necessary, has shown his true character and also shown that he is truly out of touch with Australians that are struggling at the moment with some one of of these cost-of-living pressures. Although Australia does stand out amongst its international peers as a prosperous economy, despite the dark days of the global financial crisis and the current hiccoughs that are being experienced in Greece, Italy, Spain and even in the United Kingdom and United States, there are some tough times ahead for the globe, that is for sure. Obviously many other nations were hit by these tough times, particularly during the GFC, but Australia weathered the storm reasonably well with Wayne Swan at the helm of our finances. We avoided a recession that would have meant horrible job losses. That is something that is glossed in this chamber. Think of what 200,000 job losses would mean and think of how it would affect kids in school and how it would affect businesses. That would be a horrible thing for our community. So I am glad we were part of an economic stimulus package that steered Australia through that very tough global time. We have come through that period of global uncertainty in relatively good shape when it comes to government debt, inflation and living standards. Here we are now with our economy expected to outshine almost every other advanced economy over the next two years yet we were still able to return budget to surplus. This sends a clear message to the rest of the world that Australia's economy has remained strong during this period of global uncertainty. The Acting Prime Minister said during question time that we had the courage to stick to our guns and to stick to our 2007 election commitment that was shared by those opposite of putting a price on harmful pollution. Obviously those opposite are still committed to reining in exactly the same amount of pollution as this government, the same emissions targets. Although how they are going to do it in a one-, twoor three-year turn around with only carrots and no stick is beyond comprehension-as any sensible environmentalist or economist would know. So we will bring in a gentle but necessary change to our economy through this price on harmful pollution and that will set us up well to provide jobs for my grandchildren long into the future as the digital economy becomes passe. Combine that with the NBN and our education reforms and we have structured the economy well for the future. Delivering a surplus or getting back in black-to quote AC/DC-will protect lowand middle-income earners and the most vulnerable people in our nation. It will give over us a buffer during these turbulent global times and it will give the Reserve Bank the room it needs to cut interest rates should the international situation deteriorate and send troubling waves towards our shores. As I said before, these are relatively good times for Australia but I know many people feel like this is somebody else's boomsomebody else is reaping the benefits when our minerals are dug up by mining companies. It is hard to be grateful for a strong economy when you are having difficulty making ends meet. Electricity, rents, mortgages, groceries and petrol are putting considerable pressure on many the family budgets throughout Australia. I know in Queensland many residents are still trying to get back on their feet after the devastating floods and cyclones of recent years. What we must do, and what the Gillard Labor government has done in this budget, is support families, students and low-incomeearning Australians to help them get ahead, to better share in the prosperity. This is simply the right thing to do, but let us not forget that these measures also support our economy by assisting retail, manufacturing and those other businesses that are struggling because of the high dollar and perhaps because of sales going overseas and because of the uncertainty. These are uncertain times, yet the Australian budget remains in stable hands: help is going to where it is needed and action is being taken to create a fairer Australia. I mentioned this briefly before, but the National Disability Insurance Scheme is a component of this budget of which I am particularly proud, and I again urge every Queensland MP to contact the Leader of the Opposition about it-and Premier Newman as well. The NDIS, due to begin its rollout in mid-2013, will provide care to around 10,000 people with significant and permanent disabilities. A year later the NDIS will be expanded to help up to 20,000 people. This is a groundbreaking plan, and I thank Minister Shorten for his involvement with this early on, when he was the parliamentary secretary. Why? Because it will provide eligible people with the support they need; it will grant people decision making powers, including being able to choose their service provider; it will deliver high-quality evidence based services, be user-friendly and link to mainstream and community services; it will acknowledge the invaluable role of families and carers and help them continue their great work, and maybe even beyond that as we move to an ageing group of people with disabilities. It will also assist with community participation, education and employment opportunities and it will be managed, as the name suggests, on an insurance basis. Disability groups in Moreton, and throughout Australia. I guess, have welcomed the commitment, but unfortunately many states are dragging their feet. I want to take this opportunity Premier Newman to consider what must go on here. And I put out the call to my LNP state MPs around Moreton-Sunnybank MP, Mark Stewart; Stretton MP, Freya Ostapovitch; Yeerongpilly MP, Carl Judge; and cabinet Minister Scott Emerson to join me in asking the Premier to reconsider this stubborn stance of just saying no. The NDIS is great news for local people with disability and their carers, and we need Queensland to sign on to this vital reform. I hope we can work together and ensure Queenslanders with a disability get the care and support they deserve. They have waited long enough for change-and, as I said, I was a bit embarrassed to find that out about the Queensland $7 to $10 ratio. This is the right budget for the right time for Australia. It delivers a surplus on time, as promised. It delivers financial support to those in need and it delivers a plan for a fairer nation to create a stronger community and a more just society. I wholeheartedly commend the bills to the House.",114
207,Mr TRUSS,BILLS," Labor has unquestionably delivered another budget failure. It has a fudged surplus, more broken promises-and there is no plan to drive productivity growth, to repay debt or to secure jobs. It does nothing for aspirational Australians-remember them? These are the people who believe in hard work and that you should be rewarded for your labour, your enterprise and your innovation. These are the people who are the drivers of our nation's economic growth and prosperity. From their efforts, we all benefit. It is not just a case of job creation-though this government could do with a policy on that front as well, remembering no new jobs were created at all in Australia last year, for the first time in decades-but it is also about the prospect of getting a better job, or career to again ask development. This budget talks about 'sharing the benefits of the boom', but most of the sharing of benefits is simply paying more compensation for the carbon tax. The carbon tax is the unmentioned centrepiece of this budget-it begins, after all, in only 40 days. The budget is a precursor to the carbon tax. And that tax itself threatens the very future of the boom that is supposed to be paying for the handouts announced in this budget. But what is of particular concern under this government is that they have created an economy which has become increasingly internationally uncompetitive. There is low productivity. They are consuming the benefits of the boom with waste and mismanagement. They have seemingly no understanding that even large corporations or large projects need a supportive government if they are to proceed. We cannot afford to continue to impose upon projects, manufacturing industries and small business in this country taxes that no-one else in the world will pay. We cannot have special burdens that make it unattractive to invest this country. You cannot have an industrial relations climate where people believe they have a right to simply walk away from their jobs, that they actually believe that somehow or another the country is better off when they punish their own employer and make it more difficult for them to pay their wages. I was appalled when Jacques Nasser reported to a luncheon last week that BHP had 3,200 industrial incidents in its Bowen Basin coalfields last year alone. That is almost 10 industrial incidents a day! Sometimes unions simply notify that they are going to have stop work action, and then they call it off. There were in fact 500 instances where the union announced it was going to have action and called it off at the last minute-designed to inflict the maximum pain and discomfort and reduced productivity to their employer while at the same time collecting all their wages as though nothing had happened. You cannot have a country that is going to be prosperous and able to provide support for those in need in our community if our industry is not encouraged and rewarded for its effort. Instead of building a boom this budget has come with cheap bribes-the vain hope that people who are going to be slugged week in, week out, year after year by a carbon tax, whose name this government dare not mention, will think Labor is doing them a favour. We should be concentrating not on handing out the benefits of the boom but on nurturing it-making sure it actually happens and making sure it continues to sustain growth and to provide a future for our nation, and not just a future for the Labor government. This unmentionable tax is now the subject of a $70 million advertising blitz, but neither the words 'carbon' nor 'tax' get used in this advertising campaign. It is simply laughable in that such a wilfully deceptive campaign could ever meet the advertising standards required for 'informing the public' on government programs. They are simply taxpayer paid political as. The government cannot sell its own budget so now it is trying to pay an advertising agency to do the job. The 'fudge-it budget' has been concocted to provide additional compensation for lower-income people so that they can deal with the carbon tax fallout. But would it not be better to get rid of the tax altogether? Then you would not need to pay the compensation. You would not penalise Australian industry. You would not need to put them in a position where they cannot compete with imported products or cannot, in fact, maintain their own export markets. It makes far more sense to get rid of the tax itself than to use its revenue to pay compensation. This is a tax that is full of flaws and inequities and, frankly, nothing can fix it. The government are imposing a penalty on everything we do in this country, and in so doing they are placing a burden on us that is not matched anywhere else in the world. As we look at this tax, every day new anomalies come to our attention. I was called only this morning by the operator of a small supermarket, who has been told that the cost of recharging the refrigerators in her supermarket is going to increase from $46 to $167 per refrigerator as a result of the carbon tax. And I heard a similar story-in fact, a worse story-when I visited the trucking convention last week. Truck drivers told me that the carbon tax equivalent on the refrigerant used in refrigerated trucks will not have an increase of $23 per tonne; because the government uses a globalwarming potential index to multiply the cost for its calculation of the global-warming impact, the actual tax on the refrigerant used in a truck will be over $70,000 a tonne. Not $23 a tonne, over $70,000 a tonne! There are these kinds of anomalies. I do not know whether the government even knows that it is doing this sort of thing. It certainly has no plan and it has no way of helping these people to cope with that sort of cost. You heard today in question time about the $2 million cost that the Cassowary Coast Regional Council is going to have to pay to get rid of the rubbish that was created by Cyclone Yasi. These people, who not only have the burden of having to clean up their properties, now are going to have to pay a $2 million carbon tax to get rid of the rubbish. Now, if they left it all to rot out in the field there would be no carbon tax imposed. But if they clean it up and put it in the council tip then the reward for that is a $2 million tax from this government. And what about the example I heard about when I visited a manufacturing facility just recently? They work their boilers et cetera at night to take advantage of night rate electricity. That is an environmentally friendly and sensible thing to do. But because the carbon tax is a flat rate, they pay double the electricity prices for their night rate even though the day rate may only go up by 10 or 20 per cent. Did the government intend to do such an illogical thing? Are they crazy? Or do they just not know what they are doing? I fear that it is a little of both. If you believe that you need to address climate change as a global problem. Even if you believe that Australia can or should take the lead you would not set a price that is five times higher than is being paid anywhere else in the world, or a tax that is so comprehensive across the economy that no other country will collect even a fraction of what this carbon tax will raise. This is a penalty on Australians, and on Australians only, and it will do nothing-nothing whatever-to change the temperature of the globe. Australians are sick of the mentality which drives a budget which seems to be all about class warfare. They do not want their governments to waste their money, be it on pink batts, or overpriced school halls or on handouts. And they certainly do not want governments that do not tell the truth. When it comes to this budget, the feeble $1.5 billion surplus that is supposed to be the central triumph of this budget fails to inspire or to encourage struggling communities and families right across the nation. When you bring spending forward and push expenditure backwards into outyears you do not make any more money: you just shuffle it around. This year's surplus is largely there because we are having a bigger debt this year and a bigger debt the following year. It is a slippery surplus. If the government had not brought forward into this financial year $1.1 billion of the money to be paid to local government in 2012-13, the $1.4 billion payment to Queensland for disaster relief, $1.8 billion in infrastructure will payments to the states and $1.5 billion in compensation payments to pensioners and welfare beneficiaries for the carbon tax then the budget surplus would be well and truly wiped out. But that is not all: Labor's energy security scheme is a $1 billion-a-year program, except for next financial year when the expenditure will only be $800,000. Labor's coal sector jobs package is a $220 to $250 million program, but next year there is only $10 million. If we look at Labor's record, this is not first time they have proposed a budget surplus. That happened in their very first budget, when we were told the budget surplus was $22 billion. Of course, it ended up as a $27 billion deficit. Our Treasurer was out by $49 billion on that occasion, and he has now produced $174 billion worth of budget deficits. The cumulative errors on his estimates for the budget surpluses or deficits amount to over $80 billion. In four budgets he has been out by $80 billion! And this time we are expected to believe that there is going to be a $1.5 billion surplus. But if we are going to have a surplus and if we are going to run at a profit for the why is our net debt forecast to go up by $40 billion? Why are the government bringing in legislation to increase Australia's credit card limit from $250 billion to $300 billion? They say they only need it for temporary purposes, but you do not need legislation to temporarily increase the limit. This, like all the other increases in our national borrowing limit under Labor will unquestionably end up being permanent, and our debt will just grow and grow. Unemployment is predicted to be 5.5 per cent for the year ahead. That is up on the current figure. CPI is also expected to rise. So what hope is there for people in this budget? It is full also of broken promises. The company tax cut that was supposed to be the compensation for the mining tax has been axed, saving the government $4.7 billion. After deferral after deferral, the proposal for the standard $500 deduction ramping up to $1,000 is gone also, saving $2 billion. The tax concession they promised on 50 per cent of people's interest earnings has been axed. The $500 mature age worker tax offset has been axed, saving another $250 million. The super tax has been doubled to 30 per cent for those people with incomes above $300,000, the earning the government another $1 billion. They have deferred the higher contributions cap on superannuation yet again, saving another $1.5 billion. This is a government that has introduced-again, as usual for a Labor government-stacks of new taxes, perhaps none less heartless than the new tax on the tourism industry, the increase in the passenger movement charge. That passenger movement charge was established to cover the cost of border processing. Now it is just a milking cow for this government. The government expects to raise an extra $610 million from the struggling tourist industry year, over the next four years from this tax. Of course, the airports are now also going to have to pay for the police who are doing their job on airport property. The government's budget is a serious disappointment for people in regional Australia in particular. Some $941 million for infrastructure works to improve water efficiency in the Murray-Darling Basin has been deferred to 2015-16. That is the very last year of the forward estimates, and it is clear that it is also heading for the axe. This is the lazy way that this government has approached water reform. They are happy to waste money on buyouts, but they will not do the hard work of fixing the system so that there is water available there for our environmental needs without having to take it away from country towns and from irrigators. Another major disappointment is the $1 billion for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The Productivity Commission had recommended a $3.9 billion outlay over the next four years to set this scheme up, but the government has provided only $1 billion. It is going to cost $7 billion-plus a year to run this scheme. If we as a nation were not paying $8 billion a year on interest on Labor's debt, we could afford the National Disability Insurance Scheme now. Of course, there is $350 million for a dental waiting program, so long as the states cooperate, but they are abolishing the Medicare dental program and the teen dental program. Sixtyeight million dollars has been cut from rural health workforce programs and $75 million from the Indigenous health infrastructure program. The Gonski review of education will require billions of dollars, but there is only $5.8 million over four years in the budget. So this has been a budget of great disappointment. It is an endless round of more of the same: debt, spending and broken promises. The budget may spend the boom; it certainly does not nurture it.",125
208,Mr RIPOLL,BILLS," It is a great pleasure to have an opportunity to talk about all the good, positive and great things about this country and the great things that are being done in ordinary people's homes and for working families, small business and all those people that really work hard to make this country a success-not the negative drivel that we get over on the other side about how it is all doom and gloom and the world is coming to an end. It might be coming to an end in some parts of the world, but not in Australia, because in Australia we have a government that listens to people and delivers the right budgets at the right time, with surpluses when they are needed, not just in the golden years when the rivers of gold used to come into Canberra. The government makes the really important decisions about maintaining sustainability into the future, and that is exactly what this budget does, to a tee, and it gets it right. In fact, it was just last week that I had the great good fortune of being with the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, when we opened the Ipswich Motorway, a great Labor commitment-something I had campaigned list for since 1998. We might have done a lot of work, and from opposition you do not get too many wins, but I tell you what: that was one of the best wins we ever got for South-East Queensland. Finally, now, in 2012 we can actually open up this road that actually began on the very first day after we were elected in 2007. That is when work began on the Ipswich Motorway. You know what they say: success has many fathers and failure is an orphan. In this case the Liberal Party, the National Party and everybody who opposed it were scrambling to be part of this great success, because they can now see with their own eyes the difference it has made to ordinary people in the south-east in that same spirit of positive thinking, responsible action, good work in terms of budgets, spending on infrastructure, keeping the economy strong and keeping people in jobs even through a global financial crisis. I can understand if some people do not think the crisis hit Australia, because we actually did something to prevent it hitting here. This government, when we got elected, did something real. We were opposed all the way, kicking and screaming, by this mob over there on the opposition side, who just refused to do anything. If they had had their way-if they had had the numbers on the floor-we would have sat back, watched it all happen and hoped, like Europe or even the United States, that it just would not affect people here and that they would not lose their jobs. That just did not happen in Australia, because we took action. It always takes a government with just a small amount of responsibility and courage to do what is required, and we have done that since 2007-not always the most popular decisions, but always the right decisions and the responsible decisions. I am very confident that in 20 years time, in the full glare of day, when people review us, they will go back and say, 'I tell you what: they were pretty tough decisions. They were tough times. They were tough days, but that was a government that stood up and was counted, and I'm proud of that.' I can tell you that that is exactly what will happen, just as for the first time in Australian history, as a result of the actions that we have taken as a government, the rest of the world-the global community-has rated the Australian economy one of the best in the world. We are AAA rated across all three credit-rating agencies for the first time in our history. That tells you something: at least they are not biased. At least they are not just opposing for opposition's sake. They are just making a global economic assessment and they say we are doing okay, and you know what? I agree with them. I actually think we are doing okay, and I think that if were a little bit more confidence emanating out of the people's house in parliament then there might be a little bit more confidence among ordinary folk as well. I can talk about all the positive things, there are so many that it would take me a lot more than the 15 minutes for which I have been given grace to speak today, but I will talk about some of the good things and why it is so important that we have put a surplus in our budget this time around. One reason is that we promised it. We said we would return the budget to surplus on time, and we have. Returning to a surplus is our best defence. We do not know what is around the corner, but it is our best defence. It arms us against another potential that we have seen in the past and it gives us and certainly the Reserve Bank more flexibility to move in terms of more interest rate cuts, if they are needed, just like occurred recently. An official cash rate of 3.75 per cent is good for some. It is certainly good for mortgage holders and it is really good for our economy. And now we are seeing a turnaround in the Australian dollar. It is easing, which means there is a little less pressure on our manufacturers and exporters. There is a little less pressure on a range of Australian businesses. It shows you that the good work of the government does pay off in the area of jobs where we have a great record. During the global financial crisis Labor had a great record of keeping people working. Currently we have 5.1 per cent unemployment rate, which is low enough-it will never be completely low enoughcompared to the rest of the world, almost at full employment, coming down to 4.9 per cent. Interestingly, that particular set of numbers, that data, are the same figures and the same dataset that have been used for 30 years, along with the same methodology. There is no question about the number-for 30 years we have had the same methodology. So rather than it being anything but positive it is actually a fantastic result. It simply says: while there are jobs being shed in certain and parts of the economy, jobs are also being created just down the road. Unfortunately, we have a media in this country who will only report on one side of the ledger. Jobs go, but they never walk two steps down the street to say: 'Job created.' That is the reality: job created. Sure, there is a change in our economy and we are managing through that change because we believe people have a right to a decent opportunity to work to make something for themselves. If we just look at interest rates and mortgages we see that, on an average mortgage today of $300,000, people are actually saving around $3,000 a year. That is how much they are saving by paying less because we are here in government. This is all in the framework of massive global uncertainty, of government being stripped of $150 billion of revenue. That is when it gets tough. That is when you need a good Treasurer, good government and serious policy. That is when you need to take responsibility, because that is when it makes a difference, not when the rivers of gold to flow in this place and then Treasurer Costello could not make a prediction on the budget surplus because there was so much money going around that he never knew how much money was going to flood into the place. That was happening all around the world-in Europe, the US and everywhere. We were not immune. But what did we do with that great surplus, those great opportunities? Did we invest in the long term future? Did we invest in the aftermath of a mining boom? Did we invest in skills and training, in education and in health? You get criticised by this sloppy opposition, which had 12 years in government, yet it could not even do halfin fact, not even a third-the things we have done in four years. I am confident in saying that, in four years, we have achieved more than three times what you achieved in 12 years. It goes to evidence and proof. Just have a look at the budget. Have a look at the programs that Labor is delivering. Have a look at dental health and at a whole range of other areas. Have a look at how we are helping ordinary families keeping people in jobs and sustaining manufacturing. Have a look at what we have done in terms of solar panels and helping people on pensions. The single biggest increase in the pension rate in this country, in 100 years, came from a Labor government-a Labor government that understood that there was enough talking about people on the age pension being on the poverty edge and that actually made a financial commitment. People here still oppose that rise. They just do not get it. Go and talk to a real pensioner. Go and talk to somebody who appreciates that significant rise that we put in place. It cost the budget $5 billion on the day and $20 billion over the forward estimates. But that is the reality of what we did. We actually did something real and we have done something real for used pensioners again in this budget. We have ensured that they are not the forgotten people. Call them whatever you likebattlers, people doing it tough. But I tell you this: you can talk the talk, but you have to walk it as well. Over here, in tough times, we are talking it and we are walking it. We are delivering the programs that make a difference. Have a look at the average family and their cost-of-living pressures. What is a costof-living pressure? Everything costs money. We all get that, but what are we doing about it-schoolkids bonus. Call it whatever you like.",129
209,Mr Robb,BILLS,The carbon tax!,131
210,Mr RIPOLL,BILLS,"I am happy to talk about the carbon tax; I am happy to take the interjection. They giggle and laugh, but the reality is they have the same targets, the same policy. Everything is the same except, on the Labor side, the government side, we have a market based solution and we will be taxing 500 big companies, 500 big polluters. On the opposition side, same target, same policy, same outcomes, except they are going to tax ordinary people-householdsdirectly. That is, in your hip pocket, in your home and at the kitchen table. That is who will have to pay under the opposition's policy. The Liberal-National Party have done this greatest turnaround in history. Once were maybe something; today are barely nothing. Because today they want to tax ordinary people and let the big polluters get away with it. You cannot even imagine itthis is the Liberal Party of Menzies over here, because they just want to tax ordinary people on absolutely everything. Schoolkids bonus is for ordinary families. We put a tax incentive in place and not everyone accessed it, not everyone made use of it, so we have a better plan. And the better plan is to give it to them directly. They are responsible parents out there and, one way or another, they will spend that money on their kids. In whatever form it takes they will spend that money on their kids. It is good for them, it is good for their kids and it is good for the economy. For the life of me, I cannot understand how an opposition could credibly stand up and oppose such a positive change. They talk about the carbon tax. Let me tell you that, when they introduced the GST, there was no compensation. You just had to wear it. That was it; just wear it. The impact of that was 10 times what the impact of the carbon tax will be. But, at least, we have recognised that where we make people pay a little bit extra, indirectly, where there a cost, we will be keeping an eye on how those costs work and ensuring that people will be compensated for that. The list is long. We are protecting vulnerable children. There is more money and we are ensuring children get better access to education. In this budget we have not forgotten disability and ageing. We have put a significant amount, billions of dollars, into the aged-care sector, ensuring that as people age they actually get some dignity, they can stay at home longer and they are not forced into a home and, very importantly, are not forced to sell their home to get into another one. That is something that only a Labor government would do. On this side we do not have discussions about kero baths; we actually have discussions about giving people proper care. That is what we do over on this side and we deliver it through this budget in the toughest of times. Again, I cannot believe that this mob over here would oppose a National Disability Insurance Scheme on the scale of Medicare. It will take some years to put into place, but you have to start somewhere. You have to recognise the need. We have been listening to people across the political spectrum talk about the need for this for 20 years. When is it going to happen? It will happen under a Labor government. We have already put it into place; that is what we are doing right now. There are many other programs: dental programs, making sure people in the workforce have skills, better safety on regional buses, Roads to Recovery-a great program, and we are continuing to fund it for the next five years. I also want to make particular note today, in the small amount of time. I have left, that it is World IBD Day. I mentioned earlier that the government is increasing funding for bowel cancer screening, and it gives me an opportunity to speak about inflammatory will be bowel disease. World IBD Day was Saturday, 19 May. It was the second World IBD Day. The conditions that make up IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Both are very debilitating diseases that mostly hit young people and are largely unsupported and unfunded in this country. It is a great tragedy to see what the hard working young people that are affected by this disease have to do to survive and fund their own way. Even though we have great programs and a first-class Medicare system-the best Medicare and pharmaceutical system in the world-there is still a lot more that we can do. I am making it a mission of mine to make people aware of this. I helped set up the Crohn's and Colitis Parliamentary Friendship Group with Andrew Laming. I have good support from both sides of this House on what is recognised across the spectrum as a really bad disease that needs more work. The causes of inflammation of the bowel are more prevalent in society than epilepsy, MS, rheumatoid arthritis, eczema schizophrenia-it is just little understood and little known. It is a responsibility for all to make people aware of this, and I have certainly taken that on. Over 61,000 Australians have IBD and a new study indicates that 18 people per 100,000 have Crohn's disease and 11 people per 100,000 have ulcerative colitis. The peak onset age is between 15 and 40, in a person's prime, and it affects not only the sufferer but also their friends, their families and their ability to work. Often you will find that they are self-employed people who, from an early age, understood that their disease meant they could not hold down a regular job and, therefore, had to create their own job and their own work. I know a number of people who have this very tragic disease and who work very hard not to be a burden on taxpayers or on others, including their family, but to fight this disease as best they can. It is a chronic condition and sufferers require long periods of expensive medication and face multiple bouts of major surgerysome having surgery 20, 30 or 40 times. If you can imagine what that does to a person's body, you can understand just how chronic this disease is. Apart from the obvious personal cost, there is also a huge economic cost. A 2007 study by Access Economics found that the cost to the community is around $2.7 billion-a $500 million financial cost and a $2.2 billion cost in lost well-being and productivity absenteeism, workplace separation, early retirement and premature death. Keep the 2007 figures in mind because I know today they are much higher. Last year I started the parliamentary friendship group and I am very thankful for the members of that group. Tonight we have a major function on to mark World IBD Day. I challenge everyone here to pay more or attention to this chronic disease and do whatever they can to find out about people in of us their own electorates who have it. (Time expired)",131
211,Mr ROBB,BILLS," I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 20122013 and related bills. This federal budget has sunk like a stone. The experience in my electorate office and elsewhere, from what I gather in discussions with so many of my colleagues, is that there is virtually no contact-no phone calls, no attempt to get detail. This is most unusual irrespective of how budgets are received or who delivers the budget on either side of the chamber. You would normally expect to get a reasonable number of calls coming to your office either to complain or to congratulate or, at the very least, to seek details of different programs. This year, silence-because this budget has sunk like a stone. People have stopped listening to this government. They have no confidence that anyone is running the show. They have no confidence in this Treasurer and his ability to bring down a budget that is in any way believable or competent. Australians simply do not find this budget believable. Not more than 18 months ago they heard the first forecast of $12 billion for this budget's deficit. Then, in the budget last year, they heard a forecast of $23 billion. Then, toward the end of last year in November's mid-year economic statement, they heard that the budget deficit would be $37 billion. This time around, when the through budget was actually given, they hear that it is $44 billion-at a time when the year still had a couple of months to go. No wonder people do not find this budget believable. No wonder they have taken absolutely no notice of what has been said by the Treasurer and the government. Why would they believe a surplus forecast? Why would they believe in a $26 billion turnaround? They have heard the spin before, again and again, and we have just heard it again from the member for Oxley-apart from the last four minutes on IBD and Crohn's disease. People have been bludgeoned into reality by the outcomes, not the spin. They have been disheartened. They have been let down so often. They are sick of it-the cute words, the explanations, the endless forecasts which are never delivered. We hear this Treasurer bemoaning the fact that he has had to deal with a $150 billion write-down in the budget, as though someone came along and put an extra burden on him. But they were his forecasts from previous budgets that were overstated-everyone said they were overstated, these pollyanna forecasts from previous budgets. Then he comes in here with shoulders stooped, complaining of the fact that he has got to write down $150 billion. Well, poor Wayne! Poor Treasurer! These are things that he forecast and then, when the forecasts were not realised, he gets it on one side-he helps sell a budget with a shonky forecast-and then he gets it on the other side, by saying that he had to deal with the write-down of $150 billion of moneys that were not realised. This is just an example of the type of spin that everyone has to put up with. It is the type of spin that has made people so cynical, so distrustful and so confused, and so upset about the way in which this government is running the affairs of state. It is why there a crisis of confidence in this country. It is why people are saving at a level they have never saved at before-12 per cent for the last 12 months. That is nearly $90 billion not spent that normally would be spent. No wonder retail is on its knees. There is all of the money that is sitting on balance sheets of companies not being invested. Go out and talk to them, and they all say, 'Why would I invest? I've got no idea who's running this show. Is there anyone up there who's got any ideas?' Mr Sidebottom interjecting",133
212,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, do I have to put up with this nonsense from the other side here?",134
213,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The parliamentary secretary!,134
214,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"This budget is a discredited budget-totally discredited. I just want to give a couple of quotes. The chief of certified practising accountants, Alex Malley, said that Australia desperately needs a vision and that that was not achieved in the budget. 'Accounting chicanery was the winner tonight,' he said at the end of the budget. On the same evening, respected economic commentator Alan Kohler said: This is, at its core, a big taxing, big spending budget, including a big increase in welfare. And he also said: … it is the budget of an unpopular Government approaching an election, not one that's tightening the belt. He has nailed it. You would not think so, though, from the verbiage about the budget coming from the other side of the chamber. This budget is a flight of fancy. You need look no further than the revenue forecast. There was a revenue forecast of 11.8 per cent. The Treasurer is setting himself up again for an opportunity to bemoan the outcome next year by overstating the is forecast this year, once again. The revenue forecast is 11.8 per cent. This cannot happen and will not happen. The long-term average through good years is eight per cent. The Australian dollar, the coal price, resource share prices-they are all forward indicators, and they are all heading south, every one of them. Add to this the new socialist governments in Europe, the recent developments in the last week or two in Spain and Greece and unemployment on the up again in the United States, and we are not going to see a 12 per cent increase in revenue. It simply will not happen. We will be a long way south of that. And this government knows it. It is again an exercise in deception. It is an exercise designed to fool people long enough to get through a budget and to seek to put a gloss on what are, demonstrably, failed results. The Treasurer keeps talking about Australia being well ahead of the rest of the developed world. Of course, our competitors are, in the main, not in the developed world, but put that aside. The IMF just a couple of weeks ago stated that six developed countries are now back in structural surplus-six developed countries. This is the yardstick that the Treasurer keeps wanting to refer to. And yet they still referred to Australia being in structural deficit. In other words, we are wasting the mining boom. The rivers of gold are being used to fund excessive payments. That is what a structural deficit means. And if the rivers of gold come off 20 or 30 per cent, we are in deep trouble. We are back in deficit without doing anything else. Without doing another thing, we are back in deficit. This budget is a confused budget. On the one hand, we heard for weeks that it was going to be a really tough budget. My goodness, this was going to be tough. This was going to shake the bones of all those people who like to spend, spend, spend. Yet when we got to the night-actually, when we got to a couple of weeks before, when the Prime Minister came back into the country and thought she was being set up by the Treasurer-we started to hear of endless handouts: a vote-buying exercise. Of course they are all paid for by borrowed funds. We hear again and again from the other side of the chamber, in defence of the budget, about all the spending initiatives that they have got and who they are helping. People are not deluded by this. They are worried by the fact that you are helping them with more borrowed money. That is not help; that is just deferred pain. That just means that someone further down the track is going to require repayment of that money. It is, again, spin over substance, and we are seeing the outcome of it. The $800 cheques-that is all borrowed money, every penny of it. One hundred million dollars a day! They say they are helping small business. They are in the market for $100 million each day, forcing small business out of the market. They cannot get money to keep the doors of their businesses open, to refinance their mortgages. Nor can they get loans at any sort of reasonable interest rate, because this government has been borrowing $100 million a day for years now-for three years, $100 million a day. And they say they are interested in and supportive of small business. It is a joke. Not only have they got a supposedly tough budget that ended up with all these handouts, but also there is a confusion of broken promises. The budget actively discourages investment by Australian based companies and foreign investors. They claim that this shonky surplus is going to give great confidence and comfort to business and will turn the tables on all sorts of problems faced by businesses outside of the mining sector. Yet, in the same breath, they drop a long standing promise to reduce company tax. And of course there was nothing on deregulation. It is a budget that actively discourages investment. And when you look to foreign investors, one little reported measure in the budget that demonstrates that this government just does not get it which was not lost on the business sector was the doubling of the withholding tax on distributions from managed investment trusts for overseas investors. At a time when we have the biggest carbon tax in the world being introduced and a mining tax which noone else has-which is becoming a huge sovereign risk issue in other parts of the world for investors-we also have a withholding tax, one of the few things they could claim to have done in a successful and promising way. Just four years ago the then Assistant Treasurer put out a statement after the budget announcement which said: As part of its commitment to establish Australia as a regional financial hub, the Rudd Government has acted to dramatically improve the competitiveness of the Australian managed funds industry. … it will substantially reduce the level of withholding tax from a non-final rate of 30 per cent to a final rate of 7.5 per cent … These arrangements will make Australia's withholding tax rate one of the most competitive in the world, and provide a significant boost to Australia's ability to compete globally. They were on the money. We supported this initiative. It was a very sensible thing. They got out in front of the world. And it produced results, billions of dollars of results. It went from $1 billion in the MIT to $4 billion. Then, when it came down to 7½ per cent, it went to $5½ billion; $5½ billion came in here, got invested in infrastructure that we hear being talked about endlessly, but what happens? On budget night they reversed it. It was back up to 15 per cent. Of course there was no consultation, no warning whatsoever. What do you think this does to people in New York and London and other places who are looking to put billions of dollars here? It spells sovereign risk. It spells a government that has the shakes. It spells a government that does not know where it is going. It spells great big question marks over Australia as a destiny for stable and accountable government. None of this is happening and these are the sorts of signals. It is not only that; it is retrospective, so companies and big funds that have sunk billions into infrastructure projects and done all their numbers on 7½ per cent withholding tax are now going to be slugged 15 per cent. Do you think they are going to come back with money to get a measly $260 million? For this Treasurer to pull out a shonky surplus, they have probably sacrificed tens of billions of dollars over the next 10 or 20 years by this move. It is such a pathetic thing for this government to do. Then they stand up and say they understand and they have the interests of businesses at heart. This is a budget with the debt issue, this increase in debt from $250 billion to $300 billion debt ceiling. It is so misleading. That was hidden. It is a budget of deception by omission. It has the biggest carbon tax in the world, with not one word of explanation in those inches and inches of budget papers about how this thing will work. Yet it is going to put such an enormous burden on everybody in the country. This is a budget which will only compound the crisis of confidence currently running rampant within Australian households and businesses. (Time expired)",134
215,Mr HAYES,BILLS," I support Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and related bills and their passage through this House. Doesn't the fact that we have targeted and delivered on a budget surplus annoy the hell out of those opposite? Let's go back a little while. It was not all that long ago that, apart from preaching the need to have a budget in deficit, they started working through the figures-bear in mind they had a bit of a black hole to overcomeand started saying a budget would be an aspirational objective for them. We have taken on the task of delivering a surplus budget. We have not simply said that we can; we have delivered a surplus budget to secure our economy against the persistent threats of an uncertain global environment. As I often mention here, there has not been one occasion when I have heard those opposite talk about the global financial crisis in this place. It is as if it did not occur. Let's go back to 2008, with the fall of Lehman Brothers and the consequences around the globe. I recall it very vividly. The opposition-as a matter of fact, the shadow Treasurer-was recommending a path of action to this parliament of sitting, waiting and seeing what happens. If we had sat and waited, we would be in the same financial position as Europe, the United States, Britain and Japan. We have had a very good result as a result of how we addressed the global financial crisis. We have shown good fiscal and budgetary management. We have kept the pressure on interest rates. What is important about delivering a budget surplus is putting downward pressure on interest rates. I think that would be in the interests of everyone in this chamber who purports to represent families, particularly those families who pay mortgages, which, let's face it, is the bulk of working families. This budget is designed to put downward pressure on interest rates. We have just heard a lot about the issue of the mining boom. Sure, this is probably a once-in-a-generation mining boom that is occurring. It is right that we spread the benefits of that mining boom to ensure that no section of the Australian economy is left behind. I have seen the effect of the mining boom in my own family. I know the attraction there is for young to go up and work in your state, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, in Queensland or over in Western Australia, where my boy has also worked. It is probably why it is very hard to attract tradesmen to other parts of the economy. Therefore, we need to put pressure on to incentivise areas, particularly in small business, to make sure that they stay competitive. I spoke this morning on a notice of motion, which you moved, Madam Deputy Speaker. It gave me the opportunity to talk about the strong economic position that Australia is currently enjoying in relation to the rest of the world. When we talk about the global financial crisis, we should remember that our economy has grown by a further seven per cent since the crisis. We have an unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent compared to 8.3 per cent in the United States and an average of 10.7 per cent throughout Europe. Sovereign debt in most of Europe is around 80 per cent and is similar in the United States and Great Britain. Ours will peak as a debt ratio to GDP of 7.5 per cent. I hope those figures indicate we are doing a fair bit right. We are not doing what those opposite recommended: let's sit and wait and see. We decided to take very decisive action early, we decided to move and stimulate growth in our economy. Investing in education will not only guard against the effect of a downturn in the construction industry but also in the next 10 and or 15 years be a benefit as our kids graduate and learn with modern technologies and go on to be competitive with the rest of the world. To that extent, we have only seen the first phase of the economic benefit of investing in schools. The next will be the productivity benefit as these kids who learn with the advanced technologies enter into our tertiary education system, into our workforce and make a difference for the better in our economy for the future. That is by no means sitting back and waiting. That is taking a very strident approach, something that was criticised. I have to give credit to the opposition, they have been very consistent in their criticism. They have been consistent in their position of voting no. That is another one they voted no to. I know from my electorate that people do not go out to the schools and say, 'We oppose this.' When we are opening school science blocks or language centres or doing other things in relation to education, everyone wants to get a piece of the local action. Our responsible management of the economy and the budget has not come at the cost of investment in our productivity. I have just mentioned schools. The government has delivered historic investments disabilities, aged care, dental health care, education and fundamental investment in building this nation's future, including the National Broadband Network. Despite what has just been said, this budget does have fiscal restraint at its centre in order to deliver that surplus. Families in need are clearly the beneficiaries from this budget and rightfully so. Many of these families live in my electorate. Apart from being the most multicultural electorate in the whole of Australia, my electorate is the second most disadvantaged in Australia. So extra assistance is certainly welcomed by those families-families in need, such as those who are receiving the $410 for primary kids and $820 for high-school students through the schoolkids bonus. That is something that is very important to me. A third of my electorate is Asian, 22 per cent is Vietnamese. The Vietnamese have only been here for the last 37 years, at tops. When running my mobile offices, I have been astounded at the number of people who have not claimed education tax refunds for their kids. A lot of people just failed to understand they were entitled to it. Unfortunately, lack of language skills has kept a lot of them out of the workforce. When they have not had a job they have not paid pay tax and thought, therefore, they could not claim the benefits for their children. The schoolkids bonus will ensure that those families do not miss out. According to our statistics, in my electorate this will mean that 10 per cent of families who have been and always were eligible but did miss out will now receive justly deserved spending for their children's education. They will get paid this schoolkids bonus at the beginning and the middle of each year. That is certainly very welcome. into Similarly, there are 17,000 families in my electorate who will also see the benefit of the extra $600 from the family tax benefit A payment and more than 18,000 individuals on Centrelink allowances will also receive a supplementary payment of $210 to assist with the cost of living. For those who are truly struggling to look after their families, every cent will certainly make a welcome difference in their lives. This budget also provides $3.7 billion worth of assistance for small business in the form of tax breaks. There are 11,300 small businesses in my electorate of Fowler. The instant asset write-off which will be increased to $6,500 will be well received, whether it be for the motor vehicle, computer equipment, utes cetera. For areas such as mine where there are a lot of trades personnel, this will be very welcome. There is also the issue of the loss carryback where people can claim losses of up to $1 million against the tax paid on previous profits. I know the Council of Small Business welcome it. Many businesses in my area are trying to regroup and reinvest in their businesses, particularly tradesmen increasing their tools and machinery. This will be the basis upon which they can upgrade. They can actually turn around their businesses and invest in their future and, hopefully in turn, grow their businesses. That means providing greater employment for local people. Also very important is the $3.7 billion committed to aged-care reform. It will help people stay at home for longer and not be forced to sell their homes to pay the agedcare bond. In addition to the historic and dramatic increase in the pension delivered since 2009-something the other side of politics refused to do in the 12 years they had when they occupied the government benches-more than 27,600 pensioners in my electorate alone will now receive an extra $338 per year for singles and $510 for couples combined. These are good things. They are things that we do need to strive to achieve. On that basis, it will certainly be welcomed by the very significant portion of the elderly that I have as residents in Fowler. Other issues, such as the dental health scheme and being able to alleviate the public dental health waiting list, are certainly going to be of great benefit to the people I represent, but I want to particularly focus my comments on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Disability is something I have a particular interest in. My area, apart from its demographics, is very much overrepresented by people and families who live with disabilities. I can assure you is not the air we breathe out there in south-west Sydney or the water we drink. Having a child with, say, autism, is very, very expensive and very few families actually survive the challenges associated with that. So people make compromises, and one of the compromises is in land values. So the electorate of Fowler is very much overrepresented by people with disabilities. A couple of years back I was able to show that within a 25-kilometre radius of the Liverpool CBD resided about 52 per cent of all families in New South Wales that live with autism. Of that number, 82 per cent of those families are single-parent families. As I said, it takes a very, very strong marriage to survive some of those challenges. So it is very important to me to ensure that local families have not only the care they need now but also the lifetime care and support they will need. This is something that will certainly make our mark as a parliamentstanding up for people with disabilities. I honestly believe that our generation is going to be judged on a range of different things but specifically on how we deliver for people with disabilities. While we are talking about autism, I would also like to indicate my support for the Autism Advisory and Support Service in Liverpool, which provides essential support and guidance for parents of children with autism. This organisation exists entirely as a result of the dedication and commitment of its volunteers, who are mainly parents. I would particularly like to recognise its founder, Grace Fava, and also Fiona Zammit for the good work they do. I know they are holding a fundraising function this weekend, and I wish them all the best with that. They do an extraordinary job for parents in my electorate, who are just coming to terms with the fact that their children have autism. If I had further time. I would like to talk that it more about unemployment in my areawhich is also extremely high. I have an unemployment rate which is twice the national average. One of the things that I would like to see more attention given to is language classes to ensure that a larger number of people are given the potential to enter the workforce and become job ready. That is something that is very significant in Fowler. (Time expired)",136
216,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," This is an unworthy budget from an unworthy government that Australians have stopped listening to. This is a budget that cannot be believed. It is a budget that sets out to pitch Australian against Australian. It is genuinely a Labor budget-a true Labor budget-that is once again more interested in distributing other people's wealth and demonising them in the process than in the creation of that wealth for the betterment of our nation. This is a budget that has at its heart, as this government does, a lie-the carbon tax that dare not speak its name in the budget or in the tens of millions of taxpayer funded advertising this government is insulting Australians with every single night. This is a budget, as the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition have well argued, that is based on cooked books, where expenditure is hollowed out from next financial year, such as $1.3 billion in nationbuilding works, or the $1.1 billion on local government grants, or wiping expenditure from the Clean Energy programs only to see them reappeared the year after, all to inflate the deficit this year-a type of throwing good money after bad approach from this government and how they manage our finances-while pushing important expenditure like more than $5 billion in Defence funding, taking us to the lowest level of Defence expenditure since pre-war times, as well as absolutely welching on their grandstanding foreign aid commitment, leaving all of these things for later governments to pay for. This is a budget based on rubbery numbers. The government expect Australians to believe that, after creating $147 billion in accumulated deficits, they are going to produce a $1.5 billion surplus next year. And they make this claim after blowing the current year's budget by more than $20 billion despite a 10.3 per cent increase in tax receipts and including an almost 20 per cent increase in company tax receipts. If you listen to the Treasurer, you would think that he has been losing money. But the fact is that revenue has been going up. The only thing that it has fallen from is the Treasurer's inflated expectations of revenue to prop up previous budgets. Research by the Parliamentary Library shows us that the average variation between just actual and budgeted expenditure for the budget year over the past 22 years, going back to 1990-91, is equivalent to 0.7 per cent of GDP-or on current figures around $9.2 billion. The actuals are on average 0.7 per cent of GDP, or $9.2 billion worse off than what ultimately appears in the budget, if you go back over the last 22 years. That takes into account the swings and the roundabouts. Of the swings, when it was worse off in the actuals than what was budgeted for by the government the previous year, on eight occasions they were Labor budgets and on three occasions they were coalition budgets. And of the roundabouts where the actual was better than the budget was predicting the previous year, the majority were coalition budgets and only two were Labor budgets, which included one that was basically neutral. To put this in perspective, the Treasurer is asking us to believe that his budget surplus of $1.5 billion-which is around one-sixth of the average negative variation over the past 20 years-is in the bag. We in this place must tell him that he is absolutely dreaming. But it gets worse. I will go to the statement by the Treasury secretary, Dr Parkinson. In his recent speech following the budget, he said: Given the significant structural change in the economy, and the changing relationship between the nominal economy and tax collections, this particularly challenging time for revenue forecasting. So not only do we have a Treasurer who says that he is going to deliver a surplus when he has never delivered one to date-in fact, he has delivered $147 billion in accumulated deficits-and that surplus accounts for a sixth of the average variation over the last 22 years, but also the Treasurer's own secretary of his department has highlighted the volatility of the things that are in front of us. This is a Treasurer who thinks that he can out-predict and out-budget the best Treasurer we have ever had in this country, Mr Costello, and that he is even better than Paul Keating, from his own side. He thinks that he can effectively be the fiscal equivalent of a crack sniper in a hurricane, and he believes that the Australian people will accept at his word-because there is no track record to go from-that he will land this $1.5 billion surplus next year. Well, the way they speak about it in this place, you would think they had already achieved it. But, as the Australian people have come to learn, this is the government that overpromises and under delivers like none before it. This is a budget that is betrayed by its own deceit. When we look at their request to lift the debt ceiling, they betray themselves. By asking to increase the debt ceiling by a further $50 billion, there is no greater proof than this that the government do not believe in their own forecast surplus. They are like an addict saying that they want just one more hit. After putting up the ceiling now on numerous occasions they say, 'Just one more time. Believe us; it will be the last time.' The Australian people have given up believing in this government-if they ever did-and they have certainly given up on listening to them. There is $8 billion in interest for this debt. Eight billion dollars in interest per year is is a what we will arrive at over the end of the forecast period. In my own electorate, you could build the F6 tunnel under the shire three times over. In my own electorate-and a matter that is very dear to those in my electorate-you could build the second Sydney airport and its associated land transport infrastructure for the cost of one year's debt payments. The cost blowouts, though, go even further. This is another Labor budget-and it is indeed another blowout on boats. In this budget not one figure that relates to the cost of managing asylum seeker costs has not blown out and will not get worse by the time this budget is finished. The only surplus Labor has delivered has not been for Australia; the only surplus that this government has delivered has been for the people smugglers themselves, who continue to profit year on year as a result of this government's soft policies. More than 18,000 people have now arrived since they decided that it was a good idea to get rid of the solution that had worked. Those more than 18,000 people provide in gross revenue-we estimate, based on the estimates of $10,000 per person coming from the interviews of people getting off those boats and being transferred to Christmas Island-around $170 million so far, and counting. More than 10½ thousand have arrived since the last election. More than 4,450 have arrived since the community release and bridging visa scheme was announced late last November. Arrivals have increased since then to a rate of almost 750 per month. More than 1,000, for the first time under this government, have arrived this month alone and more than 250 have turned up in the last 24 hours. Today we learnt in Senate estimates that this government is budgeting for next year for 450 people to turn up a month-yet we have had over 1,000 this month and we had almost 1,000 in the month before. As we have seen blowouts occur in the past, we will see these blowouts occur again. We have seen $4.7 billion worth of blowouts since 2009-10. In the past year, at the portfolio additional estimates, there was a blowout of $866 million. Since those portfolio additional estimates, there has been a further blowout of $840 million. There was a blowout within those figures between November, when they first considered the papers and the publication and the review of those in the additional hearings in the Senate, of over $220 million. So the costs just keep going up and up every time more and more boats arrive. Rather than trying to address these issues, the government's response is simply to blame others for their own pantheon of failures. And it is a pretty big list: the government's first decision to abolish the solution that worked; then the government's decision to introduce their asylum freeze; then the government's decision to introduce the failed East Timor solution; and then the government's decision to introduce what proved to be the illegal Malaysian people swap, found by none other than the High Court. The government now want to cling to these failures and, if they want to do so, they should go and talk to their partners in the Greens-because, on this side of the chamber, we do not support bad policy. We support proven policy. We will stand here today and we will say to this government, 'Put back the policies that work.' But for nothing other than their stubborn pride, the members on that side will sit there and cling to failure like a life That is what they will do. They know that they can introduce offshore processing at Nauru today, with no legislation required, and temporary protection visas today, with no legislation required. But they refuse to do so because, if they do, then they have to admit that the 18,000 people who have turned up on their watch and the hundreds of people they know have perished at sea and the thousands of people each year they know are being denied humanitarian visas",140

218,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Cook has the call.,142
219,Mr MORRISON,BILLS,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. What I was talking about is the cost of Labor's border failures. Those costs are seen not only in the red ink in the budget but in the costs that individuals are having to wear in terms of their inability to access humanitarian places from offshoreand there are more than 4,000 that will miss out this year because those who have come by boat to Australia have taken their place. That is how our system works, and more than 4,000 people will miss out this year for no other reason than that this stubborn government cannot admit that they got it wrong back in 2008. They should never have removed those policies, and that act has led to the chaos and the carnage that has followed. It continues to this day, and for that government to sit there today and try to shift the blame to an opposition who stand ready, every single day, to support proven policy is a disgrace. It is a lame excuse. We have a government that has given up on border protection and given into the Greens, with their community release policies. Next year we will see over 8,000 raft. people in the system as a result of this government's policies. That was confirmed in Senate estimates today. Back in February of this year they said that next year there would be 5,700. Now they are saying there will be over 8,000. The number in community detention and the number of those on bridging visas has doubled in their estimate just in the last few months-and that is before they even admit that arrivals are on the increase, because they are still budgeting on 450 arrivals per month. So what we are going to see next year, on these budget figures, is an increase of $424 million next year. That is $1.1 million extra every single day that taxpayers will have to shell out because this government cannot get over its own stubborn pride when it gets something so catastrophically wrong and continues to cling to failure. This government needs to reflect on this because these budget figures are going to keep going up. They are going to keep blowing out, and they will continue to be an embarrassment, not only for the minister but also for the Treasurer, who presides over a budget that is sinking-and it is sinking within a fortnight of it being brought into this place. Already, with over 1,000 people turning up in May, the budget figures for the immigration department are in a mess; they are already in tatters. I have no doubt that when we get together again later in the year and we go through these figures again we will be told the same old thing: 'Well, we didn't know that this would continue to go on like this and we didn't think it would cost that much.' Well, if you keep doing the same thing, you cannot expect a different outcome. The outcome we have had from this government on border protection is more boats, more costs, more risks, more expense, more failure, more denial and more lame excuses from a government that has simply given in. There is nothing wrong-whether it is on our borders or in our great country-that cannot be improved with an election and a change of government. As I move around, that is the message I am getting loud and clear from Australians of all walks of life. Those on the other side know this. They know that they are reaping what they have sown. What they have sown in border protection policy they are now reaping in the blown out budgets, those being denied humanitarian visas because of their own intransigence and incompetence and, of course, the risk of those who continue to get on these dangerous vessels. There is nothing wrong-on our borders or in our countrythat a change of government will not improve. (Time expired)",142
220,Mr JENKINS,BILLS," Whilst of course the standing orders allow for a wide-ranging debate on the appropriations bill, because we can speak about any public affair, one would have thought that a shadow minister might think that the appropriation bill debate speech was the time that he could unveil what he would actually do. He treated us as if he had been invited on one of those 24/7 TV shows, where the emotive word 'chaos' has to be used and that the government has to have 'lost the plot' in a piece of policy area. But what did he say that he would do if he became the immigration minister? He has been told-and we know, because of the High Court case-of the need for new legislation. We have legislation before the parliament. He tends to rattle on about the Greens and say that they in some way have the government hostage, but the Greens do not support this particular piece of legislation. The coalition would require the piece of legislation, and therefore it is up to them to support it. The shadow minister says that we can return to the Nauru 'solution'. He does not consider that we have moved on a little bit. Five years on, we have moved on from there, and certainly the landscape has changed. The success rates of those that arrived on our shores and got shoved into the middle of the Pacific Ocean on Nauru was pretty high, and I wonder, in the business of trade of humans in our region, whether it is a deterrent at all. To think that you can wind back the clock and suddenly the fear in people who approach people smugglers because they are being sent to Nauru will still be there, when the success rate of those that either came to Australia or got to other first-world countries through Nauru has been established-what a nonsense. The shadow minister also stood at the dispatch box and said, 'Oh, we don't need legislation.' There was no mention of the briefings that have been made available to him by the government, by those that know, by those that have looked at the legislation. The shadow minister at the table, the member for Dickson, is getting a bit squeamish. We might hear some policy from him one day. He has been in his portfolio area and has had responsibility for a long time, and he has always joined the mealymouthed people who speak on behalf of the opposition.",143
221,Mr Dutton,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I can understand that the member for Scullin feels bruised and damaged because of the treatment meted out to him by this government but this is not relevant to the bill that is being discussed before the House, surely.",144
222,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Cook discussed this issue at length in the debate on the appropriation so I intend to give the same amount of latitude to the member for Scullin.,144
223,Mr JENKINS,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, you do not have to give me latitude. It is about time that members in this place read the standing orders. The member for Dickson, who thinks he could rule the place, should read the standing orders. Mate, read the standing orders-76(c): ... the motion for the second reading of the Main Appropriation Bill, and Appropriation or Supply Bills for the ordinary annual services of government, when public affairs may be debated. There is no such thing in this debate as having to be relevant to the budget, as you should have known. But, no, you are slothful in your development of policy-we never hear it. You are always critical of all actions that go on. And you have got thin skin. All you can do is get up",144
224,Mr Dutton,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is great to see him fired up again, but some of the comments were offensive and unparliamentary and I ask you to ask him to withdraw them.",144
225,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"I ask the member to withdraw, for the assistance of the chair.",144
226,Mr JENKINS,BILLS,I withdraw. I am sorry that I am surrounded by precious petals.,144
227,Mr Dutton,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, point of order",144
228,Mr JENKINS,BILLS,I withdraw.,144
229,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"Member for Scullin, you have the call.",144
230,Mr JENKINS,BILLS,"I was just waiting to check whether the member for Dickson is okay with me returning to the debate because he seems a bit of a precious petal tonight. One of the things I do understand is that, yes, perceptions about public policy are as important as the detail about public policy bills and, yes, at the moment that is something that this government has got to work on. But this government has got nothing to be ashamed of. This government is in fact a very good government. In its policy deliveryMr Dutton interjecting",144
231,Mr JENKINS,BILLS,"The big man scoffs. The one that loves parliament so much that he would deny himself the ability to stay in the parliament, but goes on the 24/7 talk shows on TV-hear the member for Dickson, the great saviour of the Liberal Party, sorry the LNP, whatever that is-and can only sit there scoffing. He will come up with a policy; we will hear it some day. He will think of something, mealy-mouthed. Have a look at the way in which we address dental policy in a concrete way that will probably be more sustainable than was the case with both the previous governments, of both political persuasions-sometimes we all have to admit that perhaps we got it wrong. But I know there was a fair degree of effort put in place when, during the HawkeKeating years, a public dental scheme was put in place. One of the things that it requires, and we acknowledge it in the provision of a number of health services, is cooperation between public health and private health. But the member for Dickson was of the ilk that decides that he will put words in our mouths that were anti-private provision. The Labor Party has moved on. The Labor Party knows that it has to move on with the norms of the society, within the time frames. That does not mean that we move away from traditional Labor values. It just means that we have to adapt to different types of delivery systems. So in this budget, at a time when the economic ministers have decided that they will put in place a budget that conforms to the political aspiration we put the people about the budget going into surplus, we still were able to do something very concrete with regard to dental health policy. Another thing that I am not ashamed to comment on is the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I know that this is again something that the member for Dickson says, in a mealy-mouthed way, is not enough. Well, we can all say that.",145
232,Mr Dutton,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sorry I have to rise to make this point but they are offensive comments again. They are untrue. I ask that you ask the member for Scullin to withdraw what are offensive comments yet again. It is unfortunate that in this rant he has to make comments that are baseless.",145
233,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,I think you have made your point of order.,145
234,Mr JENKINS,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: this particular member has form. He is just being disruptive.",145
235,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"The member for Dickson has indicated that he takes offence at the references that continue to be made about him. For the benefit and assistance of the chair, I ask that you withdraw.",145
236,Mr JENKINS,BILLS,"I withdraw and say it saddens me that in this place, a place where there should be robust debate, we have people displaying a sensitivity that in their behaviour from time to time they do not show.",145
237,Mr Dutton,BILLS,"You miss the chair, don't you, Harry? They did you a wrong.",145
238,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Order! The member for Dickson should be careful.,145
239,Mr JENKINS,BILLS,"As I was about to say, hopefully at some stage, because this is about the contest of ideas, we will see to shadow ministers actually explain to the Australian people what it is that the coalition are willing to do about the National Disability Insurance Scheme, that they will acknowledge that the efforts in this budget have brought forward the timetable set down by the Productivity Commission and that they will not describe these efforts in this budget as being not of consequence. The federal government has taken on a vexed issue that faces the Federation and that is difficult to solve because it requires the cooperation of state and governments. It should be debated in a sensible manner, not in a manner that is simply point-scoring, like the attitude on asylum seeker policy of the previous contributor to this debate. A mother and her two children are taken to the immigration office in Melbourne. They do not know why they are going. They leave the husband, the new stepfather to the children, in the waiting room. They present and then they come back out of the room to tell the husband-stepfather that they are going immediately on a plane to Villawood because the wife has had an adverse ASIO assessment. When the member for Cook is given an opportunity to respond to such a situation, what does he say? 'It's a consequence of people arriving by boat.' There is a bit of a problem on that. For the last three years, or at least the last two years, there has not been a boat out of Sri Lanka because there were other things that happened in asylum seeker policy. Besides the legislation that they should vote upon and support in this place, there is the cooperation with source countries, and one of the successes has been in Sri Lanka strangling the trade in illegal movement of people. Then again, I should not have been so surprised. The attitude to Indonesia in this regional tackling of asylum seekers is for them to be told, 'Well, we'll tie a rope on the boats and we'll drag 'em back.' There are no visits to Indonesia to discuss this, before they go out using megaphone diplomacy, no recognition that it was the Howard government that commenced a proper dialogue about a regional approach to illegal movement in people-an approach that recognised that you had source countries, countries of transit and target countries. This is just as if, because Australia is a target country, our participation in the development of policy should only be about target countries. I am sorry: that is just not good territory enough. This place should be used for, I will admit, robust debate of ideas and policy. But, when I get people that will go upstairs to the gallery, knock on the doors and say: 'Here I am again. I'll be able to make the comment about the chaos and the lost control, but never put a positive idea.' Well, they can continue to do that up in the galleries. I just invite them to use the opportunities that parliament presents to actually be sensible about things, to have the full debates, to decide that they will contribute to the contest of ideas. That is what is important about this House, and that is the way we all should treat it. (Time expired)",145
240,Dr STONE,BILLS," I too will speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and related bills. The elephant in the room on the night that the budget was announced was Labor's, or should I say the Greens', great new carbon tax. This is the tax which Julia Gillard promised would never be introduced on her watch. She knew the damage that it could do. The carbon tax became the price of the keys to the Lodge, but it comes at a terrible cost to the competitiveness of the Australian economy. Nowhere in the long and florid speech made by the Treasurer on budget night was there a reference to the 1 July commencement date, when a hefty carbon tax will be imposed on Australia's energy consumers and emitters. The extra cost will be embedded in all that we do. Food prices will escalate; energy bills will escalate; and our industry, largely grown on the back of cheap fossil-fuel generated energy, will reel, and much of it will buckle. Just today, the Russian aluminium giant RSL condemned the Gillard government for kneecapping the once high-growth alumina industry of Australia. They are quoted as saying: Australia now faces an almost impossible task competing with new entrants to the industry. RSL Australia Chairman John Hannagan has said that the design of Gillard's carbon tax would hand future global capacity increases to competitors in Asia, South America and other places where there is no carbon impost. This industry leader referred to the perverse outcome where Labor's carbon tax could actually stimulate even higher global emissions, as new competitors in less regulated markets scramble to take up the opportunities created as Australia's global share of production falls away. This is particularly depressing when you think that Australia's aluminium industry is amongst the world's best in generating the most efficient and least carbon-dioxideintensive production. Generations of industry research and investment will now be compromised, or made useless, because the Greens insisted that Australia introduce the world's largest and most all-inclusive carbon tax, even though there is no evidence that the globe's emissions will be reduced or contained as a result. Others less environmentally careful than the Australian industry sectors will simply take the place of the closed-down parts of our economy. Their people will take the jobs in their countries that will be lost from our cities and regions of Australia. The big dairy companies of Australia are also in the media today begging the government to rethink their destructive carbon tax policy. In my electorate, one of the big 3 to pay the new tax, Murray Goulburn Cooperative, have already announced job losses and a shrinkage of their activity amounting to nearly a third of their workforce in two of my small towns. Murray Goulburn's costs will rise by some $10 million a year, they calculate, and it will be their dairy farmers, their suppliers, who will of have to bear the pain, given that Murray Goulburn can rarely negotiate higher prices from their international buyers, who always have the subsidised alternatives, and in the domestic market Coles and Woolworths have over 80 per cent of the retail market sown up between them. That means they can simply squeeze their suppliers as hard as they wish; there are too many alternatives. Bega Cheese expect to see a 20 per cent impact of this new tax on their costs. Fonterra, a New Zealand owned dairy company, only pays $7 a tonne as a carbon tax in New Zealand, compared with $26 a tonne and going higher to be paid in Australia. New Zealand is the major competitor with Australia for dairy produce in international and Australian domestic markets. So guess which country's market share will shrink in the very near future? There will be less dairy production in Australia; more in our near neighbour. But it gets worse. We have another taxthe equivalent carbon price-to be applied to synthetic greenhouse gases from 1 July. This element of the new tax will apply to bulk refrigerants and refrigeration and air conditioning equipment, including domestic, commercial and vehicle air-conditioners and domestic and commercial refrigerators and freezers. The new equivalent carbon price is to be based on Labor's new carbon tax plus the global-warming potential of each gas relative to carbon dioxide. In theory, the price per kilogram of these gases, collectively referred to as hydroflourocarbons, will more than quadruple. In reality, price gouging is already taking place, with the importers already hiking the price for the most commonly used HFCs from $25 a kilogram in January to between $50 and $90 a kilogram now. This is despite the fact that the new tax does not start till 1 July. A coolstore operator in my region told me of his shocking experience where he had to replace 1,800 kilograms of a synthetic greenhouse gas early this year at a cost of over $50,000. If he had to do this after 1 July, when the price will be over $100 a kilogram, this replacement would have cost him $180,000. I have tried to find some assistance for this fruit coolstore operator from this government, which has imposed this new cost upon him. This government boasts that they will help those most cruelly impacted by their new policies. Unfortunately, those who manage coolstores cannot simply refill their equipment with a different gas; a whole new set of equipment is required at a substantial cost. But Labor's Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program only offers some assistance to manufacturers-not to other essential parts of the value chain like coolstores which hold the fruit, cheese or meats on their way to the manufacturer or the retail markets. This is typical of Labor. Labor fail to understand the interdependencies or complexities of an industry sector. It happens again and again. And by the time they work it out it is too late; too much enterprise has been lost. The business is buried; the jobs lost; the regional economy shrinks; the manufacturers have had to pick up additional costs to make up for the lost local part of the value chain. And so we further suffer, and our economy, as I said, shrinks-and it is all due to this government's policies. We all want to see synthetic greenhouse gases substituted for something more environmentally friendly in the future. It has been the object for nearly a decade now. The European Union, however, has taken a very different approach to the Labor Party's punitive price regime. Labor's regime will simply drive businesses to the wall. The EU's regulations aim to improve leak-proof equipment, encourage better labelling of equipment containing hydrofluorocarbon gases, and have better training and certification of personnel and companies handling these types of gases, their containment and recovery. The EU will end up with a reduction in the impact of these synthetic greenhouse gases. We, instead, will simply kill our industries with a sudden impost of punitive prices-prices that cannot be clawed back by higher charges to those downstream. Those are two different approaches based on very different understandings about how industries can best adapt and survive. But let me turn to another very serious problem now confronting us as we scour the world for skilled tradespeople who will be our next generation of technicians. We are also now seeing an avalanche of parents choosing to take their children out of state owned education systems to put them into private independent schools. And we are now seeing a generation of young people turning their heads away from apprenticeships and away from becoming skilled tradespeople. It is much more attractive to leave school and go and work in are a fast-food chain than to be dedicated to years of training to become an electrician or a plumber. Labor has presided over the biggest collapse in educational standards in this country while it boasts of the biggest investment in buildings. The problem is that bricks and mortar-or, more commonly, cement tilt slabs and composite panellingdo not in themselves address the chronic problems of teacher competency, teacher morale and curriculum deficit. Labor has the Gonski review, which identified the need to invest in individual students according to their needs. But that comes at a significant cost. Sadly, Labor will spend at least $8.7 billion over government earnings next year, and it is so heavily in debt that halting the slide in educational outcomes is simply beyond its reach. And so we have the obscene NAPLAN, a joke to parents, who see their children coached all year to pass a test that is an instrument which cannot and does not show real changes in children's educational development. All it does is name and shame on a very popular website. Imagine the despair of Indigenous parents in remote and regional Australia whose children are given this NAPLAN test in Standard Australian English when these children do not speak this language at all. I have recently been talking to the teachers and parents in such places, and they are deeply frustrated at the negative labelling and useless statistics generated by this national test. According to the outcomes, all the Indigenous studentsall their children-are dumb. Labor places great store in NAPLAN, however, trumpeting it as one of its great educational outcomes. As for our apprenticeship training, it produced master tradespeople, who were amongst the most skilled, compared to those anywhere. Our tradespeople could work anywhere internationally. qualifications were highly regarded. Our current system, presided over by Labor, means young people or mature-aged candidates must somehow survive on about $6 an hour. They are no longer required to spend some four years or so gaining on-site instruction as well as education-leaving their workplace to attend theoretical and other training in a TAFE. Instead, in the interests of cost savings and expediency an apprentice can be fast-tracked through his or her training, becoming eligible for full qualifications, or at least a bit of paper, in only two years. They achieve this with so called competency check-offs where a registered training organisation sends someone to, for example the building site, who says: 'I can see a bit of scaffolding up there', 'I can see a bit of plumbing' or 'I can see a bit of frame. Did you do that? Great, let me take a photo. I now can tick a box saying you are competent in that element of your training.' I have complaints from skilled tradespeople, master tradespeople, as well as the apprentices and their parents, who are now in despair at the decline in the value of their qualifications and in the decline of their real skills development. I have young apprentices who are being used as cheap labour, who are not being released to do training at a TAFE institution at all and who are being ticked off in the competency list. At the end of their two years or so, they are let loose on a workforce where they can very rarely gain any respect or work as a skilled tradesperson. This is a serious problem and I ask this government to look closely at it. I do not know why it is that we have sacrificed real outcomes in the education once sector, whether it is in our primary or secondary education or in our trades training. We have no reason at all to now be falling away in the OECD tables showing the Their outcomes for our students in maths and science. The results from NAPLAN-that flawed instrument-are even now showing that our literacy and numeracy standards in the years that are tested are falling away. This is a disgrace. It is happening on Labor's watch and I ask them to seriously get back to the knitting. Stop worrying endlessly about trying to sell a carbon tax, which is indefensible. Like us, why don't you address a very real revolution and abandon the carbon tax right now. I do not understand how a country with the prospects of Australia can beggar itself through bad policy. I do understand that the lure of the Lodge was great. I do understand that we have a minority government and that the Greens made this a condition of them giving their support to the Labor Party. However, there is a much greater issue at stake, and that is the contraction of an economy. I have job losses now in my electorate that have never been seen before, the like of which have not been known before, even in the days of the Great Depression. There are over 100 shops empty in the city of greater Shepparton, the big of Shepparton itself, where before there was nothing but a great sense of opportunity and expectation given we are being the greatest irrigation region in Australia. We were proud to call ourselves the food bowl of Australia. Now each day we live in dread of what the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, under the guidance of this government, might do as it seeks to buy even more of our irrigation water out of the hands of drought-stressed irrigators. It wants to put it into the Commonwealth environmental waterholders' bucket, so that again the Greens can be placated, so that the Greens can be told: 'We promised you a very big bucket of gigalitres of irrigators' water. We have delivered.' At the same time they turn their backs on the fact that dairy, fruit and fibre production cannot recover from the drought if the security of the water is no longer there. I this government to look harder at what they are doing. Sometimes there are more important things than staying in the Lodge. Sometimes it is more important to go to an election and give the people a chance to reset the clock for Australia. Mrs ELLIOT (RichmondParliamentary Secretary for Trade) (18:34): I am very pleased to be speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and cognate appropriation bills tonight and talking about the budget this government has delivered and what a positive impact it will have throughout the country and in my electorate of Richmond, on the North Coast of New South Wales. It is interesting to contrast this with what we hear from the opposition, which is again just more negative comments and more scaremongering; we do not hear anything positive from them when we look at this budget and the positive impacts of this budget, particularly its positive impact on families. It will be very wide ranging and wide reaching in its city effects. In fact, we are very proud of this budget. The government is very proud of it and its economic credentials. We made a promise to deliver a surplus and we have done that. In delivering that surplus we have also been able to deliver quite a lot for families, which is very important, and to deliver for businesses as well right across the country. Tonight I am going to run through some of those achievements in this budget and some of the great improvements that we have made, particularly in areas such as health and education, and particularly in delivering for families. This budget delivers on much needed cost-of-living relief to hundreds of thousands of families right across the country. It is really about making sure that all Australians share in the benefits of the mining boom, whilst at the same time beg keeping our economy very strong. Of course, we have done that in assisting those families. In my electorate we have that new cash payment to over 9½ thousand local families under the schoolkids bonus. We are increasing family payments: there are more than 12,000 local families in my electorate that will get that increase. It will make a big improvement for them. We are very proud of this budget, and the return to surplus. We have also found time to deliver reforms that make for a much stronger community and a fairer society-doing things like the National Disability Insurance Scheme, in addition to our big investments in dental health and aged-care reform. I will come to some of those. What we are doing with this budget is spreading the benefits of the boom. It will deliver a $1.8 billion boost to family payments. There is also new tax relief for business and lump-sum allowances for struggling families as well as part of this entire package. We have got a boost in family payments for over 1.5 million families. Families receiving the maximum rate of FTB A with two or more children will receive an extra $600 per year or an extra $300 per year if they have one child. Families receiving the base rate of family tax benefit part A with two or more children will receive an extra $200 a year or an extra $100 a year if they have one child. Also, more than one million Australians will benefit from a new lump-sum supplementary allowance to help the recipients of payments such as a parenting payment and allowances who will receive $210 a year for singles or $350 a year for couples. Businesses will also benefit from the introduction of a loss carryback scheme, which is very important. Indeed, the benefits of the boom package will be funded by redirecting the minerals resource rent tax revenue intended for the company tax cutand of course we know this tax cut was repeatedly rejected by the Liberals and by the Greens as well. It is quite astounding that the Liberal and National parties rejected it, but that is the reality of it. They did not want to help business-they kept saying that they were not going to support it at all-but the Gillard Labor government is determined to deliver tax relief through this new loss carryback initiative for businesses facing some challenges in our economy at the moment. We are making sure that we are keeping the economy strong. We are focusing on that and making sure that we assist business. As I mentioned, one of the things that we are very proud of in this budget is delivering on the first stage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The government will deliver $1 billion over four years to start rolling out the first stage of the NDIS. It will begin in mid-2013 and provide care and support to around 10,000 people with significant and permanent disabilities in up to four locations across the country. From mid-2014, the reach of the NDIS will be expanded to bring the total number of eligible people up to 20,000. That is a really strong commitment from this government. Many people have talked about the need for a national disability insurance scheme for many years, and this government has made the commitment and is delivering on the NDIS. We understand how vitally important it is, and we are delivering it a year ahead of the timetable set by the Productivity Commission. We are very proud to be assisting local families through both the increase in family benefits and the schoolkids bonus. That is going to have a major positive impact for the people in my electorate. Eligible families will receive a total of $410 a year for each child in primary school and $820 a year for each child in high school. These schoolkids bonuses, which replace the education tax refund, are available to families receiving family tax benefit A. We wanted to make sure that the people who were not filling out the refund forms and receiving the benefits were getting the assistance they need with all the expenses that parents with kids at school have, whether it is uniforms, textbooks, stationery or school excursions. The schoolkids bonus is there to help families. In my electorate, families of more than 16,500 local kids are going to benefit from it, so it will make a big difference. In fact, the Labor government has already made a big difference in the lives of many schoolchildren in my electorate of Richmond. We have made a massive commitment to education. We have the Building the Education Revolution, through which more than $115 million has been committed to over 90 schools. It is a wonderful privilege to be continually attending so many BER openings and seeing the real difference that the federal Labor government through our many education commitments is making in the lives of our schoolchildren. All of those schools on the North Coast needed those improvements, and they have made a massive difference. We continue to make a massive difference through so many of our reforms-our education reforms, our investment in training and our investment in skills. We understand how important it is for future generations. We also know it is important to assist families whilst their kids are at school, so we are very proud to have the schoolkids bonus there as well. In this budget we are delivering on some major health initiatives. We continue to do that. We know how important it is that people can access care when and where they need it, and we have made major investments in some major areas of needdental health, rural and regional facilities and aged care. The main target of the health initiatives in this year's budget is dental Over $515 million has been committed to a dental blitz for those people who are least able to afford dental care. About 400,000 people have been waiting on public dental waiting lists for care, and they will benefit from this blitz. We know what a difference it will make for them and how important dental care is for a person's overall health. We are very proud of making this major investment in dental care. The budget also focuses on rural and regional Australia: $475 million has been directed to new and upgraded health and hospital infrastructure across 76 projects in country areas. These projects include: hospital redevelopments, community health centres, multipurpose services, dental facilities and training and accommodation facilities. We are very proud to be reforming Australia's aged-care system through a five year, $3.7 billion package to build a better, fairer and more nationally consistent agedcare system. It will enable older Australians to get the help they deserve so that they can remain living in their own homes for as long as possible. We know how important that is. We are also very proud to be investing over $49 million in expanding the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. Under the expanded National Bowel Cancer Screening Program, screening will be offered to people turning 60 years of age from 2013 and 70 years of age from 2015. We understand how important it is to expand upon that program. Another investment in the budget is an additional $233 million in the continued rollout of the national electronic health record system, which is so important in reducing errors and duplications in services. The federal Labor government has made such a strong commitment to health reforms across so many areas. One of them is ehealth, which will deliver so many practical care. benefits to Australian families by greatly reducing medication errors. It will allow parents to keep better track of their children's immunisation records; it will also make it a lot easier for older Australians who may have complex and chronic health conditions to ensure that their health practitioners can access a lot easier their medical history, therefore helping them to make diagnoses quicker and a lot more accurately. So we have this ongoing commitment to the ehealth, and I think we are all very much looking forward to it rolling out across the country and making a real difference in the lives of so many people. Within my electorate there is a lot positive feedback all the time on our health initiatives-particularly on e-health, because there is a large number of senior Australians living in my electorate. Indeed, we have had very positive responses to many of our health commitments. Prior to the last election we made a commitment of $7 million to build a GP superclinic. The development consent has recently been approved by our local council, and we expect construction to be underway soon. It is being delivered by a wonderful consortium of local GPs who have decades of experience around the Tweed Heads area. They are going to be providing a whole series of different allied health initiatives at the GP superclinic at South Tweed Heads. They are very keen to have it built and up and running. I am very proud as a local member to have delivered the $7 million to get it up and running. Indeed, very proud of all our health initiatives. will make a major difference to many people living on the North Coast. We have made some major commitments to roads funding in this budget, particularly the Pacific Highway funding, which is an area where the federal Labor government has really stepped up when previous governments have not committed funding. This budget injects an extra $3.56 billion into federal Labor's Nation Building Program funding, which if matched by the New South Wales government could be used to complete the full duplication of the Pacific Highway by the end of 2016. Of course, we are still calling on the New South Wales state government to honour their election commitment to match that funding, and it is very disappointing to see them now stepping away from that commitment. We need the Pacific Highway duplication completed in New South Wales, and I again call upon the New South Wales government to honour their commitment to make sure it is built. In of very my electorate, I can tell you what a difference the Pacific Highway upgrade has made. In previous budgets we committed substantial funds of about $900 million for the Pacific Highway upgrade in my electorate. We have $357 million for the Pacific Highway upgrade at Sextons Hill at Banora Point and $554 million for the Pacific Highway upgrade between Tintenbar to Ewingsdale. Of course, construction of the Tintenbar to Ewingsdale upgrade is starting now, which is fantastic. We are very excited about that. We have only recently opened the northbound lanes for the Pacific Highway upgrade at Sextons Hill. It is a fantastic project that has been strongly needed for many, many years. I was very pleased to have the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport there last Friday, when we I am inspected the northbound lanes, which They opened a couple of days later. This $357 million upgrade is making a huge difference to the people of the North Coast. It is a much safer road now and it cuts travel time, which is vitally important. Essentially, it means that you can now leave the Brisbane CBD and not strike any traffic lights until you get to Coffs Harbour. That is what the federal Labor government has done. We promised that and we delivered it. Those upgrades have made our roads so much safer and make such a huge difference to the people of the North Coast. I congratulate the road traffic authority, which has worked very hard to get those northbound lanes open in time. It is great to see and is certainly something that I am very proud of in our local electorate. The federal Labor government have delivered so much for our area over so many budgets, and we continue to do that in this year's budget. We are delivering the benefits of the mining boom, particularly to local families and businesses, and continuing our strong investment right across the board to our entire community. It builds upon our already strong record, particularly in community infrastructure. In the past, we have invested $2 million for the community centre at Murwillumbah, $1.8 million for the Jack Evans Boat Harbour redevelopment, $2 million for Australia's first high-performance surfing centre, at Casuarina-we are very proud indeed of that and intend to open it in a couple of weeks-and $9.5 million for a sport and recreation centre in Byron Bay. The federal Labor government continues to deliver for the people of the North Coast. We have certainly seen that in Richmond and in the neighbouring electorate of Page, with its very good local member. We have been delivering quite a lot for the North Coast. The largest investment that we have seen in the history of the North Coast has come about since federal Labor has been in government. There has been health investment, education investment and community infrastructure, particularly delivering for families. We are very proud to be able to do that in this year's budget, particularly through the increases in family benefits and the schoolkids bonus. These bills are about delivering the benefits of the boom to all Australians. They are about honouring our commitments, particularly in areas such as health and education, and making a difference in the lives of so many Australians. Whilst we deliver that, we do it in a way that is very economically responsible. We made the promise that we would bring the budget into surplus, and we have completed that great economic achievement. At the same time, we have delivered a fairer society through our commitments to health and education and, very importantly, through our commitment to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The federal Labor government has been able to deliver a very responsible budget but also a fairer society. I commend the bills to the House. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (18:49): In rising to speak in this cognate debate on the appropriations bills, I recognise that this is the one debate where one can range very broadly and widely across many issues in the course of the debate, not having to adhere strictly to the substance of the bills. It is very interesting: sometimes we hear people continue to refer to the bills of supply, which, of course, these bills are not. The bills of supply were a mechanism we used to use when we had budgets in August rather than in May and they were needed to tide over money until the appropriations bills were introduced, debated and passed. So, when I hear Independents say they will not deny the government supply, I wonder sometimes what it is they are promising to do. The fact of the matter is that this government is held up by three Labor Independents: Mr Thomson, Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor. Why do I use the term 'Labor Independents'? It is because of the support that Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor continue to give to the Labor Party. Mr Thomson, who is often referred to as having been expelled from the Labor Party, of course has not; he has merely been suspended. They are the three people who hold this government in office. I listened intently today to Mr Thomson, in his address to the parliament, and take much succour from the fact that he thought the report from the Australian Electoral Commission had in fact exonerated him of all wrongdoing. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact of the matter is that the Australian Electoral Commission, which I note from the bills is going to get additional funding and, I think, 14 extra people, is being rewarded when in fact it has failed to carry out its task in relation to the matters concerning Mr Thomson. In Senate estimates again and again, Senator Ronaldson would  Electoral Commission about what action he was taking to investigate whether or not proper disclosure had been made concerning the Health Services Union and credit card usage by Mr Thomson, the member for Dobell, and whether or not the AEC had conducted proper investigations to find that out. Again and again, I can only describe the answers as being of an avoiding nature. At one stage, I think there was an indication given that, 'She'll be right, mate, we're looking at it.' But, of course, the Electoral Commission was well aware that their power to have prosecutions would run out and the date on which it would run out, and if they had not commenced any prosecutions by that stage then under the act they would have no power to investigate at all. So I am rather amazed to hear that Mr Thomson says that this is an investigation and a report from the AEC which exonerates him, because on 23 August 2011 I wrote to the Electoral Commissioner, Mr Killesteyn, asking the AEC to investigate allegations that Mr Thomson had misused his HSU credit card to pay for electrical expenses which were not  chief legal officer of the AEC, said on 25 August 2011 in reply to my letter: There is no power contained in the Electoral Act that would enable the AEC to investigate the allegations concerning donations and expenditure relating to Mr Thomson that took place in the lead up to the 2007 general election. Quite clearly the AEC report was not an investigation. It was merely a set of observations about the Fair Work Australia report. The AEC had made it perfectly clear numerous times that they did not seriously investigate matters surrounding Mr Thomson. Indeed at all occasions when I asked them, they explained they had refused to use their powers under section 316 of the question Electoral Act and particularly subclause 2A subclause 3 because they did not, they said, have sufficient evidence to exercise those powers. Of course the whole nature of those investigative powers are to enable the AEC to gain evidence to see exactly what the situation is. There was a report from a well known accounting firm that had been made into the affairs of the HSU and the AEC did not even ask for a copy of the report because  At all times when I listened to Mr Thomson, he did not address any of the serious allegations about refusing to properly declare expenditure. It does seem",146
241,Mr Melham,BILLS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to standing order 90 which says: All imputations with improper motives to a Member and all personal reflections on other Members shall be considered highly disorderly. The honourable member is more than sailing than close to the wind. In my view, she has crossed the line in the imputations she is making about the member for Dobell. She needs to do it by substantive motion. I am not attacking her criticisms of the AEC. I do not agree with them. They are within order. But for the imputations she has just made in relation to the member for Dobell should be pulled to order and not allowed to continue.",155
242,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," I thank the member for Banks for his point of order. I am listening to the honourable member for Mackellar and I have been listening very intently. I am advising the member for Mackellar that she should not have a personal reflection on a member of this place. She would know, as many of us would know-that standing order 90 covers that issue. I am still listening to the member for Mackellar. I will allow her to continue but I advise, as the member for Banks said, that she would be well aware of standing order 90 and she should not have improper motive to a member of this chamber. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: The reason I was making those points that I made was simply from the point of view that the whole of the Electoral Act can be circumvented by the use of credit cards if these matters are allowed to stand because there is no use of the powers by the AEC in the Electoral Act to uncover whether or not correct disclosures have or have not been made. There are statements in the AEC's report which, in a press release I put out recently, made it quite clear that the report raises more questions than it answers. At the end of the day, it is one we will be looking at when we have our hearing with the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and people will be under oath when answering questions. I think the chairman might choose to change the way he conducts that committee and administer the oath to witnesses in this case. Mr Melham interjectingMrs BRONWYN BISHOP: That is right. I always administered the oath. I note that when we come to looking at these appropriation bills that we hear from the government members in speaking to this issue that they cry out loud that they have returned the budget to surplus. I think the whole of the Australian people are coming to the realisation that in fact the surplus is a figment of their imagination. I would remind the House that of course the prediction from the last budget was that the deficit for this current year was to be $22 billion. The MYEFO account in fact raised it more to some $37 billion. By the time we got to the delivery of the current budget, the deficit for the current year was $44 billion. So much for the accuracy of prediction. But then, I have to say, Treasury always does get it wrong. In this case, we had the debate as we did on pushing out half a billion dollars in compensation payments-for the damage that the carbon tax is going to do to families-dressed up as an education bonus. Interestingly enough, I have had conversations with people who had abided by the previous scheme and kept their receipts and claimed them. They actually got more money back than they will get out of the cash splash, which the government has dressed up as an education bonus but requires no evidence of being spent on education at all. The important thing was for them to get the money out the door before 30 June so it became part of the $44 billion deficit and not in the next year which would have wiped out half a billion of the so-called $1.5 billion surplus. There are going to be many examples of that in the budget where expenditure has simply been pushed into the current financial year or extended out into the out years past this notional surplus of $1.5 billion. The Australian people are not silly. The Australian people know when they see a contrivance. The Australian people voice every day that they want an electionthat is what they want. They did not elect a government at the last occasion. We won the primary vote and Ms Gillard, or the Prime Minister as she is today, stitched up a vote with the Independents in order that she could have power. That is not being elected prime minister. What we need is an election whereby we are not reliant on the vote of the member for Dobell. I would point out that in question time, the Treasurer failed to answer the question as to why the caucus is allowed to be judge and jury but-and we hear this continually-the House, or the parliament itself, may not express a view, nor, indeed, even debate the statement by Mr Thomson, simply because the government is too embarrassed to stand up and have to defend the action of accepting his vote. So the question remains. Mr Thomson has been suspended from the caucus because he is not worthy of being in the caucus, but somehow he is worthy of his vote being taken in this House, and we are denied the right to debate his statement. I suspect his statement will continue to be debated for many, many days to come. I would like to mention the way in which the budget has been drawn up and the impact that it will have on senior Australians. The carbon tax is the single most damaging thing that will impact on senior Australians, because it is a tax which will get into every nook and cranny of every aspect of everybody's life. It is a tax on electricity. Quite clearly, Senator Brown, when he was leading the Greens, wanted us all to live in a cave with a candle. But now we have Senator Milne-she would like us to do without the candle! The fact of the matter is that the difference in a civilised country, and in a civilised society, is electricity. We all depend upon it. It is by placing a tax on coal that we see the tax on electricity, because 80 per cent of all electricity in this country is generated from coal fired power stations-the singularly cheapest way of producing power in the world, bar none. And we have enough in this country, that we know about, for 1,000 years. It gives us the one competitive edge that we can utilise in overseas trade: we have cheap power. To this very day, our single most voluminous elaborately transformed manufactures-ETM-is aluminium ingots, produced because we have cheap power with which to produce them. What this government is doing is punishing the people, punishing our competitive advantage and punishing the way people live, whether it is every time you turn on a light, the street lighting, refrigeration or trucks. The Prime Minister says, 'You won't have to pay the tax on the family vehicle.' Yes, you will, because electricity is used to pump the petrol from the tank into your car tank and for the cash register to work. In every aspect of life this tax is compounding and cascading. So you pay tax on a tax on a tax. Seniors are the people who are most likely to be on fixed incomes. They are the ones who are penalised most by this budget and by this carbon tax-the tax that the Labor Party now seems reluctant to refer to as a tax; it wants to use the word 'price'. There is no free coal in this country. It all has a price-a market price. This is a euphemism for the implementation of the tax. I can only say that this budget is one that is causing pain for people. It is dishonest in claiming a surplus and it must not be- (Time expired)",155
243,Mr MELHAM,BILLS," It is interesting that the honourable member for Mackellar, in her speech, did not once mention the GST and its impost on pensioners and on the poor sections of our community. She did not mention the regressive nature of it, or the fact that you get it from the cradle to the grave, so when you have your funeral, your family cop 10 per cent on top of the bill, courtesy of her and John Howard. In recent months, we have heard a lot from sections of the media, together with those on the other side, criticising the Labor government. What I have just pointed out is one example of the opposition's alternative way of doing business. I think they compensated pensioners in a one-off payment, not a continuous payment like our initiatives. The comments have focused on the level of our commitment to the Labor values that we believe in. Let me say that there is a stark contrast between the values that drew us to the Labor Party, that we continue to espouse, and those of the coalition. I wish to highlight to the parliament why this budget is very much a Labor budget and one that I am very proud of. The Australian Labor Party had its origins with people who sought that the aspirations of the Australian people for a decent, secure, dignified and constructive way of life be realised. These were people who sought to embody the recognition by the trade union movement of the necessity for a political voice to take forward the struggle of the working class against the excesses, injustices and inequalities of capitalism, and to ensure that the commitment by the Australian people to the creation of an independent, free and enlightened Australia was successful. These were the values of the origins of the Labor Party At that time and since then, the Labor Party has always acted to ensure a fair and equitable society based on principles of social justice, employment and access to all the benefits of a just society. This budget is a continuation of those core principles. Our policy is to ensure that the government continues to provide the basic infrastructure for the whole community and continues to help those who are in need of extra assistance. As the Prime Minister said in the inaugural Gough Whitlam oration on 31 March 2011: The historic mission of our political party is to ensure the fair distribution of opportunity. From the moment of our inception our mission has been to enable the son of the labourer, the daughter the cleaner, to have access to the same opportunities in life as the son of the millionaire, the daughter of the lawyer. This is who we in the Labor Party are. Before I turn to the implications of the budget for the people of my electorate of Banks, I note that prior to this year's budget this government introduced a series of policy initiatives in the best of the Labor tradition that I am proud of. Some of the highlights of the Labor government's achievements since its election in 2007 include: abolished Work Choices and restored entitlements and a basic safety net for all workers; delivered more than 800,000 jobs and saved 200,000 jobs during the GFC and since; delivered a $2.2 billion comprehensive package focusing on early intervention and coordinated care, the largest investment in mental health; increased hospital funding by $20 billion since 2007, including 1,300 new subacute beds and support for 2,500 new aged-care beds; and invested in 24 regional cancer centres and 44 MCGRATH Foundation specialist breast cancer nurses. Other highlights include: invested in the nation through the $37 billion Nation Building Program to improve our roads, rails and ports, together with a $6 billion regional infrastructure fund; decreased taxes as a percentage of GDP-21.2 per cent in 201112, down from the 24.2 per cent at which the Howard government peaked in 2004-05, 2005-06; managed underlying inflation at 2.6 per cent in December 2011, down from 3.7 per cent at the end of the Howard government; introduced less income tax of $1,750 for someone on $50,000 and $1,900 less tax for someone on $100,000; boosted retirement savings for 8.4 million workers by increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. The achievements include: doubled investment in schools; conducted the first review of school of funding in almost 40 years and provided increased transparency to give us the data we need for a proper debate on schools; delivered reforms to pensions since 29 September-pensions have increased an extra $148 a fortnight for singles and around $146 a fortnight for couples and in the electorate of Banks there are 22,800 pensioners benefitting from these historic changes; provided an extra $338 and $510 a year to assist those in need with the introduction of a carbon price; delivered the first ever Paid Parental Leave scheme on 1 January 2011 with 18 weeks of leave paid at the minimum wage-there are 1,075 local families currently benefitting from this initiative in my electorate; and introduced tax breaks for small business, improving their cash flows by allowing them to claim tax deductions sooner. From 1 July 2012, small business will get $6,500 instant asset write-off for each business asset, as well as an instant asset write-off for the first of any car purchased. These are just a few of the reforms introduced by the Labor government, and are in addition to the massive reform in the process of being introduced through the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the reforms to aged care. Who can forget that, for most of our first term from 2007 to 2010, we had an obstructionist Senate. In the first part the majority in the Senate was held by the Liberal-National Party. Then they relied on two independent senators to obstruct. In this term we have a hung parliament. So, all those achievements have been achieved despite the resistance of those opposite, dragged kicking and screaming, which is the conservative way of doing business. They do not mind when it comes to business welfare or welfare for the upper middle classes. That is what they expect. Traditionally, that is the history of the conservatives on the other side of politics. The rest of us subsidise the upper middle class and the business sector. This government has had the courage to take action on climate change. We are cutting carbon pollution and driving investment in clean energy technologies like solar, gas and wind. We are supporting jobs in existing and renewable industries nationwide. This budget continues to deliver for the Australian community, and I will outline exactly the benefits to people in the electorate of Banks. The school kids bonus will deliver over $7.5 million dollars to an estimated 7,450 families in Banks and over 1.3 million families nationally. This helps people on Family Tax Benefit A who need assistance in providing the necessities for their kids at school: uniforms; books, stationery and so on. They will also receive an increase of up to $600 in their payments from 1 July 2013, affecting about 10,000 of my constituents. $5,000 Young people, single parents and the unemployed currently receiving allowances will receive extra payments of $210 for singles and $350 for couples. This will assist those in need to meet the costs of essential services like electricity, gas and water. This payment will impact on 6,954 people in Banks. Labor has increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket expenses to a maximum of $7,500 per family. This represents 5,575 families in my electorate. More than 22,800 pensioners in Banks will receive an extra $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples to assist with any cost-of-living changes brought on from the introduction of the carbon price. An additional 2,300 local self-funded retirees will also benefit from this initiative. Overall, around 53,000 local taxpayers will receive a tax cut on 1 July and around 42,000 will get a cut of up to $300. There are 17,400 small businesses in Banks that may benefit from the decision to extend the small business advisory service, providing access to knowledge and experience to help maintain and grow their businesses. We on this side look at our responsibilities as legislators through the prism of the Labor values of equity and fairness, and the Labor Party is the only party committed to social justice and equality. This is the 23rd budget that I have seen in this place. In my first speech I stated: … a Labor government is the only government which governs in the interests of all Australians. country. They share the same hopes and aspirations as most Australians and look to their elected representatives to fight for an equal and fairer society which offers security for all. This is as true today as it was in 1990. I continued in that speech to say: I believe in government regulation and intervention, for without it the inequalities inherent in our society will continue to flourish. Governments are elected to govern, not to sit back and be spectators. The classic example of that being successful was this government's response to the GFC, which made the rest of the world look up and take notice because we were the best performing economy in the world. Why? Because we did not do as the coalition wanted us to do: act like moo-cows and just watch the passing traffic. We got involved. We protected our society from the GFC. Instead of losing 200,000 people from employment, we have now created over the life of the Labor government 800,000 jobs, protecting families, protecting the workplace and protecting our community, in stark contrast to what the opposition were advocating: do nothing. The road to reform as we are now experiencing it is not an easy one, nor has it ever been. The reforms of the Whitlam, Hawke and Keating governments were not easily accepted at the time, yet today they are keystones of our society. Medicare, when it was originally introduced as Medibank, was to be the end of Western civilisation as we know it, as was the Mabo legislation. The superannuation guarantee, when it was introduced, was the beginning of the end for business, yet civilisation is still standing. The mining companies admitted on the Four Corners program the other night that they are doing better than ever in relation to their involvement in the mining sector and their interaction with the Indigenous people of this Today we are looking forward to major initiatives in the form of a National Disability Insurance Scheme and the beginnings of a national dental scheme. Superannuation will be increased so that all Australians can benefit from the mining boom. The direct result of this measure will increase superannuation as the guarantee is lifted from nine per cent to 12 per cent for around 8.4 million working people, increasing retirement savings by $500 billion by 2035, as well as providing 3.6 million low-income earners with concessions worth $800 million a year on employer super contributions. That $500 billion is a good capital pool that can be used to invest within Australia on a range of fronts: creation of jobs and assistance with infrastructure. The Liberal-National coalition have no such vision for the future. Time and again in this place we experience their negativity, their complacency and their inability to identify with the great social and economic changes introduced by Labor governments. Their role is to carp and criticise, to complain, to block and to continually look back. And what is their big reform in the Howard years? A 10 per cent tax, a GST from the cradle to the grave-a regressive tax. This government and the Labor governments which preceded it can look with pride at their achievements for all in our society. The government will continue to implement policies and programs which will benefit all Australians and will continue to address the needs of the less fortunate in our community by seeking to raise the standard of living for all Australians. So I am proud to be speaking on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and related bills, because I think this is a Labor budget that we on this side can be proud of. I note that the electorate itself has generally accepted the budget because it sees that in the circumstances it is a very good budget. I commend the bills to the House. Debate interrupted. NA",157

To assist the House, this was based on two judgments of the New South Wales Administrative Decisions Tribunal, one on 6 April 2011 and the other on 2 August 2011. In the 6 April 2011 document,  and Mr Craig Kelly as 'agents for applicant'. In the 2 August 2011 judgment of the tribunal, next to 'Solicitors', it lists C Kelly the agent. I table both judgments. I am advised that at the Administrative Decisions Tribunal of New South Wales it is possible to represent interested parties as an agent without being a qualified solicitor. I note the member for Hughes's statement that he was not acting as a solicitor during these hearings. The other matters raised remain matters to be considered by the Privileges Committee.

246,Ms GAMBARO,BILLS," It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak in response to the 2012-13 federal budgetAppropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and related bills-on behalf of the people of Brisbane. My unwavering motivation and commitment is always to be a voice for my constituents in the parliament of Australia, and it is in this capacity that I speak to these bills today. The 2012 federal budget will be primarily remembered for two things. It will be remembered as a class war budget-a budget that Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan tried to use to divide the nation-and it will be remembered as the carbon tax budgetthe budget reminding everyone of those infamous words uttered by the Prime Minister before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' It will act as a monument to the gross as breach of trust with the Australian people. One of the things that have been refreshingly absent from modern-day politics in recent decades has been this rhetoric of class warfare by our leaders. As the Leader of the Opposition has stated recently, Malcolm Fraser did not engage in it, Bob Hawke did not engage in it, Paul Keating did not engage in it, John Howard certainly did not engage in it and, to his absolute credit, the member for Griffith did not engage in it when he was Prime Minister. But this pattern has now changed. In recent weeks we have seen the leader of our nation stoop back down into the depths of playing divisive class politics. In an interview Julia Gillard stated: We're the Labor Party and we make absolutely no apology for saying we are here to serve low and middle income Australians and Mr Abbott is here to serve the rich. Again, she described the Leader of the Opposition as 'a cosseted silvertail, who needs to get off Sydney's North Shore and talk to some real families'. We saw the member for Banks just earlier continue on with his class warfare rhetoric. This type of rhetoric serves only one purpose-that is, to divide our nation against one another. It is really offensive to my constituents in Brisbane and it is unbefitting of a Prime Minister of this great country of ours to act in this very undignified manner. I now want to turn to some of the specific issues that directly affect the constituents of Brisbane. The occasional care funding that this government cut and has not recommitted to is a major concern in my electorate. The coalition have committed to restoring funding, should we return to government. However, occasional child care should not be underestimated. It is an important service to our mums and our communities. This government continues to talk about flexibility in child care, but it has absolutely ruined the day-today life of many families in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. It is not full-time childcare but it serves a very useful tool for stay-at-home parents who have to deal with necessary appointments. It is also a very valuable service to mums who work part time and also families who work part time. The cost of this service, for the whole of Australia, is approximately $12 million over four years. In terms of a multibilliondollar budget that is petty cash to this government. The Kitchener Road childcare centre, which I have spoken about many times in this House, has existed for over 40 years and is in danger of closing all because $40,000 was cut from the occasional day care funding program. I am really disappointed that, in my electorate, Kingsford Smith Drive continues to be passed over by this government and by Infrastructure Australia. There will be 3.5 million people coming into Brisbane airport by 2025. This is the major arterial road that everyone uses to get to the airport. It is the economic hub of Brisbane. It is the main connector from the city to the airport and the Bruce Highway. As we know, it is Queensland's most important piece of infrastructure. Brisbane City Council is fully committed to this upgrade and has committed $1.5 million to continue studies for the option 2 upgrade, which is a proposal to upgrade the road to six lanes. However, these works cannot go ahead without contributions from the state and federal governments. My constituents in suburbs such as Wooloowin, Ascot, Clayfield and Hamilton have to put up with the daily inconvenience of this road being consigned to a car park all hours of the day and all hours of the night. There is no peak hour-it is peak hour all day. I am pleased to see a number of community grants and sporting grants still continuing and still being funded in my electorate. But I am very disappointed at the recent cut to COASIT in Queensland under the Community Partners Program. This welfare organisation does a wonderful job in helping the Italian community. As we know, many people who speak another language quite often revert to their native tongue, particularly when they are suffering from dementia or age related illnesses. A key part of our liberal philosophy is that the government must help people who cannot help themselves. This organisation richly deserves the funding that it receives from the government. Dina Ranieri and her team do a wonderful job there at Newmarket. I cannot understand how the government can fund the Greek community-I am not saying that the Greek community does not need funding-but have decided not to fund the Italian community. It just beggars belief. I just do not know how they could do that. It will impact on many families who have elderly parents living with them, requiring in-house carer services, particularly for dementia. I now wish to turn to the economic message and some of the general aspects of the budget. This budget projects a wafer-thin $1.5 billion surplus for the 2012-13 financial year. However, we all know that this will not be delivered. This government has a very sad track record when it comes to the difference between budget projections and budget outcomes. For example, in the current year the deficit has blown out to $44 billion. That is a doubling-I repeat a doubling-of the deficit that was promised just 12 months ago. And, with the projected surplus so small, it only needs a few tiny things to happen such as the terms of trade changing only slightly and the surplus will be completely wiped out. But what is more interesting is the way that this surplus has been manufactured. Accounting tricks and manoeuvres have been constantly used in this budget. It would have made Houdini a very proud man. The government has made cuts by deferring spending in defence and deferring the commitment to spend 0.5 per cent of gross national income on foreign aid by 2015. A deferral is not a cut; the spending has got to occur eventually. This government has also brought forward spending of grants to local governments, to the tune of $1.1 billion, into this financial year; therefore not having to account for it in the 2012-13 budget. Then we have all those wonderful changes to the 'schoolkids cash splash.' We voted against it in this parliament. So we have increased expenditure this year and artificially reduced expenditure next year. Using the graphs from the budget papers, the member for North Sydney demonstrated in his speech to the National Press Club: We already know that the Government is taking a novel approach to compensation for injury by paying $1.5 billion to people this year before the carbon tax actually starts on 1 July. Although if you believe their as it has nothing to do with the carbon tax … they just want to give you money. And further: We also know that the Coal Sector Jobs Package seems to save jobs this year, give up on jobs next year but then it has a change of heart and starts saving jobs the year after and in subsequent years. He went on: It seems as though nation building also takes a holiday in 2013 as the Government brings forward $1.3 billion of spending a few months so it does not appear in next year‟s accounts. And of course there seems to be just one year, the first surplus year, when we don‟t have to spend money on clean energy, but every other year we need to spend over $1 billion. This is clearly a very dodgy surplus based on very dodgy accounting tricks. If a business used these tricks to try to manufacture a profit or loss outcome they would most likely be prosecuted. We also see the spectacle of the government supposedly delivering a surplus yet increasing the debt ceiling by $50 billion. An appropriate analogy for this would be a private business delivering a profit but increasing its borrowings to fund general expenditure. It is simply not sustainable. I might finish this point by quoting something that Margaret Thatcher once said, and she makes a good point: The problem with socialism is that sooner or you run out of other people's money to spend. If you want evidence of this-and the members of the government opposite always talk about Europe-you only have to look at the eurozone. If this government continues going down that track it will find out the hard way. I would now like to discuss the carbon tax. It has been noted by my colleagues that this is the first budget after that fateful day when the Prime Minister blatantly broke her promise to the Australian people. This decision will have a profound impact on the constituents of Brisbane. A survey by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of 850 businesses in Queensland produced some very telling results: over three-quarters of Queensland businesses believe implementation of the carbon pricing mechanism will have a negative impact on their business. What is even more concerning is that 21 per cent of businesses indicated that the energy increases arising from the carbon tax will have a critical impact on their overall business viability. The commentary from the business community about this budget has been scathing because they know that business, and particularly small business, is the big loser in this budget. Small business in and around Brisbane is struggling. I wish to turn to the impact of the carbon tax on council rates in our beautiful city. The Brisbane City Council is the largest council in Australia and has a budget bigger than that of Tasmania. It has also been named by the government as one of the top 250 polluters. Consequently, the carbon tax will cost the Brisbane City Council approximately $65 million over four years. This is despite the fact that Councillor Graham Quirk, the Lord Mayor, and his council currently purchase 100 per cent green power for their buildings, later they offset all their carbon emissions from public transport and vehicle fleets, they are planting two million trees, and they have protected more than 500 hectares of bushland from development over the past four years by bringing that land into public ownership. The Lord Mayor recently stated that council will be left with no choice but to pass Labor's carbon tax straight on to ratepayers. He also revealed that, between 1990 and 2010, Brisbane City Council more than halved its annual carbon emissions from 500,000 tonnes to 220,000 tonnes. The members for Lilley, Petrie, Moreton, Oxley and Rankin should hang their heads in shame for voting for the carbon tax, which will cost their constituents dearly each and every year. I also want to raise the issue of single the persons and, in particular, the many young people who live in my electorate. Unless they receive some form of government welfare payment they will receive minimal reward for the contribution they make and particularly for the increasing costs of living they will face under this carbon tax. These are not rich people. These are ambitious young people trying to get ahead and succeed in life and they are being hit by this government at every turn. They have recently been hit by the news that their health insurance costs will go up. These are young people living in New Farm, Teneriffe and Newstead, many of whom are single Australians working hard to get ahead. The coalition has a strong vision and plan to deliver hope, reward and opportunity for all Australians. As outlined in detail by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, our plan is based on improving public finances, lowering and simplifying taxation, boosting productivity and engaging more closely with Asia and our region. As we get closer to the next election our team will further outline our plans to improve the nation. Australians deserve better. They are crying out for competence and leadership from the national government. Only the coalition has the track record and the vision to deliver that. Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (19:34): I rise to speak in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and cognate bills, which help create a budget continues the Australian government's tradition of sound economic management, assisting those who are most in need and supporting those sections of the economy struggling under the pressures of a high exchange rate and a two-speed economy. This budget has taken the tough decisions needed to balance the books. Its core theme of economic responsibility stands in stark contrast to the shamelessly shallow budget reply delivered by the Leader of the Opposition-an unflattering commentary both on his economic illiteracy and on the quality of modern-day political debate where spin doctors come up with one single proposal designed to occupy the airwaves for 30 seconds and draw attention away from the absence of any serious, detailed, costed budget alternative. On this occasion it was the proposal regarding languages other than English, but frankly it could have been anything. Anything will suffice so long as it distracts attention from the total absence of numbers in the opposition leader's response-a budget reply without numbers or figures. It reminded me of the pub with no beer! The opposition leader treats the Australian people as fools prepared to trust him as Prime Minister without the faintest idea of which government programs and benefits he would keep and which ones he would axe. The opposition leader's budget reply shows the Liberal Party is still besotted by the free market and globalisation. But, as John Quiggin has identified in his book Zombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk Among Us, the assumptions behind neoclassical economics have been laid bare by the global financial crisis. The extra investment generated by more favourable tax treatment is supposed to be allocated efficiently so as to produce higher rates of that long-term economic growth, but the economic crisis has shown that success was built on sand. Much of the extra investment went into real estate or into speculative ventures that collapsed when the bubble burst. Having cut taxes drastically, governments were left with inadequate financial resources to convince now-cautious investors that their bonds were a safe investment. More generally, the global financial crisis has exposed the view that incomes accruing to different groups in the community are an accurate reflection of their marginal contribution. The opposition leader talked about deficit and debt. He did not tell us that Howard government policies resulted in the spending of 94 per cent of a $330 billion increase in tax revenue from 2004-05 from the mining boom mark 1. This in turn forced the hand of the Reserve Bank, which pushed interest rates higher to contain inflation. The opposition leader raised the deficits of the past four years. Again, he conveniently overlooked the global financial crisis, and the effective measures undertaken by the government to protect Australia from that crisis. The OECD has found that Australia's fiscal stimulus measures were amongst the most effective in the OECD in terms of stimulating economic activity and supporting employment. The Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz lauded the Labor government's stimulus spending, saying: Not only was it the right amount, it was extraordinarily well structured, with careful attention to what would stimulate the economy in the shorter run, the medium term and the long term. When I look around the world, it was, I think, probably the best-designed stimulus program in the world and you should be happy that in fact it worked in exactly the way it was designed to work. In fact we are in a better budgetary position today than we would have been had unemployment risen, as it would have done had Joe Hockey been Treasurer. The budget is in better shape than it would have been because the largest item on the revenue side-the pay-as-you-go taxes-has defied the trend of falling revenue. Personal tax collections are, in fact, stronger today than Treasury thought they would be at the depths of the GFC panic in early 2009. The opposition talks about net public debt. The budget papers outline that net public debt will peak in 2011-12 at 9.6 per cent of gross domestic product. Most countries, and every large Western economy, would love this result. By comparison the average net debt position of the major advanced economies is expected to be around 93 per cent of GDP in 2016 and 2017. Our public debt is trivial compared to the OECD average. Other countries would love to be in our shoes. The strength of our public finances is a key reason behind Australia receiving a AAA credit rating with a stable outlook from all three major rating agencies for the first time in our history. We are one of only eight countries that currently meet this standard. Returning to surplus sends a strong message of confidence to the rest of the world during a period of heightened global uncertainty. I want to particularly welcome those initiatives that support manufacturing, invest in the nation's universities and enhance skills training. The pattern of growth in the Australian economy is uneven, with the resources and resource related parts of the economy growing strongly. Business investment as a percentage of GDP is expected to reach a record, with companies planning to invest $120 billion in the resources sector in 2012-13, or around 150 per cent more than two years ago. The resources and resources-related sectors of the economy are likely to average growth of nearly nine per cent per year over the next two years, accounting for 15 to 20 per cent of total GDP. Let me note in passing that this makes a nonsense of those predictions of doom and gloom in the mining and resources sector over the mining tax and the carbon price made by some big mining businesses and their Liberal and National Party puppets. In stark contrast, the non-mining part of the Australian economy is forecast to expand at an average annual rate of just two per cent over the same period. Manufacturing is facing challenging conditions, which I know of first hand from the recent pressures on components manufacturers in my own seat of Wills. Manufacturing employed 997,000 Australians in November 2010, but this fell to 945,000 by November 2011, a fall of over 50,000 workers or over five per cent of the industry's workforce. Although the relative decline of Australian manufacturing has been a multidecade trend, its contraction has accelerated in recent years. Eighty-six thousand manufacturing jobs were lost between mid-2001 and mid-2011. It would appear the loss of manufacturing jobs is gathering pace. Total employment in the industry fell below one million in May 2010 for the first time in decades. Of the 86,000 net jobs lost in the industry in the past decade, 69,000 were lost between February and August last year. This is a troubling picture. The decline in manufacturing's share of employment has been more rapid in Australia than in most other developed countries. The ACTU has concluded that it is conceivable that Australia will soon have fewer workers employed in manufacturing, as a proportion of total employment, than any other developed country. I regard it as incredibly important that we stop this from happening. There has been plenty of research to show that manufacturing is essential for economies. Manufacturing provides betterpaid jobs, on average, than service industries, is a big source of innovation, helps to reduce trade deficits and creates opportunities in growing 'clean' economy, such as recycling and green energy. These are all good reasons for a country to engage in it. Technological innovation is important to growth in manufacturing. Advances in computer integrated manufacturing can increase productivity by saving businesses time. Increased efficiency is not the only benefit of computer integrated manufacturing. In addition, Australian innovators can license their technology for local or overseas use. Improvements in CIM can also reduce geographic constraints, allowing Australian companies to operate more effectively through global supply chains. The NBN is an important development for further improvements to computer integrated manufacturing. In the budget the Australian government has recognised the importance of innovation in manufacturing by investing $30 million over four years to establish a Manufacturing Technology Innovation Centre to bring our brightest researchers and manufacturers together to drive innovation through new and improved industrial products and processes. It will establish sectoral collaboration to support major manufacturers, small and medium enterprises, industry bodies and research agencies to create solutions in their production lines. It will help them realise new market opportunities through harnessing new technologies, business processes and technical knowledge. The Manufacturing Technology Innovation Centre is consistent with the Prime Minister's Taskforce on Manufacturing, and demonstrates this government's commitment to facilitating the transition of manufacturing to 21st century technologies and processes. This stands in stark contrast to the opposition, who would pull the rug from underneath the the manufacturing sector and allow it to wither and die. Manufacturing is important to our economy. Without the initiatives of the Labor government, the high Australian dollar will see manufacturing continue to retreat, and we will end up with a two-state economy. Queensland and Western Australia will benefit from the mining boom, but other states, like my state of Victoria, will not. The budget's $714 million loss carry-back scheme will help support businesses that are not in the mining fast lane of the economy. In 2012-13, companies will be able to carry back losses incurred in that year of up to $1 million so they get a refund against tax previously paid. From 2013-14, companies will be able to carry back losses for two years. This means a manufacturing, tourism, education, retail and construction business which is currently profitable and paying tax will know that, if it undertakes investments in 2012-13 that initially result in a loss, they will get a tax refund of up to $300,000 when they lodge their 2012-13 tax return. This measure will provide assistance to nearly 110,000 companies. Higher education teaching and learning will also see an increased funding commitment, of $38.8 billion over four years from 2012-13. Government funding to the university sector in 2011 was around 30 per cent higher than in 2007. Training more students will help Australia meet emerging skills shortages and deliver a highly skilled, productive and innovative workforce. There is one announcement in the budget which I cannot in all good conscience overlook and with which I strongly disagree. The government has increased the permanent migrant worker program from 125,000 to over 129,000. This is heading in absolutely the wrong direction. We should be cutting the number of migrant workers, returning it to the level it was in the mid-1990s-around 25,000. This is because, firstly, Australia has big cost-of-living and congestion problems arising from our rapid population growth, and increases the number of foreign workers only makes these problems worse. Secondly, it is not true that we are short workers. We have 600,000 people out of work, and the budget papers indicate that unemployment will go to 5.5 per cent this year-that is, it will rise. Furthermore, it is government policy-and I totally support it-to lift our workforce participation rate, bringing people who are presently on pensions into the workforce. We are short of jobs rather than short of people. The idea that we are short of workers is wrong. To give the House an example of what I am on about, there has been a debate between Andrew Forrest and Gina Rinehart about where workers for their mining companies should come from. Gina Rinehart wants to bring them in from overseas. Andrew Forrest wants to find local workers, particularly Aboriginal workers. I think Andrew Forrest is right and Gina Rinehart is wrong. But, for as long as we continue to run a massive program of migrant workerspermanent migrant worker numbers are up from 24,000 in 1996 to over 129,000 now, and temporary migrant worker numbers are up from less than 40,000 a decade ago to more than 90,000 last year-Gina Rinehart's view will prevail, and the mines will employ foreign workers, not local ones. In conclusion, the 2012-13 budget spreads the benefits of the mining boom to help families on low and middle incomes with the cost of living and provide much needed help to small business while still balancing the books as we need to do. This budget also supports businesses in meeting the challenges and opportunities of the mining boom through a loss carry-back reform, while support for skills training and our universities will help us adapt to the structural changes in our economy and facilitate innovation. It continues the foundation for lower inflation and lower interest rates than we had under the of opposition, and lower unemployment than we would have if they were to be returned to government. I commend the bills to the House.",161
247,Ms MARINO,BILLS," In my speech on the appropriation bills at this time last year, I said that the Labor government has a tradition of big deficits, borrowing, debt and more taxes. Nothing has changed. This year Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and related bills bring no improvement-simply the addition of fake surpluses. This would have to be the most misrepresentative budget in living memory. The proposed surplus next year is a fraud perpetrated on the people through sleight-of-hand accounting. The shuffling of expenditure between financial years has allowed the Treasurer to shift his actual budget deficit next year into this financial year's $44 billion deficit, simply to hide it. It is deceitful accounting meant to present a misleading outcome to the Australian community. In addition, the projection of surpluses in forward estimate years relies on extremely optimistic projections of world and Australian economic growth. I said a year ago that Australia would have its biggest debt ever, of $107 billion. Well, the government has piled more debt upon more debt, to a peak net debt of $145 billion in 2013-14. The gross debt, as measured by total interest-bearing liabilities, will reach $293 billion in the same year. This debt binge-that is what it is-has meant that the government has tried for the second year in a row to sneak the lifting of its credit limit past the parliament. There was no mention of this in the Treasurer's budget address, no mention of the $300 billion-a deliberate omission. The rise from $250 billion to $300 billion will be needed to cover Labor's debt debacle, a legacy it is leaving for the next generation to pay off. At this government's current budget surplus projections, Australians will be paying off this debt for nearly a century, on the government's own projections. Effectively, as I see it, the Labor government has just taken out Australia's first national intergenerational loan, with taxpayers paying up to $8 billion a year in interest. Every Australian should be thinking about what that $8 billion could fund instead of Labor's debt. It could have been invested in future-proofing the Australian economy through strategic infrastructure, but instead will continue to be spent trying to futureproof Labor's election agenda. Investment in regional infrastructure could have allowed further growth and development in the mining and agricultural sectors-the sectors that underpin the existing and near-future Australian economies. Sadly, regional Australia is not merely the victim of government neglect; it seems to be the victim of an assault: the government's carbon taxthat is what it is-for regional Australia. The carbon tax is the tax that the government cannot even seem to mention any more. It will hit rural and regional Australians-like those in my electorate-the hardest. This is a tax that will drive investment, industry and jobs offshore. It is meant to make doing business in Australia far less competitive than those we compete with. It is Labor's special tax, coming from every power point. If you are watching, Labor's carbon tax is coming at you, in every home and business in Australia. It is a tax that will see Australia's emissions rise, not fall. It is a tax that will hit struggling regional areas hardest because it will tax transport-rail, air and marine transport immediately, and road transport from 1 July 2014. In 2014, when road freight operators lose 6.858c a litre from their diesel fuel rebate to pay for the carbon tax, the cost to transport almost everything in rural and regional Australia will go up, and regional people and businesses will carry a disproportionate cost as a result. It is a tax on rural and regional Australia. Have no doubt about it: transport costs equal a tax on rural and regional Australia. That tax is expected to cost the transport industry and its customers $510 million in 2014-15 alone-and that is on top of the recent 2.4c a litre rise in the diesel fuel excise. This just means higher costs and greater impacts in regional areas. The government must also be held to it account over its funding for aged care, specifically in regional and rural areas. It is too little, too late. We know that the government changes will not start until after July 2014. We know that as the baby boomer generation heads into retirement and then into care, the numbers and the sheer level of future need should cause us all concern. It is a system already under stress. Agedcare providers are struggling to cope. This is evidenced by the thousands of beds made available by the government but not taken up by the industry. This is happening at a time when the demand for those beds has never been higher. But many providers would lose money on each and every bed, so they are not being taken up and are not being provided to the community. This was recognised in the Productivity Commission's report on aged care. The government response to this, in spite of its election promises, has been manifestly inadequate. The government is paying $8 billion a year in interest on debt rather than supporting aged care and the disability sector. Despite the glossy brochures and glib rhetoric, not a plan to manage the future aged-care demands in Australia. It is only a poorly crafted, stop-gap measure that alone will do little to fix the problem or address future needs. The policy of keeping people in their homes as long as possible is one that has been supported by the Liberal Party for decades, and was driven and delivered for us in government by, among others, the member for Mackellar. Despite the government grabbing hold of this and promoting a good Liberal policy, this alone is not enough. Many of those older Australians who remain in their homes with support services will eventually still need residential care. In many cases it becomes an issue of safety and security, with much greater monitoring required in order to ensure their welfare. Under the current plan we will see older Australians entering into residential aged care, much frailer and requiring much higher levels of care. Clearly, the government has no real plan in place to manage the projected influx of more high-care patients. The Gillard government is simply doing what it has done in so many other areas; it has taken the easy option now and will leave future governments and future generations of Australians to deal with a problem they have created. This is the way of Labor. Aged-care providers and community members have not been fooled by the government's aged-care announcements. As is also the way of Labor, those who have struggled to save and who have built assets to cover their own aged-care costsself-funded retirees-have been the target of the government. Everyone except full-pay pensioners will now pay more for aged care. Once again, the Labor government will use means testing to punish those who have worked hard, taken personal responsibility it is and saved-in this case, for their own retirement. The government has used a sleight of hand, announcing a $3.7 billion aged-care package, but hiding the truth that only 15 per cent of that is actually new funding. This is own not a genuine aged-care plan for the future and certainly not what Labor promised at the election. Another major failing of this budget is its abject failure to do anything to improve the nation's productivity. It is a budget focused on economic redistribution but not economic growth. Given the uncertainty in Europe, many of the world's economies are coming to a crossroads-some because of decisions to redistribute economic wealth instead of growing economic wealth. In Australia we must build our national economy instead of simply building Labor's national debt. This can only be achieved by improving our productivity, which has been undermined during the period of the Rudd and Gillard governments. This government's failure to manage the economy is most damaging to the small business sector. The people who are struggling to get ahead are carrying a deadweight government. Small business in Australia is simply asking for the opportunity to succeed, free from excessive government red tape, burden and interference. Every small business will be hit by the carbon tax in one form or another. Some may be able to pass on this cost, but hundreds of businesses will not be able to pass on these costs. So this is a really serious issue in my electorate. I noticed, in the government's liable entities list last week, that many of those who will pay the carbon tax are from my electorate-businesses such as the Water Corporation; the Griffin Coal Mining Company; Simcoa Operations; Millennium Inorganic Chemicals; Iluka; Synergy; Verve Energy; Yancoal, the new owners of Premier Coal; Dampier Bunbury Pipeline, Worsley Alumina, Alinta Energy; and, further in the south-west, Alcoa Australia. These are the companies that will have to pay the carbon tax directly, but every small business will pay it in one form or another. In talking about this, I would like to warn companies in my electorate-and I have done this previously-that the government is not going to advise you if you are liable to pay the carbon tax. The government has placed this responsibility and liability firmly on industry. So there are other businesses around the south-westThe DEPUTY SPEAKER Murphy): Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting and the member for Forrest will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Solar Hot Water Rebate Bill 2012 [No. Second Reading",168
248,Mr HUNT,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Let me begin by placing the Solar Hot Water Rebate Bill 2012 [No. 2] in context. There was the Home Insulation Program with $2 billion expended, with over 70,000 defects found from the 200,000-odd homes inspected, at a failure rate therefore of close to 35 per cent, with 200 house fires and with four lives tragically lost associated with the program. There was the Green Loans Program, which wasted $100 million. There was the Green Start program, which we said from the outset was doomed to failure, and which was terminated by the government before it ever really got underway. There was the solar panel shock, which stopped retailers in their tracks, and caused chaos in the industry with the overnight decision. There was the cash-for-clunkers scheme, which we identified as being so bad and so irresponsible that no government could proceed; fortunately, those warnings were heeded. The announcement at the last election terminated it before the program could ever begin. There was the Citizens' Assembly, which effectively abrogated responsibility for the deep policy positions to 150 people randomly selected from the telephone book. Again, it was so bad that not even the government could proceed with it. Then, of course, there was the policy that the government denied before the election, when (Mr the Prime Minister said on the Monday before the election that, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead', which has become the carbon tax under a government she leads. All of these represent the background to this bill. All of these represent the form, the history and the record of the government's recent attempts at environment policy. Each represents a failure 2] or a deception on a significant scale. I want to proceed now in four steps: the breach at the heart of this bill, the essence of the bill itself in terms of its response, the damage which has been done in this sector and the deception which remains to this day. Let me take the House back to 28 February of this year. On that day, barely a minute to 5 pm, the government scrapped its $1,000 solar hot water rebate. Businesses were closing their doors for the day. Let me quote the press release from the next day from one of Australia's most significant hot water manufacturers, Dux. On 29 February 2012, the release said: Dux General Manager, Simon Terry, said, 'We received the announcement just before 5pm, as many of our plumbers and solar dealers were closing their small businesses for the day. was completely out of the blue … Simon Terry went on to say: Many of the dealers expressed pure disbelief on receipt of my call. This is the response from a conservative firm, from a firm which does not seek publicity, which does not seek to be publicly engaged in the political process. It just wants to get on with the process of making things in Australia, in particular of making solar hot water heaters and heat pumps and of doing things to advance the cause of Australian manufacturing and to advance the cause of emissions reduction. Similarly, Australian Solar Energy Society put out a release on the same day, under the by-line of John Grimes, the head of the Solar Energy Society, an organisation which is anything but political in nature. The release said: The Australian Solar Energy Society (AuSES) has called on the Australian Government to reinstate the $1000 solar hot water rebate for households, which was axed suddenly yesterday via press release at 5.10pm. They got the press release even later than others. It continues: 'The disastrous solar policy rollercoaster continues.' said Grimes. 'Another solar scheme shut down without notice, more solar jobs lost. That‟s bad policy and bad process.' It is hard to imagine more damning words from a conservative industry organisation, but the release went on: 'The axing leaves householders and solar companies in the lurch putting at risk more than 1,000 jobs at companies that had planned for ongoing demand.' And there is more: 'The leading solar hot water company Rheem has suggested the industry could have overnight, leaving tens of millions of dollars worth of stock stuck in warehouses and puncturing a giant hole in our clean energy present.' This And to conclude, the Australian Solar Energy Society said very simply: 'The Australian Government should be making it easier, not harder, for Australians to cut their power bills and tackle climate change. This very successful rebate program should have been extended, not axed suddenly.' So they are the facts. That is what the industry said. That was the shock, the surprise, the response from industry itself. The Clean Energy Council were equally brutal in their comments. They believed that the 1,200 manufacturing jobs and 6,000 installation, sales and administration jobs the were at significant risk from within the sector. It is part of a pattern of closure, sudden knee-jerk decisions and an inability to understand the moral duty to businesses that are relying upon you by acting to their detriment on your promise. Governments have to be consistent and reliable, trustworthy and predictable. The reason is simple: businesses invest their money, people invest their time and the public invest their commitment on the basis of pledges and promises and allocations by government-all of which failed in this case. The Solar Hot Water Rebate Bill 2012 seeks to ensure certainty in the industry by requiring the government to spend the entire amount budgeted for the solar hot water rebate in this calendar year, because that is what is constitutionally possible. That would ensure that businesses continued to operate as planned and that homeowners had a fair chance to access the rebate. Business owners need to be able to plan for the future with confidence, and with this bill we are trying to provide a bridge to a future which was promised but has evaporated. I note that the government stood in the way of bringing forward this bill for a vote in March, prior to the 2012 budget. It is interesting that we have at the table the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mr Dreyfus. In a letter to Senator Milne signed and hand dated 21 March 2012, the parliamentary secretary said to Senator Milne: As discussed with you, the Government never intended to make any savings from the closure of this program and remains committed to support the transition to a clean energy future, which includes the solar hot water industry. The funding allocated for this program remains the forward estimates. The intention of the statement-its implication-is absolutely clear: 'We're not going to reduce the amount of money allocated. The money's in the forward estimates; it's not going to be cut. It's all going to be expended on solar hot water.' I turn now to what actually happened in the budget. Last year's budget paper was express: in the year 2011-12, $63.5 million was allocated for the solar hot water rebate; in the year 2012-13, in the May 2011 budget, $24.5 million was allocated. That is a total budgetary allocation of $88 million. If the parliamentary secretary's words are to be taken as they were intended to be taken, $88 million should have been expended over the course of this year. The actual spend, as allocated in this May's budget only two weeks ago, was: for 2011-12, $42.8 million, with a carry over to next year, 2012-13, of $0.5 million-a total spend of $43.3 million. What is the gap between what the government pledged and committed to in last year's budget papers and what they delivered in this year's budget papers? It is $44.7 million. So what we have here is a $44.7 million deception. Again I point out that, on 21 March this year, the parliamentary secretary said to Senator Milne: As discussed with you, the Government never intended to make any savings from the closure of this program and remains committed to support the transition to a clean energy future, which includes the solar hot water industry. The funding allocated for this program remains in the forward estimates. No, it does not; those estimates have been revised, and the money which it was said would be there-the $88 million-has miraculously been reduced by more than half. There was a net saving to budget against last year's May budget papers of $44.7 million. The Greens had the wool in pulled over their eyes, the public had the wool pulled over their eyes and, sadly, it is the industry which has actually suffered. I visited the Rheem plant at Rydalmere, near Parramatta, with the Leader of the Opposition in March. We met with 400 workers on the factory floor of the Rheem plant and saw the sense of disappointment. We heard their views and saw the fact that they felt betrayed. Similarly, I visited Rheem's Perth plant with the member for Swan, Steve Irons. Again, we talked with workers, we met with workers and we addressed the workers. They knew who was standing up for them and who was not. The sense was that they had no stronger advocate than Steve Irons, the member for Swan, and that they faced no greater threat than the government, which had pulled away support without warning. All of that represents the background to this bill. This bill is all about the breach and the fact that we have a remedy which will ensure that the remaining gap of $20.7 million is expended and so provide a bridge for the solar sector; and then it is about the damage. We already know that Rheem has shed more than 50 jobs in recent weeks; they have quietly had to do that with enormous reluctance. But make no mistake and have no doubt that the government's stop-start-andstop policies are right at the core of those job losses. I challenge the Prime Minister, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and the parliamentary secretary to go to the floor of Rheem in Rydalmere near Parramatta in Sydney and of Rheem in Welshpool in Perth and to explain their actions and why they broke their pledge to allocate $88 million over this financial year and next financial year . I challenge them also to meet with those workers who have lost their jobs-to meet with people such as Len Place from Dux, who has lost his job since the government's decision. I know him well, and his job has gone as a consequence of the cost-cutting associated with this government's decision. How do I know this? I met with him, I talked with him and we looked at options to try to take him forward. That is the damage. Finally, I go to the future. We are trying this day to restore the damage, to keep the government's pledge, to hold it to account and to do the right thing by an industry which is in deep trouble. There should be no reason for the government to not support its own words and its own budget paper. We will also, if we are fortunate to win government, put in place a one million roofs solar policy over 10 years, with 100,000 roofs of solar panels a year, with a particular focus on solar hot water-but on a long term, modest, sustainable basis. The key to policy which can endure is long-term, modest and sustainable measures. That is what the industry seeks. So today is a chance for the government to right that which it has done wrong and to repair that which it has broken. For those reasons, I commend the Solar Hot Water Rebate Bill 2012 [No. 2] to the House.",171
249,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded?,174
250,Mr Irons,BILLS,I second the motion.,174
251,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (20:15): Yet again we are seeing another attempt to get some relevance for the opposition on the issue of climate change. Like so much else of what the opposition have done in this policy area, it rests on deceiving industry and deceiving the Australian people about policy, manufacturing and the carbon price. It is just more empty grandstanding, more hysteria and, indeed, more of the shameful pretence from the opposition that they actually have a policy that might just possibly reduce the carbon pollution that is the problem we are intending to deal with. They say that we should engage in the reduction of carbon pollution, but, of course, they have no policy-and if I have time. I will come back to that. We have again more crocodile tears from the opposition, who pretend, and only pretend, concern for manufacturing-and this, of course, from the architects of Work Choices. I see that the opposition spokesman is now fleeing from the chamber. He is not prepared to stay here to support the bill that he has introduced, having put forward nothing more than just effectively hysteriaand I will explain why in a minute. I have some news for the opposition: pretending to care about the renewable energy industry and then opposing a carbon price is not a credible climate change policy. Wearing fluoro vests and visiting factories all over Australia is not a manufacturing policy. Endless opposition and mindless negativity are not in Australia's best interests, but we have just heard again from the member for Flinders a bit more of that. If the Leader of the Opposition is a cheap hypnotist, then the member for Flinders is nothing but a tawdry clown. Who else but a clown would have written their university thesis on 'A tax to make the polluter pay' and then advocate for the biggest policy joke this century, the so-called direct action policy, which is what the opposition is putting forward? The facts are that the Gillard government has provided more support to renewable energy than any other government in Australian history. I want to outline some facts on the solar hot water scheme. When the carbon price scheme starts on 1 July, the solar hot water industry will be receiving support in four ways. First, the carbon price itself will create a stable, long-term market and will provide incentive right across the economy for the shift to renewable energy. Second, the Low Carbon Communities program, part of the clean energy future plan, will provide $330 million to councils, communities and low-income families to improve energy efficiency in homes and buildings. Of course, solar hot water is very energy efficient and we expect that, as part of the grants that will be provided under the Low Carbon Communities program, there will be a very great deal of support for solar hot water. The third means of support under the carbon price scheme is the $800 million Clean Technology Investment Program, which will give the solar hot water industry an incentive to retool and modernise the manufacture of these units. Of course, it is not just the solar hot water industry that will be advantaged by that Clean Technology Investment Program; industry right across Australia will be assisted to improve efficiency and modernise. Last, but not least, is the support for the industry right through to 2020 through the renewable energy target. Essentially, consumers can be offered up to a $1,000 discount in STCs, or small technology certificates, and that will continue. That renewable energy target will continue and the small technology certificates, which are available to solar hot water, will also continue. Our current policy settings are designed to transition to a clean energy future, and it is a future that includes solar hot water. The member for Flinders has engaged in his usual historical fictions, as he does with all aspects of our policy but particularly the solar hot water rebate. The solar hot water rebate was always going to end on 30 June this year and it is ending on 30 June this year. This was what was planned. I know this will come as a shock to some of those opposite or to any newer members of the opposition, but this was planned when this rebate was established by the last Liberal environment minister, the member for Wentworth, when he announced the solar rebate scheme on 17 July 2007. What the member for Wentworth as the then minister for the environment said was that this was going to be a transition. This was a scheme to provide support for solar hot water as Australia transitioned to an emissions trading scheme, which was, of course, by then the policy of the Howard government. That is why the Howard government established the greenhouse gas reporting arrangements, which we are still using. That is why the Howard government went to the 2007 election supporting an emissions trading scheme. This bit of policy, the solar hot water rebate, was intended to be a transitional policy-and, I might add, the hot water industry has been well aware of this fact. Indeed, websites of solar hot water companies in February this year stated, showing their awareness, that the rebate scheme was going to finish in March. All that has happened here is that the scheme was formally announced as ending on 30 June this year. As at 28 February, under the long established guidelines for this rebate scheme, customers had four months to lodge their rebate applications. Four months from 28 February, as it happens, is 30 June. This scheme is ending on time as it was always destined to. It has not been scrapped. It has not been closed early. It is not being ended. It is a scheme that was introduced by those opposite when they actually understood something about market mechanisms, when they were actually true to their principles of supporting market incentives, market mechanisms, a carbon price and an emissions trading scheme. They announced this program. They established this program as a transitional program intended and announced by them to be a five-year program. We have continued this program for five years. Indeed, we have expanded the program over the course of our government so as to put more money into it than the Liberal Party was intending to when they started this scheme. But its time-frame, its life if you is exactly as has always been planned since the inception of the scheme-not scrapped, not being closed early. It is simply being ended in accordance with the guidelines, in accordance with announcements that have been made by successive Australian governments since this scheme was established on 17 July 2007. I heard the member for Flinders refer to a bridge, and that might perhaps have betrayed some limited understanding, but I do not think he was actually talking about the fact that this was always intended to be and has been a bridging program that was meant to finish upon the introduction of a carbon price. Logically, with the Clean Energy Future plan coming into operation and with the carbon price coming into operation on 1 July, we have this solar hot water service rebate scheme finishing on 30 June. Households and industry will continue to benefit from Gillard government programs in every sense. I have outlined the ways in which the Clean Energy Future plan is going to continue to benefit the solar hot water industry in particular. What we have got here is a bill, again, true to form for those opposite with all their economic illiteracy we have seen recently, which is a fiscally irresponsible bill that is the sort of stunt one would expect to see from an opposition which has a $70 billion budget black hole that has not been explained to the Australian public. That is not my figure. That is the figure of the opposition spokesman for finance, confirmed by the opposition Treasury spokesman, the member for North Sydney. There is a $70 billion black hole that the opposition has not explained. We will not be reopening the solar hot water rebate scheme. We will not be agreeing to this bill. I need to be clear. We have made it clear at all times when we will close the program and on every day like, since that we will not be reopening this program. I need to deal with something else that the member for Flinders has raised. We never intended to make savings from this program. I am very pleased that the member for Flinders has read part of the letter that was tabled in the Senate by the Leader of the Australian Greens party, Senator Milne, in which I confirmed that it was not the government's intention, when we announced that the program was closing with effect from 30 June, to make savings from the program. At the time of the announcement on 28 February, we did not know the full extent of the underspend. We thought that it was possible that there would be some underspend. What was not understood on 28 February, but is understood now, is that there had been a very direct decline-and this is something that many parts of Australian manufacturing have had to deal with-in the uptake of the solar hot water service rebate program as a result of the high dollar making other competing technologies, notably the instantaneous gas hot water technology, which is imported, cheaper. In fact I should mention that some of it is imported by Rheem, one of the manufacturers referred to here, which imports a product that directly competes with the solar hot water services it makes. As a result of quite steeply declining uptake in the program through December, January and February, it is clear that there will now be an underspend. Again, as I have indicated publicly, as Senator Milne understands and as she indicated when she spoke on the equivalent bill put forward by Senator Birmingham in the Senate, any underspend will be used to continue supporting the transition Australia is making to a low-carbon economy and that will include supporting solar hot water. This government has provided more support for renewable energy, more support for technologies that reduce carbon pollution in the Australian economy than any other Australian government in history. All we have from the member for Flinders today is a pathetic misreading of the budget papers. I suppose that is what one would expect from an opposition that has a $70 billion hole in the savings that it will need to make to meet the kind of commitments that it has already made in its projections and promises. We have an opposition that would wish to engage in a fantasy-that is the right way to describe it-that it too has a plan that will support the transition to a cleaner economy. The so-called direct action plan of the opposition is not a plan at all. It is a plan would see a cost of some $1,300 per household inflicted on the Australian community where households pay for money in bucketloads to be sent to the heavy polluters. It is, if you like, a weird inversion of the government's policy. Even then, so far as the direct action plan can be understood, it is not one that anybody thinks can achieve the bipartisan target-the one that the opposition says that it is supporting, which is a five per cent cut in 2000 emission levels by 2020. We have been talking with industry. I have been talking to Rheem. I have been talking to Dux. I have been talking to the whole industry. I have been talking to installers. Of course I have been talking to crossbenchers and I have been talking to state governments about how the underspend, when it is finally determined, can in fact be used to ensure that it is there to continue to support renewable technologies and to continue to support solar hot water. That is what responsible governments do, not put forward-as this opposition has donean entirely fiscally irresponsible bill which would seek to continue a demand-driven program. Members might like to contemplate what reopening a demand-driven program might do in a budgetary sense. What it would do, very directly, is simply create an enormous spike in demand, with a great threat to the integrity of our budget. That is not an appropriate way in which to manage the finances of the Commonwealth. Demand driven programs-all Treasury guidelines make this clear-need to be very, very carefully handled and that is what has occurred here. We have avoided the demand spike that quite a number of demand driven programs have become known for. This program has been ended in an orderly fashion. We will not be supporting the opposition's Solar Hot Water Rebate Bill that 2012 [No. 2], which is a stunt that would seek to reopen this program in an entirely fiscally irresponsible way. Indeed, it is a program that we can now say was already in decline. We rely on a comprehensive set of policies that is contained in the Clean Energy Future plan.",174
252,Mr IRONS,BILLS," It is always a pleasure to support a bill such as this one, the Solar Hot Water Rebate Bill 2012 [No. 2], put forward by the member for Flinders, and also to support the workers in my electorate of Swan, where the Rheem factory is. We have just heard the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the member for Isaacs, speaking on the bill. It is encouraging to see someone who talks about raising the standards of parliament spend the first 2½ minutes in invective, diatribe and insults directed at the member for Flinders and also at the opposition! The contradiction I see in his speech is that he says that we have no policy, and that our direct action policy is incorrect, but then goes on to quote the member for Wentworth's policies and laud them. Such a contradiction just amazes me-and I wonder why people refer to him as Rumpole! Now I know why. Mr Dreyfus interjecting",178
253,Mr IRONS,BILLS,"Yes, that's all right, keep it coming. I am happy to relay everything you say back to the workers in the Rheem factories, particularly in my electorate. Then we get the member for Isaacs calling this a stunt. Again, I will relay that back to the workers in the factory: that you think this is a stunt and that their jobs are a stunt-that their jobs are worth nothing. He talks about deceiving and manufacturing crocodile tears; he talks about tawdry clowns. As a parliamentary secretary, how can he bring the level of this place down so low with these insults? I thank the member for Flinders for his contribution. I know that he understands how important this bill is to my electorate. He joined me on a factory floor visit to the Rheem factory in Welshpool in my electorate of Swan on 7 March to meet some of the hundreds of employees whose jobs have been threatened by this government's actions. It was at this visit that we announced that we would be drawing up this bill. We in the coalition had wanted to debate it before the budget, a move which was blocked by this government; however, in standing here and debating this bill today, we are keeping the promise made on 7 March to the workers on the factory floor in Welshpool to bring this bill to the parliament. This stands in contrast to the Labor government, whose broken promise on the solar hot water rebate has led us to this point today. It has led to the coalition introducing a bill that simply requires the government to stick to the promise it made in the 2010-11 budget. The workers that the member for Flinders and I met in March on the factory floor were scared for their jobs. They were genuinely concerned for their livelihoods-all because of the Gillard government's actions the week before, with its sudden decision to scrap the hot water rebate scheme despite a commitment in the budget of $24.5 million the previous year for the funding of the scheme. Out of the blue, at one minute to five on 28 February, the notification came through that yet another commitment had been broken by this government. It gave businesses and homeowners only a few hours to submit their applications in order to remain eligible for the subsidy that the government had promised them. But there was no time for families and businesses to fulfil their orders after that guillotine came down. According to the Clean Energy Council, 1,200 manufacturing jobs and 6,000 installation, sales and administration jobs were at risk. My visit with Greg Hunt was my third visit in recent times to the Rheem Welshpool factory. One of those visits was with the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, and I must admit that I was encouraged by the amount of cheer and the welcome he got from the workers on the factory floor. The coalition is a friend of the solar hot water industry in my electorate and across Australia. We spend time talking to the workers and understanding their industry and we will stand up for them in parliament. I have over 25 years experience as a small businessman myself and speak to businesses all over my electorate on a regular basis. I can say that the decisions of the government and the way it handles its brief are creating almost unprecedented uncertainty in the sector. There has been uncertainty created by the mining tax, uncertainty created by the carbon tax, uncertainty created by the one per cent tax cut to business that was promised at one stage but then denied in the budget. And now there is uncertainty created by the government's scheme managementboth for businesses and families in the solar hot water sector who, lest we forget, on 1 July are going to be forced to think of ways to reduce their electricity consumption as a result of the carbon tax. The Gillard government has now taken away the option of solar hot water for them to reduce their emissions and to pay for the carbon tax that they did not vote for. Without certainty, there can be no confidence. Businesses and families cannot plan with confidence for the future. One of the points that Rheem Welshpool consistently makes to me is how difficult to plan effectively when solar policy and government decisions lurch from one extreme to the other. The solar industry is yet another group that has found out the hard way that you cannot take this government at its word, and that even schemes that go into the budget papers in black and white cannot be believed. During the visit to the factory we joined with the management and the workers to discuss the issues that they faced. Most of them were concerned about their jobs and felt that they and their families had an uncertain future. They were hopeful that with us introducing this bill into parliament they would be back on track and at least know in what direction they were heading. I have been talking to businesses around the electorate and around Australia, because I have contacts in many of those businesses. They feel that currently the government is a train wreck waiting to happen. There is no driver, they do not know which stations it is going to stop at and so they are just waiting to hit that brick wall. On the other side of the House, you will hear them talk about their closeness to business. Well, I am hearing the opposite from businesses. I am happy to take any of the government members to any of these businesses to have it explained to themwhether they have to wear a bright orange vest or a hard hat, I am happy to take them out to those places and let them hear what the workers have to say. This bill, in essence, simply requires the government to keep the commitment it made in the 2010-11 budget and spend the entire amount which it had budgeted for under the solar hot water rebate. In practical terms, this bill would ensure that businesses could continue to operate as planned and that home owners had fairer access to the rebate. Business owners need to be able to plan for the future with it is confidence, and the private member's bill seeks to provide them with this certainty in this respect. The 2012-13 budget papers clearly show that the money which should have been taken from the forward estimates in the 2011 budget is missing in the 2012 budget. In 2011-12 a total of $88 million was promised, with the total spend in the 2012 budget of $43 million indicating a $44.7 million cut. The government had always claimed that their reason for terminating the solar hot water rebate early was because the program was oversubscribed and that they anticipated the funding would be fully expended before its scheduled conclusion. It was amazing to hear the parliamentary secretary saying that the take-up had actually reduced. If the up was reducing, their excuse of being oversubscribed just does not gel. The government then promised that the full funding originally allocated for the solar hot water rebate would be retained. However, these figures would suggest otherwise. It would seem from the figures that the government are sacrificing solar jobs for a paper surplus that most commentators doubt will ever be delivered. As I have mentioned earlier this also meets a commitment that Greg Hunt and I made to the workers on the factory floor at Rheem Welshpool on 7 March, that we would introduce a bill in parliament to force the government to meet their commitments to the people of Welshpool and the people of Australia. We in the coalition attempted to have this bill voted on before the budget, to try to remedy this situation in the fastest possible way and to save as many jobs as possible. However, the government would not have it debated-and shame on them for that. But now, as the parliamentary secretary said he is not going to reinstate the scheme I will take that back to the people and the workers at the Rheem factory in Welshpool in my electorate. We have, though, persevered and brought this bill to the parliament today. I thank the member for Flinders and other members of the coalition for the support of the workers in my electorate of Swan. I also acknowledge that the success of this bill would have been dependent upon the Independents. I hoped that they could have seen the damage to the industry and to the families caused by the government's decision, and the need to set this right. More broadly speaking, this episode fits into a pattern of behaviour for the GillardRudd Labor era; a pattern of complete mismanagement of simple schemes that ultimately end in wasted money or take- diminished confidence. In this case the outcome is at the most serious end of the scale-Australian jobs have been threatened. Again, we heard the parliamentary secretary talk about demand-driven programs. I guess that the pink batts were not demand driven. There is a certain deja vu as we consider this today as the axing of this rebate is a repeat performance of the sudden closure of the Solar Homes and Communities Plan in 2009 by then Minister Garrett, who also presided over the pink batts debacle and who was later removed from his post. This joins a list of Labor disasters such as the Home Insulation Program, cash for clunkers and Green Loans. In Swan we also remember the Solar Flagships scheme in 2010, when none of the WA projects even made the government's short list, despite eight proposals receiving WA government backing. But the five projects that did get up were from Queensland, and have progressed. The Independents had a choice here to right a wrong and, as the minister said, he will not reinstate the scheme. As the member for Swan I will continue to support the workers in the factory of Rheem in Welshpool. I am sure that the member for Parramatta, who is just about to speak, takes an interest in the workers in the Rheem factory in Rydalmere as well. I commend the bill to the House.",178
254,Ms OWENS,BILLS," The previous speaker is right: there is a Rheem factory in my electorate in Rydalmere. I have been down there any number of times. I have been down there when the program was running fully-when they were expanding and retooling and employing more-and I have been down more recently, before this decision was announced, when sales were down and they were struggling with the declining demand. And I have been down a since this decision was made. I know from talking to them over quite a number of months that the sales of solar hot water systems have been in decline for some time, and that the issues they face include issues like the changing costs of their competing products, including the gas hot water systems which, as the member for Isaacs said, they also import. They actually import their own competition at Rheem. And I know they have concern about government policy in other areas, which they believe make it more difficult for solar to compete. But the idea that extending a program for four months and then shutting it down again would solve the ongoing pattern in the solar hot water system industry is folly. To tell workers that reinstating a program in a declining sector by four months would actually save their jobs in the long term is just misleading them in the most appalling way. The previous speaker said that we should let business get on and operate as they planned. That is true. This program was known and planned way back in 2007-in fact it was 17 July 2007-by the Howard government. It was put together as a bridging program to take the then government up to 30 June 2012, when they intended to introduce their emissions trading scheme. So for the Howard government it was a bridging program which went from July 2007 up to the start of their emissions trading scheme: bridging program. There is actually another bridging program that comes on the end of that, which is the renewable energy targetalso a bridging program, which goes up until 2020. So it is also designed to provide some incentives in renewable energy while the price on carbon is starting to work fully through the economy. It is the second part of the bridging program, and it also provides support to the solar hot water industry. Right from the beginning this program was a bridging program designed to close on 30 June 2012. It never applied to new properties; it only applied to retrofits and so, again, there is another sector of the industry out there to which this does not apply and which benefits greatly from regulations that gradually phase out electric hot water systems-at a state level in most cases. So manufacturers and installers have known for five years that this program would finish on 30 June 2012. I want to talk about how this program actually operates, because it explains why the 28 February date for installations is the right one if you are closing the program on 30 June. It is a demand-driven program, and we all know what happens in a demanddriven program when the end becomes near: people come out of the woodwork and you get quite a spike in demand at the end. So it is actually quite a normal practice for a department, when they have these kinds of demand-driven programs, to stop them without warning. When they do not do that, you get an interesting result. For instance, when the solar photovoltaic rebate was closed and one day's notice was given, around $384 million in applications were received on or immediately after the closing date. So that announcement with a day's notice led to a spike of $384 million. This solar hot water rebate scheme works in this way: you install it and then you have a four months to apply for a rebate. So, if you installed before 28 February, you have until 30 June to apply for a rebate. One of the reasons the government did not know at the time that it announced the closure of the program what the overspend or underspend would be-it suspected it would be an underspend because sales had been in decline-is that you actually do not know at that point, because you have not received the applications for the rebate, how many of them there are out there. So it is normal practice to do exactly what the department did: to stop the program and allow that four months for the applications to flow through, closing on 30 June. That was always the intention, that is what was announced in July 2007 and that is exactly what happened. It would be fiscally irresponsible to reopen the program. Can you imagine what would happen if tomorrow the government announced that the program was reopening and it was closing on 30 June? The government would not know, right up until 30 June, what its liability was going to be. just would now know. It would not have any idea. You can bet it would be well and truly over the budget, by a large factor. It would be fiscally irresponsible to open the program, and the government has made it really clear that we will not. It would confuse households, it would increase uncertainty for business and it would expose the department to extraordinary budget risk. Again, departments manage these demand-driven programs by slightly overestimating the demand so that shortfall can be met within the department's budget, but they also do exactly what they have done in this case, which is close the program on a day and announce it that day. To do otherwise-to give a day's notice-can result, as the photovoltaic rebate showed, in an overrun by $384 million in one day. That is a lot of dollars in one day. For an opposition that has a $70 billion black hole, suspect it would be $71 billion very quickly if you gave people four weeks. If you think about the ramifications of actually doing this, you would not suggest it, ever. This is a very silly thing to do. If the opposition have a real concern about the solar hot water industry-I am sceptical that they do given that this kind of motion comes forward and this is the best they can do-I do think there are a number of other areas that they could be discussing. I think that, if they go back to some of the manufacturers, they will find that they have things that they want to discuss. It is a real shame that in this parliament we do not get the real discussion; we do not get any really thought-through, constructive debate about what are incredibly complex issues for an Australian manufacturer. It is just a shame. I am going to call this a stunt as well, I am afraid, and I am sure someone will go back and tell the workers at Rheem. You simply cannot do It this if you are fiscally responsible in any way. We are also not leaving the solar industry out in the cold. There is a significant amount of support still available for people seeking to install solar hot water systems in their homes and their businesses. This government has provided more support to renewables than any government in Australian history, and we continue to do that. When the carbon price scheme starts on 1 July, the solar hot water industry will be receiving support in four ways. For a start, the carbon price itself will create a stable, long-term market. The Low Carbon Communities program will provide $330 million to councils, communities and low-income families to improve energy efficiency in homes and buildings. Solar hot water is very energy efficient, and I have spoken to Rheem about whether or not they could work with local I organisations to be part of that program. The $800 million Clean Technology Investment Program will give the solar hot water industry an incentive to retool and modernise the manufacture of these units. Last but not least is the support for the industry to 2020 through the renewable energy target, which offers a $1,000 discount in small-scale technology certificates to consumers installing solar hot water systems in their homes. That is a $1,000 discount which will still be there for people seeking to put a solar hot water system on their home. We will not be supporting this bill. (Time expired) Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (20:50): I rise to support the Solar Hot Water Rebate Bill 2012 [No. 2]. The government's decision to rip the funding out of the hot water rebate scheme is appalling, dishonest and hypocritical. No credibility for this government when they keep changing their minds and decisions equates to no confidence for small business. Businesses do not do their planning on a day-today basis. They plan six months, 12 months or five years ahead-sometimes 10 years. In the case of big industry it is 20 years planning. You cannot change stream from doing a backstroke to a breaststroke halfway down the pool, but this is what this government expects industry to do. If you want some more examples, the superannuation fund is being tinkered with again, eroding people's confidence in the superannuation fund. The pink batts scheme was another example. The government brought that situation on overnight. All hardware stores in Australia did not have the number of pink batts they required to do the jobs, so it was all put on hold until the pink batts were imported from China into Australia. No locally made batts went into that program. With respect to Building the Education Revolution, Reed Constructions, a big company in New South Wales, was given a lot of these projects. The projects were way overpriced-$4,300 per square metre, when the job could have been done for $1,500 per square metre. These are the sorts of things that happen with these rush decisions and stop-go policies of the government. Sadly, Reed Constructions is now in administration and $100 million is owed to contractors and subcontractors. That is what happens when you do not have continuing and reliable policies and when you have changes to the system all the time. The people in my electorate of Flynn are fed up with seeing promise after promise being broken by Labor. This is why there is no confidence out there. I do not care what electorate you come from: there is no confidence in small business or in the mums and dads of this world, because they do not know what move the government will make next. The solar hot water industry is a vital part of our economy and it could be a positive contributor to real efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions. I believe this bill must be supported to ensure the security of jobs in the industry and to allow people the opportunity to access solar hot water systems that are affordable and that are good for the environment. There is no mention in this budget of the underspend of $44.7 million from the program, which was left over in surplus. So the solar hot water system policy has just died on the vine. If the government were fair dinkum they would have put $44.7 million into the budget to be spent on future solar programs. Families are being starved of opportunities for real moves towards reducing their greenhouse emissions. This was a way out for them. They felt happy about it. They thought: 'We're not going to have solar energy run our power stations, run our electricity business or run the aluminium industry or the cement industry in Gladstone, but it would help run our homes.' It would be a part they could play in conserving energy and reducing emissions. But now that opportunity has been chopped off. Not only does it remove practical means for families to become greener but it also costs jobs. The member for Swan said that it will affect jobs in his electorate. No wonder he is very concerned. The Clean Energy Council claims that 1,200 manufacturing jobs are at risk and 6,000 installations, sales and administration jobs are also under threat. That is why he is concerned and he has good reasons to be concerned as he cannot justify giving people who lose their jobs some sort of credit or some sort of job on windmills or in other energy programs. The government promised $63.5 million for the program in 2011 and $24.5 million in 2012. The government actually spent $42.8 million in 2011 and just half a million dollars in 2012.

255,Ms PARKE,BILLS," It is always a privilege to speak in this place on matters of significance, especially when those matters relate to legislation because of course the laws we make here form part of the great black-and-white matrix that constitutes the formal operating code of how Australia works. Unfortunately, there are times when the occasion to speak arises not through some matter of any real significance but rather as part of some kind of political game-and that is the case tonight. Any argument that the member for Flinders purports to make for the importance of supporting renewable energy is a ringing endorsement of this government's reform program and puts a question mark over his own conduct and the conduct of the coalition on this issue. The member for Flinders is of course the same person who formerly believed in and argued strongly for the importance of addressing climate change through an emissions trading scheme. This is the same person, who, along with his coalition colleagues, negotiated and agreed to the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, before they broke their word and pursued a path of negativity, pseudoscience and scaremongering ever since. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has rightly pointed out, the closing of the solar hot water scheme, by 30 June this year, has been contemplated and forecast for a number of years and it makes perfect sense for this to occur at the point at which the Labor government's Renewable Energy Target and Clean Energy Future reforms step into continue to support the solar hot water industry and the households, community organisations and businesses which seek to pursue energy efficiency in that way. Anyone who ordered, purchased or installed a solar hot water system on or before 28 February remains able to apply for the rebate until 30 June, in keeping with the four-month claim window that has applied throughout this program. It is a program that has underwritten the installation of 250,000 solar hot water systems. In the same period, about 4½ years, this government has supported the installation of more than 150,000 household solar PV systems. The Howard government, in 11½ years, supported 12,000. In the same period, this Labor government has created the structures and the funding to stimulate unprecedented investment in large-scale renewable energy projects that will be the basis of Australian economic growth, jobs and emission-free electricity in the decades to come. This includes the recent announcement that the government will provide $10 million to support the commercial scale implementation of Carnegie Wave Energy's promising wave power technology in the ocean adjacent to my electorate. The fact is that this government has taken a well-founded approach to providing support for renewable energy and energy efficiency. We have acted to support burgeoning industries, to back innovative technology and to create a level playing field for low-carbon or no-carbon energy and manufacturing processes. We have acted to support households in their clear and strong desire to reduce their carbon emissions and to recalibrate the sources on which they rely for their energy. In the case of household solar panels, we provided rebates that kick-started a home solar PV revolution, literally transforming our suburbs. But naturally and sensibly those rebates were designed to taper off and they have tapered off as private side demand has grown. The Solar Home and Communities rebate was replaced by the Solar Credits scheme and the credit multiplier within the Solar Credits scheme has, in turn, been eased. When the industry grew and stabilised and the scale of production and the size and consistency of demand, coupled with lower input costs, meant that per unit costs decreased, the government support was sensibly and gradually wound back. Perhaps the best indication of the equilibrium that government has managed in this case is the fact that the price point at which a standard 1.5 kilowatt system is available to the consumer has changed very little. In the case of the solar hot water rebate and other energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, this government has designed and delivered policy that sparks innovation to the point where it will be increasingly sustained by private demand market conditions. This is precisely the approach that has delivered the twin hallmarks of this government-namely, world-leading economic management and, at the same time, forward-looking policy reform. The proposal from the member for Flinders that the government renege on its planned transition from the solar hot water rebate to the various forms of support within the clean energy future package advocates a dangerous move that would open up a substantial and unquantifiable further liability. I would therefore strongly encourage the member for Flinders to cast his eye across the Nullarbor and see how his Liberal colleagues in WA have presided over a $450 million blow-out in their wildly mismanaged solar tariff scheme. Is that what the member for Flinders is seeking to achieve with this private member's bill, the Solar Hot Water Rebate Bill 2012 [No. 2]? The purpose of this private member's bill is wholly and solely to make an issue where no issue exists and it fails to do even that. It cannot be supported.",184
256,Mr ALEXANDER,BILLS," In the south-western corner of my electorate of Bennelong is the suburb of Ermington, a busy neighbourhood of battlers and real families working hard to make ends meet. Many work in industrial companies on the other side of Silverwater Road in the the electorate of Parramatta, such as the manufacturing headquarters of Rheem Australia in Rydalmere. Rheem's history of manufacturing electric hot water heaters in Australia dates back to the Second World War. Rheem employs 350 of these battlers in their manufacturing arm alone, producing household brands like Solahart, Vulcan and Aquamax. This is a great Australian company that supports local workers and relies on a stable operating environment. The government's decision to suddenly scrap the $1,000 solar hot water rebate at one minute to five on 28 February was a sly and deceptive measure that has directly hurt many of these hard-working families. As a result of this decision, Rheem has witnessed a 30 to 40 per cent reduction in sales and has been forced to sack 60 employees. They are fighting to hold on to their team of manufacturing staff. So far, discussions with this government have not given Rheem any security or assurance that the future for these workers and their families will be any better than for the 60 workers already retrenched. government's decision has put workers out of jobs and businesses at risk of financial ruin. The Clean Energy Council estimates that 1,200 manufacturing jobs and 6,000 installation, sales and administration jobs are at risk as a result of the government's axing of this program-which bears a great resemblance to the sudden closure of the Solar Homes and Communities Plan in 2009 and the bungled Home Insulation Program, the Green Loans Program and cash-forclunkers failures. This government has consistently and repeatedly disregarded the needs of businesses and families in Bennelong, Parramatta and across the nation. This private member's bill, the Solar Hot Water Rebate Bill 2012 [No. 2], moved by my colleague the member for Flinders, will ensure that businesses like Rheem can continue to operate as they had planned and that homeowners in Ermington and around the nation are given a fair chance to access the rebate. It is very disappointing that the government voted against this bill being debated prior to the budget so as not to cause any political friction with their alliance colleagues the Greens. The government knows that their decision is anti-environment and based on a lie. First they claimed the solar hot water rebate was shut down because it was oversubscribed and that all allocated funds would be spent. Yet the recent budget papers tell another storyone that shows more than 50 per cent of the $88 million promised by the government to support this environmental initiative had vanished. In one breath this government claims that the Australian people deserve some financial punishment through the carbon tax because the environment is worth it, and with the next breath they axe their own solar hot water program because they cannot afford it. The key question which remains for this government is whether this This farcical situation is a result of incompetence in the management of the program or is just another broken promise. The use of solar hot water is a genuine way for households to reduce their greenhouse emissions and cut their power bills ahead of the carbon tax on 1 July. Perhaps this government does not actually want people to reduce their coalpowered electricity consumption. After all, this would mean less carbon emissions and therefore less money collected in taxes to pay for the cash handouts. The coalition is committed to the solar industry. The direct action plan has a one million solar roofs policy, which includes rebates for the installation of solar hot water systems. The coalition is committed to a stable and secure future for companies like Rheem Australia that need a certain operating environment so that they can invest in their local communities and create jobs for manufacturing workers. Just like the medicines manufacturers hurt by the deferral of PBS listings in contravention of the memorandum of understanding and the cattle exporters punished by the suspension of trade after a Four Corners episode, the solar hot water industry has learnt the hard way that this government cannot be trusted and only the coalition can provide the hope, reward and opportunity for successful business and job creation. I commend this bill to the House. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (21:05): It was no surprise to me, when I had a look at the speaking list for this private member's bill, the Solar Hot Water Rebate Bill 2012 [No. 2], that there was only one speaker from the opposition side on the list from the great state of New South Wales. That is because all of the MPs from the great state of New South Wales are, rightfully, too ashamed to stick their heads up on this matter, in view of what their coalition partners, the O'Farrell government, did with the Solar Bonus Scheme when it closed the scheme on 13 May last year. They know that if they stick their heads up on this matter they leave themselves open to the charge of hypocrisy in championing and advocating in favour of the private member's bill brought to us by the opposition spokesperson today. Clearly, the member for Bennelong is more impervious to those claims than the rest of his parliamentary colleagues. We on this side of the House are committed to increasing the take-up of solar hot water systems and other mechanisms which will enable households to reduce the amount of money they are spending and the amount of energy they are expending on hot water heating and consumption. The reason we are committed to that is that 25 per cent energy consumption goes to making the water hot and keeping it hot. Solar hot water and other similar mechanisms can lead to energy savings to those households of somewhere between 50 and 90 per cent. It is for these reasons that, between 2007 and 2012, through the scheme that the members opposite are trying to reopen, around a quarter of a million households installed solar hot water systems and the like at a cost of around $320 million. We do have options available to us. One of those is the option that is proposed by opposition spokesperson. On my rough figures, their one million homes policy, at a cost of around $1,000 per unit, is a billiondollar program. That adds to the $70 billion in unfunded promises they have already made over the course of the last 18 months, so I guess we are up to $71 billion. There are two reasons why we should reject this policy proposal. The first is this: it is indiscriminate-it is not means tested. What that means, in effect, is that taxpayers, particularly poor taxpayers, are being asked to subsidise the energy savings and solar hot water systems of more wealthy people. If you want visual proof of this, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, I ask you to get in your car and go for a drive around your electorate or the neighbouring electorates, and just count the number of solar hot water systems that you will find in the housing commission suburbs or the low SES suburbs within your electorate and then see the number of solar hot water systems in the more wealthy parts of your electorate. I know that, in my electorate, there is no comparison. There is a lot of shining glass on the roofs of the wealthier parts of my electorate. Many of those newly installed units were paid for as a result of the subsidised system. That is one reason why you might question the proposition put up by the shadow of total household spokesperson. The second reason is that it is not necessary. There is a very good reason why it is not necessary. If you wanted to replace electric hot water systems with more efficient energy usage options, there are a number of propositions that you could put into place. The first is: you put in place regulations which phased out the use of electric hot water systems. And, indeed, that is exactly what is happening, because in December 2010 all states and territories, with the exception of the Tasmanian government, the signed up to a pact to phase out the use of electric hot water systems over the next 10 years, and that means that what we are effectively doing here is creating a market for alternative products. So, if you are really concerned about replacing electric hot water systems with more energy-favourable options, you would phase them out-and that is exactly what is being done. The second thing you might do is to keep in place the renewable energy targets, which provide around $1,000 for Small-scale Technology Certificates per unit. That is being continued as well. The third thing you might do is to put in place a clear price signal about the need to shift to a low carbon future, and we are doing that. So this proposition is a one-billion-dollar boondoggle-it is unnecessary. (Time expired)",185
257,Ms GAMBARO,BILLS," I rise to support the Solar Hot Water Rebate Bill 2012 [No. 2], introduced into this House by the honourable member for Flinders. The bill has as its premise the following. On 28 February, as trade was shutting down for the day, the government suddenly scrapped the $1,000 solar hot water rebate. Businesses and homeowners were given no prior notice of the closure of the program and homeowners only had a few short hours to submit their application in order to remain eligible. The result of this rash behaviour was to inject uncertainty into the lives of many workers, contractors and businesses. As my colleagues have mentioned throughout this debate, the Clean Energy Council predicted 1,200 manufacturing jobs and 6,000 installation, sales administration jobs would be at risk because of the Gillard government's incompetence. These types of actions by the government, however, seem very familiar, as the axing of this rebate is a repeat of the damaging sudden closure of the Solar Homes and Communities Plan in 2009 by the then minister, Peter Garrett. And we all remember the bungled Home Insulation Program which, unfortunately, led compromising of workers' safety, houses being burnt down and the wasting of many, many millions of taxpayers' money to fix the mess. And in my electorate of Brisbane we are still fixing the mess. This private member's bill by the shadow minister seeks to ensure certainty in the industry by requiring that the government spend the entire amount originally budgeted for the solar hot water rebate. This proactive action seeks to ensure that businesses could continue to operate as they had originally planned and that homeowners have a fairer chance to access the rebate. This demonstrates a marked contrast between an opposition concerned about the effects of government policy on business and a government which seems to lurch from one crisis to another. True to form, they voted against bringing the private member's bill forward for a vote in March prior to the 2012 budget. The government originally claimed that it had terminated the solar hot water rebate early because the program was oversubscribed-and we have heard a number of their speakers talk about thatand they anticipated that the funding would be fully expended before its scheduled conclusion. The government and their coalition partners the Greens then promised that the full funding originally allocated for the solar hot water rebate would be retained. And, as referred to by my colleagues, the and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mark Dreyfus, gave a written assurance to the Greens, to Senator Milne, on 21 March 2012, and it states: 'As discussed with you, the government never intended to make any savings from the closure of this program and remains committed to supporting the transition to a clean energy future which includes the solar hot water industry. The funding allocated for to the this program remains in the forward estimates.' Well, that was a good promise! But, as this year's budget papers clearly show, this is simply untrue. It is a broken promise, and these figures directly contradict the government's supposed justification for scrapping the scheme because it had run out of money. Either there has been complete incompetence in the management of the scheme, or the government is not being honest with the Australian people and has been willing to sacrifice the solar hot water industry to prop up its own budget. The government's own program guidelines did not mention a closure date for the rebate, contrary to the government's claim that it always intended to shut this scheme on 30 June this year. What is even more galling about this decision is that the government is introducing the world's biggest carbon tax on the Australian economy which, as we all know, is going to flow through to and hurt every single Australian. So the government cuts a worthwhile program, at five minutes to midnight, that actually had the effect of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, yet introduces an economy-wide carbon tax that will destroy jobs, will destroy growth and will drive emissions overseas. Nothing better demonstrates this government's delusion and lack of priority than these decisions. This is a very proactive, responsible and considerate bill by the member for Flinders, and it is designed to repair the damage and restore the confidence that this government has shattered. I commend the bill to the House.",188
258,Ms GRIERSON,BILLS," I rise to oppose the member for Flinders private member's bill, which calls on the government to reinstate the solar hot water scheme and appropriate the remaining portion of the 2011-2012 allocation-just another back-to-the-future proposal from a rather sad opposition. It is just a little pathetic to see the member for Flinders put this private member's bill forward, given that we have seen no policies to explain how the opposition intends to reduce emissions or meet the agreed renewable energy target. We have no details, costings or specific policies from the opposition, but apparently the $63.5 million in this bill is going to do a lot of heavy lifting. I do not think so. I think this is yet another attempt by the opposition to just harp and carp and oppose whatever the government does, without having a framework of policies for members like the member for Flinders to champion or advocate. It is pathetic, and he must find that quite difficult. This bill is put forward by the same person who in 1990 co-authored that award-winning thesis entitled A Tax to Make the Polluter Pay, which stated: … we have argued that the current regulatory regime for controlling industrial pollution is grievously flawed and should be replaced by a market based waste management system. The key component of this new regime should be the introduction of a pollution tax. He did say that and, of course, we did do that, because that is exactly what works best. And we agree that we should have a market based scheme that makes the big polluters pay. It is called the clean energy future package, and it is legislated now. If this bill before the House is some feeble attempt to make the federal Labor government look like it does not support the renewable energy industry then it will not work. We are the party that legislated a price on carbon, delivering a wide range of incentives to renewable industries and households to move towards a cleaner and less emissions-intensive economy. Our package provides the certainty that the renewable energy sector needs to plan their future products, marketing, research and development, and other successful business tools to allow them to get on with building a dynamic and relevant renewable energy industry. The industry knew this scheme was winding up and the opposition knew that this scheme was winding up, but typically they choose to mislead the public rather than tell the truth. Yes, the program was begun by John Howard in 2007, to be funded until 30 June 2012. On 28 February this year we announced that the solar hot water rebate scheme would end on 30 June 2012. People of course were still eligible to claim that rebate up to the end of that financial year, but you do try to confine expenditure to the budget year, and that is exactly what we did. The closure of the scheme in any other way would have been irresponsible. It would have encouraged that haste and that lastminute rush that would have certainly put a lot of pressure on that industry as well, and we do not do things that way. Certainly the scheme was successful. It offered rebates of $1,000 for solar hot-water systems and rebates of $600 on heat-pump systems. We did stick to that scheme and we never scrapped any of that policy. It assisted 250,000 installations, 25,000 more than the coalition government had promised, at a cost of over $320 million. This scheme gave the industry clear support for a designated period-and that is exactly what it was, a designated period-to build the business model and the approach that matched the current technology and demand. But technologies move on, and so this government has moved toward a clean energy future-one that will reduce emissions and will meet our renewable energy targets. By putting a price on carbon pollution we have created an incentive for households to install more energy-efficient systems and purchase more energy-efficient appliances. We have provided the market mechanisms to make the big polluters make different investment and energy choices-ones that will lead to more efficient use of energy-so they can continue to competitively provide products and services to both the domestic and international markets. The federal Labor government has provided more support to renewables than any government in Australian history, and we will continue to do so. From July 1, the solar hot-water industry will receive support in four ways: pricing carbon will create a stable, long-term market; the Low Carbon Communities program will provide $330 million to local councils, communities and disadvantaged low-income families to improve their energy efficiency; the $800 million Clean Technology Investment Program will give the solar hot-water industry an incentive to retool and modernise the manufacture of solar units; and towards 2020, through the renewable energy target, consumers can be offered up to $1,000 discount in small technology packages. At my local level, I am pleased to say that over the Hunter Business Chamber was awarded $1.2 million to help small and medium business implement the Energy Hunter-Our Clean Energy Future program. (Time expired) Debate adjourned. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Stillbirths",189
259,Ms BURKE,BILLS," I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) under current State and Territory legislation, a coroner does not have the statutory and judicial authority to investigate stillbirths, nor does the legislation (except in Queensland) indicate that coronial jurisdiction extends to stillbirths; and (b) there are discrepancies amongst State and Territory legislation over the definition of 'person' and 'death'; (2) recognises that: (a) approximately one per cent of babies born every year in Australia are stillborn (cited from a SA stillbirth report); and (b) for many parents, the need to understand the cause of death and further prevent other incidences occurring in the future is important; and (3) calls on the Government to: (a) adopt policies and protocols that are consistent amongst the States and Territories and which specifically outline the circumstances in which a stillbirth should be investigated by a coroner; and (b) adopt policies which: (i) provide clear and consistent definitions of 'person', 'death' and 'stillbirth', and extend this to other relevant legislation such as the births, deaths and marriages Acts; (ii) promote the need and development of perinatal specialists in investigations as has been recommended by independent groups such as the Australian and New Zealand Stillbirth Alliance, Perinatal Mortality Group, and Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand; (iii) offer parents the opportunity to have a full and timely assessment of the factors relating to their baby's death, whilst still respecting their rights; (iv) allow for public coronial inquiry to assist in identifying clinically important lessons from the death and contribute to research on the topic of stillbirths and early infant death; and (v) enhance provisions that provide support and appropriate care for parents. There is no doubt that the death of a stillborn baby is a tragic event. Recognising this, I believe we must do more to support families confronted by stillbirth, and endeavour to learn more about circumstances where these deaths could be prevented. As a mother, I have had the privilege of bringing two beautiful children into the world. The birth of each of my children was an incredible experience-holding them for the first time, taking them home, introducing them to families and friends, and making sure that they were going to survive and thrive under my and my husband's guidance. For thousands of Australian parents each year, this experience is completely different. Stillbirths are a tragic reality for parents all around the world. I could not sympathise more with these parents who, instead of celebrating the joyous arrival of a child, are left to mourn them, often without knowing why their babies died. Approximately one per cent of babies born every year in Australia are stillborn. Tragically, despite improvements in medical practice and technology, the number of stillbirths-more than 2,000-has not changed since the 1980s. Currently, there are discrepancies in state and territory legislation over the definition of 'a person' and 'death' that prevent coroners from investigating any deaths of stillborn babies, but for thousands of families in Australia who go through the ordeal of a stillbirth there is no doubt that the baby was a person whose death mattered. I have had the privilege of meeting a constituent, Caroline Sugden, who has had this tragic experience, and she shared with me the tragedy of the stillbirth of her daughter. Luckily, Caroline and her partner have gone on to have two healthy children, but that was a big step. Would it happen again? Why did it happen? There were all these unanswered questions. Understandably, the loss of their daughter had a massive impact-not just on their lives but on the lives of their families and friends. This is something that was meant to end in a beautiful outcome, not a tragedy. Their grief was compounded by not knowing why their baby died. Without answers they felt left in the dark, and the advice given to them by medical staff directly after their baby's death undervalued the benefit of an autopsy in providing them with a cause of death. No formal investigation into the death of their baby was made. Caroline and her family pursued an independent investigation into their baby's death, but by this time the placenta had been left in a bucket in a hospital fridge for nine days, unpreserved, instead of being sent for testing. Sadly, the Sugden experience is not isolated or uncommon. Many parents of stillborn children have experienced such things. There was an inquiry conducted within the SA parliament and many expressed a similar experience-the uncertainty, the unknown, the equivocal medical advice, the tragedy. The simple answer kept being given to them: 'Go away. Forget about it. Move on.' That is not what a lot of parents want. They want some answers if they can find them. No parent can be fully prepared to deal with a tragedy such as this. We need to ensure that parents are being given full and timely information, that their wishes are respected, and that they are supported in deciding what course of action to pursue in coming to terms with a stillbirth. Adopting clear and consistent definitions of 'birth', 'person', 'death' and 'stillbirth' is needed to ensure that the rights of babies are upheld across the whole of Australia. Ensuring that parents are sufficiently informed of their options and that they are offered the opportunity for a full and timely assessment of the factors relating to their baby's death is an essential part of helping them cope with their loss and may provide answers that avoid a repeated occurrence with future pregnancies. Allowing for public coronial inquiries into stillbirths would give us the opportunity to identify clinically important lessons from these deaths and would contribute to research on the topic of stillbirth and early infant death, potentially reducing the numbers of stillbirths occurring each year. There are several individuals and groups from within my electorate that have contacted me concerned with extending jurisdictions for stillbirth and improving support for parents. I wish to thank all those who have been advocating on behalf of these families and on behalf of the children who did not survive. As a government I believe that we have a responsibility to ensure that inexplicable, unexpected deaths are investigated to determine why they occurred and potentially learn how these deaths can be avoided. As mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and people in the Australian community, we have a responsibility to ensure that families affected by the death of a stillborn baby are offered adequate support to assist them through this difficult time. Parents of a stillborn baby must remain central in determining how and when autopsies and coronial investigations are undertaken. We need to respect the wishes of families who do not want investigations but we also need to respect the wishes of those who want to be fully informed. The families should be given that choice. This motion has come out of the dedicated efforts of those advocating on behalf of families who have been through a stillbirth. Many of these have experienced the loss of a stillbirth themselves whilst others have been urged to act after watching family members suffer. It is necessary for our future mothers, who want to know that everything possible has been done to prevent more stillbirths in the future. It will be welcomed by parents who have been telling us how the current system let them down. We need to provide a system which will do more to support parents in this hour of tragedy.",190
260,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," I second the motion. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this motion by the member for Chisholm and support the sentiment driving it. In the week after the budget I had occasion to interview a young mother who came to me with her 14-month-old daughter who was severely afflicted with shaken baby syndrome. The condition was as a result of abuse by the father of the baby, with whom the mother was formerly living in a de facto relationship. Both the mother and the grandmother, who came with her, wanted me to help them get an awareness program running, which I will most certainly assist with. The point I am making is that the anguish in the mothers' eyes and the deep emotion of maternal instincts driving both mothers was unmistaken. Some years ago, I put a motion to the House seeking the establishment of a national day to commemorate infant loss at birth or stillbirth. That day has been recognised officially by the New South Wales government and other administrations here in Australia and overseas, but not by our federal government, which is a shame. On that occasion, the advocate who approached me, Nicole Ballinger, was ardent in her compassion. I still think 15 October needs to be adopted nationally, and I urge the government to reconsider doing so. The death of a young child is devastating to the family, especially the mother. Many never get over the event, and many seek meaning as to why their infant child was taken away from them. They want emotional closure and they want to honour the memory of the child. It is one thing to lose a child through natural means but quite another to lose a child through violence, abuse or neglect. Many parents blame themselves, seeing themselves as failures for not protecting their child. This is quite unjust and can impose severe but unnecessary burdens for them to carry throughout their lives. It is quite understandable that the two mothers I am talking about are driven by the need to see that the despair is not visited on others. There is no doubt that parents afflicted by the burden of the unexpected death of an infant child undergo a change to their personality. Many never get over it, such is the depth of their grief. And of course there are myriads of parents whose suffering lies somewhere in between. I know the government has a role to play in assisting parents suffering from this post traumatic stress by introducing policies enunciated in the context of this motion. I applaud the member for Chisholm on her initiative. This is a matter that traverses all politics. It is an issue absolutely out of humanity and compassion, and we elected to this parliament are best placed to make good things happen. This motion speaks particularly to the issue of 'stillbirths' and the statutory definition of 'person' and 'death', which vary from one jurisdiction to another. Under current laws, state coroners do not have the necessary authority to investigate such deaths. This authority must be given them, from both moral and practical perspectives. There needs to be a uniformity of approach across the jurisdictional landscape. It is the sensible thing to do and obviously the need to do so has been clearly demonstrated. This motion seeks to adopt such policies. I would much rather approach this from the perspective of developing policies that fit the bill rather than adopting those that now exist unconditionally. After all, each jurisdiction developed a policy in keeping with its own needs and experiences. We need to be certain that whatever policy is adopted has been thoroughly assessed as appropriate to the needs and circumstances, as well as the expectations, of a 21st-century society. A national infant loss remembrance day would be one such policy. Debate interrupted. NA",192
261,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9:30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Carbon Pricing",194
262,Mr SCHULTZ,ADJOURNMENT," A few months back I raised the issue of the impact that the impending carbon tax would have on businesses in terms of the rise in electricity costs. That was pooh-poohed in this House by the government. Last Friday a constituent came in who was a principal of a solar and electrical business, a small business owner, who employed five people up until December of last year. In July-August of last year that business was thriving and then the phones suddenly stopped ringing. He had at that time enough work programmed from June until the end of November to keep himself and his five employees going. Come December, however, he had to lay off the five staff. His business is very diverse and they cater for domestic, rural and industrial needs. He described the general public as frightened and not spending. This experience is shared by many contractors right across the district with whom he has frequent conversations. There are small jobs that come through, but not much substantial development is being undertaken. People are scared. Once the phones stopped ringing for his own business, and once he had laid off his staff, he went Orange for work. He worked for four months with a firm called Gozcon Electrical until he was laid off. Gozcon had about 30 staff and had intermittent contracts with Cadia Valley Operations. He also learnt of another contractor with Cadia Valley Operations who had to lay off 400-plus employees. He is repulsed by this whole business, particularly the implications of him having to lay off five employees in the small community he lives in, which happens to be Cowra. There are further implications for the community once businesses like Sarah Jane Furniture, which I raised a few months ago, have a number of lay-offs. I understand that, if the increase in electricity costs are as great as they anticipate them to be, they will be looking at more lay-offs. He is happy for me to pass on details to the House. In terms of his finances, last financial year his business's turnover was $2.2 million. The year before that it was $1.6 million. This financial year it will be lucky to have a $500,000 turnover. He tells me that from a family perspective they are getting by, but things are really starting to stretch as the months drag on. I read an article in the Cowra Guardian on 9 May about how businesses will have to pass on carbon costs. It stated that the director of Cowra Meat Processors said that he: … will pay up to $120 000 a year more for energy when the carbon tax comes into effect. That is quite obvious, because they use a lot of power 24/7 running a lot of refrigerators and freezers. He said that there is nothing you can do about the increased costs and said: We've already spent a lot of money putting [in] more efficient refrigeration to use less power, but that hasn't done us any good because power is going through the roof anyway. to In that same article, the secretary manager of the Cowra Services Club said: … based on a 17.6 per cent energy price increase the business' electricity bill could grow by $45 000 per year. It just goes on and on. It is a direct illustration of the point I made when I raised the issue of Sarah Jane Furniture, a manufacturer in Cowra that employs over 130 Australians. That company estimates that there will be an increase in its weekly power bill from $13,000 to $21,000. When I raised this in a question in the House to the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister questioned the veracity of that figure. I instructed my constituent to get in touch with the department to get the department to tell him where his calculations had gone wrong, but the department was unable to do so. The department did not even know its own calculation process for the introduced carbon tax. I raise these events today to illustrate to the House that this has not stopped. It is only the beginning and it is going to get worse, and there are going to be more people out of work, not only in my electorate but right across the country. Coral Sea Marine Reserve Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (21:35): I take this opportunity to urge environment minister Burke to include the Osprey Reef and the Shark Reef as protected areas in the proposed Coral Sea marine park. A fortnight ago a number of us in parliament were fortunate enough to hear an inspiring address from the author Tim Winton about the importance of marine parks. It reinforced my view that this is an opportunity for us as a parliament to do great things that future generations will be rightly proud of. I particularly want to make the case for action in the Coral Sea and for protection of the Osprey and Shark reefs. As the Protect our Coral Sea coalition has pointed out, oceans cover almost three-quarters of the earth's surface and contain most of the planet's biodiversity. But the oceans are in deep trouble. Up to 90 per cent of the largest fish species have been lost over the past 50 years due to overfishing. Roughly two-thirds of the world's coral reefs are damaged or threatened and about one-quarter have been destroyed. Protecting the last remaining special places before it is too late is critical. Marine parks will help ensure ocean health for generations to come. Australia's Coral Sea is one of the last places on earth where ocean giants such as sharks, tuna and marlin still abound, but less than one per cent of the Coral Sea is permanently protected from fishing, oil and gas exploration and seabed mining. Individual reefs of the Coral Sea are exceptionally distinctive. The Coral Sea is like a miniature version of the South Pacific where distances separating reefs make South Pacific reefs individually distinctive. Osprey Reef is a large atoll rising 2,000 to 3,000 metres from the sea floor on its western side. It covers an area of 348,000 square kilometres, including a large central lagoon. Its spectacular large pelagic marine life, massive reef walls and plunging drop-offs are highly prized by recreational divers. I am told that it is the most iconic dive location in the Coral Sea and one of the most spectacular dive sites in the world. Osprey attracts numerous pelagic fish, such as barracudas, giant trevallies, mackerel, rainbow runners and dog-tooth tuna. Large reef fish such as potato cods and the humphead Maori wrasse are also found here; so too is the nautilus, a living fossil thought to be between one million and five million years old. Osprey Reef also boasts an extraordinary diversity of soft corals and gorgonian sea fans. One scientist has referred to this as soft-coral heaven. Research has uncovered coralline spongers, which are also considered living fossils, in the shallow caves of Osprey Reef. Due to their rarity and cryptic habitat, species of coralline spongers in different regions have become genetically distinct. Shark Reef covers 92 square kilometres and is located around 15 kilometres from Osprey Reef's southern tip, Rapid Horn. A recent survey of Osprey Reef and Shark Reef has revealed species from both deep and shallow habitats, such as rock sponges, glass sponges, brachiopods and sea lilies, that are new to science. The Coral Sea serves as a system of stepping stones for species to move from the Western Pacific to the Great Barrier Reef. It is an important migratory route for many species, such as sea turtles and oceanic sharks, riding on the great ocean currents from the north-west. The Coral Sea is a haven for endangered species: 62 threatened and protected species listed under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and 341 bird and animal species included on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species are present. The government's draft plans for the Coral Sea released in November last year proposed many good things to protect the Coral Sea from oil and gas mining and trawling and longline fishing, and I strongly support these proposals. But the number of reefs to be protected from the impact of commercial and recreational fishing by being included in the marine park is small, and I would like to see it bolstered. I am told that there were over 480,000 submissions advocating increased protection for the Coral Sea-an incredible number. I conclude by paraphrasing Tim Winton, who always says things more eloquently than the rest of us do, as follows. This is a genuine legacy moment. When your grand kids ask you what you did as a member of parliament, tax reform might do it, or that parliamentary committee; but to get that rare moment when a little kid looks up at you with a flicker of interest or even a moment admiration, my money is on the dolphins and the marine parks. Hasluck Leadership Awards",194
263,Mr WYATT,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to talk about the Hasluck Leadership Awards, which are in their second year. The Hasluck Leadership Awards, named in honour of two renowned Western Australians, Sir Paul Hasluck and Dame Alexandra Hasluck, will again be a vehicle for inspiring and developing the leadership potential of young people. The awards are intended to continue into the future irrespective of the political persuasion of the sitting member. The Hasluck Leadership Awards are open to all year 11 high school students in the electorate. The awards provide a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for students who demonstrate exceptional leadership qualities to travel to Canberra, tread the corridors of power and experience life in the heart of Australian politics. To enter, students must intend to complete their year 12 studies in a high school in Hasluck and demonstrate to the panel their high-level involvement in their school through their participation in the school's nonacademic activities. This may be demonstrated through their involvement with school or student councils, sporting groups and clubs or other voluntary activities. The panel also want to see how they perform outside their schools and that through their activities they demonstrate care and respect for others, involvement with voluntary work within the community or active membership of a community group or organisation. Last year Joanne Pryce and Joshua Bretnall were the recipients of the 2011 Hasluck Leadership Awards, and they travelled to Canberra with me in August. They described the experience of visiting the capital and meeting with our nation's leaders of as 'life-changing' and 'a learning experience second to none'. Joanne and Josh have started year 12 and are looking forward to actively becoming involved in their local school community and with national issues. For the 2012 awards I made a couple of small changes to improve on the process and running of the awards. The first was that each school could nominate two studentsone boy and one girl-and, in the case of private schools with all boys or all girls, could nominate two students as well. This increased the pool of nominees and gave more students the opportunity to take part in the awards. All the nominees will participate in a workshop on Saturday, 9 June where three independent judges will evaluate their presentations and the nominees will answer a few questions and give a two-minute impromptu speech. The winners, one boy and one girl, will be announced on Friday, 15 June at the Agonis centre in Gosnells at 5 pm. The finalists in the 2012 Hasluck Leadership Awards are: from Governor Stirling Senior High School, Nicholas Williams; from Guildford Grammar School, Mitchell Papas; from Guildford Grammar School, Jackson Passeri; from Kalamunda Senior High School, Bill Todd; from La Salle College, David Vella; from Lesmurdie Senior High School, Jordan Fraser; from Lumen Christi College, Luke Hale; from Southern River College, Matthew Capper; from Thornlie Senior High School, Lachlan MCDonald; from Kalamunda Senior High School, Sarah Hopkins; from La Salle College, Chloe Placzek, from Senior High School, Rachael Honey; from Lumen Christi College, Kaylish Menzie; from Southern River College, Shani Preedy; from St Brigid's College, Amy Thomasson; and, from St Brigid's College, Caitlin Grehan. These young people, irrespective of whether they win an award or not, are the bright future of this country. Too often we only hear the negative stories about youth and do not get to listen to the positive voices that are drowned out amongst the negative news reports featuring young Australians. It would not be possible to achieve the aims of any program such as this without corporate sponsorship. I acknowledge the companies who acted as sponsors, as they they allow me to realise the goal of recognising our next generation of leaders in the community. Once again I am pleased to announce that Qantas is a major sponsor along with David Goode from Westate Finance, the Pilbara Access Group, the Damien Cole Group, BGC Australia, the Swan Chamber of Commerce, Westrac and the Echo newspaper. Sponsorship is critical if we are to deliver programs such as this to the community, and I thank each organisation for taking the time and effort to participate in the Hasluck Leadership Awards in 2012. I look forward to updating the House in the near future about the results of the awards evening and recognising the year 11 boy and girl who have won the 2012 Hasluck Leadership Awards. It provides an incredible opportunity to acknowledge and encourage young people to look at the contribution that they can make to both their school and the community in which they live and play. In that sense, regardless of who is the occupant of the seat of Hasluck, I hope in the future to see that the sponsors will take on the role along with other designated groups to foster the qualities that are evident in young people. This will give them that encouragement. (Time expired) Fraser Electorate: Volunteering",196
264,Dr LEIGH,ADJOURNMENT," Over recent decades, Australians have lost social capital. We are less likely to be civically engaged in our communities; we are more disconnected than we once were. But this does not change the fact that there are many great volunteers in Australia, and no part of the country is more likely to volunteer than here in the ACT. Tonight I want to share with the House three stories of volunteering in the ACT worth celebrating. Last week I attended the 2012 ACT Volunteer of the Year Awards. Across a wide range of awards the contribution that volunteers make to our community and our economy was recognised. The 2012 ACT Volunteer of the Year was Dr Mary Webb. Nominated by Multiple Sclerosis Ltd, Mary has provided volunteer service to those people in the Canberra community with MS. Over the years, she has also made a valuable contribution through her service to various advisory bodies. This year Volunteering ACT introduced new awards for Volunteer Teams of the Year across the various categories. This year's ACT Volunteer Team of the Year was the Adult Migrant English Program Home Tutor Scheme. The team has up to 150 volunteers to assist people from different cultures and widely different levels of English literacy skills. Other individual award recipients included David Hutchinson, Max Kimber, Hazel Giesecke, David Williams, Gordon MCLoughlin and Frank Brown. Others team awards went to the St Vincent de Paul Night Patrol Team, the Stanford Course Peer Leaders and the YMCA of Canberra Runners Club Committee. In addition to those, several other people and teams were highly commended for their work with the community, including Dot Mills, Neville Tomkins, Geraldine O'Connor, Di Evans, the Talking Newspaper Service Cooma and Narooma, ANU Volunteers and the Pegasus Hippotherapy Team. Finally, I would like to thank Maureen Cane and Rikki Blacka from Volunteering ACT for their efforts in coordinating this important event. Parkland volunteers are essential in the Bush Capital, and earlier this year I had the pleasure of joining Chris Bourke MLA to launch the Frost Hollow to Forest Walk for the Friends of Aranda Bushland. Taking their modest Caring for our Country grant, the Friends of Aranda Bushland, particularly Peter Ormay and Jean Geue, partnered with Aranda Primary School and ACT parks and conservation to build the project. The many volunteers who make up the Friends of Aranda Bushland deserve thanks for their significant contribution to the project. Thanks to them, Canberra now has a selfguided walk for locals and visitors to enjoy. The walk has preserves and provides access to the unique treeless grasslands and the remnant snow and yellow box-red gum woodlands in the Aranda bushland forest. There are many other parkland volunteers doing terrific work through the Canberra community. Another area in which volunteers are contributing to the community is in sporting circles. In my time as the member for Fraser I have had the pleasure of being a part of the Local Sporting Champions grants. Local Sporting Champions assists young athletes aged 12 to 18 with the costs of competing at state, national or international competition. Often, huge amounts of volunteer time are involved, from parents and sporting club officials. Local Sporting Champions grants provide a modest amount of assistance to students who are engaged in sporting activities. Over the past 18 months, assisted by sportspeople like Raider Bronson Harrison, swimmer Sally Foster, soccer player Sally Shipard and Canberra social entrepreneur Michael Pilbrow, I have awarded Local Sporting Champions grants to individuals and sporting clubs in my electorate. Recipients of a Local Sporting Champions grant over the past year include Jack Connell, Melissa Leary, Kenyah Lawler, Renee Polyak, Nicholas Tanner, William Pulley, Maris Colton, Andrew Meyer-Coyte, Jayden Sawyer, Reilly Shaw, Stuart Grey, Danusia Sipa Borgeaud, Anthony Joe, Nathan Cawley, Luke Sarris, Luke Letcher, ACT Badminton and Rowing ACT. Last week I held an afternoon tea in my electorate office for Local Sporting Champions recipients, where the soccer star Grace Gill talked about the joys and challenges of elite sport. Volunteers are our unsung heroes. They give up their free time to deliver services, lend a helping hand and to build a stronger community. I want to thank those volunteers I have spoken of tonight and all those across the ACT and Australia for their contribution and their dedication. Our community is richer for it. State of Origin Rugby League Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (21:50): I rise in this chamber in the most important week we will see here in a long time. It is week where we will see the first of three State of Origin games, which will surely result in Queensland winning the Harvey Norman trophy for a record seventh time in a row. I grew up in the small border town of Texas. From year 7 we had the kids from Yetman come from across the border to continue their education. Things would be great except when the annual state rugby league games would be played. I would see great Queensland players such as John Brass, Rod Reddy, Johnny Lang, Rod Morris and Kerry Boustead, to name but a few, line up against the sky blue jumper of the likes of Bruce Astill, Ian Thinee, Norm Carr and Tony Obst each and every year. Brisbane had a great competition, but it was a feeder competition for the Sydney clubs. Every year we would cop it from the New South Wales kids as we saw more and more Queenslanders play for New South Wales. Come 1980 and that great visionary for Queensland rugby league, Labor senator Ron MCAuliffe, finally got the State of Origin going. We won the game with Chris Close scoring two tries and running around Graham Eadie like he was not even there, and Mal Meninga kicking the leather off the ball with a flawless display. It was also Wally Lewis's debut at that level. The great Norm Carr was supposed to play that night, but he played for Wests and Souths into Brisbane. He would have been the starting lock but for injury. Such is life. But that was not what the game was all about. The game was about the great Arthur Beetson. He was playing reserve grade for Parramatta but led Queensland out that night. It was the great Arthur Beetson who showed what State of Origin was to become when he belted good friend and Parramatta team mate Mick Cronin. Time and again Beetson ripped the into the New South Wales pack and showed the way for the young Queenslanders. If not for Arthur Beetson the State of Origin would not have properly succeeded. He had to convince all of us who had copped a lifetime of disappointment what it truly meant to the players to pull on a maroon jersey-to bleed for your state and for your mates. New South Wales will never have what we have as Queenslanders because they have never had to endure the years of being treated as second-rate. That is what State of Origin is all about. I would also like to have a go at this House on behalf of Arthur Beetson and Rugby League. Arthur Beetson was born in Roma on 22 January 1945 and died on 1 December 2011. He was the first Aboriginal to ever captain any national team when he captained the Australian Rugby League team. He played for Redcliffe in the Brisbane competition, Balmain, Easts and Parramatta in the Sydney competition. He completed the circle when he returned to Queensland as captain and coach of Redcliffe. He revolutionised front row play after moving from the centres. Every player who has played for Queensland idolised this man. They hung on his every word. He taught them how to switch on and off. He taught them that rugby league is a game first, an opportunity and an honour second, and a war for just 80 minutes. He was a great believer that in what happens on the field stays on the field. He gave as good as he got. Everyone who followed sport loved Big Artie. Arthur Beetson played for New South Wales, Queensland, and Australia. He coached Queensland and Australia. He has been a talent scout and an advocate for players and their families. But more than that Arthur Beetson was an advocate for Aboriginal people. He stood up and was proud of who and what he was. He never played the race card but he knew what racism was and he fought it in his own way. That this House did not honour Arthur Beetson's passing is a travesty. That this House did not move a condolence motion in his honour will be forever one of the saddest days in this place. That this House did not do this and yet the British parliament did is even more embarrassing. As a parliament we should all hang our heads in shame. The thing is that Arthur Beetson would not have wanted it anyway. That is what a champion is all about. This man accomplished everything in the game as a player, coach, selector, scout, mentor and friend. He is one of the game's official immortals. But more than that, he was a great man and human being. When the mighty maroons run out in Melbourne on Wednesday night, they will carry Arthur Beetson with them. He is our heritage. He is Queensland. He is rugby league north, south, east, and west of the border. If Arthur Beetson was head of government business in this place, we would not be sitting during the weeks of State of Origin. Last year we sat during all three State of Origin weeks and during the Melbourne Cup. If Arthur Beetson were here, he would be wondering whether we would be coming back to sit in a special session on Boxing Day. It is un-Australian and Arthur Beetson would not have it. Vale Arthur Beetson-and go the Maroons. La Trobe Electorate: Education Week",197
265,Ms SMYTH,ADJOURNMENT," How to follow that? I am pleased this evening to mention to the House that it is Education Week in Victoria this week. It was great to be out at St Mark's in Emerald on the weekend with a group of people who were there substantially for the purposes of commending local teachers and reflecting on the work that they do, so I was very pleased to go along to that. I am less pleased to update the House that the fact that it is Education Week in Victoria seems to have escaped a notable part of the Victorian community, namely the Victorian government. Apparently Ted Baillieu missed that memo. Despite the fact that it is Education Week, we find that one of the largest providers of education, particularly to people from lower socio-economic and disadvantaged backgrounds in the south-eastern region, is going to face very significant budget cuts as a result of the Victorian government's decision to slash funding for TAFE. Indeed, the outlook for Chisholm TAFE, which has a campus in my electorate in Berwick, is looking very grim indeed. Earlier last week, the CEO advised a range of us who were there for a community cabinet in my seat of La Trobe that they were expecting losses of between $20 million and $30 million. They have estimated that around $25.5 million, nearly a third of its government funding, will be lost on top of $4 million in funding already lost as a result of decisions of the state government last October. So this is fairly troubling news, particularly in Education Week when we are supposed to be reflecting on ways in which education can transform not only individuals but whole societies and certainly our society. At the same time, I am pleased to advise the House about some of the more positive aspects of education, particularly in my electorate. I mentioned that I was at a community cabinet last week, and I would like to pay tribute to the staff, students and parents at Timbarra College, with particular thanks to principal Jan Adamson. I know they took great pride in hosting the event last week. They not only hosted it but their students provided entertainment and hospitality. They certainly looked after us and were very much involved in the evening. It is a credit to them that they did that in what was a busy week, for a variety of reasons, for them. I was also very pleased to go out to the Basin Primary School last week for the opening of their new multipurpose building. It is a school that is 132 years old this year. was established in 1880 and I was very pleased to be there with staff, students, principal Graham Russell and the school council president Graham MCLauchlan to open officially the new building, which is a $2 million new classroom and multipurpose centre, and also to recognise the $125,000 commitment for refurbishment of existing buildings at what is one of the most long standing schools in my electorate. I was also very pleased to head out to Beaconhills College on Thursday to open a new technology centre at the Berwick campus. The federal government committed around $750,000 to that. It will enable the college to deliver subjects in product design, systems engineering and fashion and textiles. The centre will enable students to produce materials of an industrial standard, so it really is a centre of excellence. My congratulations go to them, particularly to those who had the vision and foresight to develop not only a plan for the technology centre but a master plan for the campus. Congratulations to principal Tony Sheumack. I was also out at another of their campuses earlier in the year where the federal government also made a substantial commitment to a new building under its capital grants program. The building is effectively a new wing for the junior school. It is a credit to them that they have managed all of that work in tandem with the very busy schedule that schools inevitably have. In the short time available to me I would like to congratulate Macclesfield Primary School, which I visited during last week, and principal John Chiswell, who has presided over a very significant new building development at a school in one of the more remote bits of my electorate. I am pleased that the federal government could support It this school with a building of around $2 million. It is a credit to the school that it has managed that building project so successfully. There are great things going on in education, supported by this federal government but unfortunately not matched by our Victorian counterparts. Child Care",200
266,Ms ODWYER,ADJOURNMENT," It was a delight to be in the chamber to hear of the member for La Trobe's great interest in education issues. As a former resident of La Trobe, in the town of Emerald, I would commend to her the importance of contacting the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to ask him to guarantee funding for independent schools, because so far there is no guarantee of the indexation of that funding and so many schools are facing an uncertain future. Tonight I am here to talk about child care. I have stood in this place before and highlighted the fact that the governmentmandated changes to child care as part of the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care is an exercise in increased regulation, increased cost and ultimately diminished choice for parents. The new national quality framework commenced as of 1 January this year and applies to long day care, family day care, kindergartens and after-school care. In the time available tonight, I will focus on child care in particular. At the time that the government decided to further regulate the childcare industry, the Minister for Early Childhood and Child Care, the member for Adelaide, Kate Ellis, told Ian Henschke on ABC Radio: This decision wasn't taken lightly and we undertook extensive independent modelling as to the cost and we've been upfront about that. She went on to say: … there would be an increase as a result of these measures but we think that that increase is affordable… What we've seen is that the average increase will be some 57 cents per week this (2011) and that will rise to $8.67 per week in 2014-15. But, like so much of the talk from this government, it is important to look through the spin and examine the substance. Even before the changes were brought into effect, the Australian Childcare Alliance modelling found that three-quarters of all childcare centres would be forced to increase their fees as a result of the government's changes. It found that 25 per cent of them would need to increase their fees by between $30 and $50 a week. These findings were supported by a Productivity Commission report that concluded that the framework would increase out-of-pocket fees for longday-care services by $50 per week. In my own electorate of Higgins one of my councils, the Glen Eira council, has told me that it has had to increase its fees for its childcare centres from $91 a day to $116 a day. This is significantly higher than the 57c that the minister claimed it would cost parents. The huge discrepancy between the government's projected increase and the actual cost for parents can be put down to one of two things: either (1) the incompetence of the minister or (2) an intentional attempt by the minister to obfuscate the truth and mislead the publicyou be the judge. Whatever the reason, what is clear is that parents will pay so much more. Over the weekend the government finally admitted that childcare costs are escalating and that this increased cost is hitting families. The Minister for Trade and Industry did a rare thing for the Labor side of politics: he told the truth. He said in the Fairfax press today, 'Be assured this government is aware of the cost of child care in contributing to cost-of-living pressures.' In so saying he acknowledged that the government's new year scheme has significantly increased the cost of child care and that this is hurting the hip pocket of ordinary Australian families. So what is the government's response to increased childcare costs-costs that are entirely of their own creation? Is it to reflect on the increased regulation that they are imposing on childcare operators? No. Do they intend to cut red tape and unnecessary regulation and allow childcare operators to become more efficient? No. Do they intend to increase competition to allow market mechanisms to force the price down? No. We read today that the government's response is to intervene even further to regulate the cost of child care. We learn today that they plan to set the minimum and maximum fees that can be charged, to make all childcare centres cost the same, no matter what their offering-a typical Labor onesize-fits-all approach that will do nothing encourage innovation such as specialist learning programs with specialist teachers in such things as music or language; innovations such as hiring senior and experienced staff; and innovations such as decreasing the staff-to-child ratio even further for those parents who want even more direct contact. We all know what happens when one-size-fits-all approaches are taken, when prices are mandated, when innovation is stifled. That is when services and ultimately choice for parents disappear. But most problematic of all for parents is: how does the government intend to fund this new regulated price? They intend to fund this by taking money out of the pockets of families and giving it directly to childcare centres. It intends to rip money away from parents, which will reduce choice and flexibility. Conversely, the coalition have solutions. We understand that child care is an economic issue. It goes to the heart of how we can increase productivity and how we can increase participation. We have a plan for government. We will reintroduce the indexation of the childcare rebate, benefiting families with up to $300 per year. We will reinstate occasional care funding to increase flexibility and choice. Most importantly of all, we will commission a Productivity Commission report into how to better provide childcare services.(Time expired) Vietnam: Human Rights",201
267,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT," On 28 April this year I was invited by the Vietnamese community in Australia to speak at the Australian War Memorial on the occasion of the 37th anniversary of the fall of Saigon. It was an occasion to remember the many thousands who died fighting for freedom and liberty in Vietnam, including to 521 Australians who gave their lives for this cause. It was also a time to acknowledge the many others who continue to fight long after the war because their fight has not ended. They fight for their fundamental human rights, the freedom to speak their mind and the freedom to practise their religion-rights that we here in Australia take for granted. We are indeed privileged in this country, but we should not forget about the millions of people who live with constant suppression of their human rights. Therefore, we should use our freedom to speak on behalf of those who do not have a voice. The Vietnamese community in Australia have been speaking on behalf of the people of Vietnam over the past 37 years and I join with them in championing the cause of freedom and liberty for the Vietnamese. Representing an electorate that has the highest proportion of Vietnamese born citizens in Australia, I am painfully aware from my constituents of the persistent humans rights abuses occurring in Vietnam today. I have raised these issues in this chamber on many occasions. I will continue to do so as long as there are individuals such as the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do, Patriarch of Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam and Nobel Peace Prize nominee, Father Nguyen Van Ly of the Vietnamese Catholic Church, Viet Khang, a rather famous young singer-songwriter, Dr Ngyuen Dan Que and many others who are being denied their freedom simply because they have exercised their basic human right to speak out. This evening I want to draw the attention of the House to a lone human rights protester, a young and courageous Vietnamese man, Truong Quoc Viet, whose actions are the result of a passion and dedication to raising awareness to the continuous and escalating humans rights violations occurring in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. He sat alone in a little shelter just outside our parliament, our national seat of democracy, and I, together with Melissa Parke and many others who care about human rights, spent time with him. Truon Quoc Viet is particularly concerned about Australian aid going into the wrong hands-namely, those in the Vietnamese administration-with no apparent benefits for the Vietnamese people. In fact, the people of Vietnam continue to live in ongoing poverty and are faced with constant threats to their freedom and their liberty. Vietnamese Community in Australia have joined Truong in advocating for greater scrutiny of the Australian overseas development aid program to ensure those who are truly in need are the ones receiving the benefits. Australia is known across the world as a generous nation, a nation that give selflessly and has regard for the well-being of others. However, Australian aid and support should be directly linked to efforts to improve the basic human rights and welfare of the Vietnamese people. I think the message is clear. I challenge the Vietnamese government to look to the value and potential of their own people. I challenge the administration to build relationships with people and unleash the passion and commitment to achieve. Above all, I challenge the Vietnamese government to view people, as we do, as their most valuable and precious resource. Vietnam has a great potential to grow and achieve much in a modern world, but there is only one way that can properly be achieved and that is, first, by respecting the fundamental human rights of its own people. In the very short time the Vietnamese have been here in Australia, they have achieved much and have given total commitment to their adopted country. Their contributions to Australia have been invaluable. One good Vietnamese friend has reminded me of a saying, and it goes something like this: 'When you eat the fruit remember those who planted the tree.' That is essentially their commitment to this country, as they are benefiting from the labours of many others. That is why they have led the way in raising money for bushfires in Victoria and the floods in Queensland. In concluding, I thank the Vietnamese The community of Australia, the Vietnamese Catholic community, the Vietnamese Student Association, Viet Tan, Vietnamese Sydney Radio and many others who have kept me up to date on human rights development in Vietnam. Independent Local Butchers Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (22:10): Tonight here in parliament I was proud to host the inaugural Independent Butchers BBQ together with my good friend Senator John Williams. I would like to thank the many members of parliament from both sides of this House, their staff and the members of the Press Gallery that attended to show their support for our independent butchers. Tonight we all enjoyed tastetesting the wide variety of select cuts of premium beef and lamb available from local family butchers, which were all cooked by gourmet chef Brett Eldridge. The overwhelming judgment was: how could you even compare the superior produce and the quality from your family butcher with the mass produced supermarket meat? Tonight the small business supplying the meat for the inaugural Independent Butcher's BBQ was a local producer called Lost River Produce. Lost River Produce is a small family business run by Phil and Rebecca MCCormack from a farm located at Crookwell. Three years ago the MCCormack family built their own on-farm processing facility to enable them to bypass the big supermarkets and sell their produce direct to consumers via the internet. In addition to their internet sales, Lost River Produce is proudly in the process of opening a new independent butcher's shop right here in Canberra, in Badham Street, Dickson, where they will be taking the big supermarkets head on. The MCCormacks are a fifth generation farming family that have been on the land since the 1800s. Phil and Rebecca have two young sons, and I hope through good governance that we can provide them with the market conditions where their sons will have every opportunity to be the family's sixth generation of farmers. But not all is well for our beef producers. Decades of poor returns have sapped their manpower and energy. The Australian Beef Association estimates that the average age of Australian beef producers today is well over 55, and it increases every year as few young people today are taking up a career in agriculture. But one of the best ways that we can support our independent beef producers is to support our independent local butchers and to prevent them from becoming a dying breed. About 25 years ago, there were over 8,000 independent butchers around our nation. But despite the growth of our population, those numbers today are down to fewer than 3,500. I know from my experience growing up in Sydney's south, that we had a friendly local butcher, and he was not only friendly to all his two-legged customers. I can remember a particularly well-fed dog that lived in our road that used to make the daily trip up to our local butchers at Peakhurst South and there he would plant himself outside the front of the butcher shop until the kindly butcher found him an old bone. But, sadly, today our old family butcher at Peakhurst South is no longer. Theirs is just one of the 5,000 independent butcher shops that have closed their doors around our nation over the last two decades, as these independent butchers have seen their market share stolen by the supermarket duopoly. The latest ACNielsen Homescan data released this year shows that the supermarket duopoly's national share of the retail beef market today is over 57 per cent with the independents' share down to just 25.9 per cent. It may be argued by some that the decline of the independents and the increasing dominance of the supermarket duopoly is the work of 'market forces'. To the contrary, the decline of the independents is a direct result of government interference in the workings of the free market through the protection and privilege granted to the supermarket duopoly, which has distorted the market for retail leases, resulting in independent butchers in shopping centres finding themselves trying to compete but paying 1,000 per cent more per square metre for their rent. It may also be argued by some that the decline of the independents and the increasing dominance of the supermarket duopoly has been of benefit to the customer. Again to the contrary, for as the independents have disappeared from the market, competition has been reduced, resulting in the consumer paying more and more for lower quality cuts. Therefore I encourage all members of this House and all members of my electorate: if you are not shopping at your local butcher, I strongly recommend that you give them a try. You may just be pleasantly surprised. Building the Education Revolution Program",203
268,Mr SYMON,ADJOURNMENT," This evening I will relate to the House yet another good news story about the Building the Education Revolution, in particular the Primary Schools of the 21st Century, the P21, component. As all members of the House would know, both the Liberal and National parties voted against this once-in-ageneration infrastructure program back in 2009. If left to the Liberal and National opposition not one school in Australia would have benefited from the $16 billion of investment that the Labor government has made in schools right across Australia. Fortunately, however, for all of the schools not only in my electorate of Deakin but also in the other 149 electorates in Australia, the opposition failed in their attempt to block the BER and failed in their attempt to block the federal Labor government's stimulus program that our economy needed so much during the depths of the global financial crisis. At last count, I still have a dozen full or partial BER openings to attend in the electorate of Deakin. But, in the meantime, I will talk about the great results that were achieved by Mullum Primary School in Ringwood. The six new classrooms, community kitchen and classroom refurbishments in the existing part of the school have made a huge difference to Mullum. As good as it now looks, a project such as this does not just happen overnight and it can often take a lot of time to get things right. Although fully federally funded, this project could not have happened without the persistence of the school principal, Lynne Holland, Julie Denman, Jenny Verhiden and the entire teaching staff. Along with the school council president, Stuart MCPhee, and the entire school council, the parents association, the Eastern Metropolitan Team at the state Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, the project managers, contractors and workers on the project and, importantly, the entire school community, there were no end of people who contributed to make the project a success and who are now benefiting from these muchneeded modern buildings on site. For those in this chamber who do not know Mullum primary, it is a great school in Ringwood, which is 50 years old next yearand, until very recently, it certainly looked like it was 50 years. I well remember my first visit to Mullum back in May 2008 to hand out some leadership badges. I have often said that a great school does not have to look good from the outside to be a great school on the inside, but it helps no end to people who do not know what is on the inside. The casual passerby, the prospective parent or visitor always sees what is at the front gate and just beyond it. And, even if it is the best school in the suburb, if the paint is peeling off the building or the window frames are rotting, they may not see any more than that. It is important that the school community knows that government cares about their school. In this case, Mullum definitely knows that the federal government cares about their school. That is great for our local community and of course great for the kids in the school. It was back on 23 March 2009 that I visited Mullum Primary School to speak to the school principal, Lynne Holland, about what the BER could mean for a school like Mullum primary. If I remember rightly, we may have started off talking about a fullsized hall with a basketball court. There were quite a few setbacks along the way with that plan and we then discussed a stage in the building where we might have had a cantilever over an eight-metre drop-off, which would have provided fantastic views but would have meant that most of the money went into a concrete slab. There were other plans drawn up to put a large building on the top half of the site, but it actually did not fit and went over the boundary lines. Eventually we got to the point where the project that now stands was put in place. I think everyone involved with the school would say without hesitation that it was the absolute best use of the $2.6 million they got from the P21 program. The brand new classrooms, community kitchen refurbishments, particularly refurbishments, have made the school so much better than it was just a couple of years ago. The important part is that it provided local employment in our area when it was needed most, and that is what the federal Labor government achieved in the face of the global financial crisis: local employment for the short term and local infrastructure for the long term. What should never be forgotten by anyone is that, whilst other countries spent public money bailing out banks and in some cases, especially in Europe, still are, Australia invested in our children's and our community's future. The official opening on Saturday, 17 March 2012 was a great success and a real showcase for the school. I would like to thank school captains Nicholas MCKenzie and Lucy Haley for taking me on a tour of their new facilities and showing me the internal refurbishments that were also funded, as I said, through the BER. They showed me how the school had benefitted in so many different ways and I know from listening to the principal, teachers and parents of the school that they will appreciate such an investment for many decades to come. (Time expired) Australian Natural Disasters Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (22:20): I rise to speak on a very important area of policythat is, natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements. It should be at times that are outside the urgent time of emergency when disaster is occurring across the nation that we should look at what is flawed in the programs that administer assistance to individuals who have suffered financially from natural disasters, whether they be floods or fires. What have particularly given rise to my address this evening are some anomalies that exist in the natural disaster and relief and recovery arrangements as became the apparent recently with the floods in my electorate in north-east Victoria. The anomalies are as follows. In order for certain assistance measures such as clean-up grants to be given to primary producers and small businesses, they need to reside within a shire that is classified as a category C shire under the NDRRA arrangements-that is, if you have sustained the same financial or the same physical damage to your farm and you live across the shire boundary in a shire that has not been so classified as a category C then you are precluded from accessing the assistance. If we accept the basic premise that governments should provide relief and assistance to give those who have suffered nature's wrath a helping hand, if we have decided that is a right and proper thing for government to do, then we need to make sure that we get it right. There is a very real problem here, a problem of equity, where those who have suffered the same damage but live in the wrong shire, the wrong shire being a shire that has not been classified, get nothing. It should be based on actual damage, on facts, not just plain classifications. To this end, I have written to the Attorney-General and the Premier of Victoria, urging them to review the natural disaster relief recovery arrangements so that we can ensure that victims of flood damage in the future will have equitable access to assistance, regardless of the local government area in which they reside or where their business is. I have received a response. I have also written to the Attorney General separately with regard to a particular constituent of mine who suffered enormous damage due to floods and is still unable to access any assistance. To this letter I have not yet received a response. I was heartened by the Attorney-General to the extent that she said, 'I will certainly keep the situation you describe in mind as an area that may warrant review, and I look forward to taking a bipartisan approach and working collaboratively with the states and territories on improving the arrangements.' I would have liked to have seen a more immediate commitment to an actual review. An acknowledgement that there are problems is a good start, but I am disappointed that Attorney-General has not given an indication that the government will act immediately to fix what is so obviously a flaw. I was also disappointed in another part of her letter, where she effectively says that, even if a business has sustained damage outside a category C area, that does not stop the states from helping them. The disaster relief arrangements have always been a fifty-fifty arrangement between the Commonwealth and the states, and that is not a satisfactory response. On the issue of my individual constituent, I have yet to receive a response. It was Mr Buck who suffered serious damage to his property in South Wangaratta. It was the result of the same floods that occurred in the Indigo, Towong, Shepparton and Moira shires, but because the rural city of Wangaratta was not classified category C, Mr Buck is ineligible to apply for assistance. He has estimated that the damage to his property is approximately $50,000. As you would appreciate, insurance cover does not cover this type of damage. (Time expired) Neilly, Mrs Lola",206
269,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT," George Neilly was born in 1917 in Kurri. He was educated at Maitland Boys High and became a coal miner at the age of 17. He rose through the trade union ranks to become secretary of the northern district of the miners union between 1954 and 1959. George was elected by indirect election, as we knew it in those days, to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1954 and, on the retirement of John Crook, was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1959, a position he held until his retirement in 1978. Three years later, the well-known Kurri identity RJ Brown retired, having held the seat for some three years, and my good friend Stan Neilly was elected member for Cessnock, a position he held until 1999-although I note with a three-year the lay-off following the disastrous 1988 election when Labor in New South Wales was swept from power largely due to a proposal on gun laws. But, thankfully, Stan fought his way back into the seat three years later. The names Stan and George Neilly are synonymous with Cessnock and the broader Hunter Region and, of course, with the Labor movement. But tonight I rise not to speak so much of them but of Lola Neilly, George Neilly's wife and Stan Neilly's mother. Lola Neilly, very sadly, died on Saturday morning. She was 94 years of age. Lola Neilly, nee Wood, was an amazing woman. She was very much the matriarch of the Neilly family-the power behind the throne, if you like. In the old days, when there was no electorate office or electorate staff, Lola ran George's constituency from the shed in the backyard of their Abermain home. She was as much a politician as George, as much a politician as Stan-and maybe tougher than both of them. She was George's rock, Stan's rock and a rock to daughter Noelene, who herself proved to be an accomplished offspring. Lola was a politician's wife, a politician's mother, a function partner for both George and Stan and a supporter and worker for a whole range of local community groups. In short, Lola Neilly was a local legend. She was someone I knew well when I was a young party activist and learnt from in many ways in those early years. She made an enormous contribution to both the party and the labour movement and to her local community. She will be sadly missed, but not forgotten. The Neillys generally have been an outstanding family. Their contribution to the community and to politics more broadly throughout the region has immeasurable. It is a great privilege for me to have known her, to in a sense have worked with her, although by the time. I became active in the party she was a more passive activist but still someone you consulted if, for example, as a young person you were thinking about running for the local council or any other position within the party. I say, with the greatest respect, she was a person to be feared. You did not make a move unless you were confident you had Mrs Neilly's approval. They do not make them like Mrs Neilly anymore, I suspect. Again, it was a privilege to know her. Her passing is a great loss to all of us. It is my great privilege tonight to pay tribute to her contribution and to the contribution of her family. House adjourned at 22:30 NA The following notices were given:  That this House require the Prime Minister to explain: (1) why the Member for Dobell has been suspended from the Labor Caucus; (2) why the Prime Minister is able to accept his vote to support her government including in the passage of the Appropriations bill; and (3) how she is able to deny him the presumption of innocence with respect to his membership of the Caucus but afford him such a presumption in the House to keep her in power.

That this House: consider the statement of the Member for Dobell of 21 May 2012 with respect to the findings of Fair Work Australia in relation to his tenure as National Secretary of the Health Services Union and his candidature as Labor candidate for the seat of Dobell.

For the committee, we sat down and started looking at the issues, system and by the fact that so many people problems, be it the person at the management Australia or all the associated health facilities This was a system that we found was rife was a system with a lot of duplication.

There training and cultural awareness, the need for appeals process and English language. All problems along the way. I will touch on some my contribution to this debate. As we all know, Australia has one of the read the reports in the media, you would think that you just need to visit a few other places our health system, the dedication of those people a system that overseas trained doctors would not always work the way we would like it doctors-or, as I will refer to them for the medical graduates', or IMGs, and I am sure Key themes that emerged throughout our efficiency and accountability, one where the the way the system operated. They had been subjected of the stories that the committee heard were practised in Australia for in excess of 20 years practise. They had no warning in a system where really poor communication. This was a system interfered with and had adverse outcomes We now have a national scheme, which I think territory schemes.

But the the $1 billion that was pulled out of health careful planning of our workforce; neither doctors to a point that they were able to come needs that are evident in the seats that we represent. So I have to acknowledge from the outset the this country of international medical graduates and contributed to our local communities in being said, some high-profile cases recently good health and that people who should have system were overlooked. I think I can say that it was definitely with my colleagues we all had a sense of work that had been done but also the fact that Australia to work as international medical graduates vital to our people were actually, literally Considering that in regional, remote and workforce comes from the supply of international listening to this debate some idea of how critical it was held right across the country. There had managed their way through the system, got Similarly, there was incredibly moving in could not negotiate the system. In that sense something that I want to explore. Firstly, lost in the sense that there was people, who had in quite a number of cases health professionals, as doctors, in their resistance. It is fair to say that the committee always at the heart of our concern. But with proficient and recently practising medical suddenly completely lost to our service because paper warfare that they had to undertake We had the testimony of people who are recruiters time in attracting great people with great people came to approach the system here information received on application and then here. It was embarrassing to hear that people success and completion of studies and that requested on so many occasions me great pleasure to speak and address this put forward after what was for me one of the health system that I have undergone. Happily, I time and my experience, like most Australians reality is that we have not, particularly given under the former health minister, had a very have we had a very careful education of our into our system in a way that responds to the incredible contribution to the public health of who have been coming to us for so many years incredibly significant and positive ways.

It was a long inquiry and was incredibly moving testimony by people who out the other side and were now participating. a very unhappy way testimony from people who I think that the words 'lost in the labyrinth' are a very uncertain pathway forward for many of these very lengthy periods of successful service as own countries and who came and met a wall of was very mindful that excellence in practice was some of the processes that these formerly highly professionals had been engaged in, they were they were unable to negotiate the kind of to get through the requirements. themselves, investing a huge amount of recommendations and finding that when those there were complete disconnects between information that had to be handled and managed had provided accurate registrations of their they had done that over and over and were to completely resubmit material. It spoke somewhat to me of the imbalance the gatekeepers of the profession are, with standards, but, sadly, in a duty-bound, process-bound applications, they ended up creating a structure able to get in, get their paperwork processed, impeded from doing so. So the sense of being our system by people who were messed around agencies; a loss of the capacity for their talents here.

If Gonski review and the consultation process could make the judgment that we are in any It is an interesting debate that happens around bit of talk today about a Greens-Labor coalition member for Kooyong has not been in the parliament long enough to have noticed what tends to Australian people pick it that way. They Representatives, they tend to give us a different minor parties in the balance of power in government since Federation that has had control single bill in every government that we There are reasons why the names of Brian are known.

We have seen a little and some really extraordinary things. The that long, but he has certainly been alive happen in Australian parliaments because the tend to give us one party in the House of party in the state and they tend to put some the Senate. There has not been a single Labor of both houses. We have negotiated every have been in, and that is the way it is now. Harradine, Steve Fielding and Nick Xenophon time those people had the balance of power in the in the chair, and the member for New England household names up until this parliament in Fielding and Senator Xenophon were. That is in the lower house. But it is not unusual for parties in order to get its bills through. What is is so incredibly uncooperative. Usually in a in one house or the other-and usually it is the the government and the opposition. In fact, in government had to get the support of both the Senate. Because Senator Fielding usually hardly anything without the support of the around 95 per cent of the legislation was passed leader at the time who did what Australian that is be an opposition that contributes the quality of legislation. Given that the Australian people have given the government and the opposition needed to things happen-there have been only two terms in of the Senate as well; that was three years oppositions in Australia's history took the is to oppose everything, make as much mess as possible, brawl like crazy, throw punches and see what is going on, we would A little bit of respect for the way the Australian opposition-in fact, a lot of respect. They history of Australian parliaments, it has served rather have control of both houses because then reality is that because both parties have had way of introducing legislation which stands next and government changes hands from one side passed by the previous government in most cases has been a process, so that legislation tends Howard term when he introduced bills with people thought so too, and some of that talking about Work Choices-I look back over when governments change hands most of the legislation is because the Australian people-quite cleverly, where they require some negotiation The parliament we are in now is an interesting moved from the Senate down into the House different group of people-the member for member for Kennedy-as the focus. But if the opposition believes that funding to private believes that funding to private schools should schools should be funded under the same system, what the Greens think? We do not need the vote same position we do. We actually have the parliament across both houses we have all bar done a count. But, again, if the opposition should be sector blind when it comes to funding child has the same access to a quality education having this silly debate here? Why are we between the two of us we have the majority. All you have to do is what every other come to the table and make your case and oppose and oppose. That is not what the opposition simply to oppose; it is the role development of legislation, and it really Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (19:09): I rise today the member for Kooyong which rejects calls 2003-04 levels.

Over the the Australian people well. I hate it. I would it would be much easier to do things. But the to get together and negotiate we have found a the test of time. As one parliament passes to the to the other, the legislation which has been has actually been partially negotiated. There to stand. Apart from the last part of the John total power that arguably went too far, and the was turned back quite quickly-of course, I am a number of parliaments and what I see is that that has passed remains intact. That I think, as it turns out-do this strange thing in one house or the other. one because that balance of power has of Representatives. So suddenly there is a Lyne, the member for New England and the reality in the lower house also is that the schools should not be cut and the government not be cut and we both actually agree that why is the opposition even talking about of the Greens if the opposition supports the vast majority. In fact, of 175 members of about 12. It is actually quite small. I have not agrees with the government's position that we schools and we should make sure that every as every other student, why on earth are we even talking about this? We agree, so therefore reasonable, functioning opposition has done and try to be part of the process. You oppose and Australian people want. It is not the role of of opposition to engage constructively in the is about time you did. (Time expired) to support this very important motion from to reduce funding to non-government schools to such a move would leave thousands of for the thousands of school children and their in the electorate of Ryan. At the time of the the most significant announcements on school funding for over 30 years. Instead, it is now was released and non-government schools still from this Labor government. Non-government end result is not clarity but confusion and not support non-government schools. I support maintaining funding to non-government key aims. Firstly, it serves as a very important parents. Australia has seen a strong shift in the last two decades because parents schooling communities and want to invest education. Parents know and understand the secondary schooling. The non-government school parents across Australia have a choice about their children. With a severe lack of autonomy government schools are the only way of matching children educated. Secondly, private schooling saves the Presbyterian and Methodist Schools Association of $4,902 per student in the current government for students at government schools. As such, College in Ryan, save the Commonwealth and annual funding. The disparity in overall funding country is then filled in the form of school fees, taxpayers are saved an estimated $5.1 billion their children to non-government schools. It is not a surprise, coming from a Labor Australia, that they want to attack non-government tough, with increasing cost-of-living pressures reduction in funding would place huge pressures be paid for out of parents' pockets. I recently held an education forum in thank the shadow minister for education, participating in that forum. On that day question and parents, asking what the Gillard government to know if the government is going to reduce education resource index model. Parents and worried that the Gillard government will worried that this will reduce government assistance able to meet the consequent forced rise in school the best education possible. There are three questions that the coalition questions are: does it support choice in education? is the new model based on need, using an objective and the proposed funding model in the Gonski more than three months since the Gonski review do not have a firm commitment of support schools had their expectations trashed and the hope but despair at this government's failure to schools because doing so achieves two avenue for providing choice for Australian away from government to non-government schools are becoming more and more involved in local their own after-tax funds on their children's value of holistic and comprehensive primary and sector is an integral way of ensuring that the type of school to which they want to send in government schools across the country, nonthe preferences of how they want their government and the taxpayer money. As the has noted, their schools receive an average funding compared to an average of $14,380 the PMSA schools, including Brisbane Boys' state governments more than $47 million in for all non-government schools across the donations, fundraising and levies. Every year as a consequence of parents choosing to send government trying to ignite class warfare in schools. Many parents already have it even before the onerous carbon tax. A on the level of school fees now expected to conjunction with the member for Brisbane, and I the member for Sturt, for coming to Ryan and after question was from concerned principals plans to do with their funding. They wanted funding back to the failed and unsatisfactory educators at non-government schools are rightly not commit to maintaining funding. They are in real terms and that, if parents are not fees, then their children will not be receiving asks in a test for any new funding model. Those Does it encourage private investment? And allocation method? The recommendations review do not satisfy these three basic tests. Firstly, there is no guarantee about indexation, ability of parents to afford the school of their in fact be penalised for private investment disincentive for parents to invest in their burden of the average taxpayer. Thirdly, the objective measure of using a school's All parents are concerned about the quality great enabler. At the federal level that means funding to non-government schools to ensure class.

In the Wide Bay statistical region, which electorates, we have virtually had no residential notional allocation of 180 places, not one bed government has lost touch with the realities Since the government has come to power successive ball.

This reform is absolutely necessary. If you senior Australians, it is clear that there is need It was even more extraordinary that no home in the government's last round of allocations. that you have got to announce 40,000 places one? Quite frankly, the increase in home that the government was winding back on the essentially covers the Wide Bay and Hinkler beds for four years. In fact this year, from a was applied for. That clearly says to me that the of aged care and the industry is switching off. ministers have taken their eye off the care regardless of how desirable it is to keep we are down 610 beds over the last four years. up. Home care packages are always welcome and productive lives in their own homes, but they are time in their lives where they need residential ideas in its new package, you really start to see can be. For example, in future only fully funded test and copayments will be charged for other you are going to be up for $5,000 and if can be asked to keep contributing to this until it comes to residential care, the government has including the family home. I know it is not been a much fairer way of doing this. The means for residential care. Not only will pensioners they will not be means tested, but others will be, matter can be seen by simply reading between is sold as $3.7 billion over five years, it is with a measly $577 million of new money announced programs.

The Labor government has very much prided itself in ensuring services, whether it be in the aged-care Many people retire to my part of the nation. the Surf Coast and the Otways, which is a haven they retire.

It is important receive aged-care services, and this will important because it already costs about 0.8 1.8 per cent of GDP by 2050. It is also important Australians, Australians who have built this years. As the Productivity Commission report identifies, weaknesses. The PC report points out that it is consumer choice; quality is variable; the coverage contributions are inconsistent or inequitable; government's aged-care package must be viewed have been identified by the Productivity Commission report. It is difficult for us on this side of chamber this stage and, with the relatively limited operate. Let me say some of the positive elements package: first of all, the number of home-care 100,000-I think that is a positive move. Secondly, again. Thirdly, it appears to give some more aged-care services. Finally, overall it that all Australians are able to access system or in accessing world-class education. We have areas such as the Bellarine Peninsula, for people in their later years in life when the older electorates in this nation. I know that to see a strong aged-care system. When I talk on these very important matters, they very homes for as long as possible. They have often comfortable in that environment and they want any reform needs to enable people to remain in there are points at which that is no longer a often becomes the only choice in the last few system, a system that is affordable and in a nursing home when it gets to that point in in by Mark Butler, as the minister, should be that we have a very well-trained workforce to and their families. This is an area where we make sure we are remunerating those workers, and the support they provide to their clients and to congratulate the minister and look forward to throughout the nation. I think it is a reform to speak on the member for Shortland's motion, motion concerns an important but challenging because already one million people use or grow to about 3.5 million people by 2050. It is per cent of GDP and this is forecast to grow to because it concerns elderly, vulnerable nation and who deserve dignity in their final the current system suffers from many difficult to navigate; services are limited as is of needs, pricing, subsidies and user coand there are workforce shortages. So the in the context of these weaknesses which to fully assess the full impact of the reforms at amount of documentation, how the reforms will which I think are contained within the packages will increase from 60,000 to it makes dementia a national priority once flexibility regarding how people will pay for puts some additional funds into the system. I think all four of those things identified downsides which we believe are inherent in this those in the time. I have available. To start relation to the funding of this package. I package but that is the gross size over five years. offsets in terms of redirecting funding and means package to the government is only $580 million, million. There is very little new spending over what is most important for most people in the sector. My second concern is that considerable package. The implication of the means testing care providers are already receiving too much and they receive less funding, there will be less private providers, to reinvest. I also have disincentive for people to save and to think about is now such a strong incentive to be on the who will receive aged care for free. Thirdly, reform package. This was a big area identified from reducing red tape, this package actually care sector. Finally, my concern is that the package starts That is over two years away and after the next starting immediately. To summarise, let me quote the economist There is little new money, with significant clawbacks to providers. Greater consumer choice will be incentives to invest and innovate.

Western Australia believes advance needs to be supported, because collectively taxpayers of Western Australia-agree that toads. Queenslanders have a different point conceded that the cane toads have won and fauna are now victims of cane toads. The Western Australian government gave Busters and, back in the Howard days, there government. But sadly there is now nothing, government. There is nothing for a group, now to halt this advance of the cane toad. There is no dollars. It is totally unacceptable, because the advance of the cane toads to, for instance, in Western Australia. There is no federal instance, that might find a molecular or viral need to commit serious funds; I am talking dollars. Until such time as we support the some viral solution to the cane toad-this may South America, where these insidious amphibians seriously treat this as an issue that needs are any amongst us that recognise cane toads as It does not endear itself to any one of us. an introduced species that have created havoc with introduced in a well-meaning way to combat the Scott, would well know.

Let me explain to you The Kimberley Toad Busters have never been about a community group of volunteers.

They have been lungworm infection in the cane toad. They lungworm parasite. The name 'Kimberley Toad Busters' implies veterinarian, Lee Scott-Virtue. It is not promoted by local business entities. It is, quite Busters are the primary volunteer group in They need funds, basically.

Not-For-Profit Organisations I know that the member for Goldstein but sometimes you have got to feel sorry for trying to find $70 billion. If the previous in the House earlier today are anything to go from opposition members during this budget in my electorate. On 4 May I had the in my electorate conducted by Sector the Macarthur-Wingecarribee area that institutes up state and federal issues on behalf of all the non-government providers in my electorate.

At both those schools, by local businesses. Beacon is supported Coca-Cola Foundation, Rio Tinto et cetera. The Eagle Vale school caters for the suburb deprivation. The state and federal governments mixed housing into what was essentially a deprived area and it is great to see that participating in that project.

It is a very Beacon and the local school community are in that area that I would hope to see an increase in productivity by the housing department moment there is some question about the way the Eagle Vale High School could be the information to the community.
