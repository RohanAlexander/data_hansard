2,Ms LEY,ERADICATION ACCOUNT,"Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (9.01 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Amendment Bill 2006 (the bill) will enable residual cattle and buffalo industry levies, collected under the bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis eradication campaigns, to be transferred to a more broadly based industry disease fund. For many years the cattle and buffalo industries have contributed, through levies, to the National Cattle Disease Eradication Account (NCDEA). These funds were used in initiatives to eradicate brucellosis and tuberculosis, most recently through the Tuberculosis Freedom Assurance Program (TFAP). Successive campaigns have resulted in both diseases being considered to be eradicated in Australia. This is a major achievement that other countries are unable to claim and a shining example of government and industry partnership. As the Tuberculosis Freedom Assurance Program will conclude on 31 December 2006, the cattle and buffalo industries have requested that residual funds in the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account be transferred into the more broadly focused Cattle Disease Contingency Fund (CDCF). The Cattle Disease Contingency Fund is a trust fund that was established in 2002 by the cattle industry and Animal Health Australia (AHA) in order to fund various animal health activities which are to the benefit of the cattle industry in Australia. The funds may be used for a number of specified purposes, including prevention, eradication and control of endemic or exotic cattle diseases, research and other animal health activities likely to benefit the Australian cattle industry. In comparison to the NCDEA, there is significantly greater scope for the application of funds held in the CDCF. The increased autonomy and flexibility in the use of the levy moneys will strengthen the cattle industry's ability to address biosecurity issues, to conduct research and risk mitigation activities, and to respond to incursions of exotic diseases. The bill amends the current National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Act 1991 to add a clause that will enable payments to be made from the trust account to the CDCF. The bill also includes the addition of a clause that clearly defines the CDCF for the purposes of the act. The bill enables funds remaining after the successful completion of the brucellosis and TB programs to be used in the ongoing work of building a strong biosecurity framework for the Australian cattle industry. It will further help maintain the competitiveness of Australia's agricultural industries through an outstanding animal health status. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Murphy) adjourned. NA REPEAL BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 August, on motion by Mr Ian Macfarlane: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Martin Ferguson moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) calls on the Government to require the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources to report to the Parliament annually, commencing in August 2007, on the measures taken and the progress made to: (a) increase market penetration of ethanol and biodiesel, LPG and CNG, including the number and location of service stations and the names of the companies offering these products on their retail sites; (b) secure new investment in biofuel, LPG and CNG production and supply infrastructure in Australia; and (c) secure investment in new alternative transport fuel industries in Australia, including gas and coal to liquids; (2) calls on the Government to review, in 2009, the proposal to introduce excise on ethanol and biodiesel, LPG and CNG in 2011, and consider whether or not there is a case for delaying the introduction of excise, depending on the progress made: (a) in increasing market penetration of biofuels, LPG and CNG; (b) in securing new investment in biofuels, LPG and CNG production and supply infrastructure in Australia; and (c) towards achieving the 350 million litre biofuels target in 2010. (3) criticises the Government for: (a) its tardiness in moving on petrol retail reform; (b) bypassing due parliamentary process in introducing a regulation to “undeclare” companies under the Sites Act; (c) failing to introduce amendments to the TPA to implement the 2003 Dawson and 2004 Senate recommendations for reform; and (d) failing to act to reduce Australia's dependence on foreign oil and improve its transport fuel security; (4) calls on the Government to immediately conduct a feasibility study into a gas to liquids fuels plant in Australia, including: (a) consideration of Petroleum Resources Rent tax incentives for developers of gas fields which provide resources for gas to liquid fuels projects; (b) examining a new infrastructure investment allowance for investment in Australian gas to liquids infrastructure; and (c) developing a targeted funding scheme for research and development in this area; (5) calls on the Government to immediately embrace Labor's Fuels Blueprint proposal to: (a) make alternative fuel vehicles tariff free, cutting up to $2000 off the price of current hybrid cars; and (b) grant tax rebates for converting petrol cars to LPG; and (6) calls on the Government to immediately embrace Labor's Fuels Blueprint to find more oil and use more gas by; (a) re-examining the depreciation regime for gas production infrastructure; (b) allowing the selective use of flowthrough share schemes for smaller operators”.",21
3,Mr MURPHY,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"In relation to the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006, it is important to provide a regulatory environment which allows refineries to select business models that are appropriate for the market. However we cannot forget those many small businesses that are also struggling to survive. It is true that if there are no minimum standards for the wide range of contractual arrangements relevant in this industry, many small mum-and-dad business owners will be vulnerable to the market power of fuel suppliers during negotiations. The Oilcode will be introduced as a mandatory industry code under section 51AE of the Trade Practices Act 1974. It will, belatedly, bring the whole industry under a common regulatory regime that provides more protections for all industry participants and consumers. This will include protection being made available to commissioned agents and independent operators, who currently do not have the protections that are available to franchisees. Of relevance, all small petroleum business owners, without the deep pockets of oil companies, will now have access to a low-cost dispute resolution scheme. Furthermore, there will be greater transparency in wholesale fuel pricing for small businesses who do not have the resources to undertake extensive research and analysis on pricing issues. While the bill before us shows that the government is capable of taking corrective action in the retail petrol market, one must question why it has taken so long. Why has a 25-year-old regulatory regime been allowed to fester until today? Rather than taking the initiative to resolve the issues raised by this bill before Australia approached an oil crisis, the government has waited until we are smack in the middle of one before taking its first steps. True to form, the government is happy to surf on the good times but disclaim responsibility when things go badly. We have seen it with interest rates and we now see it with increased petrol prices. It was illuminating to read the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report into this bill, which suggested that the government did not proceed with this bill in 1998 because the affected parties could not agree on the Oilcode proposal. On my reading, it appears that it has taken over six long years for the government to broker a compromise on the Oilcode. Clearly, the government has failed to show leadership to bring refineries, distributors, retailers and consumers together to overhaul a 25-year-old system that did not benefit any of them. There can be no doubt that vigorous marketplace competition is one step to hold down petrol prices as low as possible. Yet, at a time when petroleum retailing was being whittled down to a battle between Coles and Woolworths, the Howard government stood by and watched its anachronistic legislation prevent others from competing on an equal footing. That is outrageous. The best consumers were offered at the time was the Prime Minister's proclamation that world oil prices were out of his control. That much may be true, but it does not explain the government's lethargy in reforming the petrol retail industry and showing serious commitment to other energy sources. More should and could have been done to mitigate the impact of petrol prices on ordinary Australians before we reached a petrol crisis, not while we are in the midst of one. Indeed, more could have been done with this bill. However, given the paucity of offerings from the Howard government on petrol initiatives in the past, it is a natural inclination for us to take anything we are given. Nonetheless, the Labor Party has always held firm the view during this debate that section 46 amendments to the Trade Practices Act are necessary to address concerns about the potential for the abuse of market power in the petroleum industry. There should be no ducking and weaving on the other side in relation to this amendment, which will only ensure huge corporations operate properly and fairly towards small businesses. Much has been said by greater minds than ours, including Associate Professor Frank Zumbo, who advised the Senate Economics Legislation Committee that the Trade Practices Act required amendment in light of its ineffectiveness to deal with the important issues of predatory pricing and other abuses of market power. This amendment has taken on a heightened sense of urgency in light of the increasing rationalisation of the petroleum industry. While one aim of this bill is to increase competition, we cannot forget that the main objective of competitors within a market is to eliminate competition. The increasing oligopolisation in this and many other industries pays testimony to this fact. The government should not half complete its job of promoting competition in the petroleum industry by ignoring the vulnerability of small businesses to the blatant abuse of market power. High Court cases dealing with this issue do not bode well for the ACCC securing prosecutions for the misuse of market power under current provisions in the future. Again, we should not allow dysfunctional legal provisions to fester while market share is increasingly being concentrated in the hands of few rather than in the hands of many. Of course, the reforms in this bill and proposed amendments are not a panacea for the problems being experienced by millions of Australians. They barely provide the first step. However, given the length of time the Howard government has been dragging its feet on petrol retail reform and energy reform, it is an important first step. It was pleasing to see the Prime Minister take a leaf out of Labor's Australian fuels blueprint yesterday and take a number of other steps towards mitigating the petrol criwas sis. They are small steps, but they are better than nothing. Without going into great detail, far more could be done to wean Australia off Middle East oil and to develop a diversified home-grown fuel industry. I am sure we would all like to see that. I know the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources would. I was listening to him on Radio National and on local ABC radio this morning. You have been very busy-good on you. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Batman have spoken at length about the conversion of gas to liquid, including petroleum resources rent tax initiatives for developers of gas fields who provide resources for gas to liquid fuels projects. While the Prime Minister has adopted Labor's proposals to subsidise the conversion of cars from petrol to LPG, he will slug motorists with an excise on LPG for the first time in the future. What he gives with one hand he will soon take with his other invisible hand. I am a firm supporter of a sustainable ethanol industry in Australia, and am appalled that not enough has been done to assist its take-up by consumers. While the government says it is committed to the ethanol industry, we know that few of Australia's 6,500 petrol stations stock E10. I certainly try to put E10 in my car whenever I can. I have listened to the minister over a long period of time in relation to this and I urge him the to do more to encourage the production of crops that will produce ethanol. There is a lot of debate on this issue at the moment, and the feeling is that Australia cannot produce sufficient ethanol to meet a mandated 10 per cent. It can if you have the will. I went to Brazil as part of my study tour last year and I have seen exactly what they did following the oil shocks of the 1970s. They literally stuck it up the oil companies, and the whole country runs on ethanol. It illuminating to see that every car runs on a mandated 25 per cent ethanol and that they have flex-fuel cars which can take 90 per cent ethanol and 10 per cent gasoline. The whole country is going ahead in leaps and bounds. I think we should be doing more to promote the production of ethanol. I know there are vast reserves of water in the northern part of Western Australia near the Ord River. I do not know why we are not producing crops that will ultimately produce a lot more ethanol and mean that we will be less reliant on Middle East oil. I hope the minister does something about that, because I know he believes that we have not got the capacity to produce more ethanol. Go and look at the experience in Brazil. They made it happen. We need to do more to encourage a sustainable ethanol industry here and stem the flow of investment dollars being spent on ethanol overseas in lieu Australia. Alternatively, if long-term projects are far too visionary for this government, it can begin by backing Labor's proposal to give the ACCC the power to formally monitor petrol prices. As we can see, the repeal of the anachronistic Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 and Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 is but one of the many small steps the government should have taken a long time ago to alleviate the pressure on Australian motorists. It is a step forward nonetheless and, for that, I guess we should all be very grateful.",22
4,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 and support the member for Batman and my colleagues on the amendments to this bill. It is disappointing that only one government backbencher is speaking on this bill. As this is a vital issue at a time when petrol prices are soaring, I cannot interpret that as other than an indicator of the growing arrogance within government ranks. This bill is very timely. People in my electorate and across Australia are struggling with soaring petrol prices, interest rate increases and more uncertainty in the workplace. People are now spending a higher proportion of their income on mortgage payments than ever before. At the last election the Prime Minister promised to keep interest rates low, but people are now realising the hollowness of that promise. People now spend 11 per cent of household disposable income on mortgages, compared to 9.3 per cent when interest rates peaked in 1989. So those families in my electorate who are paying off a mortgage are hurting much more now than they did in the past. The recent rate rise will hurt everyone with a mortgage, but there are some who will be hurt more than others. In some suburbs in my community more than half the private homes are paying off a mortgage-62 per cent in Banks, 61 per cent in Conder, 55 per cent in Gordon, 53 per cent in Calwell, 52 per cent in Macarthur and 51 per cent in Theodore. I name those suburbs on purpose, because they are outer suburbs. As these people live in outer suburbs, chances are they have to travel more than many others to get around the town, and high petrol costs are going to make their lives a lot more difficult. The majority of these people are young families for whom every dollar of disposable income counts, and the impact of fuel prices is really beginning to bite. People in the outer suburbs rely on their cars to take their kids to school, to take family members or friends to medical appointments, to go shopping, to visit family, to get to work and to get their children to recreational activities at weekends. I am concerned about the financial stress these high petrol prices are placing on those types of families within my community. The bill we are debating today is a belated response to the problem of spiralling petrol prices. It will repeal the sites act and franchises act, which are now out of date and ineffective because of structural changes in the petroleum retail sector. The entry of supermarket chains into the petrol market, and their market strength, has changed the nature of the retail petrol sector, but the legislation has not kept up with these changes. As the previous speaker, the member for Lowe, said, it is interesting that the regulatory regime has been in place for decades while the marketplace has changed so dramatically, with two very big players-Woolworths and Coles-having an enormous role in those market changes. I cannot help but think of the many independent owners in the petrol business who have gone out of the marketplace during those years. It is of some concern when you think about the impact. As a result, the different types of retail participants are subject to different protections and regulatory requirements. Unfortunately, the current legislation favours some retailers more than others. As I said, when I reflect on the past and the changes that have come with the big players as against the small, that really does ring true. This bill ensure that all market participants can compete on equal terms. Once the current legislation is repealed, a new regulation, the Trade Practices (Industry Codes-Oilcode) Regulations 2005, will be introduced. This will put all retailers on a level playing field. The code will bring the supermarket chains under a mandatory industry code of practice for the first time. I am pleased that this bill has the support of the overwhelming majority of market retailers, motorists and the peak bodies that represent them. I support this bill. However, it is a shame that the government ignored Labor's proposal seven years ago to strengthen the Trade Practices Act and repeal the acts. Unfortunately, the government is still ignoring this important aspect. That is why I support the amendments proposed by the member for Batman. These amendments will strengthen the Trade Practices Act to develop a comprehensive approach to petrol retail pricing and provide greater scope for dealing with market power abuse. This will further protect small business. These amendments were recommended by the 2003 Dawson inquiry and by the 2004 Senate recommendations for reform, but the government continues to ignore those recommendations. There are several measures the government could take to address the rising cost of petrol. The ACCC should have greater powers to formally monitor petrol prices and to demand information from oil companies and retailers. The community wants nothing more, or less, than that. The government should reduce our dependency on foreign oil. Labor has a plan to do this and policies to encourage alternative energy use. Labor has proposed the following measures: finding more gas and oil in Australia; making alternative fuel vehicles tariff free; cutting up to $2,000 from the price of current hybrid cars; granting tax rebates for converting petrol will cars to LPG; and conducting a feasibility study into gas to liquid fuels plants in Australia-which, as we have heard in the last couple of days, the Prime Minister is now happy to consider. In our amendments to this bill, Labor calls Oil- on the government to require the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources to report to the parliament annually on measures taken and the progress made to: firstly, increase market penetration of ethanol and biodiesel, LPG and CNG, including the number and location of service stations and the names of the companies offering these products on their retail sites; secondly, secure new investment in biofuel, LPG and CNG production and supply infrastructure in Australia; and, thirdly, secure investment in new alternative transport fuel industries in Australia, including gas and coal to liquids. The Prime Minister claims there is nothing he can do to control the soaring petrol prices, but clearly that is not the case completely. Labor has a comprehensive approach, outlined in our amendments to this bill and in Labor's fuels blueprint, which we believe will make a difference. The other point I want to make in general terms is on technology in this country. We are always pretty good at developing good technology. I have no doubt on that. I know that it exists, that car manufacturers both here and overseas have developed vehicles and technology that could begin to answer a lot of the questions that we have in relation to the cost of fuel. We need to look at that technology, and not only for the sake of the cost of fuel. The driving impetus for these things has been the environment. Long before we were talking about the price of petrol, we were talking about the need to do something about this, technologically, for the sake of the ronment. I am not for one moment saying that one is more important than the other; we really need to consider both. I would like to think that the government could bring to bear more pressure than it has to date, or could increase the pressure and the influence it already has on car manufacturers to talk about real alternatives: future hybrid cars and other future alternatives which would answer not only, to a great degree, the fuel question but also the environment question attached to this whole debate. In closing, I endorse entirely the words of and the amendments moved by the member for Batman and hope that we will see a change in the future on this whole question of fuel in Australia.",25
5,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"I thank those members who have contributed to the debate on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006. I hope we will see agreement to this bill that will remove two pieces of legislation that, as previous speakers have said, have become outdated and ineffective. The success of the Oilcode will provide all industry participants with a national approach to terminal gate pricing, set a minimum standard for a wider range of contractual arrangements, and provide access to downstream petroleum dispute resolution schemes. A new approach to terminal gate pricing will provide a transparent regime that will ensure that all customers, including independents, can access terminal gate pricing information and have the option to buy petroleum products on a temperature-corrected basis at the terminal gate. Improvements to tenure arrangements for common agents and increased disclosure requirements will benefit small business participants. The Oilcode's dispute resolution scheme will provide a low-cost and rapid means of addressing disputes as an alternative to legal action. These envichanges are likely to lead to increased competition in the sector, with the potential for positive impacts on fuel prices, particularly in rural and regional areas. Development of the downstream petroleum reform package, including the Oilcode, follows extensive consultation over the past four years with industry associations, industry, consumer groups, state and territory agencies and relevant Australian government portfolios. I would like to thank all of those who have provided valuable input into this process. I will speak for a moment about the amendments proposed by the member for Batman. He has moved some amendments requiring government action on alternative fuels. While he is one of the opposition's more progressive members, he is behind the times on the issue. Mr Martin Ferguson-Don't you shake.",27
6,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"I would have said that anyway, but they've written it in here. We like his policy on uranium and particularly on nuclear energyMr Martin Ferguson-What about flowthrough shares?",28
7,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"We should not digress. No government ever has done more to support alternative fuel than ours and we are now seeing results. By 5 pm last night, the AusIndustry hotline had fielded some 3,800 calls from motorists looking for information on the LPG initiative that the Prime Minister had announced the day before. Yesterday, BP announced that it was increasing ethanol sales in Queensland, with a projected target of an eight-fold increase. The Australian government is keen to offer as many choices as practical to the motorist. We believe that these reforms to the retail petroleum sector will aid those choices and help make them more affordable to motorists. We cannot support the opposition's amendments, which serve no purpose. We commend the bill to the House. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Martin Ferguson's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [9.31 am] (The Speaker-Hon.

Schedule 1A – Amendments to deal with abuse of market power, unconscionable conduct and price monitoring in relation to petroleum marketing Trade Practices Act 1974 1 Subsection 46(1) After “taking advantage”, insert “, in that or any other market, “. 2 After subsection 46(1A) Insert: (1B) In determining whether a corporation has a substantial degree of market power the court will take into account the following principles: (a) the threshold of ‘a substantial degree of power in a market' is lower than the former threshold of substantial control; and (b) the substantial market power threshold does not require a corporation to have an absolute freedom from constraint – it is sufficient if the corporation is not constrained to a significant extent by competitors or suppliers; and (c) more than one corporation can have a substantial degree of power in a market; and (d) evidence of a corporation's behaviour in the market is relevant to a determination of substantial market power. 3 After subsection 46(2) Insert: (2A) In determining for the purpose of this section whether a corporation has a substantial degree of power in a market, the Court may consider the corporation's degree of power in a market to include any market power arising from any contracts, arrangements, understandings or covenants, whether formal or informal, which the corporation has entered into with other entities. 4 After subsection 46(3) Insert: (3A) In determining for the purposes of this section whether a corporation (a) has a substantial degree of power in a market; or (b) has taken advantage of that power for a purpose described in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c); the court may have regard to the capacity of the corporation, relative to other corporations in that or any other market, to sell in that or any other market good or service at a price below the cost to the corporation of producing or acquiring the good or supplying the service. 5 Before paragraph 51AC(3)(a) Insert: (aa) whether the supplier imposed or utilised contract terms allowing the unilateral variation of any contracts between the supplier and business consumer; and 6 Before paragraph 51AC(4)(a) Insert: (aa) whether the acquirer imposed or utilised contract terms allowing the unilateral variation or any contract between the acquirer and small business supplier; and 7 After section 95ZE Insert: 95ZEA Direction may be given to Commission (1) A House of the Parliament, a Committee of a House, or a Committee of both Houses of the Parliament may give the Commission a written direction; (a) to monitor prices, costs and profits relating to the supply of goods or services by persons in a specified industry; and (b) to provide to the Parliament a report on the monitoring at a specified time or at specified intervals within a specified period. (2) The Commission must, in preparing such a report, have regard to the need for commercial confidentiality. (3) The Commission must make copies of the report available for public inspection as soon as practicable after it vides Parliament with the report. Labor's support for the repeal of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act and the consequential Petroleum Retail Marketing Frana chise Act is a great leap of faith. It is a leap of faith in the hopeful belief that an unregulated market will work better, more efficiently and more effectively than a market regulated by an antiquated piece of legislation now 26 years old, written and designed for another era. But we are not just taking a leap of faith. Our support for the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006, as indicated by the member for Batman, is predicated on the government's indication that it will finally bring forward amendments to the Trade Practices Act which will protect consumers and of course protect this market. In other words, we do not mind an unregulated market in the modern sphere but, at the same time, we do not believe that adequate protection for small business, independent petrol station operators and consumers will be present without the strengthening of the Trade Practices Act, specifically part IV and, even more specifically, section 46. People will not be surprised, given the events of this week, when we saw the illusion of what was being portrayed by the Prime Minister as a plan to bring petrol prices down, that, in the context of that, we are not just going to take the government at its word. This morning I have moved those amendments that Labor believe are necessary to also bring the Trade Practices Act into the modern era. This is what these amendments do. This is an unusual bill; it is a repeal bill. It gives the opposition scope to move amendments to any other bill, and that is what we have done this morning-moved appropriate amendments to the Trade Practices Act to ensure proper protections are in place. Whilst the Minister for Industry, Tourpro- ism and Resources-who is in the House at the moment-and I might disagree at the margins on what form those amendments should take, I know the minister agrees and I think the majority of the government agree. I know the Independents agree.",29
11,Dr EMERSON,NOES,I agree.,31
12,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"Of course. Not only is it time that we should modernise the regulatory regime covering retail petrol but it is also time we modernise the Trade Practices Act. This is not something we have just created. The necessity to modernise the Trade Practices Act flows from a number of Federal Court and High Court decisions, each of which demonstrates that the legislature's intention in designing and framing the Trade Practices Act has not been achieved. You will find that in the comments of the justices presiding in each of the cases, in particular as they relate to the test of substantial market power in the case of Boral. You will find it in the finding that a firm with market power has taken advantage of that market power in a case such as Safeway. This is clear. I recall that the chairman of the ACCC at a recent Senate committee hearing on these issues himself agreed that the legislature's intention in framing and putting through these acts of parliament in this place had not been achieved. But this is not just about petrol retailing, as important as that is. It is about protecting small business in a range of sectors from larger predators and it is about protecting consumers from the consequences of the antics of those larger predators. The world has moved on substantially, but some things always remain the same. In an industrial agreement, the bargaining power between an employer and an employee will never be equal and the same applies to small business. A small business can compete with a larger retailer on a level playing field, but if the larger competitor is willing-and they are in the minority-to misuse his market power then it is not on a level playing field. It is bad for small business and it is bad for the consumer. I challenge the government on this occasion to get up today and support Labor's amendments.",31
13,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,NOES,"I rise to speak in support of the amendment moved by the member for Hunter. In doing so, can I firstly echo the comments made by the member for Hunter. Not only has the Labor Party taken the government on trust but also, perhaps more importantly, has the Australian community. We all accept, as the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources said in his second reading speech, that the fuel market in Australia has changed dramatically in recent times with the entry of the major retail chains Coles and Woolworths. It has taken the government many years and many ministers to finally bring forward this legislation. The opposition has always been supportive of trying to work out a modern structure for an entirely different industry from that which existed when the legislation before the House was first approved. In that context and further to the comments by the member for Hunter with respect to the Trade Practices Act, on behalf of the opposition, the Independents and the Australian community, I remind the government of undertakings given in negotiations around this package with respect to other changes to the Trade Practices Act for which we need public reaffirmation today. The undertaking was that the government accepts a need to introduce further reform to the Trade Practices Act, to implement its response as soon as is practicable not only to the Dawson report but also to a range of other aspects of the act. These include, firstly, to provide that a corporation must not take advantage of a substantial degree of power in that or in any other market; secondly, to provide that, for the purposes of determining the degree of the power that a corporation has in a market, the court may have regard to any market power the corporation has that results in contracts, arrangements or understandings with others; thirdly, to include two new elements to be considered in relation to a breach of section 46 which could include whether a corporation was selling relevant goods or services at a price below cost and whether a corporation had a reasonable prospect or expectation of recoupment, that is, to recover the losses it suffered by selling at a price that is below cost. In that context, the opposition has been willing to support the endeavours of the government. In those negotiations, I have dealt at first hand with the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. As a former trade union official, I have always operated on the basis that a shake of the hand must be honoured. I therefore have respect for and accept his word. It is more important-because ministers and shadow ministers come and gothat these requirements as to specific further amendments are recorded publicly as an expression of a view and acceptance by government and opposition as to what is to be done. I seek that undertaking and will then seek to make some additional comments with respect to the amendment moved by the member for Hunter.",31
14,Mr KATTER,NOES,"Kennedy) (9.47 am)Some people may want to become famous and be deeply appreciated by the people, such as John MCEwen in Australia. In the United States ‘Teddy' Theodore was famous for three things, one of which was that he broke up Rockefeller's control of the oil industry. When I went to university, albeit briefly, we were taught in economics that, if there is a monopoly, supply and demand does not work and, if there is an oligopoly, supply and demand does not work either. Oligopoly means there are very few buyers or sellers. In this case, there are very few sellers: there are only four sellers in Australia and that is called an oligopoly. We have great free-traders on both sides of the House. The ALP has to come clean and say they were the champions of free trade. They started all of this rubbish. If they want to talk about economic principles, I wish they would read about it and acquire a little bit of knowledge. Maybe a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing in the case of people in this place. Supply and demand determines priceread Paul Samuelson's textbook Economics-only when there is an infinite number of buyers and sellers. We have four sellers here. I do not speak from a lack of knowledge on this. When a colleague of mine-and I do not hesitate to say that he is a good friendNeil Turner, in the Queensland state house, and I decided we had had enough and that we disagreed with the direction of the party leadership, we had discussions with Venezuelans. They said, ‘Don't worry about the price.' We said we would have to bring in a 30,000-tonne tanker and find, at that time, nearly $20 million, which would be difficult. They said, ‘Don't worry about that. We will stoke you for two or three months, but we will not do that unless we have a guarantee from the Queensland government that there will be a minimum price because every time we send a tanker load to compete against the majors they drop the price and we are left with the petrol, regardless of the agreements with the people we distribute to.' People just broke the agreements and would not take the petrol. Because of the fear that the majors would drop the price if anyone else tried to get into the ball game, what was needed was a minimum price. To bring the price of petrol down you needed a minimum price, but without that protection in the market, without some involvement by government in the marketplace, there is no way anyone is going to pay $30 million for a tanker load. What happened to John Newman on bringing in ethanol from Brazil? He lost literally millions of dollars. I supported the government in trying to stop Brazilian ethanol coming into Australia. Clearly, you can buy ethanol through the bowser in Brazil at 68c. When we say we have a free market operating in this country, why can we not get it here at 68c? I will tell you why: because we have an oligopoly. You just broke whatever power you had to restrain the majors. Australia has been very unfair to the Fraser government, particularly to Doug Anthony, who put in place this protection to try to overcome the oligopoly situation. I would say that they did not go far enough, but the fact is that they made an effort. The current government and I regret to say here the opposition-and I applaud what they are attempting to do here-cannot fool around with the oil companies. It is like Woolworths and Coles. I am sorry: you can put whatever you like in the Trade Practices Commission but their power and control in this country are such that those laws will never be enforced. In fact, the antitrust legislationMr Martin Ferguson-It was Theodore!",32
15,Mr KATTER,NOES,"No, not Theodore. I am wrong there. I was talking about Roosevelt. That was a slip of the tongue, but I can see where my mind was going. Roosevelt did not introduce the antitrust law. In fact, he was the one who enforced it. (Time expired)",33
16,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"Hunter) (9.52 am)On my first, limited contribution to the debate on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 I spoke about the first aspect of Labor's amendments. Those amendments were designed to restore the Trade Practices Act to its former glory and in particular to provide the ACCC with the capacity to show, firstly, that a firm has a substantial degree of market power and, secondly, that it has taken advantage of that market power. The second tranche of my amendments are just as important. They provide the power to either house of this parliament or to any committee of this parliament to refer to the ACCC the power it requires to undertake formal monitoring of prices in any market. However, my amendments are about the petroleum retail market. We have been calling upon the Treasurer for weeks now to pick up a pen and a piece of paper and to simply write to the Chairman of the ACCC, Graeme Samuel, to provide him with the powers that he requires to formally monitor petrol prices and to demand from oil companies, or any other retailers or wholesalers, the information he needs to determine whether price gouging is taking place. It is not a big thing to ask. We do not understand why he will not do it-whether he is protecting someone, whether he does not want a particular company or companies exposed or whether he will not do it simply because it was the opposition's idea. I am not sure which of those it is. It will not cost him anything. It is not a difficult thing to do, and he has plenty of support staff-in fact, I wrote the letter for him and invited him to put it on his letterhead, sign it and send it off. But he refused to do so. The question has to be asked: why do we want the Treasurer to solely hold the power to make these decisions? I can understand why the legislature, in the beginning, wanted to put in some protection and to not allow the ACCC chairman to act alone to decide at any time that he will have an inquiry into someone or something. You can understand the legislature wanting safeguards, which is why the opposition have resisted the temptation to simply give the chairman the power to run off and have an inquiry into any matter he wants or to demand information from any company because it suits him. But at the same time, we do not believe it should be the sole domain of the Treasurer. We believe that if a house of this parliament or a committee of this parliament has formed the view that there is something not quite right in any particular market-and in this instance we have petrol in mind-that committee or that house of the parliament should be able to refer that power to the chairman. It is a simple proposition and it is a responsible proposition. If we had suggested that the chairman should have that power without it being referred, the government would have had an opportunity to put up an argument and to oppose us. But it cannot argue against this proposition that we have put forward. How can the government possibly argue that a house of this place or a committee of this place should not have the power, having heard the evidence, to refer to the chairman of the ACCC that power? There is plenty of reason to refer the power. The evidence is not conclusive but there is plenty of evidence in the petroleum retail market that something is not quite right. Every motorist in this country instinctively believes as they watch the weekly price cycle that something is not right. In end it might not be proven, but let us have the inquiry. Let us give the ACCC chairman the power not just to look at retail prices. We can all look at the price board and form our own opinion about what petrol prices are doing, but it does not tell us anything about what is happening along the value chain. It does not tell us anything about what is happening to wholesale prices or to terminal gate prices. It does not tell us anything. The ACCC chairman needs to look not just at the prices but behind the prices. How disappointing was it when the Prime Minister came in here with his great illusion this week-with great fanfare-to announce his energy policy? He could not even swallow his pride and say: ‘I think the opposition and the Independents have it right. It is time to give the ACCC chairman the chance he requires to potentially have an immediate impact on petrol prices and to finally give motorists and their families and business some relief from spiralling petrol prices. (Time expired)",33
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The question is that the amendments be agreed to. I call the honourable member for Fraser.,34
18,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"Fraser) (9.57 am)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was temporarily distracted by the whip, who was helping me. I rise to support the amendments moved by the member for Hunter, particularly insofar as they relate to the issues of abuse of market power and unconscionable conduct. These are amendments of general application. It is particularly appropriate in the immediate case that they apply to the area of petrol, and that is why the amendments are being initiated here. I welcome that and support that but, in the years in which I have been dealing with this matter, it has become more and more evident that secthe tion 46 is the gap in the trade practices regime of this country. It is the gap in the competition regulation of this country. The former head of the ACCC, Allan Fels, made it clear that he thought that while in every other area there might be need for some finetuning, the Trade Practices Act in Australia works very well. In my view it is in some sense an international leader, but there is a gaping hole that relates to this issue of abuse of market power and unconscionable conduct, typified by section 46 and to a lesser degree section 51. The High Court's determinations, which in hindsight are probably correct, have clearly led to the situation where the original intention of the Trade Practices Act-to deal with questions of abuse of market power by major corporations to the original disadvantage of small business and the ultimate disadvantage of consumers-has not been implemented, because the act has been read down to a degree that makes it relatively ineffective. The member for Hunter referred to the case of Boral, which is the most infamous of examples. What we need to deal with here are a range of issues which are addressed in the amendments. In the long-term, there will probably need to be more, but these are very substantial and deal with the most important issues with regard to the following: the threshold test for determining whether a corporation has a substantial degree of market power; the question of power in more than one market; the question of agreements entered into which can, when taken into account, constitute an agreement that provides the potential to abuse market power; and two criteria. The first criterion is the capacity sell at below cost, which is evidence of abuse of market power, not in one case-anyone can have a loss leader-but in a continuing, ongoing manner that causes detriment to small competitors and drives them out, which was the principle behind the Boral case. The second criterion-and I want to concentrate on this in the last minute or twowhich the amendments address directly, is the capacity for unilateral variation of contracts. There is nothing more evident of an imbalance in market power than the capacity for unilateral variation of contracts. Who would willingly enter into a contract that says, ‘Yes, we agree these are fair terms but you can change them whenever you feel like it'? No-one would intelligently enter into that-no worker, but they are being forced to do so under the industrial relations legislation; and no small business, but they are forced to do so time and again. If only one of these amendments were picked up-and I support all of them-it should be the capacity to deal with unilateral variation. This would transform the lives of franchisees and small businesspeople around this country, particularly those in the petroleum industry. If we are going to have respect for free market capitalism in this country, we need to create a framework for handling the imbalance of market power between small and large business and between employer and employee. It is the failure to realise that that lies at the heart of the government's failure to address this hole in the Trade Practices Act. It lies at the heart of the refusal to make the referral to which the member for Hunter refers, because the government cannot tell the difference between the interests of the largest Australian companies, which lobby against all these changes, and the interests of the economy. (Time expired)",34
19,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"I to support strongly the amendments moved by the member for Hunter and seconded by the member for Batman. These are amendments to the Trade Practices Act that affect the Australian economy more broadly but that specifically arise in relation to concerns about anti-competitive behaviour in the petroleum retail industry. They are pro-competitive amendments and, given that the government is supposed to be a party that supports competition and free enterprise, I would strongly urge it to support these amendments. They are well considered; they have been developed over a long period of time. If the coalition government truly is a party of competition and free enterprise then it should support the amendments. We will all be very interested to hear from the minister during the summing up of this consideration in detail debate. The amendments deal more effectively with the abuse of market power and predatory pricing. There has been an emergence of greater competition in many aspects of the petroleum industry. Initially, after the establishment of the market by the ‘big four' multinational oil companies, that competitive influence was brought to bear through the entry of independents. They have done a service to Australia in behaving as a competitive alternative to the major suppliers. More recently, the emergence of Coles and Woolworths supermarkets, through the shopperdocket arrangements, have provided extra competition. But that is no guarantee whatsoever that the entire industry is going to behave competitively. Indeed, you would have to suspect that the areas in which anti-competitive behaviour might be more evident would be in remote and regional markets where the market is more segmented and there is not the flowthrough of traffic and, therefore, the influences of competition. But even that does not mean that in major urban markets we are assured of competitive behaviour in all circumstances. A number of commentators and many parliamentarians point to fluctuations in prices during the course of a week as a source of concern. I would say that that does not of itself prove anti-competitive behaviouralthough the popular conception is that, when retailers put their prices up and down at the same time during the week, that must constitute evidence of anti-competitive behaviour. However, it can be. It is possible that they can get together and agree to put their prices up or down to the same extent. We should be concerned about this sort of practice, but we have to look behind what has actually happened. One of the deficiencies of the Trade Practices Act, including section 46, is the burden of evidence that needs to be brought to prove that there has been anti-competitive pricing. As speakers on the Labor side have pointed out, the courts have tended to rule against Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on this. There was a recent court case where circumstantial evidence was not allowed, even though the circumstances seemed to be providing quite strong evidence of anti-competitive pricing and anti-competitive behaviour. The member for Hunter has moved amendments that would give greater power to the ACCC to look behind some of the behaviour that goes on and to determine whether in fact predatory pricing or anticompetitive behaviour has occurred. On that basis, I would be bewildered if the government did not see merit in these amendments; therefore, I would strongly urge it to adopt the amendments moved by the member for Hunter and seconded by the member for Batman.",35
20,Mr WINDSOR,NOES,"We are talking about an important issue today. It is a great shame that it had to be brought in on the back of the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006. It is also a great shame that government members-and I understand the structure of third reading debates-are not participating in this debate, given the issues. It is a shame that the amendments will get voted down, strictly along party lines. I would be interested to hear the comments of the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources on the substance of the issues being raised, such as unconscionable conduct in petroleum marketing, and the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Hunter to the Trade Practices Act. It is also a shame that members have not had the benefit of time to examine these amendments more closely to determine their impact on the operations of the Trade Practices Act. I ask the minister to take this debate seriously, and to address some of the issues. I ask the government the whether it has any intentions in the future, perhaps in another vein, to addressMr Fitzgibbon-He's going to read the amendments now.",36
21,Mr WINDSOR,NOES,"Well, that is a start. I am pleased to see that the minister is moving towards addressing some of these issues. I hope he takes them seriously. Even though these amendments will probably get voted down, along party lines, I hope the issues will be addressed in another fashion. The member for Rankin raised the issue of the independents creating competitive pressures in the petroleum industry. I draw to the minister's attention some of my concerns. Last week the government announced some significant changes in energy policy. Two of the fuel companies, Caltex and BP, announced they were going to cut the price of E10-ethanol 10 per cent fuel-at certain service stations across Australia. Many people assumed this was a cut in the wholesale price. There has been a 3c cut in the retail price at some service stations. I have been buying E10 fuel from a small independent retailer in a small community who retails Bogas, or Caltex E10 fuel, and has for about six or seven years. I called in there the day after this great announcement that the price of E10 was being dropped by 3c, having heard the government commend itself for not having had to mandate the use of E10 to achieve this great outcome of the 3c discount in price. My retailer, who has been selling ethanol for at least six to seven years, and buying from those same companies, had just received an invoice increasing the wholesale price of E10 by 1.8c a litre. That highlights some of the underlying issues we should be debating, not only in terms of petroleum products, but where the might of the corporation can overcome the competitive aspects for the independent players in the field. Some of those issues may be raised again when the media ownership debate comes forward. The member for Rankin also said that we need to examine the amendments the member for Hunter has put forward to see whether we have the opportunity to look behind the scenes at the behaviour of the fuel companies and how they operate. The member for Hunter mentioned a moment ago that there is no real transparency in terminal gate pricing. There is great inconsistency in the way wholesale prices are reported. (Extension of time granted) The consumer is in a haze when trying to ascertain the retail and wholesale price levels of fuel, the country/city issues, the terminal gate price issues, the various margins that apply at certain times in the week and on public holidays, et cetera. There is no real transparency in those issues. The member for Rankin said we should have an instrument that can look behind the scenes at that behaviour. In this place in recent months we have changed the electoral laws so that we cannot look at the behaviour of some of the major corporations in terms of their political activities by way of donations. I do not mean to get off the trackMr Katter-Spot on! That is the track.",36
22,Mr WINDSOR,NOES,"The member for Kennedy, quite rightly, says that in his view that is the track. We need the capacity for transparency. If we are talking about the Trade Practices Act and transparency in the pricing and other behaviour of major corporations, including fuel companies, and all their international connections, surely we must look in our own backyard-at who is paying the piper. The ethanol debate is a classic example. It is a shame that the minister has been caught up in this, but there is absolutely no doubt that the fuel companies are calling the tune. We traditionally follow the United States in nearly everything we do. The United States has recognised that its population cannot be reliant long term on the Middle East and others for the provision of energy, and it is starting to address those issues through renewable energy and other activities. The United States is invading the marketplace and putting in place policy that actually drives the energy debate, rather than-as we would do; as we are doing now-allowing the fuel companies, which are international corporations, to drive the debate for it. I think that is a great failing on the part of government. The LPG business the other day-and it is a bit like the way you cannot criticise your mother-is not going to do much good. I think everybody recognises that. Even if, at the end of the day, people did accept that the government would not change the taxation regime in the future, that the fuel companies were all going to play a straight game and not gouge the price and that the fitters of the additional equipment, the cylinders et cetera, would not profiteer on the way through, there is a whole range of uncertainties there. The consumer, the customer, has seen the government put in place in 2001 a renewable energy policy, some mandatory renewable energy targets for renewable fuels. Six years later, we are producing less than we were when we started the policy. To the Labor Party's shame, too, I notice in their second reading amendment that they are still talking about 350,000 megalitres-less than one per cent of the fuel needs of the nation. The rest of the world is marching on, and we are still playing games with old numbers from 2001: 350,000 megalitres of renewable energy. I think the member for Kennedy mentioned in a speech the other night-a very good speech too, I thought-that we are at about 30,000. There is no way that even the targets that the Prime Minister set out during his cup of coffee with the fuel companies last year have been achieved. They were supposed to be achieved by the end of June or July, I think it was. There is no way that the 2006 targets have been achieved. It is obvious to anybody in the marketplace that the fuel companies in this country are not going to make any significant changes on renewable energy, ethanol and these other products unless there is a mandate such that it opens up the process of distribution through the bowsers. There is no this way that those companies are going to do that. Take a look at America and see what they have done in the States. They recognise that at a policy level. They are agripoliticians, they are state and federal politicians, and they put in place mandates which forced the fuel companies to accept the product and start to market it through the normal processing chain, for a whole range of health, environmental and other reasons. They have had an enormous impact on the agricultural sector and the renewable energy sector. The fuel companies now embrace it in the States. The car companies now embrace it. We could do the same. (Time expired)",37
23,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,NOES,"As is evidenced by the participation on this side of the House, we regard this debate as exceptionally important. I will tell you why. I think this debate reflects sadly on the government's performance generally. The basis of the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 is to reflect a new legislative regime in response to what we all believe is a major change in the structure of the Australian retail petroleum industry. The view of the whole parliament was that we required legislation, because we had an understanding that the new structure of the petroleum industry in Australia was out of step with the legislative framework. It was our view that the legislative framework potentially created a subcompetitive retail environment, as the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources said in his second reading speech, which potentially imposed higher costs on Australian industry and consumers. That is important at the moment because it is at a time of record high oil prices. We all appreciate that there is no immediate solution to the issue of record high oil prices cause of a variety of factors, including a huge demand in developing countries such as China, with India yet to come on stream. I am therefore utterly amazed that, given that on Monday this week the Prime Minister saw fit to make a prime ministerial statement to the Australian community-not just to the Australian parliament but to the Australian community-on the issue of energy, with a special focus on transport fuels and that statement went to a total of 23 pages. It with a range of new options, such as an appropriate government focus on trying to spread the use of LPG in the Australian motoring community-and another push, can I say in response to the member for New England, for the ethanol and biofuels industry. Unfortunately, in terms of the ethanol industry, there is no capacity for government to direct sugar producers in Australia to turn their sugar production towards ethanol and thereby receive a lower price than they are receiving internationally at the moment for the sale of their sugar. In some ways, some issues in Australia are driven by market forces. I would have thought that the member for New England would have understood them, because he prides himself on representing the private sector in the Australian community. But-having said that-this is a key debate. I would have thought that, given the nature of this legislation, in association the Prime Minister's major statement to the Australian community about transport fuel in Australia, there would be some interest in this debate on the government side of the House. I raise this very seriously, because there is no doubt in my mind that, over the next couple of weeks, in all the coalition seats around Australia, all of a sudden, glossy publications will appear in the Austrabelian householder's letterbox or alternatively in the local newspapers. It is interesting to note, in terms of that self-promotion out in the Australian community, that all of a sudden we received an email from the Special Minister of State last night, saying, ‘Government has now resolved that you haven't got enough to spend on publications.' With no justification, our publications allowance has been increased overnight from $125,000 per annum for each seat in dealt Australia to $150,000 per annum, with a carry over of roughly 45 per cent in an election year, effectively meaning that in an election year you will have over $200,000 per year of taxpayers' money to spend on promoting your re-election. Rather than spending their time sitting in their offices over the last couple of days preparing those publications, which are provided by a government media unit to circulate throughout the whole Australian community at taxpayers' expense, I would have thought that government members could have found some time to come into the House to debate this major legislation and also to express their views about the appropriateness of the Prime Minister's ministerial statement on Monday on transport fuels.",38
24,Mr LLOYD,NOES,Look behind you. You don't seem to have much support there!,39
25,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,NOES,"In that context, as raised by the Minister for Local with Government, Territories and Roads, who is participating in this debate, let us see who was sitting behind one another. The second reading motion was moved, appropriately, by the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. It is interesting to note that, on the government's side, there are 87 members yet only two members of the backbench deemed it appropriate to come into the House and speak in support not only of this legislation but also of the Prime Minister's statement on transport fuels. Three spoke in total. That is equivalent to the number of Independents who spoke in this debate, and there are only three in this House. Then we go to the opposition, and the minister for local government wants to raise the issue of the willingness of members to come into this House. (Extension of time granted) Mr Katter interjecting",39
26,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,NOES,"I am sure the member for Kennedy is going to be given the call again, because I know he makes a worthwhile contribution to these debates. Let us go to the opposition. Interestingly, we have 60 members in the House; 23 of our caucus participated in this lower house debate-that is, over a third of our caucus participated in what we regard as a major debate. I will tell you why. This is not only a debate about the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 but also a broadranging debate about transport fuels and, perhaps more importantly and even more broadly, transport, oil security and energy security in Australia generally. It is for that reason we have moved further amendments. The Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources has indicated to me he will be making some comments in respect of the issues I previously raised, going to the reform of the Trade Practices Act and the outcome of negotiations between the government and the opposition. The member for Hunter has sought to move an amendment to beef up the government's legislation and to keep the finger on the industry and on government with respect to the application of this legislation in tical form. This is important, because the legislation also includes a new mandatory oil code. That mandatory oil code will seek to achieve a number of key objectives. Firstly, it will allow collective bargaining amongst independents to give them more market power. Secondly, it will introduce terminal gate pricing arrangements that are supposedly to provide greater transparency in wholesale pricing and open access to all customers. Thirdly, it will establish minimum standards for fuel reselling. Fourthly, it will establish an independent and cost-effective downstream petroleum dispute resolution scheme in Australia. The opposition support the intent of that oil code, and that is why we support the repeal of the current petroleum retail legislation. It goes hand in hand with not only the undertakings given by the government to the opposition on potential reform of the Trade Practices Act but also the additional issues raised by the member for Hunter. Our amendment is about further improving the whole range of legislation that goes to protecting the Australian consumer and making sure the petroleum retail industry is competitive. For that reason, just as we have to from time to time check up on all aspects of life, we believe that the Trade Practices Act ought to be given some additional powers. That takes me not to the performance of the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources but to the non-performance of the Treasurer. The outstanding trade practices legislation does not sit in the responsibilities of the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources but solely with those of the Treasurer. It ought to be the Treasurer in the House today, not the minister for industry, addressing this issue. It is his responsibility. The worry of the opposition goes to the manner in which the Treasurer undertakes a prachis duties. I want to make some specific comments about these issues. The opposition's very firm view is that the Treasurer has been sitting on his hands for three years. We say that because he has failed, despite numerous requests-not just from the member for Hunter but from a range of people in the Australian community, especially the business community-to introduce the 2003 Dawson recommendations and 2004 Senate recommendations on trade practices reform. He likes to talk about how he is assisting Australian industry. I tell you what: Australian industry is crying out for this legislation, and it is sick and tired of the nonperformance of the Treasurer and his failure to bring forward this legislation. We contend, as business says to us privately, it reflects height of laziness not just of the government but perhaps more importantly of the Treasurer himself. I believe this is exceptionally important. It is not just about industry. It is also about the rights and responsibilities of this government to Australian consumers. We are elected to this parliament to try and do our best for the people we represent, and that includes Australian consumers. I believe Australian consumers deserve more from this government, not only in relation to petroleum marketing but across the board. I go to the Dawson and Senate recommendations. Those recommendations go to the crux of the debate before the House today, because they refer to strengthening section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. (Extension of time granted) That strengthening of section 46 is exceptionally important, because section 46 goes to the abuse of market power. That is what this legislation is about. It is about a change in structure of the petroleum retail industry to make sure we avoid an abuse of market power. That is about trying to make sure that we conduct ourselves so as to look after the interests of consumers in an appropriate way. It is not just about the retail sector of the petroleum industry; it goes across the industry generally. In broad terms we accept that the government supports the strengthening of section 46. We want to see the colour of its legislation. I do not think we are asking for too much. We are simply asking to see the outcome of the Treasurer's work. Surely it is sitting on the Treasurer's desk at this time. I say this to the Treasurer today. Get your act together. Your performance to date with respect to these key proposals is unacceptable. It is unacceptable to the Australian community, it is unacceptable to business and it is unacceptable to this parliament. That is why we call on the government today to support the opposition's section 46 the amendments as moved by the member for Hunter. I will tell you why they are important. These amendments seek to allow a court to take into account these key principles which go to the basis of a free enterprise system, one that prides itself on the independence of the market: firstly, that the threshold of a substantial degree of power in a market is lower than the former threshold of substantial control; secondly, that the substantial market power threshold does not require a corporation to have an absolute freedom from constraint, it is sufficient if the corporation is not constrained to a significant extent by competitors or suppliers; thirdly, that more than one corporation can have a substantial degree of power in a market; and, fourthly, that evidence of a corporation's behaviour in the market is relevant to a determination of substantial market power. These principles must be enshrined in legislation. We depend on the independence of the courts, but it is a requirement of the government to give the courts the power to actually act. We are about beefing up some weaknesses in the existing legislation, as is the responsibility of legislators. The government have not taken into account these factors, which seem very fair and clear to me. If you want an example of that, just go to the Boral case referred to by the member for Hunter. The other important point is that the government should ask the ACCC to formally monitor petrol prices-what is wrong with that?-and accordingly report every six months on price movements, particularly in regional Australia; which is so often spoken about by not only the member for Lyons but also the members for Kennedy, New England and Calare, the Independents who have appropriately spoken in this debate. I am at a loss to understand why the government is opposed to this concept. It is about transparency and accountability. That is what the minister in his second reading speech said the change in the legislation is about; it is about a new competitive model guaranteeing transparency and accountability. Last year the best explanation the competitive watchdog could come up with was, and I quote, that ‘something funny is going on with refiner margins'. Let us give the appropriate authorities some capacity to actually make sure that ‘something funny' does not occur in the future. I simply say in conclusion that motorists deserve a better explanation. It is in the interests of industry and in the best interests government that we are able to prove what we argue in this House. After all it is the dustry's reputation that is being damaged as motorists blame them for price gouging-not just the government. In response to the Prime Minister's statement on transport fuels, could the minister advise-because I am sure that this work was done in the costings-what expected take-up the government sees for each of the next five financial years in LPG with respect to the conversion of vehicles and the production of new vehicles? What expected growth does it see in each of those five financial years in the spread of ethanol and biofuels? I do not think you need to mandate them; they will stand on their own feet if they remain price competitive. (Time expired)",40
27,Mr KATTER,NOES,"Kennedy) (10.33 am)We have heard an excellent contribution from the member for Batman, but unfortunately in two areas he was factually wrong. We receive $450 a tonne for sugar at the present moment. At current petrol prices that would reflect back to the sugar industry at $480 a tonne. But nobody in the industry believes remotely that we are going to stay at $450 a tonne. For the last five years we have been at $269 a tonne. I usually do my figures at $360 a tonne. We can give you petrol at a much cheaper price than you are getting it at the present moment. I have said repeatedly in this House, as we are screaming and crying about the price of petrol, that we should just bring in a tanker from Brazil. They retail petrol over there at 68c a litre. There is a distance factor involved so the equivalent price might be 75c. They are retailing it at 75c. It seems to be a point that I fail totally to get through. People say that I get passionate and forceful, but I do not know what I have to do to get it through to this parliament that that is the price over there. You can ring the Brazilians and find out. It may go up in sympathy of with the world petrol price; in fact I think it probably would. Our sugar has increased in in- price because the Brazilians have taken a lot of their cane out of sugar production and put it into oil production, which of course is much more lucrative and attractive. The point here is that the argument that would allow them in here is of no use. We are right now negotiating. There are no independents left in this country. We are informed that, on present trends, within two years 75 per cent of the market will be held by Caltex and Shell, and their partners Woolworths and Coles. The other 25 per cent are little fellas. You cannot set up an ethanol plant on the basis of getting contractual arrangements with 200 or 300 outlets. That is just not the real world. The only plant being built in Australia is being built by one of the major independents-that is the only way you are going to get it-and that major independent has now been bought out by Caltex. The government keeps preaching free enterprise, national competition policy. The Independents have come into this place and repeatedly asked-and ours are the only voices that do this-in which area did we get competition? We most certainly did not get it in petrol. We most certainly did not get it in airlines. We most certainly did not get it in transportation, which is down to about three companies in Australia now: Toll, Linfox and another one. Where exactly did we get this promised competition? In food retailing and supermarkets we are down to just two players with 82 per cent of the market. Back in 1990 they had only 50.5 per cent of the market. So it has failed miserably. I have great respect for the Prime Minister, but his policy of incentivism and moral suasion with respect to petrol in Australia failed miserably. The only answer out there, the only clear-cut answer, is what the member for New England and his area and my area can provide to Australia, which is petrol at a price under 80c a litre. We can do that right now, but we have to have somebody to sell it to. I ask members in this House to please understand that the oil companies do not buy at spot market prices. They own the oilwells. They have contractual obligations that date back 30 and 40 years in other cases. When we discussed it with the Venezuelans, they said: ‘Forget about price. Whatever the price is we can undercut it. Don't worry about the spot market price. That has nothing to do with the price of production.' It is something that all of us know. In this country we should know it, because when we had the price at the wellhead, it was $3 a barrel and the international spot price was $7 a barrel. There is no relationship between the price the oil companies buy at and what the world spot market price is. They are entitled, under the free market system-and I agree with that-to take the market price out there, but they are not entitled to close down the industry and not allow ethanol in.",42
28,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"This has been a wide-ranging and I think fruitful debate, and some very good points have been raised. I reinforce the fact that the opposition is heavily supportive of the alternative fuels industry, including LPG, ethanol, biodiesel and CNG, and of course we have been pushing hard for the establishment of a gas to liquids industry in this country. But this will turn out to be a very disappointing debate if the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources does not take the opportunity to answer some very important questions that we have posed throughout the course of the debate. Of course, the first question is: is he going to support our very important amendments to the Trade Practices has Act and, if not, why not? Secondly, is he going to support our attempt to extend the referral powers of the Treasurer to both houses of this parliament or to any parliamentary committee? Those are, of course, the referral powers to allow the chairman of the ACCC to inquire into prices-in this case, petrol prices-if he sees a prima facie case to do so. If not, why not? This is a very responsible approach on our part. The third question is just as important, if not more important. We need the industry minister to tell usMr Ian Macfarlane-Give me a chance, Joel.",43
29,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"We will give you a chance after I conclude. How many peopleand/or vehicles-does he expect will take up the government's LPG grant as announced in the Prime Minister's energy statement on Monday? This is a very important question, because we are assessing this fuels statement on the basis of its impact, on the basis of how many people it is likely to assist. We know it is not going to help anyone that is stuck on petrol. But, given the amount of money which has been allocated and given the framework which has been announced, how many people will have the opportunity to take up LPG and receive that grant? My back of the envelope calculation is about 400,000 out of 13 million. That equates to something less than three per cent of motor vehicles in any given electorate. That is three per cent or less in the electorates of Robertson, Dobell, Paterson, Parramatta, Adelaide and Braddon. In any seat you want to name, it is three per cent or less. I am happy for the industry minister to rise to his feet when I conclude this contribution and tell me that I am wrong, but I tell you what he needs to hope. He needs to hope I am very wrong. It is not much help to him if he gets up and says, ‘The member for Hunter is wrong to say it is less than three per cent; it is in fact three per cent' or it is four per cent or five per cent or even 10 per cent. It is not a very efficient fuels policy does no more than help even 10 per cent of those families and businesses that are bleeding out there because of the impact of high petrol prices. So, minister, we are issuing you with a very important challenge. Get up here to this dispatch box and tell us the answers. Are you supporting our trade practices amendments and, if not, why not? Are you supporting the expansion of the referral powers of the ACCC and, if not, why not? Are you going to tell us-we know you have got the numbers; it would be incompetent of the government if you did not have the numbershow many people are going to have an opportunity to access your LPG grants scheme? Of course, we would like some breakdowns by electorate as well if you have the capacity to give us that information. I have said this has been a free-ranging and productive debate. We know the government needs to move on to its legislative program, and we are prepared to be cooperative. I am prepared for this to be my last contribution to this debate. But, if we do not get the answers that we are looking for from the minister, we will have to get up again and again and again until he gives us the answers. So it is his turn now. Minister, just give us the answers we require. Tell us how many people will benefit from your LPG grants scheme.",43
30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Mr Quick)Before I call the minister, I would like to inform the chamber that it is my understanding that the minister will not be closing the debate.",44
31,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,NOES,"I thank those opposite for their contributions, misguided though most of them were. With respect to the question asked by the member for Hunter, I reif it mind him that if he reads the Prime Minister's statement-the one he describes as illusional, but then admits that there will be hundreds of thousands of motor cars converted to LPG by private motorists, without calculating the ones that will be converted and bought new by the business sector-in that area alone, the relief is going to be",44
32,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,NOES,"I have waited half an hour; I would prefer not to be interjected on while I try to answer the question. Those motorists who will benefit from LPG have the opportunity now to choose this as an alternative fuel. There is no cap on the scheme, there is no means test and there is no exclusion of vehicles. My understanding is that somewhere in excess of three million vehicles currently in the fleet can be converted to LPG. To save the member for Hunter doing his sums, that is about a third of the vehicles in the fleet. There are about 10 million vehicles out there. Of course, this is not the only part of the energy policy the Prime Minister announced on MondayMr Fitzgibbon-You haven't given us the number.",44
33,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,NOES,I cannot give the number because I cannot read the minds of those 3½ million vehicle ownersMr Fitzgibbon-How do you cost it if you don't have an estimate of how many?,45
34,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,NOES,"I cannot read the minds of those 3½ million owners as to whether they will support this proposal and use LPG as an alternative fuel and save money that way or use ethanol and take advantage of some of the discounts that are being offered there. The opposition has already admitted in this House that hundreds of thousands of vehicles will be converted to LPG as people take advantage of the scheme. I now turn to the ACCC powers that are being requested by the member for Hunter. The ACCC can take action under the Trade Practices Act 1974 if there is evidence of anticompetitive behaviour-and that includes anticompetitive behaviour in the fuel sector. Currently, the ACCC monitors petrol, diesel, ethanol, autogas and E10 prices in metropolitan areas and about 110 country areas across Australia. It can also undertake additional random monitoring in remote areas and will investigate complaints about prices whenever they are made. Anyone has the opportunity to refer such matters to the ACCC. The opposition is suggesting that we have another inquiry. We are currently in the middle of our 47th inquiry into fuel prices. As the Prime Minister said his speech on Monday, Australia enjoys prices which are comparable to the rest of the OECD countries, once you remove the excise, and, with excise on, we have the fourth cheapest fuel in the OECD. So the suggestion that Australians are paying more for their petrol than Europeans, Americans or Canadians is sheer nonsense. With regard to the section 46 proposals, the government is very keen to introduce legislation as soon as the Dawson legislation passes through the Senate-the very same legislation the opposition spoke of earlier and which was opposed by the Labor Party. The government amendments to section 46 in response to the member for Batman will clarify and improve the operation of the provisions of that act. Specifically, they will, firstly, state that a corporation which has a substantial degree of power in a market shall not take advantage of that power, in that or any other market, for any proscribed purpose in relation to that or any other market; and, secondly, they will clarify that, in determining the degree of power that a corporation has in the market, the courts may have regard to the power of the corporation in the market that results from contracts, arrangements or understandings, actual or proposed, with other parties or results from covenants that the corporation is bound by or entitled to benefit from. Thirdly, they will clarify that the matters set out in section 46, which the courts may have regard to in determining the degree of power the corporation has in the market, do not limit the matters the court may consider; and, fourthly, they will provide that, without limiting the generality of section 46, in determining whether a corporation has breached section 46 the courts may have regard to whether the corporation was supplying goods or services at a price less than the cost of such goods or services in and had a reasonable prospect or an expectation of being able to recover any losses incurred by supplying the goods or services at that price. I say again that we oppose the member for Hunter's amendments, which do not belong to this bill and will be dealt with after the passage of the Dawson trade practices bill through the Senate. I urge members to support the bill as introduced.",45
35,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,What a very disappointing response from the minister. I posed three tests for him. Will he support our important amendments to the Trade Practices Act? At least we got an answer: no. Will he support our proposition to expand the referral powers to the ACCC? It was a disappointing answer: no. At least we got an answer. But probably the most important question was a very specific one: how many people do the minister and his department expect to take up the opportunity to secure a grant for conversion to LPG? He completely squibbed that question. Let us not have this rubbish: ‘We don't know how many people might take up the opportunity,46
36,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,NOES,I move: That the question now be put. A division having been called and the bells having been rung minister allowed to interrupt the debate like that and move that the question be put?,46

43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Quick)Is the amendment seconded? Mr Martin Ferguson-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,48
44,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"I have just made a very broad-ranging debate much broader. This debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006 is now a very broad-ranging one that goes to just about any issue that members of this parliament want to raise. With this amendment, members should now feel free to speak on just about any issue they wish. We are repealing 4,100 pages of the Income Tax Assessment Act and measures that go to wholesale sales tax and FBT. My second reading amendment makes it even broader. I invite members on both sides of the parliament to be as broad ranging in their contributions on this bill as they wish.",48
45,Dr EMERSON,NOES,As long as they mention the word ‘tax'.,49
46,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"The member for Rankin is absolutely correct: as long as they mention the word ‘tax'. Tax on the people can come in many forms. I probably should have restricted my invitation to only members on my side, because there are not too many speakers on the other side. Mr Ciobo interjecting Mr Martin Ferguson-There's one!",49
47,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"Sorry, the member for Moncrieff is here. I also invite the member for Moncrieff to make a broad-ranging contribution to this debate and if, like the Special Minister of State, he wants to contradict the Prime Minister's energy statement, he should feel free to do so. I know he is not happy because, in the member for Moncrieff's electorate, less than three per cent his constituents will have the opportunity to take up the only initiative-that is, the LPG initiative-in John Howard's energy statement that may have brought his constituents some fuel cost relief. So I can understand why the member for Moncrieff would be disappointed in the energy statement. This is his opportunity to get up in the people's house, to properly represent his constituents and say so, as did the Special Minister of State yesterday when he belled the cat on the Prime Minister's energy statement. I hope the Prime Minister was reflecting, as he drove in this morning, in his chauffeurdriven, taxpayer funded, petrol-driven limousine, on his ‘Let them eat cake' approach. You can imagine him, waving his hand, as the royals tend to do, in his petrol-powered limousine, saying to all others-other than maybe less than three per cent in each electorate-‘Let them eat cake. Let them queue for their LPG conversion, then let them queue for their grant.' I am not yet sure whether that will be one day, two days, two weeks or three months. Certainly, if they get the conversion next week it would be a miracle, if they were not already booked in but, if they get it next week they will have to wait until after 1 October to claim the cost back. So there is a huge cash flow issue. But the Prime Minister does not care. He is not affected by any of these measures. If he were serious about LPG, he would have done something about the Commonwealth's own fleet. It is a case of ‘Let them eat cake, I'm happy in my petrol powered car; let the others line up for the opportunity to convert to LPG..' What a disgraceful approach to the pressing energy reform issues that are facing this country-our import dependency; our spiralling cost of fuel, and the tax that is attached; and, the impact that is having on Australian families, individuals, not to menof tion Australian business, small, medium and large. So I invite the member for Moncrieff to reflect on those points and respond, if he wishes, on behalf of the government. It is up to him, because he is the only one who came in. Can you believe that, despite the fact that the opposition had about 20 speakers on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006-a critical piece of legislation, which goes directly to petrol prices in this country-there is one speaker on the government side? Were they scared to get up in this place and take the Prime Minister on? Or, even worse, were they told by their whip that they were not entitled to speak on this bill because the government did not want a recurrence of what happened with the Special Minister of State, who belled the cat, who exposed the illusion of the Prime Minister's energy plan? There is one speaker on such an important bill, a bill on which we had foreshadowed some very important amendments to the Trade Practices Act, which would have protected small businesses and consumers generally not just in petrol retailing across the board. It was an opportunity for government members to support that amendment. Another important amendment is the one that will take away this restrictive idea that only the Treasurer should have the power to empower the ACCC to investigate what is happening with not only petrol prices but prices in addition to petrol prices. We believe that not just the Treasurer but any house of this parliament or any committee of this parliament which sees a prima facie case that something is wrong in a market, particularly petrol, can refer to the ACCC the power it needs not just to look at prices but to look behind prices. More particularly, the big disappointment here was the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. We asked him a very simple question: how many people around the country, and in individual electorates, will take up his LPG offer? He would not give us the answer. We know he knows the answer, but he refuses to give it because it is embarrassing. Mr Ciobo-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Mr Speaker: I believe the member for Hunter may be confused about which bill we are debating. This has absolutely no relevance to the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006. It is a lame attempt by the member for Hunter to fill in his half hour. I ask you to bring him back to relevance.",49
48,Dr EMERSON,NOES,This is a second reading debate.,50
49,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Quick)There is no point of order. The member for Hunter will get back to talking about tax laws and their repeal.,50
50,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"The member for Rankin is absolutely correct. The member for Moncrieff should have a look at how wideranging the bill is. The second reading but right amendment makes it even more wideranging. Out of respect for the House, I am going to move from this issue very quickly and close by saying this. The minister and the Prime Minister have costed their energy plan. In particular, they have costed the LPG grant. Therefore, it is obvious to anyone who knows anything about finance and how the Commonwealth budget works that they know how many people will have the opportunity to take up the LPG grant-of course they do. That is the only basis on which they can cost it. We accept that they have to make some assumptions. If it is, say, 2.8 per cent of people, if they want to put a caveat in saying it is plus or minus one per cent, we will be happy with that. Minister, you know the answer to the question. Simply come in here and tell Australia how many people will benefit from the centrepiece of the Prime Minister's energy policy-the centrepiece, the big bang, the LPG grant. How many people will benefit? My back-of-the-envelope calculation is about 400,000 vehicles or peopledepending on how you count it, it variesout of 13 million, or less than three per cent in each electorate, including the electorate of Moncrieff. Come in and tell us, Minister. That is all we ask. We just want you to be open with the Australian people and tell us what this means for them. Given what I believe will be a very small impact, what is there in the minister's energy proposals that does anything tomorrow, next week, next month or even next year to put downward pressure on petrol prices? Petrol is the fuel on which people will continue to rely. You isolate one fuel as the centrepiece of your policy",50
51,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I remind the member for Hunter that he should address his comments through the chair and should not use the word ‘you'.,51
52,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the Prime Minister devises an energy plan that focuses on just one policy, instead of taking up Labor's blueprint, which focuses on a wide range of fuels, what will happen? It was funny when the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources raised the question of supply and demand rather incorrectly yesterday during question time. What will happen is that demand for LPG will rise. And what will happen then if supply cannot increase because of capacity constraint? There are only so many converters and LPG tanks in the country. Of course, the member for Rankin, who has a PhD in economics, knows, and he learnt this in economics 101, I am sure",51
53,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"Inelastic supply, the price will go up.",51
54,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"We do not need to get into the inelasticities, but the answer that the price will go up. We have seen evidence of that already. I do not want to cast aspersions on the conversion industry. They will do their very best, but if they are dated by people and put under pressure, what will the temptation be? If you have far more customers than you can deal with, it is a bit like bulk-billing. If you have too many patients you do not bulk-bill. That would only encourage more patients and you cannot handle them. If you are a converter, there is a temptation to say: ‘It was 4,000 yesterday but things are tight, big queues. It might go to 4,500 tomorrow or even worse next week.' These are the things the government has not considered in this energy policy. Why? Because this is a hastily and recklessly cobbled together policy designed as a political fix. But yesterday, by virtue of the revelation of the Special Minister of State, it blew up in their faces. We are going to keep asking the question. We want the minister to come in here-we know he has the numbers-and simply tell us how many people will benefit. I turn to the bill at hand, an important bill. I remind members that this is a very wideranging debate. The member for Moncrieff has a sterling opportunity, the opportunity of a lifetime, to respond. The Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006 in reality-unfortunately I cannot be complementary of the government, again-is an enormous failure. Mr Martin Ferguson-Try to find something nice to say.",51
55,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"The member for Batman wants me to try. I will think about that. This is the government's attempt-a very weak attempt-to show that it is embarking upon taxation reform. Since this government came to office in 1996, the tax act-and the member for Rankin knows this only too well-has expanded is to 10,000 pages. So 1,000 pages a year over 10 years is not a bad effort. Yet this government was going to reduce taxation burdens and compliance, but there are now 10,000 inunextra pages. Out of desperation to demonstrate some attempt at reform-and probably off the very good work of the member for Rankin, who was in here on a daily basis embarrassing the government over the enormity of the tax act-the government came up with this plan to ask the Board of Taxation to look at the inoperative provisions that might exist in the act. So, if you find inoperative provisions and then get rid of them, you can say that you are reducing the tax act in volume terms. In 2003 the Board of Taxation undertook that exercise, as instructed by the government. It finally reported to the Treasurer in October 2005. The sheer amount of time that it took the Board of Taxation to undertake the task is in itself an indication of how difficult a task it was to get through a tax act that is 10,000 pages long-an act that has been through the trauma of the change from the wholesale sales tax system to the GST. In October 2005, the board told the Treasurer that it had identified 1,900 pages of inoperative provisions. You can imagine the Treasurer's disappointment. He had gone to 10,000 pages. He thought he had a bit of a stunt, a bit of a plan, a political fix to get Board of Taxation to give him some recommendations that would show that he was on the job-that he was reducing the size of the act. But 1,900 pages was not going to deliver for him by any means. So what did he do? He sought to make it larger. He went digging for other provisions, many of them going to wholesale sales tax and other areas that were not the focus of his original proposal. Remember: we are talking about income tax not wholesale sales tax. In any case, the Treasurer managed to grow the number of pages to some 4,100, and that is the issue we are considering today. It is the operative provisions of the tax act that are of concern to tax practitioners and others who deal with the tax act, not the inoperative provisions. I do not see too many people running around concerned about parts of the tax act that do not apply to them or are not relevant to them anymore. They are worried about the operative provisions. Major commercial publishers have agreed to print an archived volume of the repealed provisions, so even these repealed provisions will not disappear from the shelves of tax practitioners. Savings provisions come into operation by virtue of the Acts Interpretation Act, which ensures that repeal does not affect the operation of those parts of the act which were in force at the time the taxpayer undertook the activity. So to claim that 4,100 pages have been cut out of the tax act is grossly, deliberately and misleadingly exaggerated. The major problem is the operative provisions. The economic benefits of this measure are not significant whereas real reductions in the compliance costs of tax for small business and for individuals would enhance returns, economic growth, employment and tax revenue and would lead to lower prices in more competitive markets. This bill is a missed opportunity for our Treasurer, who we know the is lazy. That is the bottom line here. We know that his backbench knows he is lazy too; that is why he ran away from the leadership fight.",51
56,Dr EMERSON,NOES,Too lazy to challenge.,52
57,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"Too lazy to challenge? That might be pushing the ‘lazy' angle just a little too far. But we know that the very small level of support the Treasurer would have had in any leadership challenge is largely a reflection of his laziness. I know that is what his backbench think. They think he is a lazy Treasurer who relies on the economic foundation that Labor laid when last in government, which has now led to 15 years of continuous economic growth. He has sat back and just enjoyed it-no real reform; he has ridden on Labor's wave. The Treasurer relies on spin. He is pretty good in question time-almost as good as Paul Keating, I would suggest, and I think he has largely modelled himself on that style. He is pretty good in question time with the spin but, when it comes to the substance, there ain't much happening! His backbench knows that. And I think the member for Moncrieff might know that-he might take the opportunity in this wide-ranging debate to indicate his view on that very issue. While Labor welcomes the bill, we call upon the government to do something about the operative provisions of the act that will actually make a difference to people. That is what we are trying to achieve by way of our second reading amendment. It should also be noted that the government is not just repealing provisions; it is changing the law in only small ways. The best example is the change to section 26(e) in respect of assessable income of goods in kind. This has been rewritten, and the operation of the act was changed in a minor way. The point is that this bill is mistitled. When savings provisions and ‘rewrites' are considered, the bill involves much more than the repeal of inoperative provisions, as does the example in section 26(e). But they are not the kinds of changes I am talking about. This determines that goods received in kind are assessable income, but it is never used due to the operation of the FBT. Let me talk about this concept. Once upon a time we did not have FBT, so there was a tax law to make sure that, if an employee were given a gift in replacement of a salary, then that gift or that additional amount of money would be taken to be assessable income of the employee. That does not happen anymore because the FBT takes priority over that law and there is no reason to go back to that law. So there has been a little bit of tweaking there, but it does not matter. It is a nonissue for Australian taxpayers and Australian businesses. It is just another example of a wasted opportunity. I have with me a report entitled Beyond 4100. The title is self-explanatory. It is ten by the Tax Institute of Australia. It was written to back up what I am saying. In point of fact, I have probably backed up what they have said. I am happy to give them the lead. They are the real experts. They have more resources than I have to look at these things in greater detail. They also have more corporate history in these issues than I have. They are saying that it is okay to repeal these provisions-they do not greatly affect people anyway-but that you have to go beyond 4,100 pages and get your teeth into the things that do matter to people. You have to make some real reductions in areas that will make a difference to Australian taxpayers and every entity that has an obligatory interface and relationship with the tax act and the Australian Taxation Office. In the second reading amendment, we have borrowed, if you like, the ideas of the Tax Institute. We have looked at them: they seem to make sense; they seem to be efficient; they seem to have efficacy; and they seem to be pretty good ideas. It is not for the opposition to write law in this place. It is an area in which you must tread very warily and where a comma or a full stop in the wrong place can make a difference. The lazy Treasurer has the resources of two departments behind him-Treasury and the tax officeand therefore has the capacity to do something meaningful about the tax act. Some real changes could be made to lift the compliance burden on individuals and businesses, to introduce a more competitive environment into the Australian economy and to raise productivity levels and economic growth. So, I say to the Treasurer, ‘Rather than sit back and rest on the Labor reforms of the eighties and the nineties, have a look at Beyond 4100 and Labor's amendments-they highlight the important parts of Beyond writ4100-and take this opportunity to make a real difference by tidying up the tax act, reducing the compliance burden and, therefore, spreading the benefits of that reform right throughout the Australian economy. This will basically give individuals and businesses the break they have been looking for a long time.",52
58,Mr CIOBO,NOES,"It was interesting to hear the member for Hunter attempt, as he did, to fill half an in responding to the government's positive steps to slash some 4,100 pages of tax laws, including 2,600 pages specifically from the income tax law. Almost one-third of the income tax law and over half of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are being repealed in the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006. So the bill, at its very core, is good news. I have been in parliament for a relatively short period of time-about five or six years-but I think it would be very rare to have the opportunity to come into this chamber and debate a bill that proposes to remove one-third or some 4,100 pages of the tax act. I am pleased to associate myself with this bill and to support it in the chamber because it is a positive move forward.",54
59,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In accordance with the standing orders, there is a requirement on members of parliament to be accurate in their statements or at least to attempt to be. There is no way that this legislation removes one-third of the Income Tax Act. The member was counting other tax acts as well, and he should be more honest in his statements.",54
60,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Mr Haase)I understand your point of order. Thank you, Member for Rankin. I believe the speaker is attending to that responsibility.",54
61,Mr CIOBO,NOES,"What I specifically said is that it is almost one-third of the income tax law and over half of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-and that is a fact. I will very happily turn to statements of factual correctness. The member for Hunter certainly allows a very wide berth when it comes to whether or not things are truthful. The member for Hunter has established quite a precedent. I would be very pleased to hear the member for Rankin make a couple of factual statements. The member for hour Hunter touched on leadership. Perhaps he could start with whether or not he still supports the former member for Werriwa. We know that the member for Hunter was the key supporter, the key backer, the key numbers man and the key driver of that failed Labor Party leader, Mark Latham. That is the track record that the member for Hunter brings into this chamber. I would ask one of the other roosters in the Australian Labor Party whether or not there is still support there. Mr Martin Ferguson- Mr Deputy Speaker",54
62,Mr CIOBO,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought this was a wide-ranging debate. The member for Hunter invited me to address issues of leadership. Mr Martin Ferguson-I rise on a point of order, which goes to the question of relevance and the issue of tax. I do not think what goes on in either party room is relevant to this debate; otherwise we might have a debate about where he stands on his support or otherwise for the Prime Minister or the Treasurer and their leadership struggles. I suggest you bring him back to the debate.",54
63,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I understand your point of order. I call the member for Moncrieff.,54
64,Mr CIOBO,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I was invited by the member for Hunter to make comments on leadership, and I am. The member for Hunter was not pulled up by the previous Deputy Speaker on issues of leadership. This is a wide-ranging debate. Tax laws are a key part of former leaders and their various policies. I am happy to answer the member for Hunter's remarks. I am happy to make reflections on whether or not the member for Hunter is in a position to make comments on leadership, because it was the member for Hunter, as I said, who was such a strident and fierce supporter of the former member for Werriwa, Mark Latham-the man who has been charged with criminal offences.",54
65,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I am just thumbing through the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006 and I cannot find any section in the legislation that deals with the material that this member is now traversing.",55
66,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Thank you, Member for Rankin. I understand your point of order. I am sure the member for Moncrieff will attend to his responsibilities in speaking to this bill.",55
67,Mr CIOBO,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I recognise that the Labor Party is putting you in a difficult position, as the Deputy Speaker previously in the chair was happy for the member for Hunter to address leadership issues. I am not seeking to exacerbate the position in which you find yourself, but simply to answer the request by the member for Hunter for me to address the issue of leadership. I am reflecting on the fact that the member for Hunter, as a finance spokesman for the Australian Labor Party, appears to have some significant and pronounced deficits when it comes to character judgementand perhaps even judgement with respect to policy. If the member for Hunter backs Mark Latham, the former member for Werriwa, then you would have to be concerned about Mr Latham's decisions and policy statements, which the member for Hunter supports.",55
68,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. The member for Moncrieff has 20 minutes to share his views on tax reform in this country, and he has used the first 4½ minutes to talk about anything but. If he really does not have anything to say about tax reform and the legislation before the parliament, I would suggest, respectfully, that you sit him down.",55
69,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Thank you for your advice, member for Rankin. The member for Moncrieff, I am quite sure, understands his responsibilities in this House and the necessity to speak to this legislation. I call on him to do so.",55
70,Mr CIOBO,NOES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am happy to talk about this government's track record on tax. I am pleased to talk about what the Howard government is doing to lighten the taxation burden on the general population in a literal sense-which we have a strong and proud record of doing-and also in a figurative sense. The bill immediately before the chamber today is a rare bill, which I am pleased and proud to support. The bill slashes 4,100 pages from income tax law and deserves the full support of both sides of the House. Not surprisingly, the Australian Labor Party-which we know from past form stands in the way of anything that reduces the levels of taxation on the Australian people-apparently does not support this bill. That is the conclusion I am forced to draw from the remarks of the member for Hunter. We have seen, based on the Australian Labor Party's track record, that it stands opposed to tax cuts. Recently the Howard government delivered some $36 billion worth of tax cuts. We rely on the numbers we have in this chamber and on our majority in the other place to move those cuts through both houses so that the Australian people are able to enjoy less of a tax burden. The Australian people recognise that it was the Treasurer, Peter Costello, and the Prime Minister, John Howard, who delivered $36 billion worth of tax cuts for them. Those tax cuts were delivered only about five weeks ago. So Australians today are paying less tax thanks to the sound economic management of Peter Costello and John Howard. Our track record stands in stark contrast the rhetoric we hear from the Australian Labor Party. When you compare the 13 years of Labor in government to the past 10 years of the coalition in government, a couple of key factors make the difference between the two governments apparent in people's minds. I will touch on those because they are worth reflecting on. First and foremost are economic responsibility and economic governance. Under the coalition, Australians today are enjoying a 4.8 per cent unemployment rate-the lowest unemployment rate this country has seen for over 30 years. This government succeeded in bringing that about, not with the assistance of the Australian Labor Party, but with its absolute jection to it. It seeks to stop every reform we make to improve the lot of ordinary Australians. This government's reforms are delivering 30-year lows of unemployment. That is no thanks to the Australian Labor Party. In contrast, when we were in opposition in the past we supported any good policy announcements the Australian Labor Party made when it was in government. But we do not get that kind of cooperation from the Australian Labor Party today on Work Choices and on other labour market reforms, which I believe the member for Rankin probably generally supports. The Australian Labor Party stands in blunt opposition to the kinds of reforms that have brought unemployment in this country down to 4.8 per cent, to 30-year lows. What is the Labor Party's track record on unemployment? The answer to that question is one million unemployed Australians. That was its legacy, the legacy of the current opposition party, who hold itself out as an alternative government. Let us talk about interest rates, which have become a favoured topic of the Australian Labor Party of late. to Under the coalition, interest rates are now averaging",55
71,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order.",56
72,Mr CIOBO,NOES,"Oh, the Labor Party does not like to talk about interest rates because of their 17 per cent",56
73,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Moncrieff will resume his seat.,56
74,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"Reluctantly, Mr Deputy Speaker, I again draw your attention to the fact that this legislation repeals inoperative provisions of the income tax act and other acts. While it is a wide-ranging debate on tax, the member for Moncrieff is not talking and total ob- about tax at all.",56
75,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Thank you, member for Rankin. I understand your point of order. The bill we are debating is a tax amendment bill. The member for Moncrieff, I believe, is addressing the issue of tax, and, however you may disapprove of what he is saying, he has the right to say it.",56
76,Mr CIOBO,NOES,"This is a classic case of the Australian Labor Party once again engaging in acts of hypocrisy. They say they want a wide-ranging debate on taxation. I am simply highlighting the way in which the Australian people now have an easing of the tax burden on their shoulder thanks to the Howard government. The member for Rankin does not want to hear it, but I will go on because it is worth saying. It is important that people understand the reason why they are better able to meet home loan repayments, the reason why they have greater job security under this government and the reason why the government's tax take is lower than it was under Labor. On all of these measures, I am very pleased to talk about the coalition government's track record. I invite the member for Rankin to talk about the Labor Party's track record, because, on every measure, Australians are better off under 10 years of coalition government than they ever were under the Australian Labor Party. As I said, interest rates are only one of those ways. At 7.8 per cent currently, with average interest rates of just seven per cent under this coalition government, interest rates stand in stark contrast to the average under the Australian Labor Party of over 12 per cent. An average of 12 per cent and over for the Australian Labor Party, an average of just over seven per cent for the coalition; 13 years of Labor, 10 years of coalition-let the facts speak for themselves. And that is before I even touch on the peak of interest rates under the Australian Labor Party. The member for Rankin was probably in the chamber at the time. It was 17 per cent under the Australian Labor Party, with one million unemployed Australians. That is the legacy of the Australian Labor Party. Let us also talk about why the coalition government is able to reduce taxation. Let us talk about why the government is passing on $36 billion worth of tax cuts to the Australian people. The simple reason is that this government has run nine budget surpluses, budget surpluses that the Australian Labor Party were not able to run. The track record under this government is the repayment of some $96 billion of Labor Party debt. Under the coalition, in 10 years, we have seen $96 billion of debt that was a legacy of the Leader of the Opposition and a legacy of members of the Australian Labor Party, which this government has paid off in full, saving Australians some $4 billion per annum in interest. That is money-some $4 billion each and every year-that we are now able to dedicate to roads, to health, to education, to tax cuts; the kinds of expenditure that the Australian Labor Party would never even have dreamt of when their period in office was coming to an end in 1996. These are the kinds of advantages that the Australian people enjoy today thanks to responsible economic management under the Treasurer, Peter Costello, and under the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong, that the Australian Labor Party were unable to deliver beover cause they were not disciplined when it came to spending in government. I would also like to touch on what the member for Hunter spent half of his speech addressing-that is, energy policy. I was pleased today to see that the member for Batman and the member for Hunter were not disagreeing. It makes a pleasant change, because earlier this week we heard the member for Batman and the member for Hunter at loggerheads on ABC radio, embarrassingly for the two Labor members, one following the other on ABC radio. We had the member for Hunter attacking the government's policy on excise, and we had the member for Batman defending the government policy on excise. Today, when the member for Hunter was touching on excise, I note that he made no remarks about what Labor would do with excise. He was happy to talk in general terms about excise, but there was nothing specific from the member for Hunter. I invite the member for Rankin to perhaps outline to the House what the Labor Party's policy is on excise and whether or not the Labor Party is going to cut excise, as the member for Hunter suggested would be the case. I would be very interested to hear some kind of commitment from the member for Rankin about Labor Party policy on excise, because I would remind the House that, again, it was the coalition government that not only cut excise in 2001 but also froze the CPI indexation of excise. As a result of that coalition government pronouncement, fuel prices today are approximately 7c cheaper per litre than they would have been had that Labor Party policy stayed in place. Make no mistake: it was the coalition government that froze the excise indexation to CPI; no thanks to the Australian Labor Party. It was this government that stopped the excise indexation to CPI. I should also say that the reaction that I have had from my constituents to the Prime Minister's announcement that we would subsidise, to the amount of $2,000, the cost of converting vehicles to LPG so that people can take advantage of the 40 per cent cheaper price, on average, of LPG has been very positive. I genuinely know that people in my electorate of Moncrieff, the city of the Gold Coast and elsewhere will be embracing the opportunity to convert their vehicles to LPG, especially given that now, as a result of this $2,000 subsidy from the Howard government, the cost of that conversion will pay for itself in about four months-not two years, as was previously the case, but four months. It is also worth mentioning that the Western Australian Labor government-they seem to be good blokes over there in the west, Mr Deputy Speaker Haase; I am sure you would probably understand-are happy to pay an additional $1,000 towards the cost of conversion. But where are all the other state Labor governments when it comes to easing the burden on Australian taxpayers with the price of fuel? Where are the other state Labor governments when it comes to making some kind of contribution towards easing the hurt that Australians are feeling the petrol pump? The Howard government is doing it to the tune of $2,000. The Western Australian Labor government is doing it to the tune of $1,000. Perhaps the member for Rankin can ring his mates in the Queensland Labor Party. The Premier is out there. He is in election mode today, Member for Rankin. Why don't you pick up the phone and see whether you can get Peter Beattie and the Queensland Labor Party to also help out with a $1,000 subsidy? I encourage the member for Rankin to also make some remarks in that respect-as to why the Labor Party in Queensland, absolutely rolling around in funds from the GST, with bigger budgets from the GST than they have ever had, doesn't help out. I invite him to pick up the phone and ring his mate Peter Beattie and get a $1,000 commitment from the Premier in Queensland. I would welcome it. Perhaps the member for Rankin could also indicate whether he would welcome it. But I want to talk specifically about some of the hypocrisy, and it is hypocrisy, that I heard from the member for Hunter, who made disparaging remarks when he played the man-that is, the Prime Minister-about the fact that the Prime Minister, to use the words of the member for Hunter, ‘was in his petrol powered limousine, saying “Let them eat cake”'. This is from the man who presumably-and I notice he did not answer my question-also got a Comcar into the House this morning, the same man who is accusing the Prime Minister of acting in a nonchalant way. It is a complete and total act of hypocrisy from the Australian Labor Party, and it does them no justice whatsoever. With respect to petrol pricing, if there is truly going to be some immediate relief, let it be from the GST. The GST amount has been increasing as a result of the increasing price of petrol, and the Australian Labor Party is the beneficiary of it in every state and terriat tory. Let the state governments tomorrow come out and say that they are happy to take less GST. They have more money than they have ever had previously. I simply summarise to say: I welcome this bill. I invite ments from the Labor Party as to its form when it comes to taxation. Let the Australian people remember they are $36 billion better off from tax reform. (Time expired)",56
77,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"Rankin) (11.53 am)The Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006 removes inoperative provisions from the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is not the inoperative provisions that create the complexity of the Income Tax Assessment Act but the operative provisions, which are unchanged in this legislation. Nevertheless, Labor supports it. The member for Moncrieff is wrong on that account and on a number of other accounts, and I want to take the opportunity to convey to the parliament the number of errors that the member for Moncrieff made when he started talking about matters that were at least tangentially relevant to this legislation. He claimed in his speech just given that this legislation removes 4,100 pages from the income tax law. That is completely untrue. It removes 1,900 pages from the income tax law, and the Treasurer included other legislation-indirect tax laws-in order to bulk it up and get to the 4,100 pages that the member for Moncrieff asserts come out of the income tax law when in fact they do not. The member for Moncrieff ran out of petrol after about five minutes and went on to make a number of completely erroneous assertions. He was talking about interest rates. He is probably too young to remember that in 1982 the Treasurer of this country, now the Prime Minister, John Howard, presided over 90-day bank bill rates of 22 per cent. That was not fully reflected in home loan mortgage rates because there was an upper limit of 13½ per cent on mortgage rates. In those days, poor people could not get into a home. Fast forward to 2006 and poor people again cannot get into a home, even in a deregulated system. That is because, as the Recom- serve Bank points out-and the member for Moncrieff is wrong again-housing affordability today is worse than it was many years ago, even when interest rates were very high at periods during the 1980s. But the member for Moncrieff has asserted that housing affordability has never been better. It has never been worse, and that is because of the house price boom-the bubble that has been created through the mismanagement of this government-in combination with rising interest rates. Interest rates have risen three times already since the 2004 election, when the Prime Minister promised that interest rates would be at record lows. They had already risen four times before that. The last seven changes in interest rates have been upwards. The market is factoring in a 90 per cent probability of a further interest rate rise before the end of this year, and there is also in prospect another interest rate rise before the next election some time next year. We certainly do not need any lectures about interest rate rises or promises about interest rates from the member for Moncrieff. The member for Moncrieff went on to say that the coalition supported Labor's reform program. The coalition never supported superannuation. It opposed with every device it possibly could the spreading of superannuation to the working men and women of this country. The coalition never supported the introduction of the fringe benefits tax or the capital gains tax in order to finance reductions in the top marginal rate of income tax and the second-top marginal rate of income tax. Those were very important economic reforms, but the coalition absolutely opposed them. The coalition opposed the introduction of an assets test in 1984, when Labor had already anticipated the problem of the ageing of the population. That was an important reform opposed by the coalition. The coalition opposed the petroleum resource rent tax, which collects a fair share of revenue from the huge increases in oil prices. Oil prices are now above $US70 a barrel. The PRRT was designed to ensure that the community gets a fair share of that. That measure was opposed by the coalition. So let us not hear this rubbish about how the coalition in opposition supported Labor's reform program. The member for Moncrieff then went on to say that the government has run budget surpluses but that Labor did not run budget surpluses. I draw his attention to Budget Paper No. 1. If we go to page 13-5, we see that budget surpluses were run by Labor in, for example, 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91. What was significant about two of those? They were 1.7 per cent of GDP. What are the budget surpluses now? They are 1.0 per cent of GDP. The member for Moncrieff is again wrong, but he has taken his tuition from the Treasurer. The Treasurer said in this parliament on 10 May 2000: First of all, we put the budget into surplus headline basis, which the Labor Party never did. Then we say, ‘We ought to put the budget into a surplus on an underlying basis,' which the Labor Party never did. That was a completely false statement made in this parliament by the Treasurer. He has given tuition to the member for Moncrieff to continue with these completely false statements. Labor produced headline surpluses in 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91. Mr Martin Ferguson-We actually had to do the hard work of saving.",59
78,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"That is right. In a short, 20-minute speech, where the member for Moncrieff had already run out of petrol after five minutes, he made several completely false statements. He then asked questions about Labor's position on excise. The Leader of the Opposition has said that it would not be economically responsible to cut excise on fuel-certainly at this stage when there is no room because of the government's economic mismanagement to further stimulate the economy. This is because of what I have just said: that further interest rate rises are very much a prospect. There is a 90 per cent probability of an interest rate rise before the end of the year-after the three interest rises we have seen already following the Prime Minister's statement in the 2004 election that interest rates would be kept at record low levels. Then the member for Moncrieff said that I should get on the phone to Peter Beattie and tell him to provide an extra subsidy of $1,000 for LPG conversions. In the parliament two days ago the Prime Minister was saying this, just after the Treasurer had said that it is all the states' fault-that there is this fiscal expansion feeding into price pressures and feeding into interest rate pressuresbecause they are running deficits. So you have the Treasurer saying the states are not on a running budget surpluses anymore and that that is a problem and then you have the Prime Minister and the member for Moncrieff saying that they should create bigger deficits by providing a LPG conversion subsidy themselves. It is about time that the coalition got its act together. Who is the member for Moncrieff siding with: the Prime Minister or the Treasurer, because they are at odds? I thought he was the Treasurer's man; but he has backed the Prime Minister. He comes and goes. He is very flaky. In relation to the inoperative provisions being removed from the Income Tax Assessment Act, I would point out that, far from reducing the complexity of the Income Tax Assessment Act, far from making it simpler, in just 10 years the coalition has added 100 extra tax breaks to the income tax system-so-called tax expenditures. This is what the Business Council of Australia has said about the increase in complexity of the Income Tax Assessment Act: Much of this complexity is due to the need to administer tax concessions targeting particular groups, or to prevent large-scale exploitation of existing ‘holes' in the tax base by administrative means. What an indictment of this government. The Business Council of Australia is right: this government has made the income tax system far more complex. Removing inoperative provisions does not make it any simpler; it is the operative provisions that make it complex. Now there are a lot more operative provisions as a result of the government poking 100 more holes in the Income Tax Assessment Act. When the government came into office, the Income Tax Assessment Act ran to 3,600 pages. That was back in 1996. It has now passed 10,000 pages. So it has gone from 3,600 to 10,000 pages. What sort of undertakings did the government give in relation to simplifying the tax system in this country? On 31 January 1996 the present Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, said: ... I will be establishing a small business deregulation taskforce. That taskforce will have a specific brief from me as Prime Minister, to report within six months of the new Government taking office. Its main responsibility will be to advise on ways in which the regulatory and paper burden on small business can be reduced by up to 50%. After that, on 24 March 1997, in a ministerial statement the Prime Minister conceded: The volume of tax legislation has become a tidal wave which threatens to overwhelm small business. He said in the same statement: During the election campaign we committed ourselves to the goal of reducing the burden of paperwork and red tape on small business by 50 per cent in our first term. I am confident that our sponse to the Bell report, along with other initiatives that we have already taken, will make a substantial contribution to that objective by the end of our first term. They did nothing other than add to the complexity of the Income Tax Assessment Act. They added to the burden of red tape on small business. On the Alan Jones program about a year later, on 14 August 1998, Alan Jones asked: Will the number of pages in the Tax Act be reduced by the introduction of a GST? The Prime Minister said: Yes it will because some of the anti-avoidance measures which take up a lot of pages are going to disappear. I don't know by how many pages but it will be some reduction I understand. If we go forward another year to see what has actually happened, we see that nothing has happened other than that they started working on this new GST, this new monster tax. So far from simplifying the system, they were massively increasing the complexity of the tax system in this country. On 22 September 1999 the Treasurer appeared on the Alan Jones program. Alan Jones said: It's unreadable and unintelligible, there's a massive GST program that's going to overtake us ... The Treasurer said: Well I think that's right. So there is a massive GST program that is going to overtake us. He probably said that ‘that was the Prime Minister's fault because that was his great big tax adventure, not mine'. On the Alan Jones program he went on to say: And that's why we've got to get the number of pages of the Tax Act down. That's what we're working on right at this moment. So on 22 September 1999 they were working on getting the number of pages in the Income Tax Assessment Act down. Rubbish. They re- were working on coming into this parliament every second day with a tax laws amendment bill to further increase the complexity of the tax act, to poke more holes in the income tax base, and to create an extra burden on small business and on anyone who pays income tax in this country. Let us go forward to a quote from Gary Banks, the Chairman of the Productivity Commission. He said on 22 December 2003: The Income Tax Assessment Act-often taken as a regulatory ‘barometer'-has grown particularly rapidly since its inception. At nearly 7,000 pages, the ITAA is now nearly 60 times longer than the paltry 120 pages that did the job when it was first introduced in 1936. That quote was made in 2003. So the Productivity Commission was complaining about the size and complexity of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Let us now look at 2004. Appearing on the ABC radio program Life Matters with Julie MCCrossin, the host, was Michael Inglis, who is a Sydney based tax barrister. Mr Inglis said: But I can't resist. When I spoke to you last April of last year, Income Tax Act, 8,500 pages. Do you know what it is currently? Julie MCCrossin responded: I want you to tell meI bet she did. Mr Inglis said: We did a great service last year we really improved things. He said: Currently, in fact it's a few months old, 10,500 pages for your income tax legislation. Add in GST, FBT, super, 13,500 pages, 9.5 million words. That was on 15 January 2004. The government has promised and promised and promised to make the Income Tax Assessment Act simpler. What does it come up with? It comes up with a bill to remove the inoperative provisions, whereas it is the operative provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act that make it more complex. This legislation does in fact remove up to 50 per cent of the volume of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This legislation is best understood not as a tax policy but as a forest policy. This legislation was designed to reduce the number of trees that are cut down to produce the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is a forest policy, not a tax policy, because it effectively does nothing to simplify the Income Tax Assessment Act. Another way of thinking of the task of simplifying this legislation is to compare it with the human genome project, which had the goal of identifying all of the approximately 20,000 to 25,000 genes in human DNA and to determine the sequences of the three billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA. It took 13 years to unravel the human genome. It has taken this government 10 years to try to simplify the Income Tax Assessment Act. More progress has been made on the human genome in 13 years than this government has been able to time, make in more than 10 years to simplify the Income Tax Assessment Act, and still it has made no meaningful progress. There are virtually no legislative changes in this bill that simplify the Income Tax Assessment Act. How do we know that? We are told that by the explanatory memorandum. This bill simply pulls out redundant provisions and does not simplify the Income Tax Assessment Act at all. While we are on the subject of simplicity, yesterday the Treasurer announced that he was implementing a new GST-simplified accounting method for restaurants, cafes and caterers. In his statement, he said: Businesses with an annual turnover of up to $2 million will be eligible for the SAM. That is the simplified accounting method. The statement ends: Further information on the new simplified accounting method can be found at www.ato.gov.au. That is the website of the Australian Taxation Office. When you go to the website, you see that there are no details about the new simplified accounting method for the GST for restaurants, cafes and caterers whose turnover is less than $2 million. This new method is coming in on 1 October. We have had a bit of a debate in this parliament about airbrushing transcripts and on whether they appear or not. The Treasurer has announced a new simplified accounting method for the GST about which there are no details. He just wanted the announcement effect. A new simplified accounting method for the GST reminds me of another proposal-that is, the proposal of the Australian Labor Party called the ratio method. When I developed the ratio method and it was adopted as Labor Party policy, it was warmly received by the small business community. In fact, a spokesperson for COSBOA, on 8 August 2001, said: I can say with absolute clarity that the members of the association who were in the room were very impressed with the idea because it was simple. We had a Labor Party proposal to simplify the GST for small businesses with turnover below a specified level. It sounds like that is exactly what the coalition is doing, but we will not know until we see the detail when it is finally posted on the ATO's website. We do know that in 2001 the Treasurer thought this was a terrible idea. The Treasurer issued a press release on 12 October 2001 headed ‘Beazley's big BAS bungle'. In referring to the ratio method, he stated: ... it can only work if businesses pay more GST than they are liable for! … … … If thisthat is, the ratio methodamounts to less than the actual liability, then companies will choose it and open up a large revenue hole. But Labor says it has to be revenue neutral. It can only be revenue neutral if Labor can get an equal number of companies to overpay to make up for those that cherry pick the advantage. That sounds like a critique of the new simplified accounting method-or has the Treasurer had a change of heart? We will only know when that information is posted on the website. But when the ratio method was released, apart from the spokesman for COSBOA saying it was a terrific idea, the minister's department-the member for Groom was then the minister for small business-did a critique on it which was released by him to the media and which basically said that it sounded like a pretty good idea. The ratio method was described as having the potential to be a vote winner, after the then shadow Treasurer, Simon Crean, unveiled it. So there was Labor, back in 2001, proposing real measures to simplify the GST, real measures for tax reform. This government has taken 10 years to produce a piece of legislation that does nothing more than remove inoperative provisions, retaining all the complexity of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It fails every test of tax reform. Whenever it sits a test of tax reform, it fails, and it deserves to be condemned for doing so.",60
79,Mr HAYES,NOES,"Werriwa) (12.13 pm)Before us today we have a Clayton's tax simplification bill. This is the sort of bill you have when you are not serious about tax simplification. The Treasurer introduced the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006 in June and he did so with much fanfare. He made the claim that the bill would repeal over 4,100 pages of inoperative tax law. He claimed that a third of the income tax law and over half of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 was gone. He claimed that this was a major reduction in the volume of tax law. He made all these claims, but he was wrong, and he knew he was wrong. I suspect we have heard from only one member of the government's backbench on this issue because, quite frankly, they know it is wrong as well. They do not want to come into this place to defend the Treasurer's exaggerated claim. The member for Moncrieff came into this place with a view to taking some responsibility for the unpredicted resources boom and the commodity prices that we are currently enjoying-to which the boost in employment is attributed. But, to his credit, he indicated that the government did not predict the skills shortage and also that the government made cuts to TAFE and further education and abolished the Australian National Training Authority. All these things just fell into the ernment's lap, yet if you listened to the member for Moncrieff you would think we were riding on the back of a resources boom as a consequence of the election of the Howard government back in 1996. I am sure that no other member believes that-unless it is on the ministerial script for today-but I thought the member for Moncrieff put in a sterling effort to back up the unsustainable claim that this is about reform. They should not make these extravagant claims, because they know this is not reform-this is window-dressing, at best. If the Treasurer counts numbers in the same way that he relies on this as amounting to a reform of the tax act, it is no wonder that he was not serious about making a leadership challenge. We need to get it straight that 4,100 pages will not be removed from the income tax act as a result of this bill. The major publishing companies have already agreed to print the archive volumes of the repeal provisions. The repeal provisions will not disappear from the shelves of the tax practitioners; they will not disappear from our life to that extent. The pages might be moved to a different volume of the tax act, but they will remain on tax practitioners' shelves gathering dust. This bill does not act to reduce the complexity of Australia's tax laws. The Treasurer knows that. He knows that the only way to reduce the complexity of the tax laws is to change the operative provisions. Repealing inoperative provisions and shoving them into another volume that gathers dust in the corner of someone's office does not reduce the complexity one little bit. It does not make the system simpler. The simplicity of any system, particularly a tax system, will always be driven by the provisions that operate, not by the provisions that do not operate. A bit of window-dressing to the act, or a bit of prungoving of the pages, does not amount to introducing simplicity into our tax system. The things that matter to anyone who operates any system are the things that generate operations. So, unless we give attention to simplifying the operative provisions, we are simply masquerading this notion of simplification. The driver of the complexity of the tax system is and can only be the operative tax provisions. The complexity of Australia's tax system will only ever be reduced if we address the operative provisions of the tax act. The system will only ever become less complex if the government gets serious about tax law and does not just tinker with it when it suits it. As has been pointed out previously, there are currently more than 240 tax expenditures-tax breaks, concessions and the like-which erode the revenue base and make the system more complex. In the 60 years between the introduction of the Income Tax Assessment Act in 1936 and this government coming into power in 1996, in excess of 150 additional tax expenditure lines have been created. In the decade this government has been in power, another 89 have been added to that mix. In addition to these concessions, in 2000 alone nearly 90,000 private, binding tax rulings were given. These rulings create precedents which add to the complexity for tax practitioners who interpret the tax arrangements and, indeed, to the complexity of the act itself. You do not need to be a tax expert to work out that the system has become complex. Blame for the complexity of Australia's income tax system can pretty much be laid at the feet of the current government and, more particularly, the Treasurer. Yet the Treasurer comes into this place and says the bill will slash dozens of pages from the tax act. If this is the criterion for removing the complexity, I fear it will never happen whilst this government holds office. The Chairman of the Productivity Commission, Gary Banks, said in 2003: At nearly 7,000 pages, the Income Tax Assessment Actthe 1936 and 1937 statutes read togetheris now nearly 60 times longer than the paltry 120 pages that did the job when it was first introduced in 1936 He goes on to say that, notwithstanding the admirable recent attempts at tax simplification, that is the position. I would also like to quote something the Chairman of the Productivity Commission said which was not quoted by the member for Rankin but which adds a little more colour to this: To take a fanciful turn, were this rate of growth to continue unabated, I am informed that by the end of this century the paper version of the Tax Act would amount to 830 billion pages; it would take over 3 million years of continuous reading to assimilate and weigh the equivalent of around 20 aircraft carriers! That is not my view, and I am sure he is taking slight licence in saying that, but it is not bad commentary coming from the Chairman of the Productivity Commission. He was not actually seeking to heap accolades on the government over their management of the complexities of the taxation act at that point. I agree that the predictions are somewhat fanciful; nevertheless, they highlight that unless we get serious in our attempts to reduce the complexities of the tax act-if we just tack bits on here and there-we simply will not be addressing its shortcomings and the act will simply grow. This government has become a serial offender when it comes to tinkering with the tax act. It has added bits here and bits there to accommodate special interest groups or their mates, and the act has grown in its volume as a direct result. The amendments, layer upon layer, can only produce complexity. That is exactly what this government has presided over when it comes to the tax act. Sure, the bill before us does involve the rewriting of some provisions. However, as the rewriting still requires navigation between a 1936 act and the 1997 act, probably not much can be said for its quality. The government talks about efficiency and simplicity but if its performance is measured by the impact it has had on the tax act it has to be regarded as a dismal failure. Labor moved a quite complex second reading amendment to this bill, one which I support. It is based on some of the uncontroversial recommendations of the Taxation Institute of Australia in its report Beyond 4100. I am sure that the members opposite are aware that recently the Taxation Institute released this report, which outlined a range of areas in which there could be real reform in income tax. While the bill could be best described as a bit of plastic surgeryalthough, unfortunately, when you come out of this operation you still are wearing the same nose as when you went in-the Taxation Institute was proposing real and substantive reform to the taxation act. It is true that some of the institute's recommendations would be more readily accepted than others, but it is certainly a worthwhile contribution to the ongoing debate about reform of the Australian tax system. That said, the most uncontroversial recommendations of the report recommend that provisions that are almost never used and those that can not be readily enforced should be repealed or redrafted. These provide the basis of Labor's second reading amendment and I encourage the government to support the amendment and support a genuine attempt to simplify the Australian tax law. Tax is never far from the minds of working Australians, especially at this time of year when everyone seems to want to make their annual trek to the accountant's office file their return. But I am sure that many would love to be able to file those returns themselves, to have a system which was less complex, a system that would lend itself to being user friendly and where people could go about their business while paying to the Commonwealth their fair share of reasonable tax. I am sure that that is what most workers would prefer to do. The growth in the volume of tax law and its increasing complexity, which brings with it compliance costs, continues to be a concern for taxpayers and taxation practitioners. There seems to be a litany of tax bills presented in this place as the government goes about its way of tinkering here and there, making modifications to the taxation system. As it includes and excludes various provisions, and as it attempts to curb tax minimisation on the one hand and open up new opportunities to avoid paying tax on the other, these complications continue to expand. The government has come in for some criticism of late, as you would recall, when comes to tax. Bear in mind, we all know that this government is the highest taxing and highest spending government in Australia's history, and I do not think that is an underserved criticism. I think there is some accuracy in that statement. Interestingly, the OECD Economic Survey of Australia Volume 2006/12, released in July of this year, made some comments not only on Australia's fiscal position but also on its tax system. The OECD says: Tax revenues for the immediate year ahead have been under-predicted in each of the last four budget years by an average of $6.8 billion, about 0.8% of GDP, with the fiscal balance underpredicted by $7 billion. In addition to this interesting comment on the systematic failure of the government's to revenue predictions, the OECD makes a couple of other interesting comments when it comes to the taxation system itself. In that regard, the OECD says this: Recent cuts in the higher rates of personal income tax and the widening of thresholds are to be welcomed. However, the extent of the changes in the 2006/07 Budget suggests that the focus of any future tax cuts should switch to reducing high effective marginal tax rates faced by many households in the lower income deciles. That's correct-the OECD is saying that the focus of tax cuts should be switched to reducing the high effective marginal tax rates now worn by people in our lower income households. As I read it, I could not help thinking that I had heard that sort of suggestion before. In fact, I had. That was actually Labor's response to the squandered opportunity that was the last budget when this government sold Australia out. It was Labor's response to a budget that once again spectacularly failed Middle Australia and spectacularly failed working families in this country. It is a call I it have made in this place before, and I will be making it again and again until this government gets serious about fixing the system. When you put in, you should be entitled to expect to get your fair share out. Of course, suggesting that the focus of the tax cuts should be on reducing high effective marginal tax rates is not the only comment the OECD makes when it comes to Australia's taxation system. Other interesting comments made by the OECD on the government's opportunity in relation to the complexity of Australia's tax law include: The government should continue to seek opportunities to reduce the complexity of the tax law. That is not talking about how we simply go and prune a few pages off the tax act or how we can take a few pages out of that act and store them in an archived volume somewhere else where you will still have to refer to them to navigate through the taxation system. What the OECD is saying very clearly is that this government should take those opportunities to address the complexity of Australia's tax law. If anything, quite frankly, this government has got to wear that criticism. Everyone will recall that last year, with much fanfare and flourish, the member for Wentworth released his own contribution to the Australian tax debate. He presented some 280 options for tax reform last year, yet today he is silent. It is only the member for Moncrieff who decided to come and back up the Treasurer on this piece of art. I can only imagine that the member for Wentworth is still sitting in his office thinking that the Treasurer may have somehow overdramatised his claim that this bill was the culmination of a serious effort to reduce the complexity of Australian taxation. To give him his credit, the member for Moncrieff did come down to the chamber to try to make a spirited contribution in this debate. As I said earlier, I think all he wanted to point out is the fact that the country is presently riding high on a resources boom and, as a consequence, this government wants to claim all the responsibility it can for that. He was the lone voice. If the Treasurer can only muster people like the member for Moncrieff to run a diversion- (Time expired)",63
80,Mr SWAN,NOES,"I too wish to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006. When the new tax system was introduced, the government said: … a modern tax system is one of the keys to Australia's future economic growth and dynamism. According to the government: The existing tax system is out of date, unfair, internationally uncompetitive, ineffective and unnecessarily complex. The solution they gave was A New Tax System because, as they said at that time, ‘systemic problems require systemic solutions'. According to the explanatory memorandum for the bill we are considering today, the government are making ‘continuing efforts to reduce unnecessary complexity in the tax laws'. If this is the best they can do, they have got a long way to go. This bill repeals 4,100 pages of inoperative tax laws. Of course, that is welcome, but it will not fix the underlying problems with the tax law: the complexity of the laws and the burden that creates for taxpayers of all sizes. In 1996 the tax law was 3,500 pages long; today, after more than 10 years of Peter Costello's treasurership, it is 9,500 pages long. It has gone from 3,500 pages to 9,500 pages. As Gary Banks, the Chairman of the Productivity Commission, observed in 2003: Were this rate of growth to continue unabated, I am informed that by the end of this century the paper version of the Tax Act would amount to 830 billion pages; it would take over 3 million years of continuous reading to assimilate and weigh the equivalent of around 20 aircraft carriers. Repealing superfluous tax law is always welcome, but what has the government done? It has not, for example, streamlined annual income tax returns. It has not simplified all of the tax offsets, deductions and exemptions that make it difficult for people to work out their tax liability. On top of that, the Treasurer's tally of 4,100 pages of repealed laws includes several inoperative sales tax acts-acts which have not been operative for six years, and acts which do not relate to income tax. I note that the Taxation Institute of Austratrouble lia is calling for a more comprehensive rewrite of tax laws. The BCA has made this point: … regulation should be simple, clear, well explained and sensitively enforced. If you want an example of regulation that is not any of those things, you do not have to look much further than the income tax system. As I have said before, Labor sees tax reform, guided by the principles of competitiveness, efficiency and fairness, as an investment in the drivers of growth. By international standards, Australia's income tax system is too complex. While other countries have been getting on with the task of simplifying their income tax systems, we have been adding to its complexity. According to the OECD's personal income tax database, the comparative complexity of Australia's tax system has been increasing relative to other countries. While taxes have traditionally been seen as the primary mechanism for governments to raise revenue and deliver services, they are also increasingly viewed as an important factor in the conduct of the market. All this bill will do is repeal the inoperative provisions-that is, it is a fresh coat of paint when the tax system needs a major overhaul. Last year there were 15,000 separate tax rulings and determinations. That is around 290 a week-58 each business day or one every 7.3 minutes. This means that 15,000 times a year taxpayers and their agents find the tax laws so unclear that they need a ruling from the tax office about how the law applies to their circumstances. To me, this is as clear an indication as you could get that our tax law is far too complex and requires serious reform. The new tax commissioner said earlier this year that the complexity of the tax legislation does not the average taxpayer. I was certainly surprised to hear that. He said that the average taxpayer does not care whether you have 10 pages or 10,000 pages of tax law. He said that a typical taxpayer earns income and has some deductions and that's it. A typical business has business income, trading stock and operating expenses and that's it. He also said that 78 per cent of taxpayers use a tax agent so they do not face the complexity themselves. That is very disappointing. It is a narrow view of the costs of the regulatory burden. Why do ordinary taxpayers have to fork out more than $150 to have a tax agent fill out their tax return-the tax commissioner certainly has not answered that question-and why can't it be simpler for more taxpayers? The 15,000 tax rulings last year tell us that, for businesses of all sizes, there are too many sections of the tax law that are impossible to interpret. Tax lawyers may have to consult half a dozen pieces of tax legislation to answer a straightforward tax question. That complexity means that corporate taxpayers are spending tens of thousands of dollars on advice or ATO rulings. This kind of complexity is an impediment to doing business. For example, businesses are often stalled from making acquisitions, disposals or forming a consolidated group while they wait for legal advice or an answer from the tax office. Tax complexity can harm the efficient allocation of resources and, in the long run, that puts growth at risk, which is why we do need some substantial action in this area and that is not, unfortunately, contained in this bill. The government have begun the process of reducing the burden of regulation, but there is little evidence that they understand why it is important. Earlier this year the British government made a call for what was called sensible debate on risk in policy making. It is little wonder that its call on regulation and risk has struck a chord around the world. The British government pointed to the detrimental effect of overregulation, its impact on business and the competitive culture of nations. Looking at regulation through the prism of risk is a worthwhile, new way to frame the debate on regulatory reform. The British PM put it in these terms: … we are in danger of having a wholly disproportionate attitude to the risks we should expect to run as a normal part of life. This is putting sure on policy-making … to act to eliminate risk in a way that is out of all proportion to the potential damage. The result islots… of rules, guidelines, responses to ‘scandals' of one nature or another that ends up having utterly perverse consequences. Labor believe in smarter regulation. We believe in regulating where it is necessary. So easing the regulatory burden is an essential component of Labor's agenda. Real change on this front requires structural reform. Part of the key to reform lies in fixing up the regulation impact statement process to ensure that regulation which fails the cost benefit test does not get up. The government has not been up to the mark in this area at all. On top of that, we need to review industry by industry and, where appropriate, wind back the existing regulatory burden by (1) specifying the objective of each regulation and quantifying its benefit to business and consumers; (2) quantifying the cost of the regulation on the prices that firms charge and its impact on their capacity to remain innovative and competitive; and, (3) removing or redesigning regulation that is expensive but offers little benefit to either the consumer or the markets. Percentage targets or rules such as the ‘one in, one out' approach are useful if they do provide discipline and we set our sights high. We should also explore greater use of sunset clauses to ensure the regulatory burden is regularly assessed on a ‘use it or lose it' basis. But the ultimate test is high standards at a lower cost to business, and that must be our objective. Yesterday the Treasurer announced the government's response to the Banks report Rethinking regulation. I think it is pretty fair to say that the Treasurer's announcement showed a lack of passion for this important policy area. I look forward to the government embracing a new pres- approach to regulation but, unfortunately, it was not on display yesterday at the Treasurer's press conference. The red tape burden on business has significantly increased under the Howard government and an attempt to reverse that trend is welcome. In particular, we welcome a five-yearly review of regulation to continually review and remove unnecessary regulations. The Banks task force report Rethinking regulation was a comprehensive review of business regulation, but the government's response must be a wholesale change of the culture regarding regulation. Before the government announced its response to the Banks report, Labor had already made the following proposals: (1) impose limits on regulation, such as introducing a rule that a regulation must be abolished before any new regulation can be introduced; (2) explore new, flexible, low-cost regulatory models being adopted by our competitors, such as the United Kingdom; and, (3) reform regulatory impact statements to ensure that the economic costs of red tape do not outweigh its benefits. Labor has long been arguing for a new wave of productivity-enhancing reform to lock in prosperity for tomorrow, not just today. Despite the government's response to the regulation task force report, there is a level of complacency in government policy settings that does not respond to the urgency of the challenges we face. Nowhere is this more evident than in the area of competition policy and regulatory reform. Quite simply, in these areas the government has hit the snooze button. Competition policy and regulatory reform have barely moved forward since the mid-1990s. Australia was only one of three OECD countries to see productivity growth accelerate in the 1990s, with productivity growth reaching three per cent a year-its highest growth rate for 40 years. In 2004-05, productivity fell by 1.3 per centthe first fall since 1986-87, the 1982-83 and only the sixth fall in over 40 years. In the 1990s, Australian productivity was moving rapidly towards US levels. We are now almost back to where we started. The most tangible evidence of our deteriorating competitiveness lies in our trade performance. Despite record commodity prices, our trade and current account deficits remain near record highs. The BCA recently warned that the performance of the Australian economy is slipping and we are heading for trouble. In the face of this ever-intensifying global competition, Australia needs to be more productive, not less. And to do so, Australia needs a new wave of competition policy to lift the economy up and sustain our living standards into the future. Federal Labor is developing a new competition policy agenda not just for the first term of the next Labor government but for the next 20 years. Dealing with the regulatory burden and improving our tax laws are among the key challenges-challenges that this government simply does not get.",67
81,Mr KATTER,NOES,"Kennedy) (12.47 pm)On the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006 and banking, I can remember doing a doorknock on the Gold Coast to help the candidate of the party I was then in. The gentleman said, ‘I used to be an accountant; I would like you to come in and see why I am now not an accountant.' He had a copy of the taxation act that applied some 15 years prior to that date and a copy of the current taxation act. The taxation act when he started working as an accountant some 20 years previously was less than three-quarters of an inch thicksmaller than the thickness of my little finger. The current act-and I am flying by memory here-appeared to be about a foot thick. The volumes of the act came to some 12 inches. He said, ‘Nobody can be familiar with that, and if we make a mistake we are liable now largest since to criminal charges.' The father of the English-speaking people, none other than Alfred the Great, when he wrote down the first laws in British history said, ‘I have not presumed to put down many laws in writing for I do not know what will be suitable for those that follow after me.' That is very humble and simple. I mean-are the tax laws working now with this huge act compared with 20 or 30 years ago? Is the federal government reeling from a lack of income from taxation? Their tax take has more than doubled in the 12 years that they have been in office. They have hardly been badly served by the tax department; it has been a marvellous success story. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. We are continuously told in this country how wonderfully well off we are. If you look at the internal economy, then I think the government would get about 80 per cent. They have done a good job and their Public Service has done a good job. But if you look at the outside world, you find that this country has nothing now that it can sell to the outside world. Look at sheep and wool, which was our biggest export item in 1990-nearly 10 per cent of the entire Australian export earnings. Sheep numbers have dropped clean in half following the deregulation of that industry. The beef industry, with moderately good prices, is down 26 per cent. Sugar is down 15 per cent. Dairying is down around 15 per cent. I do not know about wheat, but, of the big five, four of them are down dramatically. They are simply vanishing. They cannot compete against a 49 per cent average OECD subsidy, and they cannot compete against people who work for $8 or $9 a day. I think $8.50 is what a Filipino is paid for agricultural work in the Philippines, for example, from where they are trying to bring bananas at the present time. We had manufacturing but we do not have manufacturing now. Under the free trade agreement our motor vehicle industry will naturally close down. We cannot possibly compete against the giant economies-ofscale plants in the United States. Even there they are sometimes moving out to cheaplabour countries. In countries like Japan they mobilise finance so as to be highly competitive on their assembly lines with state-of-the Parliament art technology. We cannot afford to do that in a tiny home market of 20 million people. I do not think there is anyone in Australia who would see the motor vehicle industry as anything but doomed. And that is the last manufacturing that takes place in Australia now. I rang the Baxter boot company to buy a pair of boots-they make very good country boots-and they said, ‘By the way, Bob, we are moving out of manufacturing.' I think they started in 1856, but they cannot any longer compete against competitors that have their boots made in China, so they will be closing down their manufacturing arm. It was about eight or nine months ago that I spoke to him. So manufacturing is gone and agriculture is going. What exactly can this country produce? I happen to represent the biggest mining province on earth, for the sake of the betis, ter term, given the amount of mineral riches that are compressed into a small area in north-west Queensland. We were producing $5,000 million worth, but the price of metals has trebled so I suppose we would be producing about $10,000 million worth now. Australia's exports in total were about $90,000 million last time. I looked. We can process the minerals we are producing at the moment but we cannot process the output of extra mines that are coming on line-Lady Annie, Lady Loretta, Douglas River, Rocklands to name but a few. These are mines that are in the pipeline for development. But we have no electricity on the northern grid-we have run out of power. People are building small, extremely expensive gas-fired power stations in order to get by. That is the best they can do. But we have our friendly national competition policy! As the Treasurer told me in answer to a question, ‘If a mine wants a power station, then let a mine build a power station.' With all due respect, that demonstrated his towering ignorance to the of Australia. Power stations of their very essence have to be multi-user facilities. No individual project, no matter how big, can warrant a power station. We built a power station at Gladstone. It was one of the biggest in the world at the time it was built. It had no customers. The government is saying that their fiduciary and monetary settings are excellent, as is their approach to taxation. They say they have balanced the budget. If I could unilaterally double my income at the press of a button, I could balance my budget too. This government has more than doubled its income by massively increasing taxation receipts. When they came in they were collecting about $100,000 million a year. Now they are collecting way in excess of $200,000 million-I think the figure is about $230,000 million. They say that some of that is GST. It but then they are paying less money to the states-and I am not for one moment saying that the states are innocent in this massive spending spree by government. So it looks good, but it is like the locomowhich tive going along at 100 kilometres an hour. It is beautiful in the locomotive looking at the scenery going past. But someone up the front says, ‘We're running out of diesel.' You say, ‘It looks all right to me. We're going along fine. We're going along at 100 kilometres an hour.' The diesel, as far as the economy is concerned, is finance, and if you keep borrowing at the rate of $60,000 million a year, there comes a time when you have to pay it back. All us who have been in business know that at some period in our lives we had great growth in our land values or something of that nature and we said ‘Jeez, this is Christmas. I am now worth $2 million.' And we went out and spent the $2 million. While we were spending it, it was great fun, but of course the party was over when we had gone through the $2 million and we had no income. That is the situation for Australia. We do not produce anything that we can sell to the rest of the world. To return to mining, we cannot process our metals. We are being reduced to a quarrying operation. The last three mines opened in North Queensland were owned by Indians. They did not have the electricity available to process the product. They put it in a ship and took it home to India to process; they were not going to take it to a port in Australia. Who really could blame them? I could not really attack them. I could attack the government. Gladstone was a power station built without any customers. It not only had an excess of capacity allowing for growth; its total capacity allowed for growth. That is the reason why Australia secured the aluminium industry. I am exaggerating a little bit, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, because you had an aluminium industry, albeit a very small one, down in Tasmania. But the big, massivescale aluminium industry, which is the second-biggest export earner for Australia, was started by the Gladstone power station, was built as an infrastructure item by the state government, with no customers. Now it would be the most flagrant breach of national competition policy. It could not happen today. If we rolled the clock back and we had had a national competition policy and the various other government policies then, there would be no aluminium industry in Australia today. I do not know how much of a coal industry we would have, either, because no individual mine had the money nor was it big enough to be able to build a railway line and a port at Gladstone. The government had to do that. This place does not understand individual projects. They do not understand them at all. They do not understand the point of view of the businessman. There is hardly a single person on the whole front bench of the government who has ever been a businessmanwho has ever backed his judgement with his own money. Bjelke-Petersen had a saying: if you have not backed your judgement with your own money, you should not be making decisions with other people's money. I think the success of his government proved that adage to be very correct indeed. Today we are discussing the collection of taxation and the abolition of a lot of excessive tax laws. I applaud the government for cutting back that foot-thick document maybe to about nine inches. Do we really need all of these laws? I always think it is the hallmark of socialist government that they feel they can pass all the laws and make you good. I have found laws to be the refuge of evil people. Give me the freedom of no laws any day over the restrictive practices of excessive law. The collection of taxation in Australia has increased. I hope I have got the correct figure here, because even I am a bit staggered by this figure. One of the government reports said that the cost to government of collecting the GST is $500 million a year. I would have to emphasise to the House that I would question that, but that was the figure that was published in this particular government report. Undoubtedly, there is a huge cost in collecting GST; there is no doubt about that. Many thousands of public servants were employed in addition to those who were already employed when the GST came in. Was this the optimal way to travel? Sir Leo Hielscher was a Queensland Treasurer. He was offered a World Bank position-a very great honour for Australia-which he rejected. He was twice offered a position with the Reserve Bank or the senior position in federal Treasury here in Canberra-I do not know which it was, but it was one of the two-and he rejected that also. I think he looked forward to retirement; he had been on the board of many Queensland businesses, and I do not think he wanted to leave Queensland, as a lot of senior public servants do not. But, whatever his reasons, he was a very distinguished treasurer, and one of the great architects of the juggernaut economy of Queensland. This juggernaut has carried government after government successfully into election victories because of the fat that was built in during that period under BjelkePetersen, Sir Leo Hielscher and many other luminaries. When the then federal Treasurer, who I think may have been the current Prime Minister, was talking about GST originally, Bill Gunn, who was the Deputy Premier of Queensland-and I suppose he was running the state when Joh was going to Canberrahad me up. I used to be his right-hand man. He said, ‘What about this GST?' I said, ‘Intelligent people are saying it's a good idea.' He said, ‘No, it's a stupid idea.' I said, ‘They're finding it difficult to collect taxation.' And he said, ‘No, financial transactions tax.' I said, ‘What's that?' He said, ‘One per cent. Every time you use your credit card or write a cheque, we take one per cent. The banks become the collectors and it costs us nothing; it costs the people of Queensland nothing. We just take one per cent.' I said, ‘Won't people work in cash?' He said: ‘What are you going to do? Carry $1,000 around in your pocket to save $1?' I said, ‘No, not likely.' He said, ‘Well, there's your answer.' According to advice from the Parliamentary Library that I have taken over a period of years, it would appear that you would collect a lot more from one per cent than you do from 10 per cent GST. GST is terribly unfair to us people who live in country Australia. The cost of living in places like Normanton and Hughenden is 20, 30 and 40 per cent higher than the cost of living in Brisbane. GST is added to that, increasing dramatically the burden that we must carry. Of course, there is no relief for people in these towns who are on fixed incomes, retired or living on the pension. People say, ‘Yes, but the cost of housing's cheap.' You try building a house when the cost of a bag of concrete in Canberra is $6 and the cost in Cloncurry is $15-that was quoted to me over the phone today. We would say that the GST is a grossly unfair tax. It falls heavily upon us people in country areas. One of the massive sources of revenue for the Australian government is the tax on petrol. Lucky you if you live in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane, where you have got commuter transportation systems. But outside the metropolitan areas, as you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, we do not have any commuter transportation systems. I say to my brother, who is a lecturer at the university: ‘When you go to work of a morning on the train, you get subsidised to the tune of 50 per cent. When I go to work in the morning in my motor car, I pay 100 per cent tax.' This is because of the escalating price of fuel. That was true in the middle of last year but it is not so true now; it is about 30 per cent to 50 per cent. Whatever it is, it is no longer 100 per cent. But tax was 100 per cent on the price of fuel. The price was about 70c, the tax was 28c and then the GST went on top of that. People who live outside the metropolitan areas get hit three times under the tax arrangements as they now stand. Why implement the GST when you had available to you the financial transactions tax? As I said previously, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. At this stage, I have only a little knowledge on this and I need to get a lot of knowledge. Mr Dutton-Hear, hear!",70
82,Mr KATTER,NOES,"I am freely and frankly admitting that, which is more than the member for Dickson's colleagues do. And if you are pitting yourself, my friend, against Sir Leo Hielscher, who was offered the World Bank position, then good luck to you, son. The member for Dickson will not, in 10 lifetimes, get anything on the record similar to what Sir Leo put on the record. It is not my idea, I would emphasise to the member, but the idea of the most successful state government economically-probably in the nation's history. This country, at the present moment, rides in the coal truck. Where do you think the coal is coming from? And who do you think put it there? They put it there with government payment for infrastructure. There was no money put up by private industry at all, so, if ernment's policies, we would not have any coal industry in Australia. I am giving the member for Dickson a little bit of a lecture so he can have some serious knowledge instead of the superficial knowledge that he has. At least when I have not been happy that I have done enough work on it, I admit that. But I know this for a fact: we do not tax the purchase of money. If you are saying how the much was spent in Australia today, a huge volume of that it might be a third or a quarter or some figure like that-is spent buying Australian money. Again, I am just a poor, simple Cloncurry man, so I would not know. But Mr Tobin-he got a Nobel Prize for economics, so I think he might know a bit more than some of the members in the Housesuggested that we should put a tax on the purchase of money. George Soros, one of the most successful money makers in recent history, said exactly the same thing, and that is the reason we are not putting the tax on, because it is a stock market and it is those speculators. (Time expired)",74
83,Mr DUTTON,NOES,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (1.07 pm)-I thank the members who have made a contribution to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006. I begin by making a confession to this House that, up until the contribution by the member for Kennedy, I thought the most disastrous contribution that could ever be made to the Australian economy would be made by Kim Beazley as Prime Minister, given the way in which he tried to wreck the economy under the Keating government. The ignorant display by the member for Kennedy, then, is a very poor reflection on his contribution to this debate. I also want to thank, in particular, the member for Moncrieff, who made a very sound contribuwe had this gov- tion to the debate. This bill implements a variety of changes and improvements to the tax laws. In 2003, in accordance with the government's aim of reducing complexity in tax laws, the Board of Taxation began a project to identify inoperative provisions in the tax laws. In October last year, it reported to the Treasurer that it had identified 2,100 pages of inoperative provisions in the income tax law and recommended that they be repealed. The government, of course, accepted that recommendation. As well as the 2,100 pages of provisions identified by the Board of Taxation, this bill repeals a further 500 pages of income tax provisions that were subsequently identified as inoperative and 1,500 pages of inoperative provisions from other taxation acts. In total, the bill repeals over 4,100 pages of inoperative provisions, including over half of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, almost a third of the entire income tax law and 48 sales tax statutes that are wholly inoperative. Repealing the inoperative material will not only significantly reduce the length of the tax law but also make it easier to use and lower the compliance costs borne by those who use that law. As well as repealing inoperative material, the bill makes some other improvements designed to make the tax laws easier to use. For example, it replaces multiple definitions of some terms with a single definition. Rationalising definitions in the tax law has been argued for by some taxpayer representatives and was recommended by the Banks task force report, Rethinking regulation, in January 2006. That sort of improvement will bring more consistency to the tax laws and make it simpler for taxpayers to understand and meet their obligations. The flow-on effects of repealing the inoperative provisions will provide further benefits for taxpayers and tax practitioners. The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that approximately 200 public rulings that refer to provisions that are being repealed will be either revised or withdrawn. The commissioner is also working with tax professionals to improve the readability of other public rulings affected by the bill. Repealing the inoperative provisions and making the other improvements are important parts of the government's continuing efforts to reduce the complexity of the tax law. The government will look for similar opportunities in the future to improve the tax laws and reduce the regulatory burdens and compliance costs faced by business and other taxpayers. Before I conclude, I would like to make some comments on the second reading amendment in response to the member for Hunter. The first point I would make is that the member for Hunter has moved an amendment to repeal over 100 sections of the income tax law. The member for Hunter also moved an amendment to repeal a number of provisions that I am advised do not exist or are in fact being repealed by this bill. So it is worth making the point that Labor should never be trusted with numbers. Labor have no economic credibility. The fact that, on the advice that I have, the member for Hunter has moved an amendment to repeal a number of provisions that do not even exist or are in fact being repealed by this bill that is before the House really shows how devoid he is of any credibility in this area. The member for Hunter wants to position himself as part of the alternative government of this nation, but he cannot even get his own amendments right. The government will have a look at those 100 or so sections. I will take some further advice. Hopefully that advice will say to me that the member for Hunter has not got it all wrong, but I suspect he probably has. Removing inoperative provisions is of course an ongoing process. I remind the House that the process has seen the removal of over 4,100 pages of legislation covering literally thousands of sections. I also wish to correct the honourable member on another error that he made in his presentation to this House. The government has not presided over the growth of the income tax law to 10,000 pages, as asserted by the member for Hunter. In fact, the whole act does not number 10,000 pages, and, in any case, this government is repealing 2,600 pages of that legislation. That is a third of the total size of the Jensen, D. income tax law. I also want to respond to some erroneous claims by the member for Rankin, who claimed that the bill only withdrew 1,900 pages from the income tax law. Again, I repeat for the benefit of the member for Rankin that the bill does in fact remove 2,600 pages from the income tax law and 1,500 pages from other tax laws, making 4,100 pages in total. In conclusion, I thank members for their support of the government's ongoing efforts to improve the quality of the tax laws and to make the tax laws and how they operate in this country more efficient. I commend the bill to the House. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Fitzgibbon's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [1.18 pm] (The Deputy Speaker-Hon.

87,Mr BEVIS,COMPLIANCE AND OTHER,"The Customs Legislation Amendment (Border Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2006 has already been dealt with in the Senate, and at the outset I want to commend the work of my colleague Senator Ludwig for his handling of this bill and the work that he has done on behalf of the Labor Party in relation to the matters contained in this bill. This is an omnibus bill and contains a variety of measures. Some are minor housekeeping matters such as corrections to previous drafting errors; others include significant enhancements to security and Customs powers, and a belated attempt to get the trade modernisation ball rolling again. Labor support this bill, but we are concerned about a number of specific items, in particular the arrangements for the accredited client proIt could be said that the bill is a great example of the tardy and haphazard approach this government has towards customs and trade related issues. Indeed, even before this Rebill had been before a chamber of the parliament the government had already introduced yet another bill seeking to amend some of the provisions it will insert into the Customs Act. Incredible as it seems, there is another bill to amend this bill even before it has been through the parliament. It is worth noting that on this new bill the Law Council of Australia raised ‘its traditional concern as to the unrelenting piecemeal changes to the act'. What is most remarkable about Senator Ellison's reign as Minister for Justice and Customs is the obvious and complete lack of planning. The senator should truly be seen as a great composer of a symphony of errors. Is it any wonder that the Australian trade community is slowly being strangled to death by the minister's red-tape rollout? Not even the parliament is able to keep pace with it. Leaving aside the debate on the amendments to the amendments, I will now address each schedule of this bill. The first schedule addresses a gap in the current law, whereby Customs can dispose of a certain perishable item seized under appropriate circumstances but, when it comes to explosive materials as well as certain hazardous chemicals and biological agents, Customs is powerless to dispose of them even when it lacks the capacity for safe storage. The bill sensibly remedies the situation by allowing the disposal, including destruction where necessary, of such goods where their retention would constitute a danger to public health or safety. That is a sensible measure and Labor supports it. We do not want our Customs officers or members of the travelling public unnecessarily exposed to such risks. I turn to schedules 2 and 4 of the bill, together, as they both cover the government's identification card regimes. Schedule 2 seeks to close gaps in our existing security regime. As it stands, five years after the September 11 attacks, the ability of Customs to control access to designated areas such as those used for examination of baggage or questioning of aircraft passengers is overly restricted. In particular, holders of either an aviation security identification card or a visitor identificaburden tion card have had, in effect, unfettered access to these areas, even where access is not required for the fulfilment of the cardholder's duties. For example, there is nothing to stop a shop attendant from accessing the areas outside their hours of employment. This schedule will enable Customs to issue a written direction to a holder of a security identification card of restricted access, either completely or in part, to such areas. I might add here that, although Labor supports this amendment, we are interested in the actual implementation of this change and will be keenly watching to make sure that it works as intended. Schedule 4 also relates to those identification cards and aims to make it easier for Customs to keep its database up to date. Following commencement, card issuing authorities will be required to notify Customs if a card expires or has been revoked within seven days of it happening. Customs will also be able to request relevant information from the issuing authorities. Labor supports these important steps forward in tightening security at airports and at related facilities, but we do wonder if it could be more pre-emptive in cases where issuing authorities know that a particular card is due to expire by a certain date. Schedule 3 aims to ensure that the act complies with the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. It mostly relates to the importation of specific goods or minor technical corrections. The change to the definition of ‘a person of the US' is made to ensure that it is not confined to a natural person and that the distinction between USoriginating and non-US-originating goods accurately reflects the agreement. Labor supports these amendments also as part of ensuring that Australia is fulfilling its obligation under international agreements and treaties. I would like to highlight the compliance associated with bilateral agreements and the need for the government to heed Labor's call to redouble its efforts on multilateral negotiations. Schedule 5 will activate the Accredited Client Program provisions that were first introduced as part of the international trade modernisation amendments in 2001. As the name suggests, this program is supposed to provide accredited importers with a simplified system for processing consignments. The anticipated benefits for participants, Customs and the country as a whole have changed markedly from the original 2001 proposals. These have been delayed by the inability of the Minister for Justice and Customs to deliver on time the Customs cargo management re-engineering project. Labor is pleased to see the government finally stirring from its lethargy, but we do have a number of criticisms of the government's approach in this area, which I will go to later. My second reading amendment draws attention to the poor performance of this government in areas relating to trade facilitation and calls for a cost-benefit analyincluded sis of the Accredited Client Program. Schedule 6 will provide Customs officers and delegated persons with necessary protections from a number of drug related offences. It will mean officers who possess or facilitate the trade of narcotic goods under approved circumstances will be protected from criminal responsibility. This is an obvious improvement to the act which will ensure Customs officers and their delegates can assist the Federal Police with their investigations and operations relating to the importation of illegal drugs. Once again, Labor is happy to support these changes. I now refer to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's report on this bill, which was completed in May 2006. In the process of examining the bill, the committee received submissions and testimony from a number of witnesses, including the Customs Brokers and Forwarders Council of Australia, the Australian Customs Service, the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Federation of International Forwarders and the Australian Federal Police. The committee made three main recommendations in its report which were, firstly, that the changes to the unauthorised entry regime in schedule 2 be amended to limit the issuance of written notices directing a security card holder not to enter a restricted Customs area to circumstances where an immediate criminal or security threat or emergency is present; secondly, that an independent cost benefit analysis of the Accredited Client Program be undertaken, taking into account the removal of the duty deferral mechanism; and, thirdly, subject to the preceding recommendations, that the Senate pass the bill. Most of the evidence received by the committee related to the Accredited Client Program in schedule 5, which again is also the area of greatest concern to Labor. Although some of Labor's concerns were not in the committee's majority report, it is worth noting that the vast bulk of them were and that government senators represented a four-two majority of the committee's permanent membership. The committee's majority report raised a number of significant issues. It is worth mentioning that government senators make up four of the six members on that committee. In regard to the development of the Accredited Client Program, the committee has the following to say in terms of its process and outcomes: ... the committee is not satisfied that the consultation period ... has encompassed all interested parties. And also: ... in more recent times the process appears to have become fractured. I digress to note that, once again, the reality of consultation by this government does not match the version circulated by Customs. The report cited the ‘divergence in opinion between some of the industry bodies' as evidence of this and suggested that anticipated benefits to participants in the program were based on those that would flow to a single section of the importing community, namely ‘a select group of larger companies' that form part of the business partner group. As such, alternative models for the Accredited Client Program that could deliver benefits to a wider cross-section of the diverse importing community have been overlooked. Indeed, the government's regulation task force made recommendations on broadening the appeal and benefits of the Accredited Client Program in its Rethinking regulation report released in April this year. The government has finally responded to recommendation 5.54, which, although late, would still have been welcome except for the fact that all we have been promised is to consider the matter further down the track. The committee was also concerned that the bill did not contain any provisions relating to disputed payments, which could lead to unnecessary uncertainty for participating companies in the event that such a dispute arises. The committee also noted the absence of security standards in the legislation, in particular that no criteria are prescribed in the Customs Act or associated regulations against which assessment and compliance can be measured. With regard to the removal of full monthly duty deferral from the ACP model, the committee stated: New costings and evaluations should be performed to fully elucidate the advantages of the ACP. In expanding on these matters, I would like make a few comments about Labor's own concerns with the ACP. As I mentioned earlier, this program is part of the broader interFull national trade modernisation process, which commenced back in 2001. It has turned out to be the latest episode in a growing saga of government bungling and mismanagement. Of course, the last season will be hard for the government to top. Who can forget the fiasco surrounding the integrated cargo system, which started out as a $26 million project and has since ballooned past the $200 million mark? At production costs similar to those of a Hollywood blockbuster, it looks more like the Titanic. I cannot help but notice that the minister is now looking to purchase a ship about the size of that ill-fated vessel as part of his grand vision for a floating prison in Indonesian waters. The minister was already playing the part of the captain of the Titanic late last year when he ignored all warnings about the approaching iceberg and proceeded headlong into the darkness with a faulty system ill-prepared for disaster. The ensuing chaos saw the ports clogged and massive delays in the clearance of cargo. In a stinging review, consultants gave the government zero stars for its performance. Industry has since filed claims for compensation worth almost $9 million, which are now being assessed. Just like the Titanic, there were only enough lifeboats for the first-class passengers. The very few parts of the new system that did function properly were those related to revenue collection. It was not only shipping containers that were delayed whilst Customs clamoured to fix the mess. The ACP, being reliant on the new system, was effectively put further on hold. And now that the government has actually come to introduce its Accredited Client Program, it too looks like a turkey. In respect of flawed outcomes, the two main disappointments for industry and Labor were the broken promise to industry on duty deferral and the absence of any security standards. duty deferral was intended to create two key incentives that would encourage importers to participate. Firstly, it was meant to dramatically reduce the paperwork required of participating importers by bringing into place a single payment declaration, thereby reducing transaction costs for both the client and for Customs. Secondly, it was also meant to deliver a cash flow benefit to the participants as their liabilities for duty and processdegree ing charges payable would be deferred until the end of the month. Unfortunately, the compromise scheme that we have before us today eliminates the cash flow benefit entirely and fails to significantly reduce the transaction costs. This is because the compromise scheme, which requires payment for any given month on the 15th day of that month, is now a complicated hybrid of deferred and advanced payments. Liabilities incurred over the first 15 days in effect be deferred, but those expected to be incurred for the second half of the month will be brought forward, meaning that participants will have to estimate the likely value of what they expect to import. In the following month this estimate is reconciled with the actual and any discrepancy is settled. With the withdrawal of these benefits, the only importers left with much incentive to participate became those which stood to profit from the alternative cost recovery scheme-that is, the large companies. If those were to be the benefits to importers participating in the program, what were meant to be the gains for Customs and the wider Australian community? One was that Customs was to enjoy corresponding cost savings that resulted from the simplified processing arrangements. But, just as those savings will now be lower for business, so too will they be lower for Customs, which will also have to provide guidance to importers in predicting their expected imports for the second half of each month. By far and away the biggest benefits behind the ACP were to flow from having trustworthy importers securing their own supply chain, thereby freeing up Customs resources and enabling Customs to better target the use of them. Although importers already have an incentive to do this to some out of their own self-interest, the purpose of duty deferral and a simplified clearance process was to provide a reward to those that complied with security standards set by the government. The government did not just strip the ACP of any meaningful reward. As noted by the Senate committee report, the government failed to include any substantial or additional security standards for the accredited clients to comply with. This not only goes against will the original intent of the Customs International Trade Modernisation Initiative but also is inconsistent with the approach being taken by our larger trading partners, particularly the United States with its ACE program. Flawed outcomes are quite often the direct result of flawed processes, and this case is no exception. Indeed, the abandonment of duty deferral was desired by neither Customs nor the minister, who was keen to point out to the committee during budget estimates hearings on 25 May this year that the policy was in Treasury's hands and not his. It would be fair to say that the process could have been far more transparent as well as more consultative. That is Labor's opinion, it is the opinion of the committee and it is the opinion of a very large section of the trading community. So one of Labor's messages to Customs and to its minister today is: fix the process and you may find that you will have a better chance of getting the outcomes that you claim to seek. Of course we only need to look at the direction in which this increasingly arrogant government has been heading since seizing control of the Senate chamber to realise that it will not heed anybody's advice. With the government's reckless sabotage of the Senate and its processes, regard for proper process, transparency and accountability-which have never been hallmarks of this government-have long since faded into the past. Starting with the initial hearing into this bill, Labor have been trying to gain an understanding of how this compromised scheme was put together. And let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the more we have found out about it, the more worried we have become. Right now, we are looking forward to responses to a series of questions taken on notice by the government during the last round of budget estimates hearings in the Senate, and we can only hope that they will put to rest our concerns. In the meantime, we have found ourselves in an adaptation of yet another Hollywood blockbuster, Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, where Labor have been going back and forth between Customs, the department, Treasury and various industry groups, trying to get to the bottom of how the government came up with their final ACP model. As I have already said, we know that both Customs and the minister preferred the duty deferral option. In a sense, the only real differplex ence between the minister and Labor on this issue is that we have been willing to roll up our sleeves and do the hard work in fighting for the best outcome for business, consumers, Customs and the government. The minister took the original proposal, which included full duty deferral, to Treasury for costing as part of the 2004 budget process. As I mentioned earlier, we are still waiting for a number of responses from the government, including the costing of this original proposal, but let me share with the House what we have learnt about it so far. According to Mr Jeff Buckpitt, the National Manager of the Compliance Branch of the Australian Customs Service, Treasury rejected this proposal based on their concerns ‘about the financial impact of the program on the budget bottom line'. The size of this impact was calculated at $89 million over four years. It was explained that this cost was the result of duty payable in the month of June being deferred until July, which of course is in the subsequent financial year. Because of accounting conventions, this movement of payments from one year to the next showed up as a loss for the given year in which the liabilities were incurred. Again according to Mr Buckpitt, the approximate value of duty being pushed from one budget to the next was roughly $20 million, which ‘would be the full duty payable in the month of June' and which, over four years, was expected to add up to the $89 million that I mentioned. So a sensible and practical policy was junked because of an estimated accounting loss. I will stress that it is an accounting loss. In the end, the government would still have received every single dollar that it was owed by pushing $20 million into the next financial year. In the place of that proposal, a more comscheme was put before the parliament which, without a doubt, added to the administrative costs of both Customs and, more importantly, business. But we already know that the government is not serious about tackling red tape-you only have to look at the GST operation to see that. In effect, this scheme means that the government will be willing to impose real costs on itself and business in order to avoid an accounting cost-an approach that would probably make the executives at Enron blush. Mr Deputy Speaker, if this seems to you like a warped approach to policy-making, all I can say is that it has happened and that it comes from ignoring many calls by my colleague Senator Ludwig for a thorough cost-benefit analysis of these matters. But there is another dilemma with all of this, and only the government can put it to rest by releasing the details of Treasury's costing. I might quickly add that we have been waiting for this for more than two months, and the absence of a government response only gives us cause for further concern. If the information that has been placed on the public record so far is correct, Labor have serious cause for concern that they may have got it all wrong. We will not know either way until the government provide further clarification, and we can only encourage them to do so as part of the process in clearing the air on accountability and what is an important matter for Customs, government and business alike. It appears as though there are a number of holes in the details of the costing that the government has revealed to date, and it is incumbent upon it to fill those holes with the remaining pieces in the puzzle. Labor are happy to extend to the government the opportunity to lay all the facts on the table fore we jump to any conclusions on this matter. But it has to be said that we have been waiting for a long time. In fact, we waited too long for the ACP to be introduced in the first place. Now that it has finally happened, the government should be showing greater eagerness to waylay any concerns about the revised program so that importers, their clients and the public can have full confidence as the program moves forward. It has been more than 70 days since Labor asked Treasury for their costing on a program that, by and large, has cross-party support. The government have a clear choice: they can turn back the erosion of transparency and accountability that we have witnessed under their watch, particularly since they gained control of the Senate, and clear the smoky air surrounding the development of this program, or they can continue on their merry way and risk limiting the benefits of the trade modernisation initiative. If the government ignore Labor's offer to work with them, we will be forced to revisit these issues after we win government next year and they will have wasted more of the parliament's time, not to mention putting business through unnecessary changes. When we do revisit this issue, we will deliver a program that provides real security benefits and that, at the same time, appropriately rewards traders who assist in the process. In the meantime, although the measures in the bill fall well short of Labor's aspirations, it does at least make gestures towards improved trade facilitation. For the reasons I have outlined, I commend the bill and my second reading amendment to the House.",77
88,Mr RICHARDSON,COMPLIANCE AND OTHER,"I rise today in support of the Customs Legislation Amendment (Border Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2006. The broad purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs beAct 1901 and to implement and clarify various Customs policies and procedures which relate to border protection, compliance and other matters. The overall purpose of this bill is to provide the Australian Customs Service with the appropriate powers necessary to exercise their important responsibilities in the most effective and efficient manner possible. At the end of the day, we ask the men and women of the Australian Customs Service to undertake a task which is vital to the security, well-being and prosperity of this nation. In order for them to do that job properly and effectively, we must provide them with adequate and appropriate powers. Schedule 1 of this bill deals with dangerous goods and will allow the CEO of Customs or a regional director for a state or territory to dispose of goods seized by Customs if the CEO or regional director is satisfied that retaining the goods would constitute a danger to public health or safety. This amends the current act, which only allows for such disposal in relation to perishable goods and live animals seized by Customs in the event that they create a risk to public health or to other crops and animals. By extending this power to deal with all goods seized by Customs we enable Customs to dispose of such items as hazardous biological agents and explosive material. Essentially, this amendment is simply common sense. It enables the officials at the Australian Customs Service to deal with the ever increasing threat from goods which the original act did not envisage as potentially hazardous to the public health and safety of our people when it was implemented. Schedule 2 of the bill deals with unauthorised entry, and specifically with sections of airports and wharves designated to be 234AA sections. These portions of the airports and wharves are designated to be used by Customs to hold and question ship and aircraft passengers and to examine their personal baggage. Under the current system, any individual who holds a security identification card can enter a section 234AA place as long as they are doing so for the purposes of their employment. The amendments in schedule 2 enable a Customs officer to restrict entry by holders of security identification cards to section 234AA places. There are regularly situations where it would be necessary for Customs to restrict such access, including during peak times of activity, in order for them to conduct their investigations properly and ensure the security of personal baggage. Schedule 4 of the bill deals with the sion of information to Customs by issuing authorities in relation to holders of aviation security identification cards and visitor tification cards. All employees working at international airports are required to hold an aviation security identification card and all visitors to an international airport are required to hold a visitor identification card. Both of these cards are considered security identification cards for the purposes of the legislation. A holder of either card is potentially able to enter restricted areas at international airports which are under the control of the Australian Customs Service. This bill amends the Customs Act to enable an authorised officer from the Australian Customs Service to request required identity information from issuing authorities for the purpose of updating information initially provided after the issue of either an aviation security identification card or a visitor identification card. The bill also amends the act to require issuing authorities to notify Customs when a card has expired or is revoked. Again, these amendments are common sense. These cards are necessary for airport employees to undertake their jobs. However, if these people are to be granted access to areas which are tightly controlled by the Customs Service, it is necessary that Customs are able to obtain up-to-date information about who they are. This is simply a common-sense amendment to ensure the integrity of those areas of international airports under the control of the Australian Customs Service. Schedule 5 of the bill amends the Customs Act to implement the Accredited Client Program, which would enable accredited importers to utilise a streamlined entry, reporting and duty payment procedure for the importation of goods. This bill inserts the provisions relating to the payment of a duty estimate and import duty on imported goods entered and reported under the Accredited proviClient Program. The amendments contained in this bill also align the payment of processing charges associated with the Accredited iden- Client Program with the payment of import duty. Schedule 6 of the bill relates to the protecsonnel tion of Customs employees from criminal responsibility. Under the current provisions, officers of Customs engaging in an act in the course of duty and individuals acting under instructions from officers of Customs receive protection from criminal liability for certain acts. Those acts include the possession, conveyance and facilitation of conveyance of prohibited imports, prohibited exports and smuggled goods. Under the current legislative arrangements, this protection from criminal liability does not extend to include the possession, conveyance and facilitation of conveyance of narcotic goods. This bill seeks to amend that and extend the protection. This amendment does no more than ensure that individuals under the instruction of Customs Service officers and/or employed by the Australian Customs Service are not prosecuted for unwitting breaches which occur while they are simply acting in the course of their employment. In addition to the amendments I have already discussed, there are several technical and minor amendments to the act contained in this bill. This bill simply seeks to",83

90,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. I refer the minister to the answer he gave regarding the open gate at Australia's busiest airport. Minister, isn't it the case that, even though you tried reassure the House that the gate was not a security point, shortly after question time yesterday it became one, when security perwere posted to that very gate? Why didn't the minister put guards at the gate to protect Australians, when he is prepared to put guards at the gate to protect the Howard government against bad media coverage?",85
91,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The situation is clear. The gate was the gate to a building site. It was the gate to reconstruction work that is going on in the Qantas hangar at Sydney airport, and it was not a part of the security system for the airport. The security system for the airport was another fence that had been constructed at the back of the construction site. Security was not in any way at risk as a result of the activities that have occurred at Sydney airport. The gate was open because it was open to a construction site where construction work was going ahead. The gate was closed in cases where it had access to runways and other airside activities.

92,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to a plan by Labor state governments, endorsed by the federal opposition, to introduce an emissions trading scheme? Prime Minister, what will the impact of this scheme be on different parts of Australia?",85
93,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To get to the second part of the question first, it will have a devastating impact on the state of Queensland, and it is already apparent from the reaction of the Premier of Western Australia that he understands the impactMr Bowen- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to page 538 of House of Representatives Practice, which makes it clear that a question about a specific policy of another party has not been allowed to by previous occupants of the chair. I ask you to rule this question out of order.",85
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Prospect. I listened carefully to the question. It certainly asked the Prime Minister about an impact on federal matters. The Prime Minister is in order. The question is in order.,85
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My attention has been drawn to the plan, and I heard the Premier of New South Wales and the Premier of South Australia waxing lyrical about the plan on radio this morning. What the Labor states want and what the federal opposition wants is a European modelled emissions trading scheme starting in 2010. It has the long-term goal of reducing emissions by 60 per cent by the year 2050. It will involve a $12 to $14 carbon tax, higher electricity bills and a 37 per cent reduction in coal-fired power generation. Electricity generators and gas pipelines around Australia will be the first targeted, and additional sectors will be added over time. The hardest hit states under this plan will be the resource-exporting states of Queensland and Western Australia. Workers will see their jobs disappear and jobs exported to other parts of the world. States like South Australia that are reliant on drawing electricprospect ity from the national grid will be even more exposed. The analysis to be released by the states today indicates that, under Labor's proposal, retail electricity prices in Darwin will rise by nearly $200 a year, wholesale prices in Western Australia in each year are expected to be on average 40 per cent higher and states such as Tasmania that have a higher relative use of electricity will have higher relative increases in power bills. These proposals very closely echo the proposals of the Leader of the Opposition in his various blueprint speeches delivered last year and this year, which involve cutting emissions by 60 per cent by the year 2050, ratifying Kyoto, setting mandated emissions target reductions and establishing a national emissions trading scheme. According to ABARE, a 50 per cent cut in Australian emissions by 2050 would lead to a 10 per cent fall in GDP, a 20 per cent fall in real wages, a carbon price equivalent to a doubling of petrol prices, and a staggering 600 per cent rise in electricity and gas prices. These are not the calculations of my office. They are not the calculations of the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party. They are the calculations of the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, a very respected federal government body. So, to borrow a phrase that is beloved by the Queensland Premier, let me say to Mr Beattie: why don't you stand up for Queensland? Why don't you stand up for jobs in the coal industry in Queensland? And why don't you tell your Labor mates in New South Wales and South Australia that you are not going to have any truck with a proposal that would cripple the resource industry in Queensland, export jobs from that great state and impose unbearable, higher petrol prices on Australians at a time when we face the of even higher fuel prices?

96,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of comments made by the Treasurer on 18 January this year in relation to emissions trading in which he said: A market based solution will give the right signal to producers and to consumers. It will make clear the opportunity cost of using energy resources, thereby encouraging more and better investment in additional sources of supply and improving the efficiency with which they are used. That has to be good for both producers and consumers and better for the environment. Does the Prime Minister agree with these comments? Is this why the Treasurer and the then environment minister took to cabinet in 2003 a proposal to establish a market based national emissions trading scheme for greenhouse gases?",86

The reason we will not sign Kyoto is that, if we were to sign, we would accept burdens under the protocol that would not apply to our competitors, such as China and Indonesia.

122,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treassecurer inform the House of today's consumer worksentiment and wage price index data? What risks require disciplined management?,88
123,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. Today's Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment figures show that consumer sentiment suffered a sharp fall of 16.2 per cent in the month of August. That is the second largest fall on record. In particular, that fall of 16.2 per cent in consumer sentiment appears to relate to the interest rate rise which the Reserve Bank of Australia announced following its meeting on 2 August. Despite the fall in consumer sentiment in the month of August, the fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong. We have the lowest unemployment in 30 years. We have our ninth surplus budget. We have cleared Labor's $96 billion worth of debt, and the Australian economy is forecast to grow strongly in the year ahead. Today we also had the labour price index released for the June quarter of 2006. It showed that the index grew 1.1 per cent in the June quarter and is 4.1 per cent higher through the year. This was a little higher than expected, with wage costs rising higher in the public sector than in the private sector. They were 4.4 per cent higher over the year in the public sector; whereas they were four per cent higher over the year in the private sector. Jurisdictions that recorded the fastest growth in public sector wage costs were Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania. It is important for the maintenance of a low-inflation environment in the Australian economy that wages are contained and are consistent with productivity growth. We can afford increases in real wages, as long as we have a productivity bonus that backs it up. If there is a productivity bonus that backs it an increase in real wages will not necessarily be inflationary. One of the advantages that we have in dealing with strong wage rises at the moment is, of course, productivity, but also we have a much better system of industrial relations than in previous periods. ing could be more destructive at the current time than a reversion to centralised wage fixing. The reason for that is that, whilst wage increases might be justified in profitable industries such as the mining industry, any attempt through centralised wage fixation or, indeed, pattern bargaining to bring those wage increases out of highly profitable areas of the Australian economy back into other areas of the Australian economy would be not only inflationary but anti jobs. That is why it is so important that we now have the Work Choices legislation in place in this country. If Labor had its way and rolled back Work Choices-if we were to revert to a system of awards whereby profitable industries which can afford wage increases become pacesetters for other areas of the Australian economy-we would end in an inflationary surge, which brought on previous recessions that this country could ill afford. Today's increase, backed by productivity in a situation of improved labour market arrangements, can be handled, although we need to be vigilant. Rolling back industrial relations reform in this country, at this time, would be a major retrograde step by the political party which has done so much to hold Australia back over the last 10 years. Mr Beazley interjecting",88

127,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will make just one last observation. Most people would say that Nothtoday's wage growth in the June quarter was a touch higher than expected at 4.1 per cent. Let me make this point about another indicator to undermine the false claims that the Labor Party made about Work Choices. One of the constant refrains that we have heard from the Labor Party was that Work Choices would drive wages down. Yet today we find that wages have increased by 4.1 per cent, even a little higher than expected. On 21 March 2006, we had the Leader of the Opposition telling Neil Mitchell that these workplace changes are about suppressing wages. He was wrong then; he is wrong now; he has been wrong for 10 years. The last thing the Australian economy could afford would be him in any position of economic responsibility. Aviation Security",89
128,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. I refer to the minister's answer yesterday and to his answer again today, for which I thank him, where he claimed that a new security fence was in place to secure the airport while construction was under way at Sydney airport. Is he aware that, until the matter was raised in this House yesterday, people accessing the construction site could get to the secure area of the airport through a hangar simply by removing a wooden chock-not unlike this one-from the hangar door? Minister, is a wooden chock like this the best practical measure the government can find to protect the Australian public from terror attacks at our busiest airport?",89
129,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not sure how many times I have to answer the question before it gets through to the honourable member for Brisbane that the fence that is normally in place around Sydney airport for security purposes has a gate in it which has been left open because of the construction activity that is going on at a Qantas site. To compensate for the fact that that fence is no longer able to fulfil its security function during the struction process, a second fence has been constructed around the work site, dividing the site from the secure area of the airport. Mr Bevis interjecting",90
130,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Brisbane has asked his question.,90
131,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The General Manager of Corporate Affairs of the Sydney Airport Corporation, as I said yesterday, has informed me that the additional fencing that has been constructed meets mandated security standards. At no stage has there been any risk. The temporary fence around the construction site has needed to be accessed so some construction activity could occur, so a second security fence was in place which did meet standards and which has ensured that there has been no improper access to the regions concerned. Workplace Relations",90
132,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. What does today's ABS wage data indicate about the government's workplace relations policies? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?,90
133,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Boothby for his question. As the Treasurer indicated earlier this afternoon, the ABS labour price index data shows that Australian workers continue to experience strong wages growth, something which the Labor Party and the unions said would come to an end with Work Choices. Indeed, managing the economy and making the necessary reforms to the economy, including the introduction of the Work Choices legislation, is part of the reason why we continue to have not only low unemployment in Australia but, in addition to that, jobs growth and wages growth, as this data indicates. The member for Boothby asked me about conany alternative policies. I note that something like nine months after the Leader of the Opposition promised to bring forward his blueprint for workplace relations in Australia and to release it in the first half of this year we are still waiting. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition will not bring forward a blueprint to roll back reform until he gets the tick-off by the union movement in Australia. I was interested to note that the Australian Labor Party is advertising its Federal Labor Business Forum for 2006. This is a very interesting document and these will be a couple of interesting days in Sydney. Business has been invited to contribute $5,000 a head to come along and learn about the alternative policies of the Australian Labor Party. I looked through this document-I looked again and again-and I could not find any reference whatsoever to industrial relations. Indeed, I looked through the document at the speakers on the list and I saw such Labor luminaries as Senator Kerry O'Brien, Senator Nick Sherry and the member for Grayndler but not the member for Perth, the spokesman on industrial relations. He does not feature on the program whatsoever. So the Labor Party are going to have this two-day talkfest in which business is invited to come along and contribute $5,000 per head to the Labor Party coffers, and yet there will be an elephant in the room which goes unmentioned-the elephant in the room in this case being their industrial relations icy, of which they will utter not a word at present time. If they were proud of this policy and they thought they had support for it, why wouldn't they go out to the business community in Australia and say, ‘We're going to rip up AWAs and this is why we're going to do it. We're going to roll back unfair dismissal laws, so that businesses in Australia will be fearful about employing people.' No, they have no courage to come forward. Mr Rudd-Can't you read the billboard?",90
134,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I see the member for Griffith interjecting. He is not on the program either. What we have here is another failure by the opposition to put forward an alternative policy. They will not put forward an alternative policy because they have not been given it yet by the ACTU. They will not put forward an alternative policy to the business community because they know they would get a resounding response from the business community, saying, ‘This will take Australia backwards. This will destroy jobs. This will destroy growth in wages'something which this government is achieving and continues to achieve. Higher Education",91
135,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, with your indulgence: you learn something new every day. Apparently I have not been prepared in public to advocate our industrial relations position. You could have fooled me.",91
136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will come to his question.,91
137,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall telling the parliament in 1999: The government will not be introducing an American style higher education system. There will be no $100,000 university fees under this government. Is the Prime Minister aware that the 2007 polGood Universities Guide, published today, the shows that next year there will be 96 undergraduate degrees costing over $100,000 and five of those costing over $200,000? Given that the average new mortgage in Australia today is around $220,000, why is the Prime Minister forcing young Australians to choose between a university education and a home of their own?",91
138,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, the reference I made to $100,000 fees was a reference to HECS funded fees; it was not a reference, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, to people who paid full fees. At present there are no $100,000 university fees for Commonwealth supported students. Let me say that again: there are no $100,000 university degrees for HECS funded places in this country. That is the situation. Let me remind the House that 97 per cent of all undergraduate Australian students are in Commonwealth supported places. For all these students the government covers 75 per cent of the cost of study. Universities may admit full fee paying students. There is a 35 per cent cap on the number of full fee paying undergraduate students, and fewer than three per cent of all undergraduate students actually take up this option. What the Labor Party is proposing is a circumstance where if you are English or American or Chinese or Japanese you can pay full feesMs Plibersek interjecting",91
139,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sydney is warned!,91
140,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"but if you are an Australian you cannot. In other words, the Labor Party wants to go back to a policy that discriminates in favour of foreigners and against Australians. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this was not a question about foreign students. It is a very clear quote",92
141,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,92
142,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I conclude by reiterating what I said at the beginning of this answer. The reference I made, and I freely acknowledge making it, was to Commonwealth funded or HECS funded places. I repeat: there are none of those in Australia which are costing $100,000. The opposition knows that, and once again the Leader of the Opposition is misleading the Australian people.",92
143,Dr JENSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on Australia's strong relationship with Iraq? Is the minister aware of any criticisms of this approach, and what is his response?",92

149,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Griffith is warned!,92
150,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and the interest he has in Iraq. Obviously the Australian government does have a good relationship with the government of Iraq and the people of Iraq, and I think it is important we do so. The Prime Minister has visited Iraq on a number of occasions; the Minister for Defence, Dr Nelson, and his predecessor, Robert Hill, visited Iraq on a number of occasions; and I have as well. This is a very strong relationship, and I know from talking to the Iraqis that they appreciate very much the work we do to help the Iraqi security forces defeat terrorists and insurgents. As the Leader of the Opposition often likes to point out, this is a very difficult task. We remain committed to the task-to training the security forces and to providing security overwatch from the Tallil air base in the south of Iraq. We also remain committed to Iraq protecting our embassy and our embassy staff who are working in Iraq. They are doing a good job. Our embassy staff help with the administration of our aid program to the embattled people of Iraq. Our embassy staff obviously help to promote our commercial interests and advance our political interests, so it is important we keep them going. Indeed, just yesterday I announced the appointment of Marc Innes-Brown, who is an exceptional officer in my department, as the next ambassador to Iraq. Members will of course be aware of a rocket attack that injured four officers from our security detachment in Baghdad on Monday. One of the corporals-a female corporal; the Minister for Defence will correct me if I am wrong-is still in hospital, but I understand she is in good condition. Our thoughts are with those soldiers, and they are with the diplomats whom they protect. It is tough, but it is vital work. Yes, this approach is criticised by the Leader of the Opposition and those who work with him. The member for Barton, for example, rather surprisingly was reported in today's Financial Review and yesterday on the radio as having said that, following Monday's attack, we should shut down our embassy in Baghdad altogether; we should move it out of Iraq. I would say only this: we will not be doing that. If somebody attacks our embassy, our-I mean the coalition's, the Howard government's-instinctive reaction is not to close our embassy and run away. We did not close our embassy in Jakarta when it was bombed. We stuck it out. And we are going to do the same thing in Baghdad as well. Every time Australian interests are threatened or attacked overseas, the Leader of the Opposition's response is to haul up the white flag. It is always to call for surrender. He says we should surrender in Iraq to the insurgents and the terrorists. He says surrender is the best policy. And we say: to fight determinedly beside the people of Iraq is the best policy. You cannot see John Howard surrendering, as the Leader of the Opposition likes to. And when there is an attack on some Australian personnel, we do not. And you cannot see John Howard putting out a press release saying, ‘Let's close our embassy.' No, we are too strong for that, but for the Leader of the Opposition his constant companion is the white flag.",92
151,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall an interview he gave on ABC radio on 17 March 2003 when he was questioned about the impact of a war in Iraq on the Australian economy? Does the Prime Minister recall warning: Obviously if it were to go on for a very long and there were to be a sustained lift in the oil price then that would start to have an effect. But if the conflict is shortlived then I don't believe the effect is going to be anything like that. Prime Minister, will you now describe the impact of the prolonged war in Iraq on the world oil price and the Australian economy? Mr Downer-Surrender! Surrender!",93
152,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister for Foreign Affairs! Mr Downer-You are a weak man. You are too weak!,93

154,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will naturally, as I always do, check the transcript, but I am quite certain that, in the many interviews I gave at that time, I could well have said something to that effect. But let us analyse the reasons why the price of oil is high now. It is overwhelmingly due to the market fundamentals. It is overwhelmingly due to the strength of theDr Emerson interjecting",93
155,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Rankin!,93
156,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to Iraq in a moment. It is overwhelmingly due to the massive demand that is coming out of China and, to a lesser extent, India, to the underinvestment in refining capacity and to some of the impact of the situation in the Middle East. If you are looking at Iraq and you want to improve the supply of oil by bringing Iraq more oil from Iraq on stream, what you do is defeat the insurgency, not cut and run. Mr Wilkie interjecting",93
157,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Swan is warned!,93
158,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is happening at the moment is that the Iraqi government is time waging a courageous battle against people who almost on a daily basis are trying to sabotage the oil extraction in Iraq, and the Leader of the Opposition wants to surrender to that insurgency. He wants to create a tion where those who would cripple the capacity of Iraq to be a further major contributor to the world's oil supply succeed. So, far from what we are now doing, the Leader of the Opposition's policy of capitulation and surrender would reinforce the position of those who would destroy Iraq's capacity to stand on her own feet and contribute to an increase in world oil supplies and, therefore, a reduction in the price of petrol at the bowser in Australia. ",93
159,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Chief Opposition Whip is warned! Exports,94
160,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade update the House on recent figures highlighting Australia's record export performance? Are there any threats to these record export levels, particularly in Western Australia?",94
161,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Of course, he would be very interested in the latter part of his question, given that he represents the majority of the landmass of Western Australia. The 2005-06 figures show that Australia reached a record export level of $192 billion worth of goods and services out of Australia. That compares to $99 billion worth when Labor was last in office during 1996. Mr Speaker, if you have a look at where some of the key increases have been, you see that, of our top 20 export products and services, 14 actually hit record levels in 200506. An example is coal. There was a 42 per cent increase in the export of coal in 200506. The two things that the member for Kalgoorlie would be interested in are obviously iron ore, exports of which were up 54 per cent, predominantly out of Western Australia, situaand gold, which also comes from the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate, exports of which were up 29 per cent. So a number of Australia's key exports are reaching record levels. In the services sector, the export of education services rose by 13 per cent. The export of tourism and professional and business services also rose, and exports rose in the manufacturing sector in areas such as motor vehicles, up 15 per cent, and medicines, up 18 per cent. All of these contributed to that record level of exports, with $192 billion going out of Australia in the last fiscal year. This means more job opportunities for more Australians. This export effort has fed into the unemployment level dropping to 4.8 per cent. For the information of the member for Kalgoorlie, although the national unemployment level has dropped to 4.8 per cent, in Western Australia it is 3.1 per cent, significantly as a result of the export industries in that state. We recognise that one in five jobs in the Australian economy rely on export industries. In regional Australia, that is one in four jobs, and many of those are in the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate in Western Australia. What are some of the impediments that are confronting our export industries? The Labor Party's position on workplace relations is one of those. You could talk to many of those great exporting industries in Western Australia, as many of the members of the Labor Party have. The Leader of the Opposition has got himself on a billboard over the road leading into Canberra airport with his shock and awe about ripping up AWAs. The member for Perth is saying to the captains of industry: ‘Don't listen to what Kim's saying. We'll be able to work out how we can manage a flexible workplace if we win office.' I do not know that there is that level of commitment behind the Leader of the Opposition to ripping up the AWAs, as is seen on the billboard near Canberra airport. We have achieved these export efforts because we have continued to improve the economic environment in Australia. We have continued to create flexibility so we can compete with the rest of the world. The coalition government have been creating jobs. We know the Labor Party just want to destroy jobs. Higher Education",94
162,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that, according to figures from the Department of Education, Science and Training, there was a drop of almost 10 per cent the number of year 12 completers going on to university or vocational education between 2000 and 2004? With almost 100 degrees costing young Australians over $100,000, is it any wonder that the number of students completing year 12 going on to university has plummeted? Why has the Howard government made it so much more expensive for young people to go to university and turned 300,000 young Australians away from TAFE at a time when the Australian economy needs 20,000 scientists and engineers and 100,000 extra tradespeople?",95
163,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. I will check the figure. But whether it is right ister. or not makes no material difference to the answer I give, because I would have thought that one of the reasons fewer people might be going on to university now is that it is easier to get a job. What a terrible thing! I think it is a good thing if you can get The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talks about turning people away from TAFE. The last time. I checked, TAFEs were run by state Labor governments. The time before that that I checked, they had increased the fees by about 300 per cent. So let me say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: if there has been a situation where fewer people are going on to university, that is not of itself-and I do think that, if we are to seriously address the skills issue in this country, we need to get away from the deputy leader's mindset that the only good education is a university education",95

I also thank her for Sydney.' the Road to recovery report prepared by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which she chaired. The government tabled its formal response to that report in the House last week. One of the principal recommendations of the report was to investigate the effectiveness of naltrexone in treating heroin addicts. The government has committed some $1 million to fund a major trial into this. Another principal recommendation was not to support the establishment of heroin the injecting rooms. I can certainly assure the House that, as long as the Howard government has breath in its body, we will try to oppose any state or territory which is conniving with law-breaking in this way. Let me say that there has been, indeed, some criticism of the government's approach in opposing heroin injecting rooms. The Leader of the Opposition, for instance, said: It is wrong for the Prime Minister to stand in the way of NSW Government's ... injecting rooms for heroin users ...

The reasons were the strength of the global economy and demand in the Australian economy, particularly pointing at credit growth. It did not say anything about skills. I notice that there is a habit in the Labor Party of misrepresenting what people say. Nobody could have given a clearer example of that than the member for Grayndler in the question that he asked the Prime Minister earlier today. At an appropriate time, I will be making an explanation to show how he completely misled the House in the question he asked earlier. Let me just conclude this point on this note. I sat in this House for six years in opposition and I can tell members of the House that never once in those six years did I hear anything about labour shortages, and I will tell you why. The Labor Party had 11 per cent unemployment. As far as problems go, it is much better to have jobs chasing workers than workers chasing jobs. The coalition is the party of employment; Labor stands for recession and unemployment. We now have a situation whereby we have the lowest unemployment in 30 years and that is because only the coalition can manage the Australian economy. Mr Swan-I seek leave to table the document containing the Treasurer's comments. Leave granted. Border Protection",99
212,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question to moneis directed to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister inform the House how the Australian Defence Force is contributing to Australia's border security. Has there been any criticism of this approach and what is the government's response?,99
213,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question and his very strong commitment to border protection, particularly in the north end of Australia. There is no more important task undertaken by the Royal Australian Navy than the protection of Australia's borders. Having had the privilege of being able to spend a night on HMAS Bathurst, I can attest to the professionalism and commitment of the Royal Australian Navy in this task. In the most recent budget, the government announced a further $380 million investment over the next four years in further strengthening Australia's border protection. At the moment, as far as our Royal Australian Navy is concerned, we have one major fleet unit, an FFG, at the Top End. We also currently have five Armidale class patrol boats which we will build up to seven. We have brought back two minehunters, which will also support them in that task, and a PC3 Orion surveillance aircraft. All of that complements the very important assets, dedication and commitment of Australian Customs and other agencies which we have brought together under one single operation called Operation Resolute. We also now have a border security central command which coordinates all the efforts of Australia's enforcement agencies in protecting Australian borders. I recently announced, in addition to that, a billion dollar investment in developing a multimissioned, unmanned aerial vehicle and we are working with the United States Navy to develop that for state-of-the-art surveillance across our maritime borders. I think many Australians are aware of the Channel 7 program Border Security. In May this year, it aired a program which featured HMAS Warrnambool. We saw a Royal Australian Navy patrol boat coming alongside an ice boat, a foreign vessel fishing illegally Australian waters. The first thing that this foreign fishing vessel met was a Navy vessel. The first thing the XO of the ship said over a megaphone, accompanied by another sailor holding a firearm, was, ‘This is an Australian warship.' Following that, rounds were fired from a 50 calibre machine gun and a boarding party went aboard that foreign fishing vessel. There are others who are critical of this policy and approach to border protection. The Australian Labor Party has proposed a coastguard, which is really a coast guide. That means that in five years the Labor Party has had five policies on this and it is very difficult to understand exactly what it is on about. In fact, if you have any doubt about this, when presenting evidence against handling a coastguard to the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in 2001 the Navy said that the creation of a coastguard would have a detrimental effect on Navy training and experience. That is Navyspeak for gutting Australia's Navy. But of perhaps more interest is that the CFMEU journal Common Cause in October that year said of the creation of an Australian coastguard: ‘It would be manned by members of the Maritime Union.' So Australians have a choice. The choice that Australians have is that they have the Royal Australian Navy picking up those who want to breach Australian sovereignty and presenting them with the full force of the Navy in securing and protecting our borders or they have a coastguard of indeterminate cost which would gut the Royal Australian Navy and be manned by civilians who would be fully unionised. I have also directed the Chief of Navy to review the rules of engagement and the amount of force which can be used by the Royal Australian Navy against those who want to come here and steal our fish or illein gally come to Australia. I might also point out that the choice Australians will have next year, when the election comes, is between a government that is strong in the parliament and strong on the borders, and a Beazley led government with a white flag on the parliament and a white flag on our borders.",99

Does the minister recall telling parliament in February year in relation to the $300 million ‘wheat for weapons' scandal, ‘There is no smoking gun here'? Does the minister also recall this official record, just released by the Volcker inquiry, of his conversation with AWB chairman Andrew Lindberg on 4 October 2005, when he told the AWB that ‘The Volcker report,' in the minister's own language, ‘itself would be a smoking gun'? Minister, does your reference to a smoking gun-in your own language, in this, your own department's record of conversation-refer to the AWB's prior knowledge of its corrupt payments to Saddam Hussein's regime, or are you referring to the government's knowledge of the 21 cables you received as warnings about this, the worse corruption scandal in Australia's history?",100

I would have to refresh my memory in relation to the specific record of conversation, but I can assure the House of this: that was not a reference to the Australian government knowing during the relevant period that AWB Ltd was paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime. But the Cole inquiry is continuing its investigation and hopefully its report will be produced relatively soon. What is more, in recent days-or in recent weeks, in any case-a series of documents has been released through the Cole inquiry, so-called confessional documents from AWB Ltd.

But one final point-because I am glad the honourable member asked the question-is that we on this side of the House were always in favour of getting rid of Saddam Hussein's regime. You on that side of the House wanted to keep him there and allow these rorts to continue indefinitely.

Would the minister inform the House what the government is doing to ensure Australian history is well taught in our schools? Have state governments been supportive of the need for Australian students to know the history of our country?",102
226,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. I know that as a former economics and history teacher he is very interested in this issue. teaching of Australian history in our schools has been downgraded. In fact, in a number of schools it is not even an optional extra. nounced recently that I would be hosting a summit to find ways to strengthen the teaching of Australian history in our schools, and that summit will be held in Canberra tomorrow. I have invited leading historians and public figures who are supporting the teaching of Australian history in our schools. I invited education leaders and teachers, including the President of the History Teachers Association of Australia. Eminent historians John Hirst, Inga Clendinnen and Geoffrey Blainey will be in attendance, and Bob Carr, the former Labor Premier from New South Wales, will also be in attendance. We on this side of the House believe it is time for a renaissance in the teaching of Australian history. Students need to know more about our national story. If they can better understand the past, they will be more informed citizens of the future. The summit will focus on what is currently being taught and how and on what should be taught and why. Yes, I have written to all state and territory education ministers seeking their input. I have not had a response from any except the minister in the ACT. Tomorrow, we will pursue the strengthening of Australian history in our schools.

It reads: KIM Beazley has dismissed the push ... to reinstate the teaching of traditional Australian history in schools as an “elite preoccupation”.

233,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Yesterday and on Monday the member for Adelaide asked a question in relation to a 17-year-old service station worker in Adelaide. The member suggested in her question that the employee was docked and suspended for not noting down the details of vehicles that had driven off without payment. I am advised that the Office of Workplace Services is investigating these claims, and I have asked for advice on the outcome of this investigation when it is completed. I will inform the House as appropriate. I should note that, if questions are asked in this place on specific cases, there should be no surprise when the government requests information on the outcomes of these investigations from the Office of Workplace Services. I am also advised that thus far there has been no formal offer of a new AWA to the employee. I take the opportunity to remind the House that an ongoing employee cannot be required to sign an AWA. It is unlawful to terminate an employee because they refuse to sign an AWA. Could I also take the opportunity of reminding the House that, additionally, a worker under the age of 18 must have a parent or guardian sign any Australian workplace agreement that is entered into. If a worker considers they have had their rights breached in some way, they should contact the Office of Workplace Services, which can and will take action on their behalf. NA",103

I have said this is a secular country, in the sense that we observe in our politics a secular tradition, whatever our own individual beliefs may be-and I support that position very strongly-but I have never said that immigrants who do not share Christian values should leave.

That is palpably absurd. I suppose I must speak on it two or three times a day, and I have only stuck it on 50 billboards around the country! The fourth was the suggestion by the Minister for Health and Ageing that I supported illicit drugs. I do not support illicit drugs. I support harm minimisation, in the exactly the same way he does when he gives addicts free needles. Finally, there was misrepresentation of my position with regard to the teaching of history.

249,Mr HOCKEY,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"North Sydney-Minister for Human Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Workplace Relations) (3.22 pm)- Mr Speaker, I wish to add to an answer.",104
250,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The minister may proceed.,104
251,Mr HOCKEY,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Yesterday, the member for Swan asked me a question in parliament concerning Ms Brenda Hendricks, who had raised issues about her dealings with Centrelink. In responding to the member's question I do not want to cause any undue stress to Ms Hendricks herself. However, it is important that I place on the record the advice I have received in relation to this matter. We believe Ms Hendricks contacted Centrelink for the first time on 17 February. She attended a Centrelink interview on 27 February, during which she provided a medical certificate. As a result of the interview and information on the medical certificate Ms Hendricks was granted, on that same day, Newstart Allowance (Incapacitated). Ms Hendricks was not required to look for work. Two more medical certificates were provided to Centrelink in April 2006. The three medical certificates were completed by three different doctors and contained completely contradictory advice about Ms Hendricks's prognosis. In line with normal processes, the lodgement of the third medical certificate prompted a referral for a work capacity assessment. The third medical certificate indicated that to be Ms Hendricks's condition was temporary. The work capacity assessment was returned to Centrelink on 15 May indicating Ms Hendricks was correctly receiving Newstart Allowance (Incapacitated). On 26 May contact from a social worker at the Charles Gardiner Hospital alerted Centrelink staff to the seriousness of Ms Hendricks's medical condition. Centrelink staff went to the hospital collect a completed claim for disability support pension and a treating doctor's report. This treating doctor's report provided new information and stated the significant nature of Ms Hendricks illness. Centrelink assessed the claim immediately and disability support pension was granted on that same day. Therefore, Ms Hendricks has been receiving the disability support pension since 26 May. I am advised that Ms Hendricks contacted my office for the first time by email last Thursday. She received an acknowledgement from my department the next day advising that her email had been referred for investigation. I am also advised that the member for Swan never contacted Centrelink, never contacted his designated local liaison officer and never contacted my office before raising this sensitive matter in the parliament. This matter is very serious. I think everyone here should wish Ms Hendricks a speedy recovery from a serious illness. NA Question Time",104
252,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question to you. Mr Speaker, my question to you relates to the ruling you made during question time relying on the ruling of Senator Wood as Acting Deputy President of the Senate in 1955 and contained on page 501 of House of Representatives Practice. The distinction in that ruling is that you would not require things to be withdrawn where they were political matters, but you would require things to be withdrawn where they were offensive in some personal way. The allegation that someone is ‘soft on drugs' is an allegation that someone is soft on criminal conduct and an allegation that someone is soft on an issue that kills and harms thousands of Australians each year. Mr Speaker, if you do not believe that that to allegation is offensive in a personal way, does that mean, for example, that if I were to sayMrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You ruled on that question earlier in question time. You made a very firm ruling. The member opposite is now attempting to debate your rulingwhich, quite frankly, is against the standing orders.",105

278,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,106
279,Mr ALBANESE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Firstly, I claim to have been misrepresented by the Minister for Health and Ageing, who selectively quoted from a speech and suggested, very explicitly, that I was soft on drugs. He quoted one section of my speech. If you read the sentence around it I think he perhaps even excluded words within the sentence. What I said was this: Reverend Bill Crews runs the Exodus Foundation in Ashfield in my electorate of Grayndler. Every day he deals with the desperation and destitution wreaked by heroin dependence. Heroin is a bad problem. But it is not the heroin per se that causes all these problems, it is often the criminalisation of the supply and use of heroin. Because heroin is illegal, addicts are criminalised. Most addicts do not start as criminals, but their habit makes them criminals. And then, in order to support their habit, a vast proportion of addicts engage in far more serious crimes. I think that is fairly self-evident.",106
280,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The member has made his point.,107
281,Mr ALBANESE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Secondly, Mr Speaker, the Treasurer has suggested that somehow in my question today I misled the parliament. My question raised two issues. One was a quote from him. The paragraph two up from him supporting emissions trading in that speech stated: Price signals in an efficient open market will promote new and more efficient investment, give incentives for further exploration and promote more efficient extraction and use of key resources. As prices rise the incentive to improve the efficiency with which we use scarce resources becomes stronger. And alternative fuels become more commercial. I could not have described emissions trading better myself.",107

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",108
301,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If there is one thing you can rely on with this Prime Minister it is that he is always slipping and sliding away from things he might have said in the past. One thing, though, that you can particularly rely on is that he will continue to drive up the cost of a university education in this country. In fact, you could bet your house on it. Under this Prime Minister and his education policies, it is now the case that you can pay as much for a university degree as you pay for your home. We now have university degrees that basically cost as much as the average mortgage. Let us look at the Good Universities Guide that came out today and the piece of information that tells us that we now have almost 100 university degrees that cost more than $100,000-in fact, five of them cost more than $200,000. If you want to do a medicine-arts degree at the University of New South Wales, it costs $237,000; at the University of Melbourne, $219,000; and at Bond University, $233,000. If you want to do medicine-law at Monash, I am sure the member for Chisholm would be interested to know that you could rack up a debt of $214,000. Let us compare that with the average mortgage that people have. We know many people are paying more than this. We know that many people have very large mortgages under this government, but the average mortgage is about $220,000. That is after a with number of interest rate rises, of course, as a result of this Prime Minister's economic management. The average mortgage is $220,000, and now we have five university degrees that cost more than $200,000, even though the Prime Minister said way back in 1999 that under his government there would be no university degrees costing $100,000 and that he did not want to have an American style university system. We now have an American style university system courtesy of the Howard government, and we have nearly 100 university degrees costing more than $100,000. We know that that American style university system is driving Australians away from university. Let us look at some of the others. I have mentioned the $200,000 degrees, but let us look at the $100,000 university degrees. It costs more than $100,000 to do optometry at the University of Melbourne and more than $100,000 to do a combined science and applied science degree at the University of Sydney-the list goes on, particularly in the very, very important areas of professional skill shortage. We know that there are serious shortages of health professionals in optometry and so on, and we know that there are very serious skill shortages in the sciences, yet it costs $100,000 for a combined degree in science and applied science at the University of Sydney. And that is after this new Minister for Education, Science and Training came out just a few weeks ago and told us that we need another 20,000 scientists and engineers in this country. The government know that we have a very serious shortage when it comes to scientists and engineers, but what are they doing to encourage people into the sciences and into engineering? All they have been responsible for is a massive hike in the cost of a university education, whether it is full-fee degrees of $100,000 or full-fee degrees of $200,000. And, of course, we have also seen the doubling of HECS under this government. Today in question time we drew attention to the decline in the number of students who complete year 12 and go on to either a university education or to technical education. Of course the Prime Minister did not want to answer the question and so he meandered off answering some other question. Because of the massive hike in fees for university education, we have seen a decline of almost 10 percentage points in the last four years. Is it any wonder we have a serious skills crisis in this country when this government is making it more and more difficult for young people to go to university, to go to TAFE, or to get an apprenticeship? It is no wonder we cannot find plumbers and electricians; no wonder we cannot find scientists and engineers. Fees are driving our young people away from our universities and TAFEs and away from apprenticeships. The Leader of the Opposition drew the Prime Minister's attention to the promise he made back in 1999. He did not mention HECS in this commitment. I quote Hansard, the Prime Minister speaking: The government will not be introducing an American style higher education system. ... will be no $100,000 university fees under this government. That statement is quite clear. He did not mention HECS. He did not qualify it in any way. He did not say, ‘We won't have any $100,000 HECS degrees but there might be some $100,000 full fee degrees.' It was a categorical statement from the Prime Minister. We are used to the weasel words that we heard in question time today-yet another broken promise from this Prime Minister. This promise is well and truly smashed. We now have not only a broken promise but 100 university degrees costing more than $100,000. We know why it is that the Prime Minister does not want to get into this debate. Those of us who were here in 1999 will remember why it was that he was forced into making that commitment. You might recall it was in response to a very secret leaked cabinet submission put forward by a previous minister for education, David Kemp, who wanted full deregulation of university fees. He wanted to get rid of HECS and basically say that universities should have full free market power to determine whatever university students should pay. We can imagine that the Liberal Party might see that that is the way university entry should be organised-in a free market way. David Kemp proposed to the cabinet full deregulation of fees and a voucher which could be used in public and private institutions. Also, he wanted a new loan scheme that had a real rate of interest. Not surprisingly, when that cabinet submission was leaked, the Prime Minister did one of his backflips-we know he is very good at those-and decided that he had to back away from that very extreme agenda. Instead of that proposal, we had a change of minister. Brendan Nelson was brought onto the scene and he said, ‘No, we won't have There 100 per cent full fee payers; we'll have 50 per cent.' Brendan Nelson, the previous education minister, said that we should have 50 per cent of our university students paying full fees, that that is what should be allowed at our universities. He could not get that proposal through the Senate. He did a deal with some of the Independents in the Senate that we would have 35 per cent full fee payers. This government has form when it comes to this issue. We know that their fundamental position is to go to a free market where universities can charge whatever they like and whatever the market will bear, and where there will be abolition of HECS. We know that is the true position of this Prime Minister. He has had to bow to public pressure for the time being, but we can expect to see more and more students being forced to pay higher and higher fees. We do not know what the new Minister for Education, Science and Training thinks about this issue. She has not said whether or not she thinks that the current level of full fee payers should stay as it is or whether she agrees with David Kemp-maybe that is her position. Hopefully she will give us an answer in response to this MPI. We have heard from her today that we really should not be worried about any of this because it affects only three per cent of students. I say to the minister that you cannot have it both ways. You cannot say on the one hand that universities are going to go broke if Labor abolishes full fee university degrees and on the other hand that we should not worry about it because it is only three per cent. Which one is it? Is it that it is only three per cent therefore Labor can certainly afford-and I would say the government can afford-to do away with these outrageous levels of fees that are being imposed on our students? Let us see which way the minister wants it. Is it just a small number or is it going to send the universities broke? The minister cannot have it both ways. We heard the other argument from the Prime Minister which he has mounted over the years-that if foreign students are allowed to pay $200,000, why should not Australian students? I mean really! I have never heard a more ridiculous argument. Mr Bevis interjecting",109
302,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"University students from Australia should have the right to pay $200,000 for a university education! Only the Liberal Party could think of this ridiculous argument. The other point that the member for Brisbane rightly makes is that Australian parents pay tax in this country.",111
303,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Melbourne Ports is way out of his seat.,111
304,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"One of the reasons they pay taxes is that they recognise there is a public benefit to be gained from encouraging our young people to go to university. When we hold up this graph and say that it is a terrible thing that there are a declining number of year 12 students going on to university or TAFE, the Prime Minister waves his hands in the air and says: ‘It's nothing to do with me. What are you worried about?' Of course the government is not worried about it. It does not think it is important for our students to get a further education, either as an apprentice or a university student. It does not think it is important. That is why the government does not mind these prices going through the ceiling. But most Australian parents do care, and and they understand that their taxes go to subsidising the cost of university education for Australian students. Of course Australian students should not have to pay as much as foreign students. Of course Australian students should get subsidised places at our universities, because Australian parents know how important it is to have doctors, nurses, engineers, scientists and all of the rest of the people who benefit from a university education. We hear the most spurious arguments over and over from the federal government. Why is it that our universities are being forced into increasing the number of degrees that cost so much? There is only one reason. On the radio this morning, the ViceChancellor of the Australian National University belled the cat-he told the truth, which is that the only reason that universities are going down this path is that the Howard government has so massively slashed the funding of our universities. Over the last 10 years, more than $5 billion has been slashed from the budgets of our universities. No wonder the quality is now being called into question. This is the only developed nation in the world to have cut public investment in higher education-the only one-and the government is proud of it. Mr Danby interjecting",111
305,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Melbourne Ports is warned!,112
306,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They are the ones that have cut public investment in higher education while the rest of the developed world has seen a very significant increase-a 38 per cent increase on average-because all of our competitors know just how important it is to have a skilled workforce, to make sure that their young people can get a university education or a trade. That way their countries will go forward. Ours will only go backwards. (Time expired)",112
307,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Curtin-Minister for Education, Science and Training and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues) (3.54 pm)-You can always rely on Labor to scaremonger. The Labor Party would have you believe that the higher education sector is on the verge of collapse and that no student can afford to go to university. Labor would have you believe that students have to choose between a house and a university degree. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Australian education system is one of the fairest, most equitable and accessible in the world. The latest figures show us that there are almost one million students in higher education. Over 700,000 of them are Australian students and over half of them are Australian undergraduate students. One million students in universities is a 50 per cent increase since we came to office in 1996. Mr Baldwin-How much?",112
308,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"A 50 per cent increase, Member for Paterson. Students are reporting the highest levels of satisfaction ever. The median starting salary for graduates is $40,000. That is nearly 82 per cent of average weekly earnings. Among those graduates available for full-time work, nearly 94 per cent were in some form of employment within four months of leaving university. About 81 per cent of graduates are in full-time employment and 12 per cent are in casual part-time employment while looking for full-time work. Graduate satisfaction is at a record high of about 90 per cent. Since the Higher Education Contribution Scheme was introduced by the Labor Party in 1989-they introduced HECS-over two million individuals have been able to access higher education through Australian government funded loans. About $17 billion has been loaned to students since 1989. Almost $7 billion has been repaid. About 830,000 people have totally repaid their HECS debt. Of those who have not, around 20 per cent of them never will-they will effectively have a free degree because they will not reach the income threshold at which repayment kicks in, at just over $38,000. Today the average outstanding HECS debt is $10,500, yet the member for Jagajaga is out there trying to tell students that they have to pay $240,000 to do a university degree. She is suggesting they have to choose between a house and a university degree. That is ridiculous. It is scaremongering and exaggeration. She ought to be ashamed. Mr Bartlett-Shame!",112
309,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Macquarie is out of his seat.,112
310,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The average outstanding HECS debt is $10,500. Ninetyseven per cent of students are in Commonwealth subsidised places. The average repayment time for debts that have been fully repaid is just over seven years and, as any accountant will tell you, a HECS loan is just about the best loan you will ever get in your life. Of those who have a debt, around 88 per cent owe less than $20,000 and 72 per cent owe less than $14,000. These students know the value of their vestment in education. Average lifetime earnings for male graduates are around $622,000-less for women, $400,000- more than for those who do not have a university degree, and the lifetime unemployment rate is one-quarter of that of a nongraduate. So, over a lifetime, a full-time worker with a degree will earn about $2.62 million and a full-time year 12 graduate can expect to earn about $2 million. Graduate doctors and lawyers earn a great deal more. Let us turn to the government supported places-what we call HECS places. There are record numbers of HECS places available for Australian students. As the Prime Minister pointed out, 97 per cent of all tralian undergraduate students are in Commonwealth supported places. This means that, on average, this government pays three-quarters of the cost of their study. In 2003 the Australian government committed to creating more than 39,000 places between 2003 and 2009. More than 18,000 of these places have been added to the system since that commitment was made. I announced almost 5,000 new commencing places only a few weeks ago, with a particular focus on the skills shortage industries such as nursing, teaching and engineering. As a result of this massive injection of new places-and the member for Jagajaga knows this-unmet demand has dropped by more than 61 per cent since 2004. ‘Unmet demand' is the number of students who would have been eligible to go to university but did not get a place. More than 90 per cent of eligible year 12 completers who applied to university in their own state received an offer from a university. That is the best result in decades. When the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, what did he do about unmet demand? The in- number of eligible applicants who could not get a university offer reached something like 100,000 when the Leader of the Opposition about was the education minister. So what did he suggest? The Sunday Telegraph of September 1993 reported: School leavers must be prepared to miss out on universitythis is Kim Beazleythe federal government warned. This year in New South Wales, unmet demand fell from 5,000 to 3,000; in Victoria, from 6,000 to 4,000-and it goes on. Tasmania had unmet demand of 200, which would have been annihilated by my announcement a few weeks ago of 290 new places for TasAus- mania. You have to contrast this with 100,000 eligible applicants who could not get into university in 1992 when the current Leader of the Opposition was the minister for education. What was his answer? He said: ‘You've got to miss out on going to university,' or ‘We've got too many universities in this country. We're going to have to cap university expansion. We don't need any more.' He did not allocate more places, as this government has done; he said, ‘You've got to close down universities.' Today, under this government-and thanks to our generous investment in higher education and training-unmet demand for university places is virtually negligible. Entry scores are at their lowest in decades. Universities are looking to give back thousands of unfilled places this year, and I am going to reallocate them to other providers who are still experiencing student demand. The reality of the situation is that any qualified student who wants a Commonwealth subsidised, taxpayer supported place can find one-and the member for Jagajaga knows that. In 2003 the coalition brought to this parliament a plan to revolutionise funding for universities. Rather than get block funding, universities would receive payments for the subsidised courses they actually delivered university students. This was accompanied by an $11 billion injection in new funding for the sector. That is new funding of $11 billion over the next decade. As part of that package, students were offered loans for full fee degrees. The Labor Party introduced full fee degrees in postgraduate courses. This government introduced loans for full fee degrees in undergraduate courses in both private and public institutions, and this is known as FEEgree HELP. We have recently lifted the amount a student can borrow from $50,000 to $80,000 in all degrees, but in medicine, veterinary science and dentistry a $100,000 cap applies. As a result, almost no student is prevented from entering a degree on the basis of upfront fees. So, like HECS students, students who access FEE-HELP only need to start repaying their loan when their income reaches the threshold, which is $38,149 this year. Also as part of that package, the coaliof tion government directed over $400 million to create more than 43,000 scholarships for Australian undergraduates to help them recover their living costs while studying. Turning to the facts about full fee paying students, at the latest count in 2004 there were no more than 16,299 Australian undergraduate full fee payers in the higher education system. We are talking about a student body of one million students and 6,000-or about 37 per cent-of them were in intensive summer and winter courses. The fact is that the average annual fee for a full-time, feepaying undergraduate student is $12,112. The member for Jagajaga is out their scaremongering, saying that you have to sell your house to go to university, when the average annual fee for a full-time, fee-paying undergraduate student is $12,112, based on latest figures. Students undertaking a threeto four-year for degree with these fees would usually complete their course for less than $50,000. And yes, the Good Universities Guide lists some degrees costing more than $100,000. It is a good thing that students have these facts to inform their decisions, because HECS places are available for them. But has the member for Jagajaga actually bothered to find out how many students are enrolled in these courses? I am advised by the University of New South Wales that the medicine-arts dethat is listed at $237,000 has one enrolment. The $219,000 medicine-arts degree at Melbourne has no enrolments. And-guess what?-Melbourne proposes no intake of students into this course next year. Monash has a mere three or four takers for its medicine-law combined course. Also, Monash has a combined biomedical science and engineering course listed at $101,000 that has one student. Labor's position on full fee payers is full hypocrisy. Astonishingly, in their so-called white paper-it is increasingly a brown paper-on higher education, their first commitment was to maintain the coalition's policy of voluntary student unionism. Their second commitment was to abolish full fee paying places in only public universities. So Labor are committed to throwing 16,000 students out of their courses. By contrast, Labor have no problems with foreign students from China, Malaysia, Singapore and India coming to Australia. Under Labor, they can come here in their thousands, take up university places and pay full fees, but that opportunity is denied to Australian students. If a prospective student is determined to undertake a particular course and just misses out on it, Labor would force that student out into another course or into another institution or into another state. Under Labor, there is no opportunity for an Australian student who has just missed out to follow their ambitions into a particular discipline at a particular university. Labor denigrates these students as being unworthy of university study, yet full fee payers have shown themselves as competent at study as their colleagues. In fact, each year around 700 full fee paying students-about eight per cent of the total fee-paying cohort-transfer into HECS places. These students are more than competent enough to undertake a degree and succeed. They do not deserve the denigration that the Labor Party heaps upon them. It is competitive to get into full-fee courses, and a quick review of the Good Universities Guide shows that full fee places are offered in the highest demand courseswith law, medicine and veterinary science chief among them. Let us take an example: say a student from the member for Jagajaga's electorate gets 95 for their tertiary entrance ranking score. That student desperately wants to do law. They have a choice: they can go to ANU, one of Australia's top universities, in a Commonwealth supported place, or they can go to the University of Melbourne in a full fee paying place. They got 95 but Melbourne university's HECS cut-off is higher. Just because that student chooses the University of Melbourne, which is closer to home, Labor would have you think this student is unworthy of that course. A review of the Labor policy shows the extent of Labor's hypocrisy. Labor wants full fee payers out of public universities, but Labor has no problem with full fee payers in private universities-nor, it would seem, any problem with HECS places in private universities. So it is okay under Labor for a full payer to sit next to a HECS student in a private university but it is not okay for a full fee payer to sit next to a HECS student in a public university. Where is the logic in that? Do you know what Labor's ideological hatred of full fee payers in public universities will cost universities? They would throw out 16,000 students, and more than $520 million over the next four years would be lost to universities. If you add that to the $1.5 billion that universities would lose under Labor's mooted reductions to HECS, the $400 million more it would cost in scholarships, the more than $600 million it would cost to pay for student clubs and activities, and the $850 million it would cost to change the parental income test which applies to youth allowance-all options in Labor's paper-it can be seen that you would have a very, very expensive education policy under Labor. I ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-and it is a question that I know her backbench colleagues are asking her: where is the money coming from? And there is division in the Labor ranks. An article in the Age on 7 April 2006 reported: Opposition Leader Kim Beazley will face pressure from his own party to abandon Labor's long-standing opposition to full-fee-paying places for Australian undergraduate students. … … … But the Age has learned of a behind-the-scenes push within the party to review the policy, which universities claim would cost them millions of dollars.

311,Mrs IRWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"At the end of each sitting week, when members leave the ivory tower that is this parliament building and return to their electorates, some of us see a huge difference between the fairytale world that members of the government speak about and the real world. If you listen to the answers given by government minisfee ters at question time, you have to wonder if they live in the same country. The rosy picture painted by the government seems like a Hollywood film set that hides the reality of life in areas like Western Sydney and many other areas throughout Australia. That reality does not show itself in the endless list of statistics that the government trots out. It is not obvious in the outward appearances of areas like Western Sydney. The result is not the glaring inequality that can be seen in developing nations. The signs do not show up on the radar of those who measure prosperity in terms of GDP. What must be noted from those figures is the falling share of national income going to wages and salaries. It is clear that the results of our nation's prosperity have not trickled down to all Australians. The rising tide has not lifted all boats, and a good many Australians, especially in electorates like Fowler, are being forced to tread water. Things might look calm on the surface, but underneath there is frantic activity to keep afloat. And to keep their heads above water, families have a limited number of responses. We know that Australians are working longer hours now than at any time in the last 50 years, and we know that more and more mothers are re-entering the workforce earlier than they did a generation ago. We certainly know that Australian families are borrowing much more than they did a generation ago. We know that Australian families spend more on home mortgage repayments now than they did a generation ago. We know that high interest credit card debt has gone through the roof. On top of that, we have record high petrol prices, at a time when families are more dependent on car travel than ever before. As well, we are beginning to see the full impact of increased prices at the supermarket and higher costs for electricity, water and other services. It is a slow process, but the signs are there for all to see. In a local supermarket last week, I overheard a remark that will ring true with many people who do the household shopping. One age pensioner remarked to another that ‘the specials don't seem to be as good as they were'. It is a small sign but an important one of inflation feeding through to everyday goods. So to keep their heads above water, families in Fowler and many other electorates throughout this nation are treading water as hard as they can. They are working longer hours, they have extended their mortgage and they have maxed out their credit cards. The effect of this is not obvious to any observer. That is because the stress felt by families does not register on the national the accounts. But it is being felt by a growing number of families, and it will take a toll as heavy as any social upheaval that we have felt as a nation. For young families, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. We now have 50-year mortgages. Take out a mortgage today and it will be paid off out of your estate when you die. But that mortgage is only for the home. With 96 full fee undergraduate courses costing over $100,000 and five courses costing over $200,000, the debt burden on young Australians seems certain to rise and place even greater pressure on families. We already see the higher levels of HECS debt, thanks to changes by this government, eating into the incomes of thousands of Australian families. For a teacher or a nurse to see $100 a fortnight taken out of their pay in HECS repayments is a huge slug. But just imagine paying over $2,000 a month in repayment of loans to cover full fee payment courses. For parents in ordinary families wishing to help their children, the cost of those degrees puts them way beyond anything they could afford. How could any average family afford to pay $100,000 for even one child, let alone two or three, as the Treasurer suggests we should have? While this government boasts about repaying government debt, we can see who is shouldering that debt burden. It is the young families who are forced to take out outrageously high mortgages to pay for inflated house prices and, on top of that, to higher HECS fees if they have been lucky enough to gain entry to a HECS course. But just imagine the debt burden for those students undertaking a full-fee course with fees over $200,000. Those fee levels will exclude young people from electorates like Fowler and other electorates from undertaking those courses. And what will be the result of limiting access to courses to those rich enough to afford such high fees? Just as we have seen with the government's cuts to technical training, we will face skills shortages in many vital professions. If we look at a list of the full fee paying degrees costing over $100,000, we see courses such as medicine, science and social work-all areas where we definitely have a skill shortage in this country. But, instead of funding those places, this government is placing the burden on individual students-and then the government complains that Australian graduates take their skills overseas, as we have heard in a number of speeches over the last couple of weeks and in this House today. The government's approach to higher education is as short-sighted as its approach to trade training, and we will pay a heavy price in the coming years as we seek to make up for the shortfall in a competitive world market for highly skilled professionals. Australia is already at the bottom of the list of OECD countries in terms of government spending on higher education. This government's growing reliance on individual students to fund the full cost of their education is a policy failure of dire proportions. While we might enjoy the economic sunshine that comes from digging up our minerals and shipping them off at record prices, these times will not last forever. For Australians to retain our standard of living, we will need to rely more on the use of our skills, but this government has set back our advances as pay a highly skilled nation, and we risk falling well behind other developed nations. By then it will be too late to make a quick recovery. Our best brains will have left for overseas, and we will lack the critical mass to lift our knowledge and skills base to anywhere near that of our international competitors. I began by speaking about the electorate of Fowler and the impact of stress on families. What we see there today is a taste of the future for all Australia. When mineral and commodity prices return to normal and we have to look to other ways of generating our national income, we will come to regret the folly of cutting spending on higher education. The Treasurer's chickens will have come home to roost. What keeps those struggling families going is the hope that there will be some light at the end of the tunnel, that some day they will be able to get on top of the mortgage and be a little bit more relaxed and comfortable. But, for young families of the future, paying off the house will be the least of their worries. The ever-increasing burden of higher education loans for themselves and their children will keep them in debt well into retirement, and few families in Western Sydney can afford that. We are fast going down the path of an American-style system of higher education. Once again, higher education will be the privilege of the rich, not an opportunity for all Australians. For the past 30 years, affordable higher education has been the ticket out of Struggle Street for thousands of young Australians, including those who came here as children of refugees, found Australia a land of equal opportunity and have gone on to contribute greatly to Australia's growth. In 1999, John Howard promised there would not be $100,000 degrees under his government. Today we have degrees costing more than $200,000. Another broken promise by this Prime Minister and this government. (Time expired)",115
312,Dr JENSEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"A very interesting speech there-highly impassioned, but unfortunately, typically, a little short on facts and logic. The simple fact is that Labor in general unfortunately have little understanding of what data actually means, the implications that arise and certainly the associated subtleties. Simply, the opposition decide to have a quick scramble through the newspaper in the morning: ‘What can we have for the MPI of the day?' Ms George-You're joking!",118
313,Dr JENSEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You are right; I am joking. Have a look at your opposition leader. He does not look through the newspaper too well, does he? He is not even aware of who the Reserve Bank governor is. The opposition go through the newspaper, sometimes not even realising that a person of one name is actually someone other than who they think, and, ‘Oh, eureka! We've got an issue for the day.' Then they say, ‘We can turn this into an attack on the government. Let's come up with an MPI.' We have seen on numerous occasions that Labor simply do not understand the issues. With great excitement, they rush joyously, only to discover that they have all this energy but there is nothing really to show for it. It is a little bit like a can of fizzy drink that is accidentally shaken: a bit of excitement, a slight fizz, then just a mess and a clean-up. Then it is all forgotten. No indelible mark remains. On this issue, sadly, they think they are onto a winner and that they are going to embarrass the government for having the audacity, of all things, to offer young Australians choice, a choice allowing even more students to undertake courses than are offered under HECS. They have clearly missed the fact that the Howard government has massively increased the number of university places offered under HECS and, in addition, for full fee paying students, and that our government has delivered far more choice to students. The Labor Party really is opposed to choice. Let's just have a look at some of the issues. The Labor Party hated the issue of choice in voluntary student unionism. The Labor Party has as its central theme a ‘c' word which is certainly not associated with the government. The Howard government also has a ‘c' word at the centre of its policy-that word is ‘choice'. The word most often associated with Labor is ‘compulsion': compulsion in student unionism, compulsion in unionism generally, compulsion in having to accept wages and conditions under centralised wage-fixing arrangements, and so on. For Labor, anything not expressly allowed is forbidden. Now, they want to compel Australian students-our future doctors, scientists, lawyers and eventually, in some cases, politicians-to have access only to Commonwealth funded university places. If Australian students want to undertake a certain course at a certain university, even if it means a financial cost, the opposition's view is that students clearly should not be accorded that option. I repeat: Australian students should not be accorded the option. However, if a student is from foreign shores, it is no holds barred: yep, we'll have them then. In the view of the opposition we should discriminate against Australian citizens in favour of foreign students. Perhaps an Australian wanting to do a full-fee course should move overseas. (Quorum formed) Obviously the truth hurts, and as the truth obviously hurts let me reiterate that point: in the view of the opposition they would prefer that we discriminate against Australian citizens in favour of foreign students. Let's have a look at the logic of their position: an Australian citizen wants to undertake a university degree as a full fee paying student. Under Labor the way they should go about it is go overseas and get foreign citizenship, and, then, hey, we will take the student, but we will not take them while they are an Australian citizen. I am sorry but that does not make any sense at all; that is the undeniable result of Labor's so-called logic. Labor's hypocrisy here knows no bounds. Let's have a look at a bit of history as far as before. full fee paying students are concerned. In 1986 under the Hawke government full fee paying foreign students were allowed in. In 1989 Labor allowed in full fee paying postgraduate students. This is clearly a ridiculous position to take. Once again this is an issue of saying, ‘Yep, if they're a foreign student, it's acceptable.' If they are an overseas full fee paying student we will take them but we will not take an Australian citizen. Let us just think for a second about some of the people who might be disadvantaged by the Labor view. When a certain person by the name of Isaac Newton was 18 years old, he had no ability to do mathematics. They had a plague in England at that time. He retired to the country and taught himself mathematics, and at the age of 22 he invented calculus. Under Labor's policy, because he would have had inadequate marks to get into a HECS course, Newton would not have been accepted for a full fee paying course; therefore, sorry, folks, Isaac Newton and the whole point of gravity, laws of motion and calculus-gone! Albert Einstein was a low achiever at school. In fact he was referred to by his supervisor as a ‘lazy dog'. Let's have a look at where Einstein went: photoelectric effects, special relativity and general relativity, at the age of 26. Einstein is another person who would not have been accepted in Australia as a full fee paying student. This is clearly a ludicrous position to take. The Howard government has introduced a lot of different opportunities for students. In fact our whole attitude is about choice and opportunity. Unfortunately, Labor's is about compulsion and exclusion-the exclusion, unfortunately, of Australian citizens. Let's just get that one correct again. Let's have a look at some of the opportunities afforded to Australian students under the government's policy. The government has provided more affordable opportunities to students than ever",118

316,Mrs MOYLAN,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 12th report for 2006 of the committee relating to the proposed tactical unmanned aerial vehicle facilities project, Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, Queensland. Ordered that the report be made a parlia25th/49th mentary paper.",120
317,Mrs MOYLAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report examines the proposed works which will support the introduction of the new tactical unmanned aerial vehicle and the establishment of the 20th Surveillance and Tactical Acquisition Regiment at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, Queensland. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $17.45 million. Defence is acquiring the tactical unmanned rial vehicle system to enhance the reconnaisspecialist sance and surveillance capabilities of deployed land forces. The capability is planned for introduction into service in 2008. Twelve TUAVs, comprising two troops of four air vehicles each and four spare air vehicles, will be accommodated in the facilities. The 20th Surveillance and Tactical Acquisition Regiment will be established to operate the TUAVs at Gallipoli Barracks. This regiment will include the existing 131st STA Battery, a new 132nd Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Battery and a combat service support battery. The TUAVs will not be flown from Gallipoli Barracks but will use existing defence training areas, such as the Shoalwater Bay training area. A flight simulator will be amongst the facilities provided at Enoggera and will be where most of the flight training of operators will be undertaken. The proposed scope for the project will involve: the construction of three new purpose-built buildings and the refurbishment of one existing building to support the introduction and operation of the new TUAVs; the Report refurbishment of 11 existing buildings and the construction of one new building to support the establishment of the 20th STA Regiment, including the existing 131st STA Battery; and the refurbishment and extension of 10 existing facilities to support the 25th/49th Battalion Royal Queensland Regiment. The 20th STA Regiment and the Battalion Royal Queensland Regiment will effectively swap facilities as part of this project. This was shown to be a far more cost-effective solution than the construction of new facilities on a greenfield site. One building is proposed for demolition at the site-a steel portal frame structure containing no hazardous materials. However, Defence has discovered some asbestos is in ae- the existing 131st STA Battery area, and a company has been engaged by Defence to report on how to best contain and remove it and to certify that the area is asbestos free. Defence submitted that the newly constructed facilities would include a range of practical environmentally sustainable design initiatives to minimise and measure water and energy consumption. However, as much of the project involves the refurbishment of existing buildings, Defence anticipated that implementing these initiatives in refurbished buildings involved a capital expense that would not be recouped in reduced operating costs for the life of the building. Defence will provide space in the facility for use by the prime TUAV equipment contractor, Boeing Australia. Under its contract, Boeing will provide the installations and be responsible for the fit-out of these areas. Office accommodation provided by the project will be designed for maximum flexibility, allowing for future internal churn or change in operational requirements at minimal cost. The committee, having given detailed consideration to the proposal, recommends that the tactical unmanned aerial vehicle facilities project proceed at the estimated cost of $17.45 million. In closing, as always, I wish to thank those who assisted with the committee's inspection and public hearing, particularly Hansard, my colleagues and, of course, the secretariat. I commend the report to the House. Corporations and Financial Services Committee",120
318,Ms BURKE,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's report entitled Statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Ordered that the report be made a Parliamentary Paper.",121
319,Ms BURKE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As always, the ASIC oversight hearing covered a range of topics and produced much valuable information for the parliament-and for the public at large, if anyone in the gallery cares to cover the hearings. I want to thank Mr Jeffrey Lucy and Mr Jeremy Cooper for their patience during a long and broad-ranging hearing. I also want to thank the secretariat for their excellent work at the hearing and I particularly thank Andrew Bomm for his work in digesting the hearing and producing a succinct and readable report from all our ramblings. I wish in my short time to touch on a few issues from the report. First, I want to again congratulate ASIC on its shadow shopper exercise into superannuation advice. Sadly, again, this exercise, which is a valuable tool, even indeed for the financially literate public, produced some disturbing results. I read from the report: 2.28 In the committee's view, the survey results are of major concern. ASIC found that superannuation advice did not, overall, meet its expectations. The survey revealed that: - given the client's individual needs, 16 per cent of advice was unreasonable; - one third of advice suggesting a switching funds lacked credible reasons; - unreasonable advice was between three and six times more likely where a conflict of interest (eg high commissions) was present; and - advisers failed to give a requisite Statement Report of Advice (SOA) on 46 per cent of cases (though one fifth of these were verbal advice to stay in an existing fund). Most consumers do not have sufficient time, understanding or experience to digest and compare superannuation products. Advice given by advisers should ensure that consumers are making informed choices about switching funds and not be directed to a fund because the adviser will get the best commission from this deal. Lack of real, comparable advice about the fund the consumer is leaving for the one they are being encouraged to take up means that many individuals are losing vast amounts of their retirement income in fees and charges. The report quotes ASIC: That is for the industry. In our shadow shopping work, we show that there is a fairly worrying correlation between commission models, conflicts and so on and advice that does not have a reasonable basis. We will leave it at that. The government introduced super choice. It should ensure that informed choice is available to assist individuals to make this very important life choice. Today the Australian government has sent us Understanding money-how to make it work for you. It says: ‘Get advice from an adviser.' What it does not tell you is that some of the advice from advisers is not worth the paper it is written on and that you do need to shop around. We need to provide greater financial literacy to people to be able to make these important choices-choices that can have a vast impact on their quality of life in retirement. The financial services regulation was again covered. Again it goes back to this notion of advice given to people. Advice does not need to be good. It is a bit like answers in question time-they only need to be relevant; they do not actually have to be a good or honest answer. Advice under the FSR also does not need to be good. This leaves consumers very exposed. Again I read from the report, quoting ASIC: In a sense the industry is lucky that the legislation does not say that you actually have to give good advice because I am not sure that we, as a regulator, are actually qualified to judge whether advice is good or not. I think that is a policy platform that obviously was not taken up by the government. If ASIC cannot judge whether the advice is good or not, how does the consumer out there, who knows so little about superannuation, make good, informed choices about switching funds? Much more needs to be done in this area. I again commend ASIC for leading the charge. One of the other areas I would like to very quickly cover is in relation to the Vizard case. Yet again there was some disturbing information presented at the hearing in relation to the Vizard case and some information that came to light after the case. Extracts from Crikey have been incorporated into the report because there was a very interesting exchange between Crikey and Mr Lay's lawyer, Mr Lederman. Mr Lay is the accountant who was critical of ASIC's decision not to proceed with criminal charges against Vizard. I quote from Crikey: Lederman writes: We are able to state categorically, both on our instruction and our personal knowledge, that at no stage did Mr Lay refuse to testify against Mr Vizard. The simple truth is that-notwithstanding the relevant publicity associated with public statements by personnel of the Australian Securities & Investments Commission and by Mr Damian Bugg-at no point of time was Mr Lay asked to give sworn evidence against Mr Vizard, nor was he ever served with a subpoena to do so. ASIC was a little taken aback by this advice printed up on Crikey, and in a letter to the committee responded: Following the publication of the Crikey.com material, ASIC contacted Mr Lay's lawyer expressing concern about the statements and querying whether ASIC had misunderstood the position or whether Mr Lay had reconsidered his position. ASIC again invited Mr Lay to meet to discuss this matter further. Mr Lay, through his lawyer, continued to decline to meet or engage in any further discussions on the matter. This leaves open the whole question of criminal proceedings against Mr Vizard. It exposes again the weakness in the system about actions being brought against whitecollar crime. This is a very serious case of insider trading. Yes, Mr Vizard has had his wrists slapped, but it does not appear that justice has really been done or that the full force of the law has been applied. Again the committee explored why ASIC had not used its complete powers to compel witnesses to testify in the ASIC case. As we go more and more into the realm of people trusting advisers, buying shares and investing their super money to ensure that they are providing for their own retirement, the public needs to be assured that there are no grey areas in matters of financial concern-that people are not manipulating the financial market. We are all now shareholders. We all need to have faith in the system. More needs to be done in this regard. I will be, as the report says, keeping a clear eye upon the discussions between ASIC and the DPP to ensure that they can more fully investigate claims brought in respect of the corporate world in a more timely manner. I commend the report to the House. It would be really valuable for most consumers out there to have a look at it and to also look at the ASIC website, which provides very valuable information to consumers.",121

324,Dr SOUTHCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Report 76 contains the findings and binding treaty action recommendations of the committee's review of six treaty actions tabled in parliament on 28 March and 10 May 2006. The committee found all the treaties to be in Australia's national interest. I will comment on all the treaties reviewed. The Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for Cooperation in Scientific Research and Technological Development will help promote cooperation in research between Australia and Indonesia. At present the Australia-Indonesia relationship is our fourth largest in the area of science collaboration. This treaty and the less than treaty status Collaboration in Science and Innovation, Research and Technology Agreement offer the potential to expand and promote the Australia-Indonesia relationship and to enhance knowledge and increase scientific and personal links in a mutually beneficial way. The treaty does this by providing the basis for the activities performed and funded by a range of Australian science agencies and their Indonesian equivalents. The Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Namibia and the Governments of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission provides for the maintenance of 426 war graves of members of the Commonwealth armed forces in Namibia. In addition, the agreement formalises the work already undertaken by the commission in Namibia. While there are no Australians Report among the identified Commonwealth graves, Australia is a founding member of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and recognises the important role the commission undertakes in remembrance of the Commonwealth war dead through its contribution to the commission. The Agreement on Social Security between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Kingdom of Norway provides for enhanced access to certain Australian and Norwegian social security benefits and greater portability of these benefits between countries. The agreement includes the age pension, the disability support pension for people who are severely disabled and the avoidance of double coverage for superannuation. Norway will reciprocate with the age pension, disability pension and pensions for survivors. This treaty is the 16th such agreement that Australia has with other countries. The Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America on Cooperation in Science and Technology for Homeland and Domestic Security Matters establishes a framework to encourage, develop and facilitate bilateral cooperative activities in science and technology. This agreement strengthens Australia's long standing relationship with the United States in the area of science and technology, and enables Australian scientists and counter-terrorism agencies to benefit from collaborative research activities. Under the agreement, such activities would include development of threat and vulnerability analyses, staff exchange, prototype development and any events which have implications for domestic security such as extreme weather conditions and pandemics. The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance-or International IDEA-statutes, as amended at the Extraordinary Council meeting of International IDEA on 24 January 2006, will improve the governance arrangements of the organisation. Established in 1995, International IDEA consists of 24 party states and is tasked with developing and strengthening democracy globally. The committee heard that the 2003 amendments to International IDEA were not tabled in parliament. This did not provide an opportunity for the committee to be aware of the amendments and so review them. The committee heard that the 2003 amendments were made in preparation for International IDEA gaining observer status with the United Nations General Assembly. The 2003 amendments prohibited associate members and observers of International IDEA from voting or participating in the council's decision making. The committee expects any future amendment to the current treaty action to be tabled in parliament as soon as possible. The International Organisation for Migration has for 55 years, since its establishment, been involved in meeting the ever-growing operational challenges of migration management, advancing the international understanding of migration issues, encouraging social and economic development through migration, and upholding the dignity and well-being of migrants everywhere. The amendments to the constitution of the International Organisation for Migration will streamline organisational processes and further strengthen the organisation's responsiveness and service efficiency. I commend the report to the House.",123

328,Mr RICHARDSON,COMPLIANCE AND OTHER," Mr Deputy Speaker, I was saying before the debate on the Customs Legislation Amendment (Border Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2006 was interrupted that this bill simply seeks to make necessary minor amendments to ensure that our Customs personnel are equipped with an appropriate level of power to do their jobs effectively. It is necessary to alter this legislation to keep up with and adapt to the ever-changing circumstances our Customs organisation is forced to operate in. I would like to take this opportunity to commend and congratulate the men and women of the Australian Customs Service for their hard work and for the exceptional job they have done and continue to do to protect our nation. Again, these amendments are common sense. These cards are necessary for airport employees to undertake their jobs. However, it is necessary that, if these people are to be granted access to areas which are tightly controlled by the Customs Service, Customs is able to obtain up-to-date information about who they are. This is simply a common sense amendment to ensure the integrity of those areas of international airports under the control of the Australian Customs Service. For those reasons, I commend this bill to the House.",124
329,Mr KATTER,COMPLIANCE AND OTHER,"I rise to speak on the Customs Legislation Amendment (Border Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2006. A lot of the officers will have facilitated and made easier a lot of the jobs they are currently doing and would agree with the bill. However, in a port like Cairns or Townsville, fairly typically we have Customs boats, police boats, national parks boats and fisheries boats. There is a ridiculous waste of money and duplication here. The Americans have a single, integrated coastguard service that covers all of those things. They have a boat that can do the job adequately and quickly, and that is the sort of approach that should be used here. I truly believe that the government's reluctance to move in that direction is simply a matter of politics-it is because the ALP came up with the idea of a coastguard. I do not profess to be an expert in sea fare-anything but. However, I would flatter myself enough to say that I know plenty about land warfare, having been a platoon commander for a long time. But the assertion by the government that the 10 frigates that we have-I think eight are built and two are on the way-are an adequate defence of Australia is an appalling assertion. I do not want to speculate here on the circumstances in which we might find ourselves needing a naval force, but we may have to confront a naval force at some point, and there is an assumption that the Americans are going to come and save us. You really want to read your history books if you think that the Americans are going to come and save us. Quite frankly, they were bombed into the First World War and they were bombed into the Second World War. They had the strongest possible reluctance to go into either war. Whilst they are doing a bit of international police work, it is to look after their oil interests. I am not condemning America for that. Maybe that is something you do have to fight wars over. However, where their vital interest is concerned they will act, but where their vital interest is not concerned they are historically consistent in not acting. When England was bleeding to death in the Second World War, and despite the fact that the people there had a common racial background and in every respect had a strong relationship with the United States, there was no way the United States were going to buy into the Second World War. It was only when the Japanese bombed them that they came in. The people who lived in Northern Australia in the last war will recall that they were actually handed over to the Japanese with the infamous Brisbane Line. It was not actually a Brisbane Line for those people who came from Western Australia-it was a golden boomerang, and the rest of us were handed war- over. General Mackay's proposal to the federal cabinet said that all they could defend was a line that went from Brisbane through to Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide and that the rest of it could not be defended. Whether it was a good or bad idea, it was the only possible way that they could approach the situation that very rapidly arose. One moment they were yawning and not very worried about a war that was far away in Europe, and the next minute they were fighting for their lives with the Japanese six weeks away from invading Australia. We need provision of enough patrol boats to do this job. Over the last three or four months, I have run into three people who work on patrol boats. I cannot say where I ran into them, but they were very far away geographically. Each of them gave me exactly the same story. They sit out there, edge of our territorial waters, and there are Indonesian and foreign vessels fishing just beyond the territorial limit. When they have finished their patrol duty and return to their base, whether it be Cairns, Darwin or wherever, the Indonesian vessels come straight in. When the new patrol boat goes out, those fishing vessels leave our territorial waters. is a game of cat and mouse. It is no news-or it should not be newsto this House that, tragically, in 2005 there were 13,018 sightings of foreign vessels. I have come into this place having taken riding instructions from the fishermen at Karumba. They said that they sight them all the time. Quite frankly, I had my doubts as to whether the boys were having me on a bit, but I did my job-thank goodness. It was disclosed on 60 Minutes and has not been denied by the government at any stage-in fact, effectively it has been affirmed by the government-that there have been 13,000 sightings. If there have been 13,000 sightings, I think we can safely conclude that there are 20,000 vessels in our waters. The Australian government have decided that, to keep our fish stocks, we should allow only 6,000 vessels to fish in our waters. But they will come into this place and effectively affirm that there are some 20,000 foreign vessels fishing in our waters, and we are going to build two destroyers to rein them in. I cannot see two destroyers running around the perimeter of Australia-the 12,000 or 15,000 kilometres of coastline. There is an ideological fanaticism which started in the ALP under Keating, and the disease has spread to the other side of the House, who are now occupying the government benches, that you must not do anything to adversely affect trade-we must have free trade. It is a unique occurrence. I do not think it has ever happened in the history of at the the country, but most certainly no other country on earth is carrying out this experiment, with the exception of New Zealand, which is rapidly becoming one of the poorer countries on earth. We have a huge coastline to look after, so, if a five or 10 per cent customs duty that does not breach WTO regulations in any It way, shape or form is imposed, it might give a tiny bit of relief to some of our manufacturers and other people. That money can then be turned over into building patrol boats. I am told that we need a hundred patrol boats. To properly police 10,000 kilometres of Northern Australian coastline, you would most certainly need dozens and dozens of patrol boats. But I do not like to come into this place and say: let the government find an extra $1,000 million a year. I want to say how you are going to findAn honourable member interjecting",125
330,Mr KATTER,COMPLIANCE AND OTHER,"You will find that I have never done that. You will find that that would not be a part of what I have said. I was a senior minister in a government for the best part of a decade, and I will stand on my own record as far as government expenditure goes. But, if those patrol boats can be paid for and manned by people, they will project this country back onto an industrial base once again because the building of those patrol boats over an eightor nine-year period would give us the technological base which we now do not have. It is very heart breaking for us Northern Australians-and I think also for the people of Fremantle, who had this great technological base which has just dissipated. The company concerned, the NQEA, does not operate as a shipbuilder now, I am informed. Most certainly Don Fry, the principal, has retired. So back to a cost estimate for those patrol boats, with interception capacity and missile capacity. I was quoted in the media as advocating that the patrol boats should run around with the missiles on and assail Indonesian fishing vessels, which I derived a lot of humour from. Obviously you do not go running around with missiles on when you are in a patrol boat role! But you can very rapidly convert from a patrol boat role to a very seritralia ous naval presence that can defend this country. It is not good for offence-I hope that we are not running around picking fights with anyone-but if anyone tries to pick a fight with us then we would be well capable of looking after ourselves. I would like to mention the issue of border patrolling. Our territorial waters extend 23 kilometres-that was the reach of a cannon. That water, which we can control, is ours. If there are 20,000 foreign fishing vessels in our water and only 6,000 of our own vessels in our water then I think we would be hard put arguing in the international courts that we are in control of our waters-that they are under our cannons and not somebody else's. This proposition has been put forward so many times to me by the most serious people with naval experience in Australia. I cannot say anything more than that. I said: ‘Why are we putting all of our eggs in the destroyers basket?' For those who are not familiar with the Falklands war, the Falklands had just five Exocet missiles. That is all they owned. But, with those five missiles, they took out two destroyers. Say we have a potential enemy. Say Indonesia, for example, one of our neighbours, had a contract signed for the purchase of Exocet missiles when their economy collapsed; I presume they would go back to that contract. Say there are five Exocet missiles-and that was the mark I; the mark III Exocet is an infinitely more sophisticated weapon-and you have two destroyers, I do not think you are really in a very happy situation at all. But, if you have 100 patrol boats, they might knock out 10, 20 or 30 of those and you would still have 70 or 80 hurling cruise missiles. It is not a very happy event at all. On the issue of border patrol, we have here a cost-effective way of protecting Ausin times of warfare. Just this week I was reading the story of Holden's Hartnett. He said, ‘We were producing Wirraways, and actually it was quite a simple task to switch the Wirraways over to Beaufort fighters. But we needed the tools, the dies and the casting, and we could not get any of them. In a twoyear period, we were still left with nothing.' One of the reasons that John MCEwen was such a strong man on tariffs was, as he said to me personally, ‘I will never see my country placed in a war again without the ability to build a battle tank.' I doubt we would be able to build a machine gun at the present moment. All of our technology is simply dissipating and vanishing. So I would urge the government in relation to the wastage at the present moment with these silly little boats that Customs, the police, National Parks and Fisheries have. I have been out fishing on a couple of these boats in days past. I am not denying the boys the right to have some nice fishing boats to use of a weekend! But, in terms of effectiveness, having all this government duplication is colossally wasteful. These patrol boats can service our Defence, our Navy and our fortress walls. They can also serve to win back Australia's fisheries for Australians, to give our own fishermen a fair go out there. We have a saying in the bush: good fences make good neighbours. It would be very good if we used those patrol boats to establish our fences, which are well and truly down at the present moment.",126
331,Mr HUNT,COMPLIANCE AND OTHER,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (5.05 pm)-In rising to sum up on behalf of the government for the Customs Legislation Amendment (Border Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2006 I want to proceed in three short steps. Firstly, want to outline the core measures within this bill; secondly, I want to address some of the comments made by honourable members; and, thirdly, I want to address very briefly the context in which this bill and other border protection measures advanced by the government are being taken forward. The measures are simple. Firstly, they deal with the disposal of dangerous goods in providing appropriate mechanisms under circumstances where such goods have been obtained by the Customs Service. Secondly, they outline new steps in relation to the access of security identification card holders to section 234AA places, ships, aircraft and wharves. In effect, they help deal with the regime for securing critical sites for Customs activities. Thirdly, there are minor corrections to provisions implementing the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. Fourthly, there are activities and changes in relation to the provision of information in respect of security identification cards to Customs. Fifthly, there are amendments in relation to the implementation of the accredited client program. Sixthly, there are amendments in relation to the protection from criminal responsibility of Customs officers handling narcotic goods in the course of duty. Finally, there is an amendment in relation to remaking a misdescribed amendment to the Customs Act-a house-cleaning exercise. All of those amendments have been largely uncontroversial, but I want to acknowledge and very briefly respond to the comments by honourable members. The member for Brisbane on behalf of the opposition raised one concern-that is, while the opposition generally supports the measures in the bill, it had concerns in relation to the scope of the accredited client program. I thank the member for his general support and I note that we seek to take initial steps in this I area. We are not closed to the notion of proceeding further at a later stage, but we think that this first step is an important base. It proceeds as far as we want to proceed at this time, but it will allow us to assess the long term requirements. If we see that it is workable and if we see that it is necessary to expand it, then we would be happy to consider it. But at this time we have set out a limited and prescribed range of activities in relation to the accredited client program. The second speaker, the member for Kingston, spoke with great passion on this issue. I think most importantly he established a framework for the necessity of broader border protection measures in a global context, where there are real issues of security and real issues of protection of our resources. In particular he noted his support for the brave and strong men and women of the Australian Customs Service. The third speaker, the member for Kennedy, gave us his unique interpretation of the global history of the 20th century. I thank him for that and seek not to interpret it myself. However, I note, in relation to one point he made on illegal fishing, that the government introduced a $380 million illegal fishing protection package in the May budget. Amongst the many things that that does, most critical is the engagement of the Indigenous population as sentinels, as guides and as people who will play an active role. It is good for those people and it is an important role. It is backed by real military expenditure and enforcement, and I argue that it is the most significant package for the protection against illegal fishing in Australian history. In summing up this bill, I want to note the context. The context is two great challenges. The first of those challenges is that there are real issues in relation to the illegal movement of people and the security elements that come from that. What we have seen in the last week in the United Kingdom is that there are those who will seek to destroy the fundamentals of the society in which we live. We as a government make no apologies for laying down a regime which is about protecting borders, which is about ensuring that there is genuine security and which makes it as difficult as possible for those who would seek to defraud or bypass the system for whatever purposes. The second contextual point that I wish to make is that there are real concerns about our fishing resources. The role of the Australian Customs Service, in conjunction with the Australian Defence Force, is fundamental in that, and we take every step we possibly can. We will be vigilant and unrelenting in protecting those resources. I commend this bill to the House. I thank all of those officers and staff of the Australian Customs Service and the different government departments involved in the bill's creation. I thank them and pay particular tribute to the men and women of the Australian Customs Service. Once again, I commend the bill to the House.",128

334,Mr FITZGIBBON,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"Hunter) (5.13 pm)The International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006 is essentially driven by the need for changes to Australian tax law to facilitate the pursuit of nonresidents living in Australia who have foreign tax liabilities. The government is seeking to aggressively align the Australian international taxation system with the OECD model tax convention. Article 27 of this convention provides for mutual assistance in collection of tax debts. Under many of Australia's tax treaties there are reciprocal obligations to take measures to pursue persons who have tax debts in one of those jurisdictions. This usually requires a change in the enforcement and investigation powers in each hosted jurisdiction. There are a number of Australian residents with foreign tax liabilities. The current ute law does not permit the commissioner to seek to retrieve these funds directly. In order to pursue the matter, the commissioner would need to take common-law action on a case-by-case basis. Schedule 1 allows the commissioner to create a register of taxpayers with foreign country tax debts and apply the tax collection conditions operative under Australian tax statutes. Provisions are also included to allow conversion of payments in foreign currency from foreign governments to repay Australian tax debts under the reciprocal arrangements of the OECD tax treaty system. Schedule 2 gives the commission information-gathering power for overseas tax debts. This follows from measures in schedule 1 and permits exchange of information between nations otherwise captured by tax secrecy laws. The schedule on the protocol with New Zealand aligns the Australia-New Zealand tax protocol with the OECD model tax treaty, clarifies where information can be exchanged and modifies the agreement to provide for enforcement action by officials on behalf of the other country. There is also most favoured nation clause, which ensures Australia benefits from the reduction New Zealand makes under treaties with other nations. Labor supports these measures, as it is generally committed to the adoption of the OECD model tax treaty. In particular, there is no reason why Australian tax authorities should not cooperate with countries in the pursuit of tax debts if a satisfactory double tax treaty is in place. I am sure the minister will be very pleased with the brevity of my contribution to the debate.",129
335,Mr DUTTON,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (5.15 pm)-Can I begin by thanking those memstatbers who have taken part in this debate on the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006, particularly the contribution from the member for Hunter. It was short and sweet. This bill will give the force of law in Australia to a protocol amending the Australia-New Zealand tax agreement by inserting the text of the protocol into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953. The bill also includes consequential amendments to provide the legislative framework to support Australia's treaty obligations, to provide assistance in the collection of tax debts and to exchange information on tax matters with other jurisdictions. The protocol between Australia and New Zealand was signed on 15 November 2005. Details of the protocol were announced and copies were made publicly available following the date of signature. The New Zealand protocol enhances trans-Tasman integrity aspects relating to administering and collecting tax imposed in accordance with the treaty and the laws of both countries. The protocol reflects the government's desire to provide for more effective exchange of information a on a broader range of taxes, including the GST, and to provide for reciprocal assistance in the collection of taxes in future tax treaties. The government believes that the conclusion of the New Zealand protocol and the associated amendments will strengthen the integrity of Australia's taxation system. These measures will reduce tax evasion in both countries and will assist in ensuring that the tax liabilities on cross-border transactions are correctly determined and efficiently collected through bilateral administrative cooperation between the Australian Taxation Office and the New Zealand Department of Inland Revenue. The protocol also includes an obligation for New Zealand to enter into negotiations with our country in the event that New Zealand agrees to lower rates of withholding tax with another country. This most favoured nation obligation recognises the importance this government places on lowering withholding taxes imposed on Australian investment in New Zealand, consistent with the direction set in Australia's tax treaty arrangements with the United States and the United Kingdom. The protocol is another example of the strong bilateral relationship Australia shares with New Zealand, and the enactment of this bill and our formal notification of the completion of our domestic requirements through diplomatic channels to New Zealand will complete the processes followed in Australia for the entering into force of the protocol. On that basis, I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",130
336,Mr DUTTON,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (5.19 pm)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006 Consideration of Senate Message Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for the bill and requested amendments announced. Bill returned from the Senate with a request for amendments. Ordered that the requested amendments be considered immediately. Senate's requested amendments(1) Schedule 1, item 46, page 22 (line 31) to page 23 (line 11), omit subsections 19A(6) and (7), substitute: (6) A lease granted under this section must not make provision for the lessee to make a payment to a person other than the lessor. (2) Schedule 1, item 177, page 70 (line 7), omit “rent”, substitute “amounts”.",131
337,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (5.21 pm)-I move: That the requested amendments be made. The Northern Territory government and the land councils have put the view that the rental cap on the township leases will impede the implementation of the Township Leasing Scheme. What they have suggested to me, and I have taken their advice, is that the five per cent cap that the government has in the legislation, which we now seek to remove, would potentially send the wrong message to some traditional owners that five per cent was an expectation or, in some cases-I might say unlikely-that more than five per cent of the value of the land may be warranted and that this arbitrary figure, whilst it had been proposed earlier, should be removed. Following consideration of these issues, the government has agreed to remove the rental cap. We have listened to the stakeholders and will ensure this happens. I also announced this decision in the House when we debated the bill back in June, so it is no surprise to members today or to those who are particularly interested in this bill. The requested amendments are part of a series of amendments agreed to by the Senate to remove the rental cap. The amendments also remove the prohibition on payments other than rent and make it clear that all payments must be made to the traditional owners. I table the amendments.",131
338,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I thank the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Yes, the minister did acknowledge when he introduced the bill into this place that after a discussion with people he had agreed to remove this cap. We welcome that concession, notwithstanding the fact that we think the whole regime for leasing is flawed and inappropriate under the current circumstances and that there are better options. We also believe that the cap as it was initially proposed was potentially anticompetitive and possibly racially discriminatory. I am not sure what advice you received on that. I also welcome the removal of the restriction that prevented traditional owners from negotiating pecuniary benefits other than rent which, as I understand it, will be the impact of the amendment to remove subsections 19, 6 and 7 and replace them with the new subsection. We believe that that is an appropriate course to follow in the circumstances where the government is determined to pursue these leasing arrangements. The model that is proposed is seriously flawed. I do not want to repeat the arguments that were made here previously and in the Senate, but I would like to ask what the purpose was for the proposed change to section 64(4) to omit ‘rent' and to substitute ‘amounts'. The second item on the schedule for amendment is to omit the word ‘rent' and to substitute ‘amounts' for payments out of 64(4). Mr Brough-It is just other than cash.",132
339,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,That is not what this says. Mr Brough-What was the section?,132
340,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,Section 64(4).,132
341,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (5.25 pm)-‘Rent' is obviously a periodical payment. This allows for lump sums up-front and any number of variations which would meet the needs of both parties.",132
342,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I thank the minister for the information he has given us. I do not believe that this is an appropriate use of 64(4) moneys in any event. The 64(4) moneys, as they were originally envisaged, are for the benefit and use of Indigenous people and arise out of proposals under royalty equivalents which are received by the Commonwealth and paid into the trust account under 64A. The minister has the discretion to direct from time to time the transfer of amounts of money he specifies from the trust account to a consolidated revenue fund. Then there are a series of references as to how the money is to be made available. My concern is that what we are now doing under the regime which the government has proposed, indeed passed in this chamber and sought to amend in the Senate, is to impose a regime which effectively means that the way in which the government's proposed leasing arrangements will operate may well rely on payments made out of this account at the direction of the minister. It is worthwhile to point out what 64(4A) says: There must be debited from the Account and paid by the Commonwealth such other amounts as the Minister directs to be paid in relation to: (a) the acquiring of leases by, or the administering of leases granted or transferred to, approved entities under section 19A ... I am concerned that this should be the case. It seems to me that we have Aboriginal people who are effectively the lessor having a benefit which they have accrued being paid out of their account for the purpose of a lease that is from them, which seems to me to be a very bizarre notion.",132
343,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (5.27 pm)-I understand the concern. Maybe it arises partially, at least, from a misunderstanding. The Aboriginal Benefit Account is intended to benefit, as you do appreciate, all Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. It is money out of consolidated revenue. It is not just the revenue that the federal government receives in the form of royalties from uranium. It is also the equivalent to the royalties that the Northern Territory government receives from mining in the Northern Territory. It is that equivalent amount as well that goes into the Aboriginal Benefit Account, so the money is there for the benefit of all Northern Territory people. The equivalent amount plus the royalties that the federal government receives for uranium are placed into the ABA. That money is then to be used for the benefit of Indigenous people in the Northern Territory. Apart from those ABA moneys going to the areas affected by mining, and to the land councils for their administrative costs, most of the remainder of the ABA is available for the benefit of Northern Territorian Aboriginals under subsection 64(4) of the ALRA. New subsection 64(4A) will allow the minister to make payments to the Northern Territory for acquiring or administering headleases. To put that all into context, it means that not even a small proportion of the royalties or the equivalent royalties that the Northern Territory government receives for the benefit of all Territorians is biting into the money that the federal government receives. It is of course going to the administration and the facilitation of these headleases. The money goes back to the traditional owners. We believe overwhelmingly that the lease-back situation will advantage Indigenous people in those localities in a very major way. I hope that that, along with the other points, helps to clarify where the ABA money comes from and the percentage that will be distributed or that is likely to be distributed through here.",133
344,Mr MELHAM,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"It is interesting that the minister says that this is a period for us to reflect upon the fact that this act is about Indigenous people. In summing up, because we are virtually at the end of a process, I am pleased that he has taken on board the request from the land councils and the Northern Territory government about capping and that that change was made. It seems to me that there has been a lot of disappointment. When I was on a parliamentary committee some years ago, we looked at the land rights act. It was the unanimous recommendation back then that there be no amendments to the act without traditional owners in the Northern Territory first understanding the nature and purpose of any amendments and, as a group, giving their consent. I understand that the government has undertaken to talk to traditional owners after this bill is passed. It seems to me that the requests for Senate amendments that we are now discussing are a slight improvement on what was put up in the first instance. I am sure that there are other improvements that need to be looked at on behalf of Aboriginal people in relation to this land rights act, and we should not apologise for that. This was a landmark act in its day. It was introduced by the Fraser government, although it was not as good as the draft put in by the Whitlam government. I note in the report of the Senate committee that it had received a number of submissions, including from land councils, the Law Society, the Minerals Council of Australia and the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research. They were all united in their criticism of the bill and had argued that it should not be proceeded with until agreement was reached with stakeholders, particularly the traditional landowners. That is not happening. We are going through with the government's proposals in relation to the land rights act. These requests for amendments are slight improvements on the wording and the capping situation, which the land councils specifically asked to be addressed. But what concerns me is that I see a lot of amendments that are not aimed at improving the lot of Aboriginal people; they are actually aimed at making it harder for Aboriginal people. I am not one-and the member for Lingiari is also not one-who says that the land rights act should not be improved and changed. When I was shadow minister, I was approached on a number of occasions by the land councils, and they said to me, ‘We think this can be improved not only for our benefit but also for the benefit of the mining community.' They want to see the benefits on their land flowing to their communities as well as to the mining community. In many instances, it is the only hope they have. I take on board that, in terms of these amendments, the minister and the government have responded in one instance to the capping at the request of the Northern Territory government. I think that is important. I also think it is important that what the ernment and the minister do not respond to is the uninformed element out there in the community, because that is not going to satisfy the long-term interests of the community or the traditional owners. I want to see us take a path whereby both sides of politics can put the partisanship to one side and look at some long-term solutions. That involves engaging the other side. That involves sitting down in the sand with traditional owners and others-and I know the minister would propose to do that-and to take on board some of their concerns, because it is a developing situation. In relation to the amendments before us, the member for Lingiari is right. We have had debates on other issues; we have laid down our markers. What the parliament is currently dealing with is very narrow. But it is symbolic that the government has at least taken on board some suggestions and has not said, ‘No amendments at any cost.' There are other instances here that, in the cold, hard light of day, will show that what is being proposed is not necessarily workable. I urge the government to adopt a conciliatory approach and that, if improvements are found necessary, they are made. But bear in mind, as I said, that it is about Indigenous people. They are not against mining. The land rights act is something that empowers them, and they should continue to be empowered by it.",133
345,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (5.35 pm)-I thank the member for Banks for his constructive comments. I want to assure him of a couple of things. I do not have a closed mind to changes. I have only one goal in mind, and that is to improve the lot of Indigenous Australians. This legislation deals in particular with traditional owners. The gov- member for Banks mentioned sitting in the sand. I went to Galiwinku, which I am sure you are very familiar with, on two occasions. The second time was to sit down, in language, and go through chapter and verse what is being proposed there, which does involve this legislation, and then talk to the entire town that was assembled-again, it was all being interpreted. They asked for two months. As the member for Banks and others who have had any real dealings with Indigenous people would know, these decisions are not made quickly. They asked for those two months. They have now said to me: ‘Can we have a few more weeks? It's not that we do not want to do it, but we have to talk things through.' That is perfectly reasonable. These are major decisions. For the benefit of those who are not close to these issues, particularly around issue of leasing, we should all remember that this is not a new proposal; this is an amendment to refine an existing proposal. Leases can be done, and they have been done. They are just very laborious. They are slow, they are frustrating and they are costly. These amendments are aimed at trying to facilitate a more efficient way of achieving goal that traditional owners may have. I also need to stress that no traditional owners will be required, under any circumstances, to lease back their land. I know there has been debate in the other place about the way in which we handle things and whether or not they believe it could be done differently. us leave that aside. I want to make everyone understand that that is the way this is approached. When we say that the consultation with the traditional owners will continue from now, it is not that they have not been engaged with these changes; it is that specific community-any discrete community that decides that this may be a path they wish to go down-there will be a lot of consultation involving the Northern Territory government, the Northern Land Council or the Central Land Council or whichever land council is involved, sometimes private sector people who are going to add their advice to and, of course, the federal government, the local councils themselves and, most importantly, the traditional owners. Getting your mind around the concept of this change in ownership is a very major thing for people who, in many cases, have never really had to be part of that or considered being part of it. For them to take this step, it is paramount that they do so with understanding, acceptance and willingness. Otherwise, people are set up for failure. With respect to all sides of politics and those who have come here before with the best of intentions-and those at state and territory levso els-I have to say that too often Indigenous the groups have been set up for failure with the best intentions in mind. We do not want to repeat that, and I will certainly make every effort to ensure that any traditional owners who elect to use this legislation do so knowing exactly what is entailed, what the benefits are and, of course, what some of the issues are that may have to be resolved around a those decisions, which some will see as not necessarily being in their personal best interests today. If they cannot accept that, that is reasonable and they remain under the current a land ownership arrangements in those communities.",134
346,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I Let want to thank the minister for what he has just said and the undertakings he has given, but I do want to make a couple of observations. The first is that, despite the fact that this proposal, initially for leasing, was derived from conversations between the Northfor any ern Territory government and Commonwealth, I do not support it. I have to tell you that the federal Labor Party does not support it. The reason is that principally it was done without discussion. This legislation foists on people a model-which the minister rightly says is ultimately a matter of choice-which I and many other people who are informed it think has serious flaws in it. Be that as it may, that will not stop the passage of this legislation. I also want to pick up on the minister's observations about Galiwinku. I am not sure if you have read Senator Kemp's response to part of the discussion in the Senate, but in the context of the discussions you have had at Galiwinku with the proposal for 50 houses he made it very clear-and it is worth reading the transcript-that that deal would require a change in leases. I have had discussions with people from Galiwinku subsequent to your visit and I will be having further discussions with them. It is very clear that they are confused by that proposal. They are confused because they say-rightly, I think-that they have an expectation that housing ought to be made available and provided. Certainly there is no objection that I have heard from anyone to the proposition that if people want to buy them they can buy them. That is not at issue. What is at issue the fact that somehow or other the proposal for the housing will be subject to them agreeing to the lease. If that is the case then I suspect that might be in for a very long discussion and you might not like the response you get at the end. It seems to me that we should be separating the two issues. You can certainly put on the table a proposal for housing and say that one way of addressing this need would be to do it in the way you have described. Then you could say that there are other ways in which it could be done and these are they. Then you could say that they are not bound to accept the proposition you have put if they have another proposition, which means that they will get housing, and if they do not like the idea of leasing a town, well so be it. But we do not want people to be held to ransom by a government implying that the provision of housing will be subject to their agreeing to the lease proposals. That is certainly the message which was given by Senator Kemp in his contribution last night. But, in any event, it is not my intention to frustrate the House or the proceedings. We are happy to allow these to proceed and we will have a discussion about them and other matters at some other time.",135
347,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (5.42 pm)-I would like to make a couple of brief comments in closing regarding the Galiwinku situation and, of course, the Nguiu situation. The 50 houses were part of a broader package which involved the Northern Territory government and the provision of policing-there are no sworn police permanently on Galiwinku, which has a population of 2,500. There is inadequate healthcare and there is inadequate education. It was is about bringing together a package of economic development, housing, education, policing and a range of other initiatives which most Australians would take for granted as you being our God-given right living in this wonderful country. In relation to the 50 houses-and I particularly draw your attention to this-no-one will stop the provision of housing in Galiwinku if they decide to stay where they are. The 50 houses are through home ownership, and home ownership cannot happen when the land is not owned by an individual but is owned by a collective. That is money with which people would actually be assisted to build and own their own home. So there will be no reduction in the normal housing assistance that would be provided to Galiwinku. This is money that the budget has put aside to help Indigenous people own their own homes. It is a new approach. It is over and above that. We all know that there is inadequate housing in many Indigenous communities. We are trying to find ways to improve the number of homes, the quality of the homes, how long the homes last, the rental collection on those homes and the maintenance of the homes-I guess, ultimately, for the people who say to me, ‘Why don't I have the right to own my own home?' They do not understand that because, as you say, it is their land. It is no individual's land; it is collective land. It is the same in Nguiu in relation to the federal government's commitment to a collegewhich of course is a church based collegein that the land tenure is very important when you start putting that sort of money in there: who actually owns it, and is it at the whim of a third party? Most importantly, I reassure the people at Galiwinku that, in the event that they elect not to go down this path, that is their right and it remains their right. They will be eligible for housing from the Northern Territory government, which of course has the majority of the responsibility for housing, as states-for whatever there is in the normal way of things. We were trying to explain to them that there is a way of getting a lot more and, in doing so, improving all the situations that we know housing will. Again, I thank the member for Lingiari and the member for Banks for their constructive comments and thoughts, and I commend these amendments to the House.",136
348,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I do not want you to walk out of here believing that we do not think that private capital ought to be used in Indigenous communities for the purchase or building of housing. That is not the case. But it is the case that there are grave concerns that what you have just described is effectively saying to people: ‘You've got a shortage of housing in this community. Under the normal course of events, you might be eligible for three, four or five houses per year. We know that you've got'-I do not know what the occupancy rates currently are in Galiwinku, but let us say this-‘14 or 15 to a house. We can ameliorate that situation by providing a new scheme, 50 houses, which you will individually purchase.' Mr Brough interjecting",137
349,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"No, I appreciate that. But clearly, people will say, and they have every right to say: ‘Hang on. We don't want to do that. But we do want the 50 houses.' And there are other ways in which it can be done. I would have thought, given the creativity that exists within this country, that we ought to be able to come to an arrangement where, for example, the housing is owned as happens in the United States in some places, where loans are underwritten for the provision of housing for a whole village community. In the case of Indigenous communities, I think there should be no problem in accessing private resources leveraged off federal do the money and Northern Territory government money to build housing. It does not mean that you need to have a home ownership scheme, but it does mean that you need to have a coherent capacity for getting the money together and assuring people that they will get a repayment for their investment, and you obviously need to ensure that people are paying appropriate rents and that their houses are being serviced. That is another way of doing a similar sort of thing, except that it says to people, ‘You don't have to compel yourself to a 40or 50-year payment schedule'-whatever it is-‘for the life of a mortgage.' So I have to say that, whilst I understand the intention, I do not agree with it. I think we can provide options, but it seems to me that that option is a very hard one for people. They might accept it, and they have every right to do so if they want to, but it seems to me that it raises some serious issues which they will be thinking about. I know, having had discussions already, that people are thinking about this very deeply. They are not taking it for granted. They are asking questions. They are very sincere in trying to get answers to those questions. They want honesty and all the rest of it, as you would properly expect. Ultimately, they will make a decision. All I say to the minister is: if they happen to make a decision which does not suit the model you have proposed, then be flexible enough to look at an alternate model which might also require you to provide up to 50 houses. Question agreed to. NA (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 June, on motion by Mr Hardgrave: That this bill be now read a second time.",137
350,Ms MACKLIN,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"Jagajaga) (5.49 pm)The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006 does contain some welcome additional support for Indigenous students. However, it is a missed opportunity to deal with some of the problems which have been identified and should be being addressed in this legislation. I will go through those. The bill provides an additional $43.6 million over 2006 to 2008, mainly to extend tutorial assistance support for school students in year 9 and for students at TAFE and with other providers of vocational education and training. The bill does not deal with some of the serious flaws in the government's policies and programs. These flaws, as I say, have been apparent for some time. In June last year in a speech to the parliament, I described the inherent problems and the unfair ways in which Indigenous education funding is provided for Indigenous students, parents and communities. We had a number of other opposition speakers outlining their concerns as well. Unfortunately, there has been no mention of these issues either in the legislation or in the minister's second reading speech and no attention given to the problems that both my colleagues and I have raised many times. It seems there is continuing indifference to the problems which I am sure the government knows about and which we would certainly like to see addressed. That said, Labor certainly will be supporting this bill, because it does provide additional funding. We want to see that urgently needed additional funding out and into our schools and TAFEs as quickly as possible. Given that our underlying concerns remain, I intend to move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for: (a) failing to deliver urgently needed funding for Indigenous students by insisting on complex and bureaucratic administrative arrangements that prevent many schools and communities from benefiting from education programs; (b) causing a $126 million underspend in Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives expenditure in 2004-05 through bureaucratic bungling; (c) imposing impenetrable red tape that has led to a decline in the involvement of Indigenous communities in the parentschool partnership initiative; (d) failing to provide sufficient resources for early intervention programs in schools to raise Indigenous children's literacy standards; (e) reducing the number of Indigenous school children who access tutorial assistance by making eligibility requirements more restrictive and short term; and (f) presiding for ten long years over continuing gaps in educational and training participation and performance between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students; (2) requests the Government to reform its funding criteria and guidelines so as to the address the above concerns and provide all Indigenous students with the opportunity to achieve quality schooling results”. I want to go through why we believe the parliament should voice these concerns, and I call on the government to address them. They are very serious indeed and have been around for some time. The report on the review of Aboriginal education in New South Wales, Freeing the spirit: dreaming an equal future, laments in the following terms: How can it be that, in a country like Australia, there is a group of young people whose early years do not prepare them adequately with the skills and confidence to enjoy a meaningful role in society and a share in the country's wealth? Indigenous people are looking to the nation's political leadership, particularly members of this parliament, for an answer to this and other questions. The member for Kingsford Smith in last year's debate referred to the march from Melbourne to Canberra by Michael Long. This well-respected Indigenous leader walked from Melbourne to speak directly with the Prime Minister about the needs of his people. He took the Prime Minister's word in his election night speech in 2001 that he wanted to place Indigenous issues, including Indigenous education outcomes, at the centre of the government' policy agenda. We saw on television that Michael Long got a cup of tea from the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, he, like the rest of us, is still waiting for a response to the substantive issues affecting Indigenous people, particularly in education. Just the other day the member for Fremantle told us about another story of Indigenous people reaching out for help. In her question to the Speaker last week she referred to the actions of two women who arrived at the parliament after walking across the Nullabor. The women wanted to draw attention to the need for action to eliminate racism in our communities. They wore aprons with the words ‘Steps towards healing' on the front and a map of Australia on the back with black and white hands reaching out for each other for succour and friendship. The women were confronted, unfortunately, by parliamentary bureaucracy when they arrived, but that is not particularly the point I want to make here; rather, this is another case of Indigenous people calling out for understanding, support and, in their words, ‘healing'. The government has been in office now for a very long time-time enough, I would say, to assess its effectiveness in making progress in the education of Indigenous people, despite the difficulties. I acknowledge that there have been some improvements, and all governments and communities, federal, state and territory, should be given credit for these. I think one thing for which people need credit is the fact that there are more Indigenous students completing secondary schooling. The retention rate to year 12 for Indigenous students in 1998 was a very low 32.1 per cent, which is a difference of over 40 percentage points when compared with the rate for non-Indigenous students, who had a completion rate of 72.7 per cent in that year. By 2005 the retention rate for Indigenous students had improved to 39½ per cent, so we certainly have witnessed an improvement since 1998. The retention in 2004 was slightly higher, so I hope we are not seeing a reversal of the trend in 2005. The biggest problem we are aware of is that there is still a very substantial gap between the retention rates for Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. The retention rate for non-Indigenous students also increased in 2005, to 76.6 per cent. So we have a gap of over 37 percentage points between nonIndigenous and Indigenous students when it comes to completing year 12, and I do not think anybody in this chamber would say that this massive difference is acceptable. There is also some evidence of some improvement in the literacy and numeracy standards of Indigenous primary school students over recent years. Once again, the gap in these standards when compared with nonIndigenous students remains extremely troubling. For example, around 60 per cent of year 7 Indigenous students achieved the national reading benchmark in 2001, compared with just under 90 per cent for all other students. By 2004 the achievement rate for Indigenous students had improved to 71 per cent, but I would have to say that that is unacceptably low when compared with the level for all year 7 students, which was 91 per cent. Unfortunately, there has been very little improvement in the percentage of year 7 students who have achieved national benchmarks for numeracy. The rate for year 7 Indigenous students hovered around 50 per cent between the period 2001-04. If you compare that with all Australian students, you find that their benchmark achievement was about 80 per cent. So the year 7 numeracy benchmarks were 50 per cent for Indigenous students and 80 per cent for all other Australian students, and that is plainly still totally unacceptable. When we look behind this data at the differences between the states and territories, unfortunately we see some very big disparities. The percentage of year 7 students achieving the 2004 national reading benchmark in the Northern Territory, for example, was just 39 per cent compared with the national result for Indigenous students of 71 per cent. So you can see that, even among Indigenous students themselves, there is a huge disparity between the achievements of children in year 7 in the Northern Territory and the results of Indigenous students elsewhere. The rate for year 7 Indigenous students in Western Australia in 2004 was 58 per cent, and in New South Wales and South Australia it was 69 per cent. By contrast, in Queensland, the rate was over 85 per cent. Clearly, things are in much better shape in Queensland. The numeracy rates for year 7 Indigenous students, as I said before, are worrying. Only around half of the students are achieving the national numeracy benchmark. The rate for year 7 students in the Northern Territory was a very low 27 per cent. It is bad enough that only half the Indigenous students nationally still achieve the numeracy benchmark, but in the Northern Territory it is a very disturbing 27 per cent. One of the problems, of course, with the results we get from the national literacy and numeracy benchmark tests is that they only provide information about minimum standards at the various stages of schooling. The gap in performance between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students is very stark. One of the other things that have been done is that these test results have been translated into months and years of schooling. The Report of the review of Aboriginal Education in New South Wales advises that the gap between basic skill test results for Indigenous and non-Indigenous students in year 3 is equivalent to 19 months of schooling. In other words, Indigenous children in year 3 have been going to school for only three or maybe four years and, on average, even by year 3, they are about 1½ years behind the level of achievement of their non-Indigenous counterparts. So, even by year 3, they are falling a long way behind. Unfortunately, things do not improve the longer they stay at school. By year 5 the gap is around 24 months. The gap in the writing and language results for Indigenous students in year 7 rose to around 60 months-that is, Indigenous students find themselves five whole years behind. Each and every one of us knows just how important writing and language skills are for success in secondary schooling. Children cannot hope to do well in secondary schooling if their literacy and numeracy is not up to scratch. It is as plain as can be: these very poor literacy and numeracy results are of fundamental concern when it comes to Indigenous education. Compounding these concerns is a very high rate of absenteeism among Indigenous students. It is about twice the rate of non-Indigenous students. Suspension rates are six to nine times those of nonIndigenous students. The absentee rates for Aboriginal girls in year 10 in New South Wales secondary schools is around 28 per cent-that is equivalent to about 60 days of school missed each year. It is no wonder that they are having trouble keeping up with the standards they should be achieving. The government's key strategy for dealing with Indigenous literacy in primary schools has been the Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme. The guidelines for the scheme say: In-class tuition provides Indigenous students who do not meet the Year 3, 5 and 7 literacy and meracy benchmarks with up to 2.5 hours a week of literacy and numeracy tuition for up to 32 weeks each year. That means that this funding is available to Indigenous students in years 4, 6 and 8, after they fail to meet the national benchmarks in the previous year. The guidelines go on to provide some flexibility for principals to allocate funding for students who are at risk of not meeting the relevant literacy and/or numeracy curriculum outcome levels for their age. I remind my fellow members of parliament that, in response to opposition criticisms on this point in parliament, the previous minister for education indicated in last year's debate that he had apparently allowed a degree of flexibility at the school level for principals to decide how they might best allocate the resources. I would certainly appreciate the new minister for education updating the House on whether or not principals are, in fact, able to spend the literacy money where and, most importantly, when they think it will most help students learn to read and write. As many principals have told us, this is most likely to be well before the child fails the year 3 test. We do not want children having to wait until they have failed the year 3 test before they get help with their literacy and numeracy. The key point remains that what is needed are guidelines that encourage early intervention strategies at a school level. I say to the minister that we would like to know whether or not principals and teachers are getting the flexibility they have called for, as well as getting the resources when they need them the most. And that really is at the earliest time so they can identify and prevent or minimise failure, not try to pick up the pieces when it is too late. We do not want to see nu- support that is so late that Indigenous students, at the end of primary schooling, are up to five years behind their non-Indigenous counterparts, which is what is happening at the moment. There are other problems with the way the government administers its tutorial assistance program, which, as a result of this legislation, will now be extended to year 9 students. For example, tutorial assistance funding is not available for students in metropolitan areas that enrol fewer than 20 Indigenous students. That means, of course, many students miss out on the urgent assistance they need. The guidelines for this funding also state that the money is limited and that students in remote locations will be given priority. Nobody in this parliament would say that Indigenous children in remote areas do not need more support. Of course they do. With only 20 per cent in remote areas achieving national reading benchmarks in year 3, we certainly must be putting the extra effort needed into those remote schools. But it does not mean that Indigenous students in regional and metropolitan areas do not have educational needs. Of course we know they do. Funding should be available to all Indigenous students who need help with their reading, writing and numeracy. It should not be based on competition for scarce resources between one group of Indigenous disadvantaged students in remote areas and similar disadvantaged Indigenous students in metropolitan and regional locations. That really is an incredibly nasty way of going about allocating this funding, especially when you contrast this approach with the open-ended funding available under the schools General Recurrent Grants Program, which provides automatic per student funding to all students. Some of that money, of course, is going to some of the best resourced schools in the country. So I think we should find a way through this program to make sure that all disadvantaged young people and children, especially Indigenous children, are able to have the same criteria applied so that they can get the help to read and write and help with their maths at the earliest time. I have had a lot of feedback from principals and schools. They are very frustrated with the way the government organises and delivers this money. I want to quote from a few principals and teachers who have voiced their concerns. One primary school principal advises: We have only 8 Indigenous students here, but 3 have huge literacy problems ... if we want these kids to make serious sustained improvement they need expert intervention for a sustained period ... there are no quick fixes. Another primary school principal says: ... with hard work and creative additional learning assistance, we (previously) achieved 100 % of all year 3s and 5s above the national benchmark ... AND THEN THE FUNDING STOPPED ... That was when the previous minister said the money had to be removed from these metropolitan schools that had small numbers of Indigenous children. Another principal says: We have a small but significant Indigenous student population-11 students, which represents 10 % of our total enrolments ... we need to base support on very early assessments, such as Kindergarten checks on reading level so that effective intervention programs can be implemented early. The point that principal is making is the one I made earlier: we do not want to wait until those children in that school fail the year 3 test; we want the kindergarten children and the children in year 1 and year 2 to be getting the checks, to be getting the additional tutorial support, before they fail the year 3 test. Other principals have made the point that many Indigenous students with poor attendance records may have been absent when the benchmark testing was done. It is more than likely that these children are going to be at risk and would not be eligible for funding. These are practical problems that I hope the learn to minister will take into account. Many of these frustrations from principals are also matched when it comes to concerns about the operation of the Parent School Partnerships Initiative. Once again, the previous minister for education dramatically changed the way in which this funding is delivered to schools. There has been a very significant increase in bureaucracy in this program, and it has had the effect of excluding many parents and community members. Parents now have very little understanding of the processes and feel very remote from them. Many of us on this side of the House raised concerns about these issues last year. I am pleased to see that the department has made some changes, but schools are still complaining that the funding arrangements still require them to undertake considerable work to access what I think everyone would say is pretty modest funding. Schools are complaining that they are spending more time in submission writing and paperwork than in actually designing and implementing educational programs for their students. This is an example from one primary school principal: We now have no Indigenous involvement despite having quite a high number of Indigenous enrolments. Indigenous parents have commented to me about how the process has kicked them out of real engagement ... Another principal says: Since the change to funding we have had no involvement. We have Indigenous children but the work and complexity of getting funds is simply not worth it. Perhaps they (the government) have achieve their purpose, I.e. money stays in consolidated revenue ... Another says: During the process we became extremely frustrated ... on two occasions people dealing with the submission (on a homework centre) ... were reduced to tears and were prepared to walk away. In my last dealing (with the Department) I had to provide information on a program. I was emailed two sets of instructions on managing the database: they would not open and crashed my computer a number of times. When I finally got them to work, the instructions did not match with what was appearing on the screen ... My experiences mean that I want as little to do with (the Department) as possible. Its (processes) need to line up with the realities of school tion. The result of all this is chronic underspending of Indigenous education programs. What an extraordinary outcome when we know that the need is so great. The minister's department has admitted to Senate estimates that there was a $126 million underspend in 2004-05. It really does show that this government does not have an effective strategy to actually deliver the support that Indigenous students need. I would say to the minister that principals in schools who want to do the right thing are saying things are just not working. I honestly hope the minister will now take charge of these processes to make sure that funding is delivered to where it is needed. The administrative processes need urgent attention. It is only through those changes that we will in fact see the money going where it needs to go. As I said before, we do support the additional tutorial assistance in this bill that is going to go to TAFE and other forms of vocational training. There is no question that Indigenous people rely heavily on TAFE for their training, and also for second chance opportunities that TAFE provides. In 2005 the enrolment of Indigenous students in vocational education and training was around 62,700-about 3.8 per cent of total enrolment. We have seen Indigenous enrolment increase in 2005, which is welcomeespecially after two years of decline. Unfortunately, though, completion rates for Indigenous students at TAFE remain very low: around 43 per cent for completion of apprenticeship or traineeship contracts. This is much lower than the overall completion rate of 52 per cent for all apprentices or trainees. The bill does not cover funding for Indigenous students in higher education, but I did want to mention that it is disturbing to note that education department data indicates the number of Indigenous students starting in operahigher education continues to fall. The 2004 commencements represent a nine per cent decline since 2002. These are very worrying figures indeed. These trends are compounded when you look at Indigenous students' completion rates in higher education. The March 2006 report of the Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council advises that the course completion rate for Indigenous students is only about 42 per cent-two-thirds of the completion rate for other students. So once again we have a serious problem with the number of Indigenous graduates declining as a proportion of total Australian graduates. These are unacceptable figures. In the white paper we put forward on higher education, we have foreshadowed that one of the initiatives we would like to see implemented is increased support to our universities to enable them to provide the support that Indigenous students need as they progress through their second, third and fourth years of a degree course. It is very important to get Indigenous students into university, but we also need to improve the graduation rates. In summary, the bill before us certainly does provide much needed additional funding. It will be welcome, but there is no point to it if it does not get to where it is needed. We will support the bill, but I commend the proposed second reading amendment to the House.",138
351,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Ripoll-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,144
352,Mr BAIRD,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"It is my pleasure to support the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006 tonight. It is an important step forward in the education of the Indigenous members of our community who, we would all acknowledge, are significantly disadvantaged compared to the rest of the community, and that is a situation that has existed for some time. In terms of quality of life statistics, Indigenous people are expected to live, on average, 17 years less than other Australians. The infant mortality rate of Indigenous infants in Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory is more than twice the mortality rate of non-Indigenous infants in those jurisdictions. The Indigenous unemployment rate sits at approximately 15 per cent-more than three times the national average. Of course, in some country towns it is a lot higher than that. On educational outcomes, the statistics also speak for themselves: only 40 per cent of Indigenous students complete year 12 compared to 76 per cent of non-Indigenous students. The link between health and education status has been well documented. Large numbers of Indigenous students struggle with attendance and learning outcomes as a result of chronic health problemspredominantly middle ear infections and nutritional deficiency. Only 70 per cent of Indigenous primary school students are reaching literacy and numeracy benchmarks compared to 90 per cent of other students. It is my pleasure to support the purpose of the bill, which is to amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 and to provide additional funding of $43.6 million over the 2006 to 2008 period for targeted assistance programs to improve opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in school and training. Education is generally considered to be a crucial part of improving social and economic outcomes for Indigenous peoples. A great deal of research has shown that educational participation and success directly affects health and socio-economic improvements. There are a variety of factors that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people participating in education, such as access to educational institutions, financial limitations and community attitudes. Existing programs that target Indigenous students are aimed at improving outcomes in some areas. However, Indigenous students continue to achieve lower levels of attainment and participation compared to the rest of Australian students. Within my electorate of Cook, we have a very interesting program in that students who show particular excellence in sport are brought down to the Endeavour High School, located in Caringbah, which is a selective sporting high school. It was set up by a former New South Wales Liberal government under a selective schools initiative. That gram has worked very well. In fact, Minister Kemp visited the school and was terribly impressed with the way in which it was developing a whole range of talented, outstanding young people in all types of sporting fields. The school has produced some outstanding Olympians, national basketball team members, baseball team members in the United States and top swimmers. It is very impressive across the board. They are bringing young Aboriginal lads down from the country with particular skills in Rugby League and training them. Many of them have ended up in some of the top Rugby League teams in the competition. In fact, some are in the Sharks, for example. Mr Hardgrave-It hasn't helped the Sharks!",144
353,Mr BAIRD,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"I wish they had done a little better in the last few weeks, but it is not fault of the program. It is a very successful program. It is the type of thing that we want to do to sponsor and identify a talent amongst Indigenous young people. It is a program which we support. There is no doubt that education is not just a means of personal progress. Education will lead to greater equality for Indigenous Australians. Unemployment is the foremost source of poverty in Australia today, and the reason that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people face difficulties with respect to employment outcomes is their comparative lack of education. I remember a long time ago, when I was shadow minister for Indigenous affairs-or Aboriginal affairs I think it was called at that time-in New South Wales, speaking to the head of World Vision about the programs they had set up in New South Wales. I asked, ‘What do you see as the biggest single way in which we could overcome disadvantage?' He said, ‘By providing jobs.' We are going to provide jobs, probut as part of that we have to provide the educational skills to enable them to take on those jobs. That is why this bill is so important and why this funding is significant. There is still a significant gap between the educational participation and the achievement of Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, but we have made some small advancements and that gap is slowly and steadily getting smaller. Although 40 per cent of Indigenous students now finish year 12, that figure was only 29 per cent when this government took office 10 years ago-and the number of Indigenous students in vocational and technical education has almost doubled since 1996. No-one can pretend that we have achieved so much success that we can all sit back and say: ‘Well done. Haven't we done well?' I think indigenous people around the world are the facing similar challenges, whether they are American Indians or Eskimos in Alaska. It is difficult and challenging, but we are making some progress-and it is the incremental progress that I think we should be very pleased with. This bill is not suggesting that this is going to provide some panacea to address the inherent difficulties that we have, but certainly it attempts to address the imbalance and the gap. This bill is part of the government's strategy to reduce that gap further and to keep Indigenous educational outcomes at the front of our efforts to improve conditions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In keeping with the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy, the additional funding allocated will pay for a number of new initiatives. There is $14.5 million to provide additional tutorial assistance for year 9 Indigenous students, $11.2 million for new programs of tutorial assistance for Indigenous students in vocational and technical education, $7.3 million to support the Indigenous youth festival's health promotion programs and $1.5 million for activities that address substance abuse by Indigenous youth in remote areas-and those programs will assist up to 1,000 young people involved in petrol sniffing and other substance abuse in the central desert and other regions. There is no point us having great education programs if our young Indigenous people are involved in petrol sniffing. It is a great tragedy that this is occurring and destroying lives, and it is a challenge for all us as to what we do to persuade them not to be involved in these activities. It is not easy, but I am very glad to see that additional money is being allocated for that reason. Finally, there is $9.1 million to set up sporting academies and sports related activities based in schools. These initiatives will complement the existing programs. As for the additional tutorial assistance for year 9 students, year 9 is cally the period when Indigenous students are at risk of dropping out of school, so additional tutoring will be provided for year 9 students as a way of addressing this challenge. They will provide some counselling, and the tutors will assist those who have poor literacy and numeracy skills in overcoming some of the difficulties they experience. I think that is an important activity. I see that the minister who is responsible for vocational education is at the table. I am sure he has been very much involved in the program, in that there has been no previous provision for vocational and technical education for Indigenous students. This initiative will encourage Indigenous students to enrol as VTE students. While 13 per cent of Australians between the ages of 18 and 24 are neither studying nor working, 42 per cent of Indigenous Australians fit into this category. So we hope that this program will assist to reduce this. I am sure the minister will be watching that. I am sure all of us in this House feel a responsibility for our Indigenous community and for getting them involved in education and also in trades. This bill provides for the establishment of 18 sporting academies, based in schools, with the aim of increasing sports and related activities for young Indigenous students. If that works as well as it has in Endeavour High, I think it will go particularly well, because sport is something that Indigenous young people can all identify with. There are of some great stars. I know in the Sharks, my own football team, David Peachey was a great idol of many of the young people. Unfortunately, he is now playing for Souths. But he got Cathy Freeman involved as the No. 1 cardholder of the team. He is a great role model for our young people. This program will encourage them in life skills, and self-esteem is going to be important as well. By next year these academies will provide basi- more than 1,000 students with a range of school based sporting activities. I know the minister, having been educated in the Sutherland shire, is a product of Miranda North high schoolMr Hardgrave-Public School.",145
354,Mr BAIRD,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"Miranda North Public School. He is a great example of education in the Sutherland shire. In terms of countering substance abuse, the Australian government's Partnership Outreach Education Model has achieved considerable progress in this area, and this new program of diversionary education will build upon that progress. It is aimed at preventing young people from becoming involved in substance abuse. In conclusion, the government remains committed to addressing the inequalities that exist between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians, particularly to addressing the education area by identifying the problem areas-in particular for those students in year 9, when difficulties exist in their maths and English-providing tutors, helping them overcome problems in other areas, providing these special centres for developing sporting skills, and of course, providing more funding for education in relation to substance abuse. Overall, I think it is an incremental move forward. I congratulate the minister in bringing forward this bill. I note the comments of the shadow minister, and I am pleased to see that the opposition will support the bill. inherent on all parliamentarians to look at the challenge of Indigenous education and at the challenge of our Indigenous community and what we can do. No-one can provide any easy solutions, but at least this addresses practical way some of the inequalities that exist and assists people to develop that pride in themselves-the self-help that is required-and to bring out the real talents they have. I think it is worthwhile and I commend the bill to the House.",146
355,Mr MELHAM,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006 aims to provide an additional $43.6 million over a three-year period-2006 to 2008-for Indigenous education and training. It will extend the tutorial assistance program to students in year 9, extend tutorial assistance to TAFE and vocational students, support community festivals that promote health and are anti substance abuse and support school based sporting academies and related activities for Indigenous students. The extension of assistance for year 9 students restores support that was previously available under the Aboriginal assistance scheme but not under current guidelines. However, I note that this additional money is offset by the tightening of eligibility requirements for Abstudy allowances for Indigenous children under 16 years old. In addition, the Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme funding guidelines restrict access for students in urban areas. It is a strange state of affairs where funding for Indigenous students relies on competition between urban and remote students, yet this government's recurrent grants to nongovernment schools are allocated on a per student basis. The phrase which comes to mind in relation to this legislation is ‘fiddling around the It is edges'. There is no substantive upgrade of Indigenous education; there is no significant input into an area where funding is being reduced. My colleague the member for Jagajaga in a has outlined some of the ALP's more detailed concerns about this bill and what it actually represents. One of the matters she raises is that parent-school partnerships are not addressed. In fact, the bureaucracy surrounding these programs further excludes parents and community members. To access even a modest level of funding, schools need to undertake considerable work. This results in teachers and education administrators becoming highly competent submission writers but not actually spending their time in delivering educational outcomes. Indeed, the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee in June 2005 found in its investigation of Indigenous education that: 1.11 Commonwealth education funding has long been characterised by the imposition of conditions by the Commonwealth, and by a gradual tightening of accountability procedures. And: 1.13 The leverage strategy of detailed reportport. ing, however, affects the operations of schools which do not have the resources to deal with the reporting requirements. One submission, from the Association of Independent Schools of South Australia, indicated that, given the relatively small amount of money available, the level of reporting and accountability is an issue of concern, particularly because of the different reporting requirements for different programs. I addressed this House on a similar bill just over a year ago, on 2 June 2005. That was a significant date because it was one month before the government took full control of the Senate. This government's form has been to treat Indigenous Australians as second-class citizens. I have seen nothing in the past 13 months to change my mind on that position. I warned then that this government was uniquely placed because of its control of both Houses to address Indigenous issues. At that time. I addressed the notion of community consultation. This government, however, still does not get it. The abiding lesson I learned when dealing with Aboriginal communities is that one must work with them, not try and save them from themselves or impose whitefella solutions on Aboriginal communities. In its discussion on parental and community support and awareness, the 2005 Senate committee report noted that there were two basic issues underpinning the dissatisfaction with the government's approach to Indigenous education. The first issue related to the suggestion that the government's approach indicates a lack of trust in the Indigenous representatives' good faith. The second issue related to the greatly reduced levels of funding to support educational programs, particularly in student welfare and attendance supThe government's attitude to funding for Indigenous education is reflected in a very telling comment from that committee, on page 5, which said: There is a presumption that education funding policy should be determined by what can be reported, rather that what is most necessary for overall success in achieving learning outcomes. That statement is a clear indictment of this government. It is all about bells and whistles; it is all about show and not about substance. Of course, it is difficult to find out exactly how much and where the government is spending on Indigenous education. Until the last budget, and post ATSIC, financial information was provided by program by department. While not always easy to decipher, the information was more or less available. This year, the portfolio statements provided extraordinarily broad information. In the education, science and technology portfolio, Indigenous expenditure is reported by three outcomes: schools, post-school and research. The government would probably argue that this reporting provides an easy-to-view summary of expenditure. As long as one is familiar with the details of each outcome, that may well be so. But not many of us are. A plain-text reading of the Indigenous expenditure by the Department of Education, Science and Training actually shows a projected decrease in expenditure. In outcome 1, expenditure on schools in 2005-06 was $473,192,000. In 2006-07 it will be $461,358,000. In outcome 2, post-school, 2005-06 expenditure was $110,027,000. In 2006-07 it will be $108,860,000. In outcome 3, research, 2005-06 expenditure was $535,000. It will be $451,000 in 2006-07. This is a total of $583,754,000 in 2005-06 compared to $570,669,000 in 2006-07, yet the minister will claim that new money is being provided when, as far as I can tell, money is simply being moved around. We must remember the context of Indigenous demographics when analysing expenditure on Indigenous education. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have a relatively young population, with a median age of around 21 years on 2002 Australian Bureau of Statistics figures. port, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey of 2002, stated that 39 per cent were under 15 years of age, compared to 20 per cent of the nonIndigenous population. In 2004, DEST estimated that the Indigenous population is growing at a rate of 5.3 per cent per year. Between 1991 and 1996 the number of Indigenous children under 17 increased by 12 per cent compared to a two per cent increase in non-Indigenous children. ronment. Therefore we could reasonably expect to see expenditure on Indigenous education increase to reflect the increase in actual bers of school age Indigenous children. We must make a long-term commitment which is meaningful to the education of Indigenous young people. I acknowledge that there are no easy answers. No government has ever found the magic solution to these profound and disturbing matters. But no lastIndigenous ing solution will ever be found where the Indigenous community is marginalised in the process. It is only in consultation with the Indigenous community that we can move forward in identifying solutions which are educationally and culturally acceptable. We must also remember that Aboriginal children usually operate from a lower economic base than most non-Indigenous children. In identifying the factors impacting Indigenous education we should consider several factors which operate in the Aborigiity nal community and rarely in the white community. These include: the link between education and the likelihood of future employment; operating from a base of poverty and the resulting emphasis, or not, on education; the lack of privacy, time and resources for study; the low likelihood of increased workforce participation even when Indigenous people do complete school, TAFE or even university; and the connection between povThe same ABS re- erty and crime. The member for Kingsford Smith, in a debate on 2 June 2005, spoke about the OECD inaugural Program for International Student Assessment. One of the findings of that program which is worth reiterating is that learning preferences and behaviours of Indigenous students were different from those of non-Indigenous students. The report also found that Indigenous students have less preference for a competitive learning enviThese findings represent the essence of my remarks today. This government is relynuming less and less on Indigenous community input to the education of their children. Yet the findings of the study I have mentioned clearly identify the types of differences apparent in determining learning strategies for Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. Whitefella solutions are not appropriate for people. The opposition will support this bill because it does put fundinghowever little-into Indigenous education. I commend the amendment put by the member for Jagajaga to the House.",147
356,Mrs MARKUS,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"I rise to speak on a bill that is very close to my heart. The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006 sets us on a path that will improve opportunities for on Indigenous students and, in the long term, contribute to the social and economic equalthat we as a nation aspire to. As the Prime Minister said in a speech to the National Reconciliation Workshop in Canberra in 2005, the gulf between the first Australians and other Australians when considering economic and social outcomes is a measure of the distance we still have to travel. These gaps can only be closed by practical actions that deliver results, and it will be a work of generations. The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006 is a further enhancement of strategies focused on assisting Indigenous youth. We are continuing on a path that, if we get it right, will influence a positive way future generations of Indigenous Australians. I am privileged to be a member of a government that helps where help is needed most, that seeks to create opportunity for all, that creates opportunity for our youth and that, in so doing, builds for their future. This bill provides additional tutorial assistance in schools and training programs, supports community festivals for health promotion, facilitates activities addressing substance abuse by Indigenous youth in remote regions and delivers school based sporting academies and related activities. The purpose of this bill is to increase funding by a net $43.6 million over the 2006-08 calendar years. Supporting the bill and releasing the funds will result in an increase of $25.7 million in additional tutorial assistance for Indigenous school and vocational and technical education students; $9.1 million for school based sporting academies and related activities for Indigenous students; $7.3 million for Indigenous youth festivals, a component of the community festivals for health promotion program, which will reinforce the benefits of educational success and positive lifestyles for Indigenous young people; and $1.5 million to be used for discouraging petrol sniffing and substance abuse among Indigenous young people in the central desert and other remote regions. There is also more flexibility for that budget to be increased under special circumstances referred to in the act. Currently in the electorate of Greenway there are approximately 2,345 Indigenous youth in high schools who may benefit from that assistance. In the 2001 census there were 2,039 Indigenous students in the Blacktown local government area, and the breakdown of that figure shows that 1,239 students were in primary schools, 585 in secondary schools, in 161 in technical or further educational institutions and 54 in university or other tertiary institutions. The drop-off rate is stark and we need to reverse this trend. I have worked with many local Indigenous youth and youth workers and have come to know that the measures intended in this bill, if passed, have the potential to make some difference to Indigenous youth throughout Australia. A revelation as to the size of the issue we are dealing with is found in the statistic that almost 40 per cent of Australia's Indigenous population is 14 or under, compared with 20.4 per cent of Australia's non-Indigenous population. The median age of all Indigenous people in Blacktown is 17 years of age. That is, there is basically double the number of children in the below 14 years age bracket who are Indigenous compared with children who are non-Indigenous. We desperately need to provide the majority of our children with positive role models, with targeted programs that will build esteem and a sense of value and with life and work skills so they can realise their potential and build a future for themselves. Nationally, 40 per cent of Indigenous students progressed to year 12 in 2004, up from 29 per cent in 1996. The number of Indigenous students in vocational and technical education rose from 32,315 in 1996 to 62,726 in 2005. The proportion of Indigenous adults aged between 25 and 64 with a vocational or higher educational qualification has never been higher, and the proportion with a certificate or diploma is also up. Even so, there is indeed much more work to be done. I believe passionately that education is one of the keys to helping young people to reach their potential, to enable and facilitate them to rise above their circumstances, whether it be poverty, peer pressure, dysfunctional family background, personal disability or generational poverty. The Prime Minister is also passionate about education. He said in a speech to business leaders in July this year that education offers the proven avenue of lasting hope for Indigenous young people. To fulfil that hope and achieve that education, to give Indigenous youth the same opportunities as everyone else, increased funding is critical in the areas of schooling, vocational and technical education and health related strategies. The Howard government is committed to developing the potential of Indigenous youth so they can make informed choices about how they relate and behave in the world. I personally know many young Indigenous people in my electorate who can reach their potential. One young girl I was speaking to only a short while ago told me that her dream was to become a police officer. When I asked her what she thought about that, she said she felt that there was no hope for her. She believed that this was not an option for her. I challenged her and said that there was an opportunity to continue her education and to remain in school, that there was no reason why she could not achieve that. But informed choices will only come with knowledge, understanding, skills and values, which are the foundation stones of emerging adulthood. It is necessary for them to understand that they can reach their potential, that they do have something to contribute. A starting point will be $14.5 million allocated to extend tutorial assistance. Tutorial assistance is already provided to Indigenous students in years 10, 11 and 12. This extra funding will be extended to encourage year 9 Indigenous students to go through and complete year 12. Year 9 is a critical year for all students, a time when many make the choice to drop out of school. Many of those who leave school at year 9 have poor literacy and numeracy skills which limit their post-school options, including employment opportunities. Students can access tutorial support of up to four hours per week, for up to 32 weeks in one school year, and the funding will be split between students enrolled in remote schools and students enrolled in nonremote schools. This action is intended to equip students with the necessary skills to consider further education or enhance job prospects. That drop-out rates are a problem is demonstrated by the example of Greenway. Census figures from the 2001 census show that the number of people for whom year 10 was the highest level of schooling completed was 2,170. For years 11 and 12 that figure drops to 691. That is well over two-thirds of students who do not continue on to higher levels. The end result is the current figure of 42 per cent of Indigenous people aged between 18 and 24 years who are neither studying nor in the labour force, compared to 13 per cent of other Australians. That reality means our Indigenous community starts to lose ground after year 10. This government is committed to bringing equality of opportunity to all. The tutorial funding program will continue to the year 2010. Over time, we hope the expanded tutorial assistance program will encourage students to stay on at school or continue their education in vocational or technical education courses leading to the attainment of relevant qualifications. To further that aim, an additional $11.2 million will be allocated to Indigenous students undertaking courses leading to the successful achievement of an Australian qualifications framework certificate level III or above, which will significantly increase chances of employment. The bill also directs funding to sporting, recreational and cultural activities. In 2007 this initiative will enable more than 1,000 students, both boys and girls, to attend up to 12 sports academies, located within schools, which offer a range of sports and recreation activities. The funding will also cover related initiatives to address racism in sport, to promote cross cultural awareness, to showcase the contribution Indigenous people make to sporting life and to provide opportunities to participate in sporting carnivals. By the end of 2008 there will be some 18 academies in place and the number of Indigenous students attending will increase to an estimated 1,530 from every state and territory. Indigenous sportsmen and women have represented Australia with honour and distinction at district, state, national and tional events. The football codes, Rugby League and Australian Rules in particular, have long been a path to success as the young boys grow from youths to men. Those role models are there. The government, through this bill, is making a concerted effort to focus on programs that are proven to work to ensure that every young person gets the opportunity to build a future for themselves. A working model of the sports academy initiative already exists in Western Australia. The Clontarf Foundation is a model for Indigenous engagement in education that has demonstrated significant and lasting outcomes for their students, both current and former. The Clontarf Foundation operates six football academies in partnership with, but not independent of, secondary schools. The model was developed by the foundation's CEO, Mr Gerard Neesham, as a result of his experience with Aboriginal footballers and their families and his recognition that the football environment was one in which Aboriginal people excelled. He found that participation in football and related activities helped to develop positive behaviours and to reduce the prevalence of negative behaviour in those who were involved. Some of the aims of the program for participants include attending school regularly, re-entering education after prolonged absences; achieving retention rates above state averages; enhancing self-esteem; using experience gained to make healthy lifestyle decisions, for example exercise, diet and nutrition; addressing alcohol and substance abuse; setting goals and persevering to achieve them; reducing criminal reoffending; achieving improved academic results; and developing a greater understanding of, and access to, the employment opportunities available to them. Importantly, Clontarf's results speak for themselves. In 2004, internaapproximately 270 young people participated, with the following results: an average attendance rate of 78 per cent, an average retention rate of 82 per cent and 83 per cent of graduates from the program achieving full-time work It is the government's aim to reflect those outcomes through its own sports academy initiative. The program will be rolled out nationally in partnership with national and state sporting bodies with strong affiliations with schools and in collaboration with state and territory governments. This initiative will ensure that more young Indigenous girls and boys have the chance to experience positive education and sports activities, with a view to improving their health, employment and education outcomes. Hopefully they will be inspired to swell the ranks of Indigenous sportsmen and women in the annals of Australia's illustrious sporting history. Another important feature of this bill provide $7.3 million for Indigenous youth festivals, with an emphasis on promoting healthy, positive lifestyles for young people. More than 30,000 primary and secondary aged students in remote and regional areas will participate in community based music, dance, art and career activities designed for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous young people. Positive events such as these provide an important mechanism for increasing community involvement in building the resilience of young people and for promoting well-being and healthy lifestyles. A program such as the one outlined can never be fully effective if it does not address the very ous matter of substance abuse, in particular petrol sniffing, by Indigenous youth. Effectively dealing with substance abuse requires a comprehensive, sustainable approach that includes education, justice, community support and health initiatives. The government is committed to providing education programs, and $1.5 million will be provided by this bill. Under this bill diversionary and preventative education based projects that build upon the successes of the Australian government's Partnership Outreach Education Model pilot will be introduced in the central desert and two other remote regions to help combat the critical issues of petrol sniffing and substance abuse. Up to 1,000 Indigenous young people will benefit from these projects, which will act as a safety net to help young Indigenous people in these regions who have dropped out of school. This bill not only addresses educational and sporting opportunities and provides opportunities to engage in healthy, meaningful lifestyle events but it also will help to address the critical issue of substance abusean issue that holds back our children, Indigenous or not, and also impacts negatively on families. This bill offers a comprehensive package of measures that will assist, encouris to age and inspire a generation of our young Indigenous people. In line with this government's philosophy, this package is a hand-up not a hand-out. It will give Indigenous young people the knowledge, skills and self-esteem to make better choices and to take their place as the leaders in their community. I commend this bill to the House.",149
357,Mr GARRETT,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"I follow on from the member for Greenway and also from my colleagues the member for Banks and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to again highlight and make reference to the fact that nothing is more important for young Aboriginal kids, young seriIndigenous students, than completing their education and making the passage from preschool, primary school and high school and hopefully into a trade or into tertiary studies. Amongst other trends in Indigenous education that bear down on policymakers, some of which have been identified by those who have spoken in this debate on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006, I note that despite a period where we have seen significant increases in the numbers of students who graduate from high school and go on to some form of tertiary study, and despite the fact that tertiary studies themselves are of critical and vital importance to people and enable them to be effectively and thoroughly skilled to go into the workforce where job requirements are often increasingly specialised, Indigenous higher education is suffering considerably and the numbers of students who are able to get into Indigenous higher education has in some instances declined. This is a matter of great concern for us on this side of the House. I speak on this legislation as someone who has a number of Indigenous communities in their electorate. In the electorate of Kingsford Smith, there is a significant population of Indigenous people. Some of them have grown up in the area and some have moved into the area. It is no exaggeration for me to say that one of the most pressing issues in the electorate is getting Aboriginal kids into the schooling system so that they can prosper and succeed. The point needs to be made, as we consider some of the problems in this debate on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006, which have been identified by the member for Jagajaga in her second reading amendment, that a school which has a large proportion of Indigenous students tends not to operate like a school which does not. By that I mean a school with an Indigenous population is often the lightening rod for the disadvantage that their communities suffer. The pressures on the students in the school are often of a greater order than they are for children in schools where there are not many Indigenous students. More often than not, the kids are coming from backgrounds which have experienced some form of trauma-sometimes dislocation in their family and sometimes they are from backgrounds where education, regrettably, has not been strongly emphasised. There is absolutely no doubt that, on the whole, Indigenous parents want their kids to have a good education. They recognise from their own lack of education how important it is that their kids be educated, that from education comes employment, from employment comes economic sufficiency and from economic sufficiency comes good health. I think everybody in the House agrees that this productive virtue of education is one of the most important and critical issues that we face in redressing Indigenous disadvantage generally. I do not fully share the Prime Minister's view that the road to rekindling the hopes of the 1967 referendum lie through education. I spoke about this in another forum today. Important as education is, there are other important measures and issues that pertain to the prospects of Indigenous people being able to live full lives, to not suffer the levels of measurable disadvantage in health and education et cetera and to have a true, just and lasting commitment to reconciliation is part of that. Labor support the bill, but we have moved a second reading amendment. We note that the bill provides an extra $43.6 million over 2006-08 for Indigenous education and training. We have raised concerns by way of the amendment and in debate in the House that the funding criteria and the program administration issues that have arisen during the consideration of the bill have not been adequately addressed. We note, for instance, that there is an underspend of $126 million on the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program. I can well understand that there are some good reasons for that. When you look at the difficulties that we face in driving policy through bureaucracies both out of this place and out of state governments, you see that underspends or funding lags are often a function and a feature of that process. However, I do not think the parliament should contemplate that an underspend in an area as critical as this should be at all acceptable. In addition, Labor is very concerned that more red tape will be attached to the provisions in this bill and that, as a consequence, we will see a decline in the involvement of Indigenous communities-in particular, families in the Parent School Partnership Initiative. It is absolutely critical for the success of any amount of money or for any programs that are introduced into Indigenous education that participation by Indigenous parents is fully encouraged. If you do not have that, then it will be extremely difficult for programs to have enduring and long-term success. I refer at this point to one of the aspects intervention in early childhood education, which this bill addresses. There is absolutely no doubt that the earlier intervention is made the more likely are the chances of successfully assisting that child in getting into the education stream so that they can enjoy the education process, not fall behind, graduate and become a member of the workforce. The earlier the intervention, the earlier the involvement, the earlier support and resources are made available to them the better. It is extremely important, particularly under this bill, that we do not have a situation where the money is being spent after the problems have been identified and the problems cannot be rectified in time. That is absolutely critical. Labor have raised a number of issues in relation to the bill. In particular we note that this assistance here restores some support that was previously made available under the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme, which provided tuition at all levels in an effort to achieve educational outcomes for Indigenous Australians equal to that of non-Indigenous, and we note that the funding guidelines of the Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme, ITAS, actually restrict access for students in urban centres. As somebody from an urban electorate, I have to say that that must be one of the deficiencies of the legislation. The guidelines for the Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme state that funding will be based on an assessment of students' needs and availability of funding, and that students in remote locations will be given priority. I think that is understandable, given some of the statistics that we have in terms of absenteeism and failure of students to complete primary school and high school education, particularly in the Northern Territory. But, notwithstanding that, the Indigenous community is a diverse one, and there are large numbers of Indigenous kids who are going of through their education system in cities and towns. They face a range of problems, sometimes not on the scale or magnitude that perhaps some kids in some parts of rural Australia face but they are nevertheless real. Labor believe that funding should be available to all students who need assistance, not just to those who live in remote locations. I note that general recurrent grants for tutorial assistance from the government are paid on a per student basis, but we believe that the same criteria should apply to the most disadvantaged students in the nation. Because the Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme continues to be linked to year 3 literacy and numeracy test results-so consequently you cannot take any action until year 4-this means that you are not capturing students at an earlier age. It really is a deficiency that has been identified in the amendments because it means that it will be a little late to pick up the sorts of problems that kids are having with literacy and numeracy at that year 4 stage. There is overwhelming evidence from educational research of the importance of the early intervention that I have referred to. With only 20 per cent of Indigenous kids in remote areas achieving national reading benchmarks in year 3, we strongly believe that delivering assistance to this cohort before they reach this failure point is critical. Additionally, I want to point out the concerns that have been raised about the parentschool partnership program and the additional levels of bureaucracy that attach to this program-the amount of paperwork, formfilling and so on that attaches to it. This is always a problem in Indigenous education. The provision of materials and the requirements to fit into guidelines and frameworks that in some cases are imposed bureaucratically are always difficult issues, particularly for parents coming into the school environment. While there have been improvements to the application process-and Labor acknowledge those improvements-we still note that schools are complaining that the funding arrangements require the schools themselves to undertake a considerable amount of work to access most modest amounts of funding, and quite often they are not successful. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I am sure you would agree that any measures which are aimed at targeting Indigenous assistance should not be of such a complex order that they actually have the opposite effect and make it more difficult and more burdensome, particularly for teachers who have pretty strong demands on them as well. I note too that schools complain they are spending more time in submission writing and paperwork than they are in designing the best educational programs for their students. Welcome to the world of funding, regrettably. Nevertheless, this is something which should be noted by the government because it really is an issue of some importance, not only on the matters that relate to this bill but more generally in education. Many critics cite education as the key to improving the gap between life expectancy rates. In fact, a principal of a remote Indigedigenous nous school was quoted as saying that, in relation to Indigenous students, those who leave school early die early. That is the stark reality of failing to make sure that Indigenous kids have an adequate and comprehensive education. There is no doubt that there are positive examples and some inspiration that we can draw on in this respect. Dr Chris Sarra is a good case in point. He was given the job of turning around Cherbourg State School, which had tremendous issues of truancy and staff who did not share his views. He wanted to turn around literacy levels, and he set about delivering on the Cherbourg motto ‘Strong and Smart'. I have heard Dr Sarra speak on a number of occasions. I think he is a very impressive Indigenous educator. He remarked that the first thing and the most necessary thing to do was to challenge the community mindset that being Aboriginal destines a child to failure. We need to be able to say, and we need to provide teachers with the confidence to say, that education is absolutely critical for Indigenous children and that if they come into the education system they will not automatically, as a matter of course, fail. In fact, in his first year as principal, the number of unexplained absences dropped by 94 per cent. By 2004 more than eight in 10 students were in the average band in the state. One of the major reasons for Dr Sarra's success at Cherbourg was that he instilled in students a sense of pride in being Indigenous, in being Aboriginal, and he gave them a belief that they could be successful. My experience is that this is absolutely critical. When you have contributions such as that which we have seen by a former Labor member of this House, Gary Johns, writing for the Menzies Research Centre a report on Aboriginal education in remote schools and an assertion that we should not preserve Inculture in our schools, then you realise that there is some thinking that is way out of whack. I was surprised, frankly, that the new education minister saw fit to launch that particular research, which was very quickly howled down by those who have first hand experience of what is needed in education and in making sure that Indigenous kids are able to progress well in their education lives. In my electorate of Kingsford Smith, we have an Indigenous community program called HIPPY. It is the Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters. Again, it is based on the principle of early intervention. It is based on the principle of teaching parents to familiarise Indigenous kids with what going to school is about and how to organise their pens and paper-providing them, if you like, with a bit of cultural encing before they come into the school system so that they have confidence when they come into the school system. From that position of confidence, they are able to go forward and participate and complete their studies. I do acknowledge that the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Minister Brough, has provided some level of support for HIPPY. It is actually a nationwide program. It feeds very much into the bill that we are considering this evening because it talks about how important it is for there to be good relationships between families and the schooling system, where people go into the schooling system with confidence and a feeling that they are welcomed, where kids believe that not only is learning important for them but it can actually be fun, and where kids are targeted at an early age so that they get into the educational frame of mind and begin the taskwhich for them can sometimes be a pretty difficult and onerous task-of completing their education. The education statistics in our country for Indigenous people are very poor. It is critical that the amended Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act that we are considering is a piece of legislation without default, without deficiency-that it does the job that it is intended to do and that it provides the benefit and the assistance that is needed both for kids in that early period and for the year 9 kids who will also benefit under this program. I know that all members present recognise how critical education will be for Indigenous kids, who are facing a long and tough struggle in some instances but whose future very much depends on them receiving education which is comprehensive. We have brought an amendment to the House. It is a constructive amendment. We referdo hope that the government will take some heed and some notice of it, because there is no question that the decisions that we make today will affect the prospects for kids in the future. (Time expired)",153
358,Mr HAASE,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"I rise this evening to support the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006. The purpose of this amendment bill is to appropriate additional funding of $43.6 million over the 2006 to 2008 calendar years for tutorial assistance, community festivals for health promotion, activities which address substance abuse, and school based sporting activities for Indigenous youth. Education prepares children for life and participation in society. These projects will assist Indigenous pupils with their schooling, and I commend the Australian government on this amendment bill and its lofty ideals. However, the number of children these funds will assist is relatively minimal and will continue to be so unless there is a fundamental shift in the attitude of Indigenous people themselves towards education. It may surprise members in this place to know that there exists an unacceptably large cohort of children not even enrolled in the school system, within the Indigenous population. These children are therefore out of the education system and often the social system completely. This situation can lead to nothing but negative, wasteful and tragic outcomes. The obvious drawcards of substance abuse and crime aside, there is also the lure of welfare dependence and the baby bonus grant. The baby bonus is something that this government very rightly takes a great deal of pride in. We now offer new mothers $4,000 tax-free to assist with the cost of a child. However, in communities where young people are out of the education system, this assistance is having an adverse impact, leading to an increase in the number of under-age mothers and therefore an increase in the number of welfare recipients. Worst of all, all these young people have no chance of breaking the cycle of poverty. Enrolling children in school and ensuring that they attend every day for their primary school years is the single most important action parents can take to solve the crisis of the unemployability of Indigenous youth as a result of failed primary education and everything else that follows. School attendance for at least primary school years must be made compulsory for every Australian child. I have been deeply committed to this principle since I first heard of the herculean struggle Indigenous children face for a positive life without an education. Addressing the issue of truancy among children is fundamental to the future prosperity of Indigenous people and, I believe, their salvation. Last year a trial project addressing this sue was set up in the town of Halls Creek in my electorate. Halls Creek has been in the spotlight in recent weeks because it is a microcosm of the wider issue. The project's aim was to suspend the Centrelink welfare payments of those parents whose children did not regularly attend school. Parents had to go into Centrelink and explain why their children were not attending and ask for support. This trial was working incredibly well, with school attendance jumping from 54 per cent to 80 per cent in two months. Unfortunately, the project was cancelled because its legality was questioned. I worked very hard to get that trial reinstated and it was, but unfortunately in a weaker form. Political correctness once again dealt a blow. We anticipate the release of the report on that trial, and I hope to see a strong recommendation for no school, no welfare and that not to send one's child to school is tantamount to child neglect. Some members may feel that is a strong statement, and it is. It is also a true statement. For decades we have equipped Indigenous communities with more than adequate educational resources-that is to say, we have tossed money at the problem. If members feel that that approach has been successful, they are mistaken. We need a change in attitude, and the cultural reasons children do not attend school must be addressed if we are to make any progress. No one reason is more important than another, and I will begin with the dependence on welfare. Over the past decades we have created a culture of welfare dependence among Indigenous communities. Measures must be taken to wean people off this dependence, and the most significant impact will be made by education. The concept of mutual obligation needs to be mentioned. The taxpayers of Australia expect this government to spend money in a reasonable isway. Surely, if we are prepared to continue to pay welfare dollars, the recipients should best equip themselves to break the welfare cycle. Across Indigenous communities a culture of illiteracy has been created. Children have no role models because in many communities no-one in their family has been educated since the time of the missions. Generally, little importance is placed on learning and improving one's situation through education. There is also the question of funeral attendance and sorry time, which involve extensive travel and taking the children out of school for such long periods of time that it seems to them pointless to return. Cultural matters have priority over what is considered to be the importance of education because, currently, political correctness is paramount. Too many teachers have a romantic idea of teaching in Indigenous communities: learn the language and culture, embrace the community members, stay a short time and dine out on the experience forever. When they return to their cities they should have left something behind, other than the children. Too often they take from the community rather than contribute to it. When you consider that they are charged with the responsibility to improve the ability of these children to engage in society, combined with the reluctance to attend school on a regular basis, it is little wonder that we have such difficulty in finding real employment for community based people. Government does not have a responsibility to embrace Indigenous or any other culture. Government has a responsibility to equip all its people for a fulfilling life. dictates of modernity define that as being a basic education, health care, security under the law, equal opportunity and the opportunity for participation in meaningful employment to gain financial independence and contribute to society. Too often, currently, not only excuse but condone a culture that says, ‘School attendance is not important.' It is simply not morally just to espouse the view that one ought to be sustained by society without contributing to it. This bill provides an additional $25.7 million for tutorial assistance for students in year 9 and for those undertaking vocational and technical education. These two groups need support. Year 9 has been identified as the level at which many students drop out of school, and vocational and technical students are few and far between. Indigenous children who attend school are too often not given educational support at home. So those struggling with their studies tend to simply give up. Providing funding for tutors to assist with difficult subjects means that these children are more likely to stay at school. Most recently the media has focused on the endemic culture of violence and sexual abuse. Under this ever-present threat within the home, women are unable to concentrate on the appropriate care for their children. We need to create an environment where Indigenous parents, predominantly mothers, feel secure and confident, allowing them to encourage their children to gain an education. We need to make mothers more secure in the knowledge that their children will not be abused as they were, and unfortunately still are. There needs to be a greater and local abundance of agents genuinely concerned with the welfare of children, providing realistic support for the mothers of those children. There need to be a sufficient number of The advisers on basic domestic health and Western style domestic standards. There needs to be a law enforcement presence which will give a sense of confidence that the family unit can be divided for the duration of the school day. Parenting skills need to be taught we which include the value of a basic education, because that education is the foundation of a meaningful future for all Australians. Generational unemployment and the resulting boredom leads to all manner of cheap and easily alternative preoccupations, such as substance abuse. Substance abuse takes priority over school attendance. If you have been brought up in a community without the example of employment participation, the theoretical perfection of education, training, employment, financial independence and self-esteem is totally absent. The bill provides $1.5 million for educational efforts to discourage abuse amongst children in the remotest regions and to try to break that cycle. Whilst that does not seem substantial, it is just one of a number of projects, and even if it prevents only a small group of children from becoming substance dependent it will be a success. Substance abuse, combined with neglect and a dangerous home environment, means that Indigenous children are often left to fend for themselves. This bill also includes $9.1 million for 18 school based sporting academies, which will provide direction on how to occupy those children in a productive and positive manner. I add that only this afternoon I had the good fortune to meet with Peter Holmes a Court, co-owner of the Rabbitohs. I am pleased to say that the Rabbitohs are well focused on Indigenous participation in their team, and I am told that there will be something in excess of 25 per cent of members with Indigenous heritage in the team next year. Debate interrupted. NA",157
359,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Centrelink",160
360,Mr WILKIE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on the adjournment on a matter of some concern to me and my constituent Ms Brenda Hendricks of Carlisle. Today, after question time, Minister Hockey added to his answer to my question yesterday and suggested that she had in fact been treated appropriately by Centrelink. I am most concerned that the minister is being selective in his account to the House, and with Ms Hendricks's approval I would like to read her letter into the record as it speaks for itself. It says: Dear Sir I wish to congratulate your actions to assist Matthew Pearce's fight for a Centrelink Disability Support Pension (DSP), which I read about in the 8 August edition of the Southern Gazette. I am pleased that you have requested that The Hon Dr Stone conduct an immediate investigation into the matter, as I believe that the whole Centrelink system requires an overhaul. I would like you to know that the treatment of Matthew is despicable but, unfortunately, not an isolated incident. I have also had a difficult time with Centrelink. In February of this year, I was diagnosed with a highly aggressive, incurable brain tumour, a grade IV glioblastoma multiforme. At 30 years of age, this tumour is rare and highly malignant. After surgery, I was faced with months of treatment, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, all of which has left me with headaches, dizzy spells, an inability to concentrate, eyestrain, extreme tiredness and lethargy. I am also no longer able to drive as I am under constant threat of an epileptic seizure. I contacted Centrelink for assistance and was informed that I was not eligible for the DSP, but may be entitled to a Newstart incapacitated allowance. I followed all of their procedures, but told them. I could not go into the Victoria Park office as I was recovering from major brain surgery and suffered all the symptoms I listed above. They assured me that I would not be required to have an in-person assessment and that it could be conducted over the phone. However, I was then asked to go into the office to sign all of the paper work and to complete a follow up interview. They would not concede that I was too unwell to leave home and assured me that by setting up an appointment time, I would not have to wait long. I waited for almost one hour. I could barely sit up in the waiting area and my father was so worried that he begged me to let him take me home and forfeit my application. I was offered a weak apology and then told that they were unaware of my medical condition. This was odd as I had disclosed my condition over the phone three times as well as in my application. I was then told that I would have to go into the office fortnightly to lodge my claim form. I told them again that this was impossible for me to do and after much argument they agreed to let me lodge it every 3 months as long as I provided them with a medical certificate saying that I was still sick. My problems with Centrelink escalated from there, with letters threatening to recover payments as I had not lodged my fortnightly forms. When I rang to query this, they insisted that I still had to lodge fortnightly as I didn't have a medical certificate, which was untrue. After 2 months of receiving the allowance, I was told to go for a work capacity assessment. I again argued that I had a medical certificate, but they insisted and threatened to stop my payments and recover previous payments if I did not go. I went. The work capacity assessor was surprised by the severity of my condition and that I had been requested to be assessed and told me that she would state in her report that I was unfit for work for at least 6-12 months. Approximately two weeks later I was told that an appointment had been made for me with Centrecare to create a resume for me, go through possible job options and to enrol me on the jobsearch network. I was appalled and contacted Centrecare to inform them that I would not be attending the interview as I had a medical certificate and was not able to work. However, I also have two degrees in psychology and am due to complete a Masters in Psychology at the end of this year, so I do not need assistance in finding possible job options. I was so distraught with how I was treated and the amount of stress that they caused me that I felt that I was close to a breakdown. I was already under immense stress from dealing with my condition, the treatment and facing my mortality. I finally broke down in my oncologist's office and the hospital's welfare officer was called into assist me. I was then told that I should be entitled to the DSP as my condition was permanent and incurable, so they began the paper work to apply for the DSP. With the assistance of the welfare officer, I received it. However, my problems didn't end there. The final straw came less than a month after I started receiving DSP payments. I was told that another interview had been made for me with Centrecare and that if I did not attend I would forfeit my pension and they would commence action to retrieve all of my payments. I rang Centrecare up again and was informed that I had to attend the interview under the new laws, which came into effect on 1 July this year. My interview was scheduled for 26 June and I argued that the laws weren't in effect yet and that I had a treating Doctors report, but to no avail. In tears, I again contacted the welfare officer, who managed to sort the matter out and the interview was cancelled ... I believe that the whole system is in desperate need for an overhaul. I can appreciate and understand that a small minority of people have defrauded the system resulting in measures being put into the place to ensure that recipients of allowances and payments are genuine. However, it is indicative of serious problems or flaws in a system when genuine applicants, like Matthew, are passed over because of generic and generalised assessment methods that do not take into account individual circumstances or needs. If I had a dollar for every time one of Centrelink's staff members told me that it was a computer generated letter or form and out of their control, I wouldn't need the DSP as I would be quite comfortably well-off. I know that there must be procedures and protocols in place in order to ensure that there is a fair system across the board, but there must also be a way of recognising applicants and recipients as more than just a reference number. Therefore, I again applaud your actions and encourage you to persist in fighting for your constituents rights. I hope your actions and the media attention that Matthew has received will not only benefit him, but others like us. (Time expired) Electorate of Barker: Higher Education",160
361,Mr SECKER,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I rise tonight to raise an issue that I know is very close to your heart, as well as mine. It is an issue of great importance to many farmers in my electorate of Barker. It is due to concerns for students in electorates like ours that I raise this issue. If these students wish to study at university, they have the extra costs of accommodation and travelling. Recently I have received a number of letters from various constituents relating to their children's desire to study at a tertiary level and the financial barriers they are forced to consider in making their decisions. This has certainly been an ongoing issue for some time and one which affects many of the youth of Barker. I acknowledge that, since my election to parliament, this government has made considerable changes to the Youth Allowance scheme, but I stand here this evening asking this government to give the rural youth of Australia a fair go in undertaking tertiary studies, and let us make some further changes to really make a difference. Whilst these children find a desire to better themselves and their skills to become skilled zens of this nation, unfortunately a lot of them do not have the resources to even contemplate such a dream. In a rural electorate as large as Barker some students need to go to a tertiary instituin. tion in the nearest capital or regional city, often located a considerable distance from their home town, forcing them to leave their family home and stay at a residential college, board or face setting up their own accommodation at an extra cost to their family. Unforately tunately, many country families cannot fund such costs on top of the cost of education and we have many fine students who cannot even consider attending further tertiary education. We certainly cannot expect families to take out loans or extend their mortgages just to educate our future leaders. With the current costs of university courses, one cannot even consider how much it would cost a rural student in total to move to a new town, set up a place to stay whilst studying and fund an education course. Whilst the government provides the youth allowance, we need to ensure that we are considering our rural youth and that the means test and qualifying periods ensure we are encouraging the rural youth of Australia to continue to study and not making it an extremely expensive and difficult exercise for them as compared to students from city based families. Were changes to be made to the Youth Allowance program, allowing more rural students to study, we may actually be able to encourage these graduates to then return to rural Australia with their skills and encourage the next generation of this nation to undertake further study. I remember seeing a study some time ago which showed that doctors who came from rural areas were at least a 50 per cent chance of returning to a rural area, but if they came from the city, the citichances were only one in 20, or about five per cent, that they would move to the country. So there is certainly a greater chance of a rural student coming back to a rural area and serving those areas that they often grew up I would certainly like to see the government allow any student who needs to travel more than 100 kilometres from their homewhich takes in most of my electorate, I might add-to undertake tertiary study to immediqualify for full youth allowance or residential rent assistance under the exceptional circumstances determination. For example, students from the city of Mount Gambier, with 25,000 people, have to travel 450 kilometres to attend a university in either Melbourne or Adelaide. In the Riverland, students travel between 200 and 300 kilometres to attend university. For students from my hometown of Keith it would be 250 kilometres and from Naracoorte it would be 350 kilometres. I would certainly like to see the family means test relaxed by the genuine cost of a student living away from home for that calendar year. Conservatively this would be around $10,000. I believe that with these two changes in place we would really be assisting rural youth to become the best they can be without the extra financial burdens they face, as opposed to their city classmates. Death Penalty",161
362,Ms ROXON,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to take this opportunity in the adjournment debate tonight to speak about the death penalty, an issue on which a number of members in this House had hoped to move a joint motion. Unfortunately, the opportunity for doing that to mark the 15th anniversary of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, passed while we were not sitting. I want to read into the Hansard the motion that is supported across the House. It was seconded by the member for Cook, Bruce Baird-and I am pleased that he is able to be here tonight-and co-signed by a number of my colleagues: Peter Andren, the member for Calare; Tony Burke, the member for Watson; Duncan Kerr, the member for Denison, who I believe is going to speak on the matter as well; Carmen Lawrence, the member for Fremantle; Tanya Plibersek, the member for Sydney; and Robert MCClelland, the member for Barton. Although not signed by them, I know it was supported by the member for Fraser, Bob MCMullan, and the member for Brisbane, Arch Bevis. This makes up the core of a group of people who have formed the Cross-Party Parliamentary Working Group Against the Death Penalty. The group is co-chaired by Tony Burke, the member for Watson, Senator Gary Humphries and Senator Natasha Stott Despoja. Members include Laurie Ferguson, the member for Reid, and Senator Claire Moore. A number of others have also indicated an interest in being actively involved in this group. We formed this group to voice our opposition to the death penalty. Of course, here in Australia the death penalty no longer exists. But we want to be able to advocate our position in the broader region. We see as our ultimate goal the abolition of the death penalty altogether, irrespective of which country you are in or the crime that has been committed. I would like to read the motion that we wanted to put before the House. It read: That this House: (1) notes that 11 July 2006 marks the 15th anniversary of the entry into force of the United Nations' Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty; I might note, just as an aside, that this came into force on 11 July 1991, 15 years ago, but we still do have many countries around the world-71, in fact-that retain and use the death penalty. The protocol prohibits ratifying countries from executing anyone and prohibits the reintroduction of the death penalty by signatories. The proposed motion went on to say that the House: (2) notes that 57 countries have signed and ratified the Second Optional Protocol, including Australia; (3) notes that, while Australia has ratified the Second Optional Protocol, this Parliament has not yet adopted the Protocol into domestic law; (4) reaffirms its opposition to capital punishment; andmost importantly, I think, for the debate in this House and for us as a group(5) on a bipartisan level, calls for the Australian Government, this Parliament and the Parliaments of the States and Territories to work together to adopt the Second Optional Protocol into domestic law with binding force over the Commonwealth, the States and all the Territories. As I say, we were hoping we would be able to debate this in another form. I am not going to be so bold as to put words into the mouths of other members who will not be able to speak, but that motion was an agreed text between all of us, and I think it is fair to say that very strong views are held amongst this group and more broadly amongst our parliamentary colleagues. It is probably not an issue that people always think about a lot, because we are not confronted with it on a daily basis here in Australia. But, of course, many of us have recently experienced this debate. Only last year an Australian was executed in Singapore and other Australians are charged with offences for which the death penalty applies in a range of neighbouring countries as we speak. If we look beyond Australia's circumstances, the fact that 71 countries still retain and use the death penalty is quite staggering. During 2005 at least 2,148 people were executed in 22 countries and more than double-5,186 people-were sentenced to death in 53 countries. These figures are according to Amnesty International's research. While the total figure for those currently condemned to death and awaiting execution is difficult to access, human rights researcher Mark Warren has estimated the number at between 19,000 and 24,000. This is a very serious problem and not one that can be dealt with adequately in the five minutes that I have to speak tonight. I would like to refer colleagues to a paper that has just recently been released by the Lowy Institute called Capital punishment and Australian foreign policy, which is an interesting perspective on this debate and might be useful in furthering people's understanding of the issue. (Time expired) Death Penalty Cook Electorate: Bundeena",162
363,Mr BAIRD,ADJOURNMENT,"I support the member for Gellibrand in her statement to the House on the death penalty, and I want to say that this is a bipartisan committee. It has been formed within the parliament to express our concern at the widespread use of capital punishment as a deterrent to those who commit significant offences. Despite the circumstances which surrounded the death of Van Nguyen in Singapore, we still experience the problems of the imposition of the death penalty. We have many reminders that the death penalty continues to apply in our neighbourhood. We are faced with constant examples in Indonesia of the death penalty being applied to Australians there who have been accused of various crimes, particularly drug trafficking. In the case of the Bali nine, two of them are facing the death penalty. This is a very important motion. Those of us on the coalition benches who support this motion ask members to consider the implications of the death penalty for our region, to see that we ensure we do not see the re-emergence in any of our states of the death penalty, and to continue to encourage our Asian neighbours to use other forms of punishment. Tonight I want to speak in particular about developments at Bundeena. Bundeena is a unique site in my electorate. It comprises an artists' colony. It is a unique environmental centre-a unique village that has changed very little in the past 50 years. It adjoins a national park and it has a population of 2,000 people. In many ways it is an environmentalist's paradise. It has rock carvings by the Indigenous people who were there and it presents a wonderful vista across Port Hacking. That it adjoins a national park-one of the first national parks declared in Australian history; in fact, it was one of the first in the world-is the reason why we should take great care over the planning requirements that apply in Bundeena. We have had several examples. The first is the Uniting Church site, which was divided into small housing sites despite the objections of local residents. The second is the question of the old corner store. The site was heritage listed, and one night it mysteriously burned down. There is now a proposal to put up a rather unattractive group of houses and home units there. As one of the local councillors said, ‘Instead of saying welcome to one of the unique villages in the Australian community, we have got a building which says Hello Rockdale.' Not that there is anything wrong with Rockdale, but Bundeena is a unique environmental area. We want to see this area preserved and appropriate planning measures applied. I encourage Frank Sartor, as the Minister for Planning in the New South Wales government, to develop a special code that relates to Bundeena, recognising its unique nature. The final point I want to draw to the House's attention tonight is the doctor shortage in Bundeena. Its physical isolation has been a great asset, but it is also the cause of disadvantage. It is short of doctors. I have been in touch with the federal Department of Health and Ageing in relation to this problem. I am very pleased to say that the department has agreed to classify Bundeena and Maianbar as a district of workforce shortage, which means that the Australian government would offer financial incentives to doctors to locate their practices in the and that overseas trained and even overseas based doctors could be recruited to meet the doctor shortage. This is a win for Bundeena. I am really pleased that we have started to address this issue. However, it still leaves Bundeena with 3,000 people to one part-time GP. An acceptable ratio is considered to be 700 people to one full-time doctor. I urge the New South Wales health department to classify Bundeena as an area of need to help relieve the chronic shortage of medical services. It is a unique area, a wonderful site and an environmental paradise; it needs appropriate services. (Time expired) Death Penalty",164
364,Mr KERR,ADJOURNMENT,"I congratulate the member for Gellibrand and the member for Cook for their fine advocacy inside this House, and outside of it, against the utilisation of the death penalty. It was a remarkable act of international statesmanship when the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, was brought into force. It is a unique international instrument because it not only obliges those who become party to it to abolish the death penalty within their own territories but they also each sign up to the obligation to persuade other nations to act consistently with those objectives. In the spirit of bipartisanship, I acknowledge the work that our Minister for Foreign Affairs has undertaken in that regard. He and his predecessors have very strongly advocated against the utilisation of the death penalty in all circumstances. When I say in all circumstances, it behoves us all in this parliament to recognise that this is an extraordinarily difficult and passionate area of debate, and there will be circumstances, such as the Bali bombings, in which intemperate rearea marks of understanding and perhaps even vengeance in relation to the death penalty may be expressed. But, if they are expressed, particularly by our leaders, they are readily seized on by those in other countries who say that we are seeking to oppose the death penalty only when it applies to Australian nationals and that we wish to act in a discriminatory and arbitrary way. That cannot be an effective framework, either for the interests of Australians who may find themselves subject to the potentiality of the death penalty or for the advocacy of its abolition across the board. I will say something very specifically about arrangements that have become more contentious-the exchange of policing information. Some time ago, this parliament passed an act which made it plain that, once a person becomes subject to charge, law enforcement cooperation can only be facilitated under legislation which makes it obligatory not to provide that assistance unless an undertaking is provided by the government of the country in which the person is that, if the person is proceeded against, the death penalty will not be applied or, if it is imposed, it will be the subject of an act of clemency. However, it has become very contentious in the preceding period, and I believe in a most unintended way. I believe I am very competent to speak about the fact that it was unintended, because I was in fact the minister who introduced the mutual assistance legislation imposing the prohibition on the provision of assistance in death penalty cases. What we did provide was that, where pre-arrest information exchange was occurring between police, assistance could be provided irrespective of whether there might be a later charge involving the death penalty. However, that was intended to be facilitative, not mandatory. It was meant to be facilitative because, on advice from the police, we recognised that there may be some, hopefully quite rare, circumstances where the cost to the lives of others and the communities involved may be so much greater if that assistance were not provided. A simple example might be that we have come into information that a bomb is going to be placed on a plane within China. We know that if that information is passed on and an arrest is made the likely outcome will be that the person undertaking that conduct will be subject to the death penalty and shot. But to fail to pass that information on would be completely irresponsible. So it is facilitative that the formation could be passed on. However, surely it cannot be the case, as is being proposed, that in all circumstances common sense flies out the window and we do not exercise judgement regarding circumstances in which assistance will be provided. Take, for example, the circumstances in Iran where a 16-year-old girl has been hanged for the offence of having sex with a person when she was not married. There are many countries which have the death penalty for offences that even the most draconian of lawmakers here would not recognise as appropriate, and for our police to say repeatedly and for our ministers to repeat that they are obliged in all instances to pass on information without any regard to the consequences to those who might be affected by it is simply shutting their eyes to the real consequences of that conduct.

365,Mr TOLLNER,ADJOURNMENT,"Solomon) (7.55 pm)The Darwin Basketball Association has been invited to send its Darwin All Stars team to the prestigious 6th Shell Rimula Brunei Cup international men's basketball tournament that will be held in Darussalam in Brunei this year from Saturday, 19 August to Sunday, 27 August to celebrate the 60th birthday of His Majesty, the Sultan of Brunei. The Darwin team will play five games against other participating teams, such as professional club teams from South Korea and the Philippines, as well as all-star teams from the Kingdom of Jordan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabi and the Philippines. From those results, the top four teams will then go on to play in the semifinals and so on. This is the first time that a team from outside the Asian zone of FIBA, which is the world basketball body, has been invited to the tournament. The Darwin All Stars will be representing not only Darwin and the Northinern Territory but also Australia as a whole. The tournament is principally sponsored by Brunei Shell and is supported by Brunei's Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports. The teams will be competing for a total prize pool of over $30,000 in cash plus many other prizes. The board of the Darwin Basketball Association, led by President John Sealy, has been instrumental in seeking and acquiring opportunities such as this one for the association's senior teams. Other board members who are very deserving of congratulations include Maisie Austin, Ian Charman, Dale Geer, Grant Matthews, Gary Shipway and Errol Thorne. This will be the strongest team ever to represent Darwin in a basketball competition. The team will consist of 12 players, of whom seven are local Darwin products. These players include Michael Maclean-an all-round elite sportsman, who is the captain of the side-Danny Miller, Kevin Roe, Travis Ellis, Matthew Rugendyke, Jacob Fogolyan and Blake Truslove, who is currently in New Zealand playing with the New Zealand Breakers in the National Basketball League. These fellows are the cream of Territory basketball, and they have been training extremely hard over the last couple of months. They are acutely aware that this competition will be tough and that they are carrying the hope and expectation of thousands of Territory basketball fans. The other squad members invited to join the Darwin All Stars include Marcus Ch'ng and Shane Davis, who have both played for Queensland in numerous national championships, and Dallas Jeffries, Cadale Threatt and Toby Zaremba, who have all played in the National Basketball League. The officials travelling with the team include the head coach, Don Sheppard; the team manager, Clint Kononen; the sports trainer, Bernie Devine; and the head of the delegation and Executive Officer of Darwin Basketball Association, the tireless worker Rod MCGRATH. We were lucky to have obtained a coach of the calibre of Don Sheppard. Mr Sheppard has been named national and state ABA Coach of the Year a remarkable seven times over his career. He has also received the Australian Sports Medallion for his services in basketball, presented to him by the Queen's Governor General in 2000. Mr Sheppard has coached the likes of Luc Longley, who won three NBA championships and played alongside Michael Jordan, and also Michelle Timms, who represented Australia in the Olympics for many years. We are excited to have him developing our up-and-coming players. This tournament in Brunei will be an excellent opportunity to promote Darwin, the Northern Territory and, of course, Australia. I would like to pass on my very best wishes to the players and officials and also to congratulate the board of the Darwin Basketball Association for supporting this initiative into South-East Asia. Obviously it is rare for those coming from Darwin to have this opportunity.",166
