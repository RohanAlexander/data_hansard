2,Mr LYONS,UNIFICATION OF RAILWA Y,"Yesterday the honororable member for Franklin (Mr Frost) asked whether the Government of Tasmania had been invited to be represented at the conference which is to consider the unification of railway gauges. I have since verified the impression that I had -*B6 the time that an invitation was not issued in this case. The exclusion of the Government of Tasmania from the conference was not aimed at, but, not being directly concerned in the matter of a uniform gauge on the mainland, it was thought that that Government would not desire representation. Should it wish to be represented, its delegates will be welcome. TARIF F BOARD REPORTS.

SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr LYONS) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next, at 3 p.m. SESSIONS OF PARLIAMENT.",11
3,Mr R GREEN,UNIFICATION OF RAILWA Y,"During the last two or three parliaments the Government has shown a disposition to have only one session of a number of periods, instead of periodical prorogations and new sessions. I ask the Prime Minister to state whether the Government favours reversion to the practice of annual sessions, which was followed for a very lengthy period in the history of Australia, and the rejection of the pernicious practice to which I have referred?",11
4,Mr LYONS,UNIFICATION OF RAILWA Y,"I do not know that the recent practice can be accurately described as "" pernicious"", nor that it has less merit than that followed for a number of generations in Great Britain and Australiat So long as there is business to be done, and the circumstances are such as were associated recently with the consideration of tariff schedules, there is no possibility of avoiding the continuance of a session. If the business can be so arranged that the former practice may be reverted to, the Government will be only too pleased to adopt that course. NA ASSESSMENTS.",11
5,Mr CASEY,FEDERAL INCOME TAX,"Yesterday the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. John Lawson), asked a question in regard to the issue of federal income tax assessments. I should like to supplement the reply that I then made. Further inquiry shows that no federal in come tax assessments have yet been issued, and that none will be sent out prior to Christmas. The assessments referred to by the honourable member were those of the State of New South Wales. NA WHEAT - GROWER S.",11
6,Mr HAWKER,ASSISTANCE TO,"Can the Minister for Commerce state when a decision will be made in regard to the allocation of the £500,000, portion of the £4,000,000 to be made available for assistance to wheat growers, which is to be utilized in the immediate relief of cases of acute distress ?",12
7,Dr EARLE PAGE,ASSISTANCE TO,The intention is that a discussion shall take place between the chairman of the Wheat Commission nnd the State authorities as to the best means of dealing with the matter. Action will be taken to give effect to whatever is decided.,12
8,Mr NOCK,ASSISTANCE TO,"In view of the statement of the Minister for Commerce yesterday, that the wheat-growers relief money will be paid through the States, can the right honourable gentleman say whether the payments will be made directly to the growers, or if paid through the State government departments, whether those who owe money to the States, will be prejudiced?",12
9,Dr EARLE PAGE,ASSISTANCE TO,The intention of the Government is that the money shall be paid directly to the growers. NA WATERS.,12
10,Mr A GREEN,PROTECTION OF NORTHERN,"The Sydney Morning Herald yesterday published a message from Darwi n concerning pearl fishing in the waters of Northern Australia. It readsMr Mark Aitken, a pearler, of Thursday Island, who put into Darwin today, said that the Japanese were increasing their pearling boats operating off the coast of Northern Australia . . . The Japanese on the grounds were operating about sixteen ketches. These were much larger than the Australian boats, which numbered nearly twenty . . . After staying two days the motor vessel left. That refers to a vessel which carried a party of scientists and Japanese government officials, who visited the grounds and made investigations. The message continuesHe heard afterwards that it was a patrol boat frem the Pellew Group of islands, near the Philippines, over which the Japanese exercise a mandate. It was the opinion of pearlers . . . that Japanese vessels had been poaching in Australian waters. The 'Japanese were placing new boats on the grounds every year. I ask the Minister for .the Interior to state what efforts are being made to prevent Japanese boats from entering the creeks of the Northern Territor y and the north-west of Australia?",12
11,Mr WHITE,PROTECTION OF NORTHERN,"This matter concerns partly the Department of Trade and Customs and partly the Department of the Interior. The last Government decided to either build or purchase three patrol* boats, one to operate in Darwi n waters, one near Thursday Island, and one in the Mandated Territor y of New Guinea. The arrangements for their purchase or construction have not yet been completed. The policy of the Government is definitely to investigate any poaching that may be taking place in Australian waters. Mr A . GREEN - Actio n was promised eighteen months ago.",12
12,Mr WHITE,PROTECTION OF NORTHERN,"Q u it e a lot of the reports which come from the north are found, when probed, to be inaccurate. The Department of Trade and Customs seized a boat at Thursday Island last year, and the captain of it was fined. A second boat was seized in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, and the crew were imprisoned. The Government is alive to the difficulties of the situation, and when the patrol boats are available further steps will be taken to minimize the activities of poachers. NA (No. 2) 1934.

13,Mr SCULLIN,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Yarra) [10.41] - As the subject-matter of this bill is cognate to the relief of wheat-growers, I should like to know whether it will be permissible to consider it in. conjunction with the Wheat Growers Relief Bill and the Wheat Bounty Bill.",13

20,Mr LYONS,ASSISTANCE TO MINING,"I quite realise that evil to which the honourable member referred exists. I am afraid, however, that interference with State legislation aud administration in regard to employsum ment would be a difficult matter. A conto ference has been held in the last day two between representatives of the States and the representative of the Commonmit wealth, and a report is to be submitted to the Government. When it is received, consideration will be given to the matter raised by the honourable member. NA TASMANIA.",13
21,Mr FROST,TELEPHON E CABLE TO,"Can the Minister representing the Postmaster-General say whether a contract has been let in connection with the proposed cable telephone service to Tasmania, and, if so, when the work is likely to commence?",13
22,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,TELEPHON E CABLE TO,"A tender has been .accepted for this work, but it is anticipated that some months will elapse before the cable is ready to be laid. It is estimated that about eighteen months will elapse from the signing of the contract before the work 13 completed. I shall obtain the details and supply them to the honourable member, VICTORIAN FLOOD RELIEF.",13
23,Mr FAIRBAIRN,TELEPHON E CABLE TO,"Can the Prime Minister say whether, in addition to the grant by the Commonwealth to assist in the alleviation of distress caused by floods in Victoria, the Government will make money available to help farmers whose crops have been completely destroyed by * the floods, and also whether it will make available relief money to restore the damage done in the Koo-wee-rup district?",13
24,Mr LYONS,TELEPHON E CABLE TO,The matters referred to by the honourable member come more within the jurisdiction of the Government of Victoria than that of the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth has already contributed a substantial sum assist the Government of Victoria in Mr LAzzAitrai - Is it not a national be calamity affecting the Commonwealth?,13
25,Mr LYONS,TELEPHON E CABLE TO,"Because the Commonwealth Government realized that it is a national calamity it agreed to contribute £10,000 to the Government of Victoria. the In addition to making that grant, has the Commonwealth Government is prepared to meet the request of the Premier of Victoria for a substantial to provide immediate employment restore damage done by the flood. Apart or from what the Commonwealth is doing in this national calamity, it will soon subdefinite proposals to Parliament for the assistance of primary producers generally throughout Australia; but it seems to me that the particular cases referred to by the honourable member should be dealt with by the Government of the State. The Commonwealth will do all it can to co-operate with the State government in dealing with the problems caused by the flood.",13
26,Mr FAIRBAIRN,TELEPHON E CABLE TO,"Can the Prime Minister assure the House that, in the event of the Victorian Government proposing to use Commonwealth unemployment relief funds to make advances to farmers in the flooded areas, in order to restore their properties, the Commonwealth Government will give its approval to such use of the money?",14
27,Mr LYONS,TELEPHON E CABLE TO,"I cannot give an undertaking that the Government will approve of such a course; but if the Government of Victoria takes action to re-employ people thrown out of employment for any reason, then this Government will consider the proposal. If the action involves the employment of people who would otherwise be unemployed, whether on the land or in towns, I have no doubt that this Government would support it.

29,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,MINISTERIALVISIT TO NEW,"The Minister for External Affairs (Senator Pearce) was accompanied on his recent visit to New Zealand by Mr F. G. Shedden, one of the secretaries of the Defence Department, and Mr A. E. Leighton, of the munitions section of that department. ROYAL COMMISSION ON PETROL. Prime",14
30,Mr MULCAHY,MINISTERIALVISIT TO NEW,Will the Governto ment take steps to present the report of the royal commission on petrol to the House before the recess?,14
31,Mr LYONS,MINISTERIALVISIT TO NEW,"If possible, the Government will do as the honourable member desires.",14
32,Mr BEASLEY,MINISTERIALVISIT TO NEW,"The chairman of the commission is prolonging the inquiry unduly, which is unfair.",14
33,Mr LYONS,MINISTERIALVISIT TO NEW,"I have no information to that' effect; but on more than one occasion the Government has asked that no time be lost in presenting the report. I give the honourable member the assurance that, if the report is received in time, it will be laid on the table before Parliament goes into recess. NA EXPORTS.",14
34,Mr R GREEN,RESTRICTION OF MEAT,Has the Minister for Commerce any further statement to make regarding the proposed restrictions of meat exports from Australia to the United Kingdom?,14
35,Dr EARLE PAGE,RESTRICTION OF MEAT,"Negotiations are still proceeding with the British Government; but I have no further statement to make at this stage. TARIFF BOARD'S REPORT ON OREGON.  Trade and Customs say whether the Tariff Board has reported on oregon, and, if so, when he intends to table the report? I have received a telegram from South Australia this morning asking when the report will be presented. ZEALAND. Mr WHITE - The Tariff Board's report on oregon has been received and considered by the Government; but, as it affects certain trade treaty negotiations, it has not been tabled. When those negotiations have been finalized, the report will be laid on the table. ANSWERING OF QUESTIONS.",14
36,Mr LAZZARINI,RESTRICTION OF MEAT,"In . reply to a question which I had placed on the notice-paper for Tuesday last, the Minister for the Interior said that the expenditure involved in supplying the information sought was not warranted. Can the Minister say whether the refusal give information in answer to my question was the result of a Cabinet decision, or merely the decision of the Minister? Further, does he consider that a refusal to answer questions concerning the expenditure of public funds is in the best interests of responsible government?",14
37,Mr LYONS,RESTRICTION OF MEAT,"The reply given by the Minister for the Interior, in answer to the previous question of the honourable member, was, in the first place, an expression of his own opinion; but I add that it is my opinion, also. The Government, like all its predecessors, is prepared at all times to give the fullest information within reason to the Parliament and the - country; but there are times when the cost of obtaining the information asked for is greater than is justified. I believe that that is so in this case, and also that no good purpose would be served by supplying the information asked for. REPATRIATION TRIBUNALS.",15
38,Mr LANE,RESTRICTION OF MEAT,"In view of the large number of cases to be dealt with existing repatriation tribunals-the e or four months ago the number was given as between 600 and 800, and returned soldiers having sometimes to wait twelve months for replies-wil l the Minister consider the advisability of creating another set of tribunals, so that one sit in Sydney to deal with Queensland and New South Wales cases and the other in Victoria to deal with cases in all other States?",15
39,Mr HUGHES,RESTRICTION OF MEAT,"My attention * has already been called by the honourable gentleman to the large number of cases awaiting consideration; but I cannot believe that the appointment of another the last month. set of tribunals would clear up the arrears. However, I shall give the matter most careful consideration, and if I see eye to eye with the honourable gentleman I shall consider the advisability of appointing a still further set of tribunals. NA",15
40,Dr MALONEY,BRANDING OF IMPORTED,"I hold in my hand two cheap ink pens, one made in Japan and sold for l d . retail in that country, and for 3d. in Melbourne, but bearing no mark to indicate the country of origin, and the other bearing a brand giving the name of its manufacturer in England. Can the Minister say whether there is in force a regulation providing that imported goods shall be branded with the country of origin, or whether there has recently been some change in the department's requirements in this connection ?",15
41,Mr WHITE,BRANDING OF IMPORTED,"Unde r the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act, the Government can prescribe that all goods imported into Australia shall be marked with the country of origin. The regulations, provide that only those articles that are branded with British words shall indicate the country of origin. One of the articles referred to by the honourable member has nothing to show that it is a pen, and the price at which it is sold suggests that it may not be a pen. If the honourable member thinks that the article to which he has drawn attention should be branded with the country of origin the Government is by the prepared to consider the matter. EXPORT OF STUD SHEEP.",15
42,Mr BEASLEY,BRANDING OF IMPORTED,"Will the Minister for Trade and Customs inform me could whether his department has, during the last month, issued a permit for the shipment of 30 rams and 60 ewes to Japan? the If so, to whom was the permit issued?",15

46,Mr GREGORY,BRANDING OF IMPORTED,"Will the Minister for Trade and Customs inform me GOODS. whether, if the Tariff Board report on the remission of duty on agricultural machinery is received before the Christmas adjournment, an endeavour will be made to lay it on the table of the House ?",15
47,Mr WHITE,BRANDING OF IMPORTED,"That report has just been received by the Government, but has not yet been given consideration. In the circumstances, it cannot be tabled. NA PLANT..",15
48,Mr ROSEVEAR,COCKATOO ISLAND DOCKYARD,"Has the Prime Minister yet reached a decision as to whether he will lay on the table of the House the report of certain officers of Department of the Interior into the condition of the plant at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, or will honourable members still be forced to go to the office of the Commonwealth Shipping Board if they wish to examine it?",16
49,Mr LYONS,COCKATOO ISLAND DOCKYARD,"I have made arrangements for the report to be brought to Canberra. When it arrives, it will be laid on the table of the Library. NA AUSTRALIAN GOODS.",16
50,Mr COLLINS,BRITISHBOYCOTT OF,"-Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a report that men are parading outside Australia House in London carrying placards advocating the boycott of Australian goods? If this is being done, will the Government communicate with the High Commissioner in London with the object of having the practice discontinued in view of the detrimental effect it may have on the interests of Australia?",16
51,Mr LYONS,BRITISHBOYCOTT OF,"I shall make inquiries, but I do not know whether the High Commissioner can exercise any control of the street outside Australia House. PAPER. Tho following paper was presented:Public Service Act-Appointmen t of F. B. Miller, Department of Commerce. NATIONALITYBILL 1934. accept  read a first time. NA PROCESS BILL 1934.",16
52,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [11.7] - I move That the bill bo now read a second The object of this bill is to amend the Service and Execution of Process Act 190.1-1931 to meet a request made by Government of Queensland. The prinacts, cipal act provides, in section 15, for the interstate service of processes on men who have deserted their wives and children and left them without means of support. Serious doubt has arisen, however, whether the provisions of this secthe tion are sufficiently wide to enable the service of processes to be made in cases covered by section 51 of the Queensland State Children Act 1911, which provides that summonses may be issued upon a complaint that a certain person is a near relative of a State child and able to contribute towards the cost of maintaining the child. Upon the return of the summons, the court may inquire whether the defendant is a near relative and able to support the child, and if it is satisfied on these points, it may make a maintenance order against him. It is obviously desirable that the provisions of the Service and Execution of Process Act shall enable the service of processes to be made in such cases. As tie Commonwealth act does not appear precisely to cover them the Government of that State has invited the Commonwealth to amend the law to remove the anomaly, and the Government is quite willing to do so. The bill simply seeks to include in section 15 of the principal act, a reference to the kind of complaint that may be laid under section 51 of the Queensland law, and I invite honourable members to give it their favourable consideration.",16
53,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"What is the definition of a ""near relative""?",16
54,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,That appears in the Queensland act. I am sorry that I cannot give the honourable member the definition off-hand.,16
55,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,Are we simply to what the Queensland Government,16
56,Mr BRENNAN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,This bill deals simply with the service and execution of process.,16
57,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"That is so. We are not seeking to exercise any control over the State Government in the matter. One State may choose to impose heavy obligations upon parents and near relatives, and time. another State may choose to impose lighter obligations upon them. This Parliament is not concerned with the wisdom the or unwisdom of the provisions of State or the standard of obligations they impose. The object of this bill is merely to enable service of the process from one State into another State. Nothing is being done to influence the proceedings under the service, for that is not a monwealth function. The bill is confined to procedure and does not touch jurisdiction.",16
58,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"But it may enable the Queensland court to make an order, by the laws are bad? allowing the process to be issued.",17
59,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"That is so. The object of the measure is to facilitate service of process. It is intended primarily to bring about cheapness and unjust. promptness of service of process, which is a matter of greater importance to people who cannot afford expensive litigation.",17
60,Dr MALONEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,Will the passage of have our support. this measure tend to help ex-nuptial children ?,17
61,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Yes . I point out that if cases of the kind brought under our notice by the Queensland Government do not fall within the provisions of our Service and Execution of Process Act, may he impossible to obtain an order against a man who is properly liable an order, simply 'because he has gone yond the jurisdiction of the State.",17
62,Mr HOLLOWAY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,That is now the case in some respects in connection with our marriage laws.,17
63,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"It is very frequently so. The purpose of this bill, I assure honourable members, is simply to remove doubt as to whether the present provito sions of the Service and Execution ofrespect Process Act apply to cases of the kind brought under notice by the Queensland Government, and to avoid an expensive and cumbersome process which may deenabled feat the object of the people v/ho seek, and are entitled to, redress.",17
64,Mr BRENNAN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Batman) [11.13] If I have understood the Attorneyadministration General (Mr Menzies) clearly, this is merely a machinery measure. The laws of the States differ somewhat in regard to the protection of deserted wives children. Specific reference has been made by the Attorney-General to the Queensland law which imposes certain obligations on the near relatives of child. Such obligations are not, for stance, imposed in similar cases in toria. As the Attorney-General has said, it is not for Us to question either the right or the propriety of any State passing legislation of that kind. Some States Com- have more comprehensive legislation of this nature than other States. The laws have in some instances a far-reaching effect, and in others a limited effect.",17
65,Mr HOLLOWAY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,But what if we think,17
66,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,That is just the point.,17
67,Mr ROSEVEAR,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,I do not see why we the should facilitate the service and execution of process if we think the laws are,17
68,Mr BRENNAN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"I express no opinion on that subject, except to say that probably a law extending the ambit of responsibility of a near relative would",17
69,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,We should kuow what the law is before we do anything to facilitate the administration of it.,17
70,Mr BRENNAN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"That has not been the procedure followed in the past. The practice has been to provide machinery it operative throughout the whole of Australia to give effect, so far as the to machinery of procedure is concerned, to betho statute of any State only so far as it may be relevant to matters to be adjudicated upon and to enable the persons sought to be cited as offenders to be served with the necessary process. We shall land ourselves into all sorts of difficulties if we attempt so to modify the Service and Execution of Process Act as pass judgment upon any State in of any legislation it has enacted. Such a course would create an impossible position. This Commonwealth law has proved very useful indeed. It has offenders to be followed into different States where, prior to federation, it was impossible to follow them. It has proved most useful in the interest of the of justice generally. I have no objection to the bill whatever.",17
71,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"West Sydney) [11.17]. - I approach the consideration of this and bill with no knowledge of the Queensland legislation, but with the feeling that it may be wise for this Parliament to prevent the easy process of some State a law of which it does not approve. The inhonorable member for Fawkner (Mr. VicMaxwell) laughs. I am not considering this subject from the legal view-point, which is merely concerned with the phraseology of a statute, not caring one way or the other whether the law is bad or good. As far as it is within my power to do so, I shall not consent to this Par- I would gladly relieve the people. liament facilitating the application of a bad law of a State-or , indeed, of any law of a State-until I have fully informed myself whether I agree with its provisions. For instance, a government of the character now in office in New South Wales may pass legislation seriously infringing the rights of certain citizens, and may then approach this Parliament with success for an alteration of the existing legal process to enable the application of that law to residents of New South Wales, no matter where they may be found, throughout the Commonwealth. Thus, citizens suffering under the measure who might desire to leave the State in order to escape the incidence of that law and remain absent until it was amended might be pursued by means of Commonwealth legislation. As I was remarking, I approach the consideration of this measure with no knowledge of whether the Queensland law is good or bad. The House ought reasonably to be fully informed on that aspect of the question before it permits the application of that law by any process to any other part of Australia. It should not be greatly influenced by the. claim that this bill seeks to cheapen the process of applying a particular law gassed in Queensland. The observations of the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) in this respect may lead us to feel that those likely to benefit from the operation of this legislation are usually of the poorer classes. Probably the majority likely to be affected are in that category.",17
72,Mr MAXWELL,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,Does the honourable member hold that a citizen of a State should be able to avoid his obligations under a particular law passed in that State?,18
73,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"That would depend, in my opinion, upon the kind of law under which such a citizen sought to avoid his obligations.",18
74,Mr MAXWELL,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"The people of that State itself would, I suggest, be the proper judges as to whether the law was fair or unfair.",18
75,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"I am at liberty to exercise my own judgment in that regard. For instance, there are many laws operating in New South Wales of which I would be entitled to take that course just as much as the honourable member is entitled to defend his point of view on any subject which comes up for discussion in this House. Therefore I hold that I should not be a party in this Parliament to any action designed to facilitate the application of some law which, upon examining it, I might hold to be an unjust law, or one not based on equity or on the best principles by which I think the people should be governed. The Queensland law in this case may, upon examination, be found to be satisfactory. But I have no knowledge of what it is. The point I emphasize is that, by passing this bill without the fullest deliberation, a precedent may be established. State governments will understand that, after passing a certain law, it will be an easy matter to facilitate its application throughout the Commonwealth, merely by asking the Commonwealth Attorney-General to bring down a bill such as has been done in this case. Before providing such facilitation of process, the House must be satisfied that the law under consideration is just and equitable and is one which, in the opinion of a majority of honourable gentlemen 'in this chamber, can justly be applied to all States throughout the Commonwealth.",18
76,Mr NAIRN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Perth) [11.23] - The Queensland law involved in this matter is the State Children Act of 1911. Under that act a near relative of a legitimate child is defined as the "" father, mother, step-father, step-mother, brother, sister and grandparent""; and that of an illegitimate child as "" the mother, and the person admitting himself to be, or adjudged by a competent court to be, the father "". Section 50 of this act provides that a magisterial order of liability to pay or contribute towards the maintenance of a legitimate child can be made against the ""father, mother, step-father or stepmother "" and in the case of an illegitimate against the "" father or mother"". Provision is made for the granting of maintenance orders limited, at the time this act was passed, to 10s. per week. That amount may have been altered since.",18
77,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,A grandparent would be subject to such an order?,19
78,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,No .,19
79,Mr NAIEN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"The act mentions the relatives who may be called upon to contribute towards the support of a neglected child, according to their several abilities and limits them, under section 50, to the father, mother, step-father or step-mother of a legitimate State childthe brother, sister or grandparent is not liable-and to either the father or the mother in the case of an illegitimate child.",19
80,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,But this measure seeks to facilitate the process and application of a law of a State under conditions of which we may not approve.,19
81,Mr NAIEN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"I appreciate the point taken by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) but seeing who are the persons liable for payment under the Queensland law in this case, I think the honourable gentleman might be prepared to support the bill.",19
82,Mr HOLLOWAY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Melbourne Ports) [11.25] - The question raised by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) opens up the problem as to Beasley). what persons are morally bound to assist a neglected child, and whether this provides that such children should supported by people whom we do not agree are morally bound to do so.",19
83,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,That question already been determined by the Queensof land law.,19
84,Mr HOLLOWAY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"But the view of for this question taken in the Queensland may not be acceptable in the parliaclude ments of other States. Many of these said parliaments still hold the view that parents are responsible for the welfare of their children. I do not think honorfacilitate able gentlemen would refrain from helpas ing to facilitate any law which supports that principle. It is generally agreed that near relatives, provided no hardit ship is incurred to themselves, should volunteer to provide for the upkeep a neglected child, but the question arises as to whether we should depart from that principle by facilitating application of a law which provides that certain people should be made responsible for the upkeep of the child for whom they are not really responsible. Thousands of cases might arise in which people would be compelled to contribute towards the upkeep of a child, although they are not justly responsible for the economic position of that child. This Parliament might not want to do that, yet by passing this bill we are making it easier for a State to do so. I do not think any honourable gentleman would be averse to facilitating the operation of a law throughout the Commonwealth which limited the responsibility for the upkeep of children to parents. I can imagine cases arising in which, under a State law, a magistrate could, and would, compel struggling working people to accept responsibility for a neglected child and subscribe to its maintenance, although such an order might impose hardship upon the children of the relatives against whom the order was made. I do not think we should facilitate the r application of a law which would have that effect.",19
85,Mr BOSEVEAB,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Dalley) [11.30] - I agree with the opinion expressed by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn) quoted from the law Queensland act in order to show be that, in some circumstances, grandparents and certain other relatives were uot included among those who might has be compelled to contribute to the support children, but the fact remains that if we pass this bill we are opening the way the enforcement of legislation which law might, in other circumstances, insuch relatives. It has been that it is the duty of this Parliament only not to consider whether good or bad will come of laws passed by States, but to the execution of those laws far as possible whether we agree with them or not. My idea of the functions of the Commonwealth Parliament is that should, as far as is practicable, seek to obtain uniformity in legislation throughof out the whole Commonwealth. If one now State departs radically from accepted standards or principles of legislathe tion, we cannot do anything to prevent it, but there is no obligation on us to facilitate the execution of its legislation. The act, as it stands at present, is very complete, and gives authority for the issuing of summonses to persons charged with child desertion, and certain other specified offences, no matter in what State they may be. The act further provides that15 - (1.) When a summons has been issued, on information upon oath, by any Court Judge or Police, Stipendiary, or Special trate or Justice of the Peace having jurisdiction tion in any State or part of a State of the Commonwealth, commanding any person:(a) who is charged with any offence alleged to have been committed in that State or part, whether offence is indictable or punishable upon summary conviction; or (b) against whom complaint is made, that State or part, of his having deserted his wife or child, or his wife or child without means support, or failed to make adequate provision for the payment of maternity expenses in connection with birth, or expenses in connection with the future maintenance, any infant of which he is the putative father, or of his having obeyed or failed to comply with order made under the provisions any law relating to deserted and children or the protection of infants, to appear and answer the charge or complaint or be dealt with according to law, the mons may bo served on that person in any other State or part of the Commonwealth. That provision covers the generally tion. accepted responsibility of parentage in any State.",19
86,Mr RIOKDAN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,Does the act give power to serve summonses in another State in the case of desertion?,20
87,Mr ROSEVEAR,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,Yes . I do not the think that we should facilitate the execuchild tion of laws with the principles of which we disagree.,20
88,Mr MAXWELL,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Is it not possible that the principle of uniformity can be cartives, ried too far? Is it not better to engrandparents, courage pioneering in legislation by the States?",20

90,Mr MAXWELL,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,Can the honourable member not imagine cases in which relatives other than immediate relatives should be compelled by the community to contribute to the support of children?,20
91,Mr ROSEVEAR,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"That is not for us to decide. What concerns me is that, in this bill, we are asked to facilitate the enforcement of the law of a State or whioh is essentially at variance with the Magisaccepted principles of similar legislain every other State. I . objected or part some time ago, when an amendment to the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act was before the House, to the proposal that children should be responsible the for the upkeep of their grandparents. To be consistent, therefore, I must also oppose any proposal to make the grandin parents responsible for the upkeep of left their grandchildren. I think that honorof able members would be well advised to vote against the bill because, if passed, it the would create an undesirable precedent.",20
92,Mr BLACKBURN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Bourke) [11.40]. of - When I first examined this bill, and disbefore I had heard it debated, it did not an seem to me that there could be any obof jection to it. Now, however, after hearwiveB ing what honourable members have had to say, and after having examined the Queensland act, it seems to me that cirsumcumstances might arise in which it would be most undesirable to give this extraState extension to the Queensland legislaThat legislation raises questions of policy which are novel to me, though the act is a fairly old one. I should have thought that it was highly unreasonable that stepfathers should be compelled to support children, while blood brothers should escape all responsibility. Under Queensland act, a brother can have a declared a ward of the State, and, that having been done, the stepfather and not the brother, becomes liable for its maintenance. In the act certain relaincluding brothers, sisters and ar,e described as near relatives, and authority is given to them to make application for children to be Once a for child had been declared a ward of the is State, an order for its maintenance may be made against its father, mother, stepor stepmother. I should not quarrel with that if it applied only to those relatives of the child who happened to be resident in Queensland; but rny objection is that, if the bill now before us is passed, Queensland might be able to apply its legislation to persons who are not residents of Queensland at all. In my opinion, discussion of this measure should be adjourned, so that we might see just how far it is proposed to extend the authority of the Queensland legislation. It seems to me that there is a possibility, under this legislation, that proceedings might be taken in a Queensland court against a stepfather or other relative resident in another State, and who has never been a member of the Queensland community.",20
93,Mr MAXWELL,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,He must have been a resident when the obligation was incurred. Mr BLACKBURN' - That is not stipulated.,21
94,Mr NAIRN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,The State law would have no applicacion otherwise.,21
95,Mr BLACKBURN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"That is a matter we should look into very carefully before proceeding any further. Section 15 of the present Commonwealth act is free from the danger to which I have referred, because it is made clear that the person against whom the summons is to be issued must have committed the offence or incurred the liability in Queensland. There may be nothing in the point I have raised; but we should give ourselves time to examine the matter thoroughly in order to determine whether there is or not.",21
96,Mr SCULLIN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,'Coul d a Queensland court hold a resident of another State liable?,21
97,Mr BLACKBURN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"This bill is certainly intended to enable proceedings to be served on a person living in another State. If a member of the Queensland community leaves that State in order to evade his obligations under Queensland law, it is right that Queensland law should be able to follow him in the way proposed in this bill; but the question is whether we are not making it possible to apply Queensland law to residents of another State who were never citizens of Queensland. In view of all the circumstances, I trust that the Attorney General will agree to an adjournment of the debate, in order to enable the points raised to be considered.",21
98,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [11.46] - The discussion on this measure exhibits, I submit, a failure on the part of some honourable members to appreciate the true significance of legislation of this nature. The question raised by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) is whether the law in Queensland operates against persons. who are not residents of that State, and how far under the Queensland act of 1911 it would be possible for the Queensland Crown to make an order against some person who was definitely and permanently resident in another State. There are two observations which I should like to make on that point. The first is that when there is State legislation, particularly of this type, it must, prima facie, in accordance with very well-established principles of interpretation, be read as being directed to the citizens of that State. Assuming that to be wrong, and that the Queensland act does in fact address itself to the liabilities of persons not resident in Queensland, my second observation is that anything we do in this Parliament can have no effect upon it. All that we are concerned in doing is to determine whether we shall complete the machinery, put into motion many years ago, of facilitating the service and execution of process between one State and another. If in considering a service and execution of process bill we paused to determine how far we should approve or disapprove of any State law that would be enforced as a result of the process, we should become involved in what might eventually prove to be a hopeless tangle.",21
99,Mr SCULLIN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,We would be setting ourselves up as a high court of appeal.,21
100,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Exactly . One of the powers conferred upon this Parliament is expressly related to this subjectUnder section 51 of the Constitution, paragraph XXIV . , the Commonwealth Parliament is empowered to make laws forThe service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and the judgments of the courts of the States. That power is not - concerned with the problem of the accuracy or inaccuracy of the judgments or disputes in the matter of law. It was given to the Commonwealth Parliament in order that it might deal with an anomaly existing prior to federation, when every State was, in relation to every other State, a foreign country for the purpose of serving processes.",21
101,Mr BLACKBURN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,Not exactly; there was a federal council.,22
102,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Yes , of an extremely tenuous character. In substance each State, in relation to another, was for this purpose a foreign country, with the result that the gravest abuses arose. Persons escaped their obligations, not only under the laws, but also under the processes of the courts, by removing from one State to another. This was particularly so in thecase of persons against whom orders had been made in matrimonial causes. Husbands who had deserted their wives or fathers their children could, regardless of their financial position, avoid their obligations by merely transferring across the border. Provision was, therefore, made in the Federal Constitution that the Commonwealth Parliament should have power to legislate so that the writ should run with perfect ease from one end of Australia to the other-processe s of all kinds, the enforcement of judgments of all kinds. If we refer to the Service and Execution of Process Act we find for example in section 14 that any writ, notice, decree, or other process required to be served on any party or person may be served on such party or person in any other State or part of the Commonwealth. That power, which has existed for years, has been extremely valuable, and yet in the writs which have been served State laws have been invoked which might have been roundly condemned by large sections of this Parliament; but this Parliament has deliberately abstained from inquiring into the wisdom or unwisdom of the law concerned for the good reason that it is its business to attend to its law making, and it is equally its business to respect the right of a State to make its own laws for its own purpose.",22
103,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,But we represent the same people.,22
104,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"We do, but our the powers are quite distinct. The act which I have referred was passed by the Queensland Government, and this amendchildren, ing bill is submitted because of repremaking sentations made by and information carried out."" reoeived from the present Queensland Government, which I should have thought would be scarcely likely to desire somfrthing unduly oppressive. The point I wish to emphasize is that we are not concerned with the legislation passed by any State provided that it is within the competence of a State Parliament to pass such legislation.",22
105,Mr GANDER,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,Then it is wrong for the Federal Government to intervene at all with respect to any State law ?,22
106,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,That point cannot be answered in a word.,22
107,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,I see. The Attorney General realizes the point we are making.,22
108,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"The honourable member who has interjected will see better in a moment. There are many legislative powers jointly or concurrently exercised by the Commonwealth and the States, and where powers are held concurrently it is not only right, but also the duty of this Parliament to intervene when it thinks proper.",22
109,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,It depends upon the interests to be served.,22
110,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"It depends entirely upon the will of this Parliament, and if the expressed will of this Parliament affects one State or another, it does not matter very much. The illustrations raised by honourable members are scarcely to the point. They deal with matters under the concurrent jurisdiction of the Commonwealth and the State parliaments, and therefore, it is within the competence of this Parliament to deal with them.",22
111,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,No .,22
112,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"I bow to the honourable member's superior knowledge. I gather from honourable members' interjections that it is immaterial to them that own the Parliament of a State has sole power to deal with the obligations of parents in respect of their children. That power is not possessed by this Parliament. If any Parliament has to legislate on this subject it must be a State Parliament, and it would be gratuitous on part of this House to say to a State to "" We shall endeavour to control your laws in relation to the maintenance of through the indirect means of it difficult to have those laws",22
113,Mr BRENNAN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,In this particular case we would also be prejudging a decision of the court by preventing a matter coming to a hearing.,23
114,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Precisely . That is the last point with which I wished to deal. When process is issued against a man it is in the first place issued against him because it is thought that some complaint exists against him. Whether that complaint is well founded or ill founded is to be determined by a proper tribunal, and it is most important that the process of determining it should be facilitated, made cheap and prompt. Another class for consideration is'that in which an order has been made, and the liability determined, but the person concerned has slipped across the border. In those circumstances I doubt whether anybody would suggest that it should be made difficult to recapture him and make him face up to his obligations. By passing legislation of this character we do not propose to deal with the liability at all. We do not create the liability, and we do not express any opinion upon it. All that we do is to provide that a valid State law in which the social will of that State is expressed shall, under the general power given to this Parliament by the Constitution, be made effective throughout Australia from the point of view of administration and service.",23
115,Mr SCULLIN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"During the committeo stage, will the Attorney-General undertake to satisfy himself and the House that there is no doubt as to the point raised that a State law may apply to residents of another State.",23
116,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"I do not think that there is anything in the point raised by the honourable member for Bourke, but I suggest that the bill be carried through to the report stage, and meanwhile I shall give the subject further consideration. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Service of summons for complaint in any part of the Commonwealth).",23
117,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Darling Downs) [11.58] - It has been suggested that by passing this bill the application of the State legislation may be extended beyond the confines of the State, but' I remind the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) that the subject must be studied from the view-point of the powers possessed by the States prior to federation. It is clear that the powers of the Commonwealth are limited. By the Constitution certain specific powers are conferred upon the Commonwealth, and speaking generally those powers which the Commonwealth does not possess are still retained by the States. The Commonwealth possesses only those powers which were specifically conferred upon it by the Constitution, but at the same time it was realized that there was a possibility of citizens of certain States avoiding legal obligations by passing from one State to another. It was also realized with closer union that means for service and the execution of process beyond a State should be provided, and with that in view, paragraph 24 of section 51 was inserted in the Constitution. As the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) has clearly pointed out, the object of that paragraph is not to extend the area of the legislation possessed by the different States or their jurisdiction so far as the rights, duties and liabilities of their citizens are concerned. That power of legislating within a State was left entirely to the States. But it was deemed desirable to have a simple and expeditious procedure for the service and execution throughout the ..Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and judgments of the courts of the States. In the present instance the Queensland Government is asking this Parliament to give fuller effect to the paragraph in the Constitution governing it. This provision was inserted to enable the Commonwealth to work in conjunction with the States, but was never intended to confer upon the Commonwealth a power to he exercised by way of supervision in respect of legislation passed by the States. If such a power were exercised by the Commonwealth, this Parliament would have to be continually revising this federal legislation according to the changed circumstances of the time.",23
118,Mr BRENNAN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"And exercising its mind as to what obstacles it could put in the way of the States. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - Yes . In this Parliament we might have continually fluctuating opinions as to the wisdom OT otherwise of State legislation. Yet the suggestion is that the Commonwealth Parliament should use the power it possesses under paragraph 24 as a blocking power, whereas the object of that paragraph is to facilitate the operation of the State legislation. Take the case of a person who has never been a resident of Queensland. It is not intended by this amending bill to extend the application of State legislation over people who have not been subject in any way to that State. If the honourable member for Bourke will look more closely into the bill he will see that no authority is given to extend the jurisdiction of the State. Therefore the position in that respect is perfectly safe. Simply because members may differ from a State law is no reason why they should not approve of the general enabling power in clause 2 of this bill. It does not purport to define uniform legislation for the States. It extends the federal act so that action can be taken against a person of ""whom complaint is made under any law of the State relating to the care and maintenance of children, and such person being a relative of any child to whom that law applies, is liable under that law to pay or contribute towards the present or past maintenance of the child. It is set out in general terms. It could not possibly extend by any implication the meaning OT extent of any particular State legislation. It simply provides that, in - respect of the State laws enacted the procedure for enforcement provided by this act may apply. Honourable members will see that the Queensland act itself is within the legislative sphere of the State. It is well drafted, contains nothing that can be seriously questioned, and, in its operation, does much good. It seeks to enforce the principle that, where relatives are in a position to contribute they should be compelled to do so. The principle involved in this bill is whether it is the duty of this Parliament to provide adequate machinery designed to enforce the legislation of the States as contemplated by the Constitution. This clause is quite a reasonable one, and I commend it to honourable members.",23
119,Mr BLACKBURN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Bourke) [12.5] With regard to much of what has been said I am in complete agreement. I agree that we have no right to prevent any State from enforcing its law against its own subjects, even if those subjects have attempted to evade their liabilities by departing to another State. We have no right to set ourselves as censors of the States. But there is a possibility, if this legislation is passed in its present form, of a Queensland court being enabled to issue a summons against, a person resident in another State, compelling him to attend that Queensland court, aud make an order against him if he should obey that summons and attend the court. The Commonwealth has power to legislate in the matter of maintenance of children in connection with marriage, and it has power to say that the whole of the Commonwealth shall be considered as one unit for this purpose; but it has never attempted to do so. Nevertheless it should assist a State to enforce whatever legislation it has on this subject, upon persons which are its own residents, even though fortuitously, or in an attempt to evade the law, they are then in another State. The point I am endeavouring to make is this: It may be that there are persons not residents of Queensland and who have never been residents of Queensland whom the State of Queensland may attempt to affect by this legislation. Section 15 as it now stands provides that a person shall not have a summons served upon him extra-^State unless he has committed something in the nature of an offence in the State by which the summons is issued. But this provision is much wider and under it a person who has not been a resident of Queensland maybe dealt with. This difficulty might be overcome by inserting the words "" being a resident of a State"". Residence is a permanent connection. I am not suggesting that these are the best words, but I do think that there is considerably more in the point which I have raised than was conceded by the Attorney-General.",24
120,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"West Sydney) [12.10]. - In order that the Committee might determine this question and not permit the bill to reach a stage beyond its control, I intend to move that a new subclause be inserted providing that application of the process shall not a,pply to other than residents of Queensland. Thii amendment is designed to ensure that the methods of process which Parliament proposes to apply shall not affect other than those persons to whom the Queensland law actually applies. It would remove any doubt as to its application, for instance, to the residents of New South Wales, who may be near relatives of the Queensland parties concerned. The point I am making has already been established by the Attorney General (Mr Menzies) that no amendment of the Commonwealth law should be permitted which infringes the principle that certain State laws have particular reference to the people of the State. My amendments makes that clear. The Attorney-General stated that in the usual interpretation of the law the practice is to say "" such and such is the case"", but the honourable gentleman qualified that by saying, "" If there is any doubt, so-and-so is the case."" As to the application of the law, it is a question of the hands into which its interpretation is entrusted. One legal man may give one opinion, another may give quite a different interpretation.",24
121,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,That will apply whatever language we use in our law.,25
122,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"That is so. Apparently it does not matter what we determine in Parliament. It is a question of into whose hands the interpretation of the law is entrusted. One authority may place one construction on the written word of the law and another may give an entirely different interpretation of the same law. In that regard it is very fitting that I should make comment at this stage on the active interference of the Commonwealth with the rights of the States. Much has been said in regard to the interference by the Commonwealth with the rights of the States: that we should not interpose or place obstacles in the application of State laws; that our powers should be confined to matters within our own province. But the determining factor in that regard is the government of the day. For instance, the Constitution of the Upper House of a State legislature has nothing whatever to do with the 'Commonwealth, but one Commonwealth government saw fit to intervene when New South Wales proposed to remove its Legislative Council. The revenue r>f the Commonwealth was used for the purpose of briefing legal opinion abroad to take steps to prevent the abolition of the Council. It all boils down to the fact that is rests on the government of the clay to say that the Commonwealth has certain rights under the Constitution, or to twist and wriggle the meaning of words to suit its own purpose. We therefore reach no finality; the whole problem is a hopeless one. Each authority applies its own interpretation; it all depends on which political party is in power at the moment. The case of the New Soutli Wales Legislative Council maybe cited as evidence of this. The opinions of individuals in this Parliament outside of the Government are held in little regard; but if words meau anything the best we can do is to insert the amendment I have suggested in the hope that they may be interpreted along the lines we desire. J move That the following new sub-aection be added:.""Application of this process shall not apply to any other than residents of Queensland.""",25
123,Mr BRENNAN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,It probably would not apply to anybody if that amendment were agreed to.,25
124,Mr SCULLIN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Yarra) [12.17] - I think that the committee agrees that this Parliament should not act as a high court of appeal on any State legislation. The fact that we allow processes to be served does not indicate that we either approve or disapprove of the legislation of a particular State. I sympathize to a great extent with some of the protests made by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), who spoke of the Commonwealth interference witli regard to State affairs; yet that does not warrant us in further interfering in other directions. There is always a Nemesis when we go beyond our own authority. I favour one sovereign authority, and I believe that it should be vested in the Commonwealth; but, while we have a federation, we must respect the sovereign rights of every State, and the rights of each to pass its own laws. We are bound to facilitate the processes of the laws of the States. I suggest to the honourable member for West Sydney that the word "" resident "" is capable of so many interpretations that it may destroy the whole process of the law. A father might desert his wife and children, and cross the border to another State. ""Within a month he could become enrolled there, and surely he would then be a resident of that State. If an offence has been committed in a tain State, the law of that State should apply; but it should not be made applicable to an offence committed elsewhere. I do not believe that any State law could be applied to a resident of another State, if the offence had been committed in another State.",25
125,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,The Privy Council upholds the right honourable gentleman in that view.,26
126,Mr SCULLIN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,I am glad to be in such good company. I cannot support the amendment because it would enable a husband to leave his wife and family to starve by becoming a resident of another State. Mr BLACKBUBN:- I urge the honourable member for West Sydney to accept the suggestion of the Attorney-General.,26
127,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"West Sydney) [12.20] - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) has twisted my meaning, and I think he knows he has done so.",26
128,Mr SCULLIN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,- I ask that that remark be withdrawn. I have not knowingly twisted any remark.,26
129,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"The right honourable gentleman has misrepresented my remarks to an unreasonable extent. The trend of the discussion has shown that the laws of a State should not be applicable to persons other than residents of that State. I emphasized the point by quoting a declaration by the Attorney-General himself on this matter. He went on to say that, according to the interpretation of the law by those empowered to interpret it, the statutes of a State apply only to the residents of that State. My amendment is in conformity with that principle. I have no desire to enable a father to evade his responsibilities to his family. The Leader of the Opposition said that, by crossing over the borders of a State a man could escape from family responsibilities by becoming a resident of another State, and he added that my amendment would enable him to evade his obligations. That was the only logical inference to be drawn from his remarks.",26
130,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"The right honourable gentleman said that the language o' the amendment would have that resuli, and that is so.",26
131,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,That is a matter of cer- opinion. The Leader of the Opposition should not have made it appear that that was the purpose of my amendment.,26
132,Mr SCULLIN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"I did not attempt to do anything of the kind, nor was such a thought in my mind.",26
133,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"I noticed indications from the other side of the chamber of approval of the right honourable gentleman's argument, and the implication seemed to be that I was trying to make it possible for people to evade their family responsibilities. Surely we are not here merely to juggle with words. If the objept of any member of the committee is misrepresented when he seeks an improvement in the law, a most unfair advantage of him will be taken. A private member is at a distinct disadvantage in dealing with a bill of this nature. The measure was not placed in our hands until the Attorney-General rose to speak upon it.",26
134,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,I was informed that a copy of the bill had been placed in the mail-box of every honourable member.,26
135,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"That is not so. We have had no opportunity to compare the Queensland act with the present proposal. I do not profess to have an intimate knowledge of law, and so other members, legally trained, could possibly pick holes in amendments submitted by me, on the ground of imperfect drafting.",26
136,Mr MAXWELL,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,Is that not a good reason why the suggestion of the Attorney-General to postpone the consideration of the measure should be accepted ?,26
137,Mr BEASLEY,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"The Minister's proposal was to confer with the Opposition, but not with the members of my party. We have no opportunity to deal effectively with this measure in the other branch of the legislature, and, therefore, we have to take every advantage of our representation in this chamber to safeguard the interests of those who send us here. It will be of no use to complain after we have agreed to certain legislation that something has happened of which we do not approve. So we have taken the only course open to us, and have expressed our views to the best of our ability. Our amendment may not be framed in the most correct legal language; but we have tried to make our meaning reasonably clear by our supplementary remarks. I claim that I clearly showed that the object of my amendment is not to enable a person to evade his legal obligations by becoming a resident of another State.",26
138,Mr SCULLIN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"I rise to a personal explanation. The honourable member for West Sydney stated that I had deliberately misrepresented the purpose of his amendment, and had been unfair to him. I had no intention to do anything of that kind, nor did I do it. I merely pointed out to the honourable member, and to the committee, that his amendment was so phrased that it would have the effect of enabling a person t& escape his obligations by becoming a resident of another State. I did not suggest for a moment that the honourable member desired to make that evasion possible.",27
139,Mr ROSEVEAR,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Did not the honourable gentleman say that the carrying of the amendment would be in bad taste, or use words to that effect?",27
140,Mr SCULLIN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"No ; I did not even imply that. I said that, in framing an amendment, we had to be careful not to stultify the whole of the legislation. I suggested that we should accept the suggestion of the Attorney-General for the adjournment of the debate at a certain stage, so that, if an amendment were found necessary, it could be inserted after due consideration. I pointed out that, if we accepted the honourable member's amendment, the effect would be to nullify the State law, because a person affected by it might become a resident of another State, and the effect would to defeat the object of the legislation for the protection of wives and children. I did not think for one moment that that was the honourable member's intention, nor did one word of mine imply such an accusation.",27
141,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Darling Downs) [12.27] - I advise the honorsatisfy us. able member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) to accept the Attorney-General's (Mr Ttfenzies) suggestion. The point raised by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn), was that he was afraid that this measure, read in conjunction with the Queensland law, might have the effect of imposing obligations on persons not subject to the State legislation, and he asked the Attorney-General to look into that matter. I think the honourable member for West Sydney is labouring under a misunderstanding. Nobody has suggested that he desires the law to be amended to enable persons to escape their liabilities. The object is merely to secure the operation of the law upon those to whom the State law properly applies. That, in fact, is exactly what the honourable member for Bourke desires.",27
142,Mr ROSEVEAR,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"Does the honourable member say that the State law. could not be applied to residents of another State? Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - My own view is that the Queensland act does not apply to persons other than those under its legislative jurisdiction. A case has occurred where the question right was raised as to the application of legislation to persons outside such jurisdiction. The Attorney-General, however, has promised to look into this matter to see whether a further definition is necessary, and then to make an announcement to the House, so that, if honourable members are not satisfied, it will be possible for them to take further action. I think that the honourable member *for West Sydney should ,be prepared to accept that offer.",27

I suggested, however, that we should take the bill up to the report stage, so that, if, ultimately, I made an announcement with which the House desired to disagree, it would have an opportunity to recommit the bill in order to make such alteration as it thought fit. I do not propose to leave this matter to be dealt with by another place. It will be dealt with effectively in this House.",27

Debate resumed from the Sth December (vide pag£ 8543} on motion by Mr. CASEYThat the bill be now read a second time.",28
149,Mr BLACKBURN,SALES TAX PROCEDURE BILL,"Bourke) [12.35]. - This bill attempts to consolidate the procedure provisions of the nine sales tax acts. I say "" attempts"", because, curiously enough, it does not propose that the procedure sections of those acts shall be repealed. Apparently it is intended that they shall continue, but that at the same time there shall be a general form of procedure, which may be used with reference to any of the acts. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) told us that this measure was introduced as a result of certain doubts raised in a case pending in the High Court as to whether it was not the duty of an informant in a prosecution under any of these acts to name the act which he alleged to have been infringed. Because of that doubt, the honourable gentleman, taking time by the forelock, has introduced in this bill a clause which says that the Commissioner may, at his option, either demand a return under all acts, or a return under any separate act he pleases to name. The Assistant Treasurer says that this measure is in aid of the taxpayers. From that point of view, it seems to me that it is not, since a taxpayer has first of all to make a general return under all the acts, and! then may he called upon to make a return under one special act. That means that the taxpayer is not to be freed, as he ought to be, from the burden of keeping separate books in respect of all the acts. be The best course to follow would be to make a general provision that he shall be called upon to furnish one return, and shall not be called upon to furnish returns under separate acts. Under this bill as it stands, the taxpayer will still have to keep several sets of books; he might have to keep as many as nine. It is also clear that the procedure clauses of the nine acts are to remain in force. It will be possible for the Commissioner to elect whether he will proceed under one of the existing acts, or whether he will proceed under the new consolidated procedure laid down by this measure. That is not desirable. The hill should substitute a new form of procedure for the old one. It should also repeal the clauses that relate to returns and penalties under the nine several assessment acts. For some reason or other that is not done. There are, however, directions in which the bill does benefit the taxpayer. For instance, if we compare clause 11 of this bill with sections 48 and 49 of the corresponding No. 1 act we shall see that the burden of the penalty is by this bill lightened considerably. Formerly, I think it was possible to collect a triple penalty for any infringement. It is now proposed that such shall be done only where the maximum penalty has to be applied. In that respect the bill will benefit the taxpayer, and, subject to what I have said and to what I want to say, it seems to me to be unobjectionable. But I should like the Government to consider the advisability of making a clean sweep of the return and procedure provisions of the nine assessment acts, and to substitute this consolidated form for them. I should like it also to consider the desirability of dispensing with the power to require a return to be made under any of the old acts. If that be done, the taxpayer will have only one act to look at; he will kuow exactly his obligations and will have only one set of books to keep. Another point, which is really a matter for the committee, is that, under the original Sales Tax Assessment Act, it was provided that a person who was proceeded against under section 45 for making or delivering a return false in any particular, or making any false answer, whether verbally or in writing, might plead in defence that he had done so i'gnorantly or inadvertently. The burden of showing that it was done wilfully did not rest with the prosecution, but the defendant was permitted by the old legislation to defend himself by showing that, although he had made a false return, he had done so ignorantly or inadvertently. That particular provision was repealed by this Parliament during the present year. On looking through the debates I find, however, that the attention of the House was not directed to the fact that that change was being made. In this House the repeal bill was passed through all stages rather summarily. The Minister gave honourable members a memorandum on the subject in his explanatory speech, but did not draw attention to the fact that the amendment would take away from the taxpayer the right, to plead that the false statement rmade by him had been made ignorantly or inadvertently. In my opinion that provision should be re-inserted. I have shown the Assistant Treasurer an amendment that will be moved in committee to reinstate the old provision of the assessment act in that regard. Every one should agree that a man who has made a false statement, ignorantly or inadvertently, should be permitted to give evidence of that fact, and that if he can successfully prove it, he should not be convicted of an offence. Even'if this provision be restored, there will still be a penalty upon the defendant, because, under section 46 of the principal act, to which clause 8 of .this bill corresponds, a man is liable, if he has made a false statement, to pay double the tax. He has first of all to pay the tax, then he has to pay double the amount by which he has defrauded the department, with a maximum of £1. I regard that is a perfectly adequate punishment for making an inadvertent or ignorant statement, and I do not wish to modify it in any way. I do not suggest that in such a case the defence of ignorance or inadvertence should apply; but I do not think that a man who has made a false statement, ignorantly or inadvertently, should have a conviction recorded against him.",28

151,Mr BLACKBURN,SALES TAX PROCEDURE BILL,"It all depends upon the meaning of the word, "" false "". Apparently, he can be convicted; but I do not think the Commissioner would prosecute a man who had injured himself by a mistake.",29

154,Unknown,SALES TAX PROCEDURE BILL,Sitting suspended from 1245 to 2.15 p.m.,29
155,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX PROCEDURE BILL,"Corio-Assistant Treasurer) [2.15] - The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) raised a number of points which I might be allowed to deal with at this stage. Perhaps I can satisfy the honourable member by amplifying somewhat the remarks which I made when moving the second reading. There are two main subdivisions of taxpayers under our sales tax legislation. The basic principle of the law is that persons shall pay sales tax on the sale price of goods. Generally speaking, sales tax transactions of this nature are dealt with in Sales Tax Acts Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7, so clearly there is no logical reason for asking taxpayers to dissect transactions made under any of these five acts. There is another class of transaction: that under which a person buys or makes goods and applies them to his own use: this class is dealt with on a different basis. In this case the tax is paid not on the sale price of the goods, because usually there is no sale price, but on various bases according to the origin of the goods. Where, however, sales tax on transactions of this kind is collected under acts Nos. 4 and 8, it is payable on the same basis, viz., the purchase price of the goods. Clearly again in respect of this class of goods there is no reason, from the point of view of the department, why the taxpayers should be 'required to dissect the transactions. But when a taxpayer is required to pay sales tax under any one or more of acts Nos. 1, 2, .3, 6 or 7, and also under acts Nos. 4 and 8,. in respect of which the tax is based on different calculations of value, it has in the past been necessary to dissect the transactions, and it will still be necessary in the future in order to make it clear to the department whether he is paying tax under any of acts Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7, or under acts Nos. 4 or 8. I offer this explanation because there appears to be some misapprehension in the minds of honourable members concerning the points raised by the honourable member for Bourke. The honourable gentleman also pointed out, and rightly so, that this bill seeks to reduce the minimum penalty for tax evasions. Under the principal act it is possible for the department to secure for gross cases of evasion, a minimum penalty of £50, and a maximum penalty of £500, plus three times the amount of tax evaded. This bill fixes the minimum penalty at £50, plus the amount of tax evaded, and the maximum penalty at £500, plus three times the amount of tax evaded. Thus there has been a lightening of the penalty for offences committed under these acts. The honourable member for Bourke also criticized the inclusion in this bill of sub-paragraph b of clause 6, under which the Commissioner may, by notice in writing, call upon any person to furnish to himA return - which shall be a return under, subject to the provisions of, and in the form prescribed under, any Sales Tax Assessment Act. The honourable gentleman went on to say that as we propose to take what may be regarded as overriding powers in this umbrella-like machinery bill, it should not be necessary for the Commissioner to retain his powers in this respect under the individual Sales Tax Assessment Acts. I may explain that the Commissioner would only take advantage of the Mr Casey. provision in paragraph 6 of elause 6 in cases where taxpayers failed to furnish returns or where they furnished returns which were incomplete-in other words, default returns. In these cases it would be necessary for the Commissioner to require such separate returns before he could issue default assessments under the various acts affected. I give the honourable member for Bourke and the House generally an assurance that this provision in the bill will be invoked only in cases of default returns. We have been advised by a most competent authority that it is necessary to retain this power. The honqrable member intimated that when the bill was in committee he would propose to re-insert in the act the provision repealed in an amending measure passed last session, enacting that it would be a good defence if the taxpayer pleaded ignorance of the law or that the offence was committed inadvertently.",29
156,Mr BLACKBURN,SALES TAX PROCEDURE BILL,He would have to prove that the offence was due to inadvertence or ignorance of the law.,30
157,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX PROCEDURE BILL,"That provision was removed from the act because of the opportunity which it gave to dishonest taxpayers to evade the law. In one case, a taxpayer claimed that his return had - been furnished by his agent, and that he had had no personal knowledge of the business. When his claim was investigated, it became evident that there had been, over a number of years, gross and persistent under-statement of sales by the taxpayer in question. I believe it was established that had he given the slightest attention to his business, it would have been clear to him that his agent was acting against the law, and that in consequence the revenue was being defrauded. It was clear from that and other cases which came under the notice of the department that the provision enabling taxpayers to plead ignorance or inadvertence was being grossly abused by some taxpayers, and it was thought to be in the interests of the revenue and of those taxpayers who furnished accurate returns and paid sales tax, that it should be expunged from the act. If the honourable member seeks further information on this point, I shall be pleased to furnish it to him when the bill is in committee.",30
158,Mr BLAOKBUBN,SALES TAX PROCEDURE BILL,"Will , the Minister consider the propriety of superseding the procedural provisions of the individual assessments acts?",31
159,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX PROCEDURE BILL,".We have been advised by a most competent authority, who assisted in drafting the original sales tax legislation, that it would be unwise to repeal the machinery provisions enshrined in the individual acts. The machinery provisions of this bill will be paramount whenever they are invoked by the department, but it will still be possible for the department to invoke the machinery of each individual act if considered necessary. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and committed pro forma. In committee: NA BILL 1934. SECOND BEADING.",31
160,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"Corio-Assistant Treasurer) [2.30] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. It has fallen to my lot to handle this measure, which seeks to make a small amendment to the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1923-30. In an attempt to assist honourable members, I have caused to be circulated a memorandum which shows more clearly than does the bill itself the alterations proposed to be made in the act. The bill applies only to the Commonwealth sinking fund, and in no way to either State sinking funds or the financial agreement. Sinking fund contributions are designed to liquidate the postal debt in 30 years, and other debts in 50 years, and are respectively at the rate of 30s. per cent, and 10s. per cent. Payments into the sinking fund are made annually, and are used to purchase securities in the market and to redeem debt. Such securities as are acquired in that way are immediately cancelled, and the Government effects a saving of the interest on the debt so wiped out. Under the existing law, in order to preserve the compound interest basis of the sinking fund, in effect, an amount of 5 per cent, per annum is paid into the sinking fund in respect of debt so wiped out. Under that arrangement the debt is wiped out in 30 years and 50 years respectively. These provisions are contained in section 9AA of the principal act. The bill is designed to correct an anomaly in the provision which relates to the 5 per cent, contribution. The gross contributions to the fund include the 30s. per cent, and 10s. per cent, respectively in respect of all live debt. Other contributions consist of capital repayments of other debt, such as, in particular, the war service homes debt. The 1930 act was drawn to allow of the .deduction of these capital repayments from the gross annual sinking fund receipts. It is on the difference between those two that the 5 per cent, compound interest is paid each year into the sinking fund. Section 9AA / of the act contains a fault. It readsThe amount of Fivo pounds per centum on the total amount received by the fund on and after the first day of July One thousand nine hundrod and thirty and up to the thirtieth day of June next preceding that financial year in which payment is being made in accordance with this section less amounts paid into the fund in that financial year . . . The principal alteration that this bill seeks to effect is to replace the words "" in that financial year "" with the words, "" during that period"", because, under that provision, as honourable members will see, the fund at any one point of time would be credited with 5 per cent. of the gross receipts after deducting the repayments of capital debt in any one year. In other words, the act as drawn limits deductions in any one financial year, to the repayments in that year. Under a strict interpretation of the law, we should now be paying into the sinking fund a greater amount than Parliament clearly intended should be contributed in any ono financial year. The repayments of which I speak are cumulative. Strictly, we should deduct only the repayments made in any one financial year. Clearly, however, we should be able to deduct all the repayments since the law was amended in 1930. Mr SbuxijDf - Has the practical effect of the proposed alteration been worked out?",31
161,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"The gross receipts of the sinking fund from the 1st July, 1930, to the 30th Juue, 1933, were £10,131,517. Deducting the repayments during that period-£1,556,715-the total becomes £8,574,S02. Were the law strictly interpreted, we could deduct only the repayments made in the financial year with which we were dealing. That would be considerably less than the sum which the law clearly intends that we should deduct. I may say that the law has been implemented by the National Debt Sinking Fund Commission in the way clearly intended by Parliament. The object of the bill is to legalize its actions since 1930, and to put the matter right for the future.",32
162,Mr LAZZARINI,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"Werriwa) [2.40] The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) says that the purpose of the sinking fund is to wipe out the postal de'bt in 30 years and all other debts in 50 years. I ask the honourable gentleman if he seriously believes that the sinking fund will wipe out those debts. The Minister for Commerce (Dr Earle Page), when Treasurer in the Bruce-Page Government, claimed to have invented the sinking fund, which, he said, would do great things; but history tells us that Pitt started a sinking fund to wipe out the debts incurred in connection with the Napoleonic wars, and that, although in a few years between £10,000,000 and £15,000,000 had been wiped off those debts, in the same period £150,000,000 had been added to the national debt. It is claimed by some persons that between £28,000,000 and £30,000,000 of Australia's war debt, bearing interest at 4^ per cent., has been wiped off; hut it is not always pointed out that during the same period our national debt has increased £98,000,000 at varying rates of interest up to 6 per cent. I am not greatly concerned about any proposals which are introduced to deal with the national debt, because that debt can never bo wiped out. It is not intended that it should be. The Auditor-General shows the utter impossibility of wiping out the national debt, for in his report for the year ended the 30th June, 1933, he pointed out that the total volume of taxation for the States; and the Commonwealth was £82,000,000,. and that interest and sinking fund charges represented £63,000,000. The task of wiping out, by means of a sinking f und,. a national debt so great as that, is as hopeless as that of a dog trying to eat itself up. It is simply begging th« question, to say that we can wipe out the nationaldebt by means of a sinking fund. Instead of hypnotising ourselvesinto the belief that the impossible can be achieved, let us face the facts honestly; in which case we shall realise that, without a complete remodelling of the financial system,, sinking funds are useless.",32
163,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,The honourable member is going beyond the scope of thisamending bill.,32
164,Mr LAZZARINI,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,The measure before us proposes to amend legislation designed to wipe out the postal debt in 30* years and all other debts in 50 years.,32

167,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,The honourable member would be in order in referringto the principal act so far as may benecessary to discuss the amending bill.,32
168,Mr LAZZARINI,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"That was my intention. The bill before us proposes to dosomething which, in my opinion, is impossible. Notwithstanding the claim of the Assistant Treasurer that the sinking, fund has cancelled some of our debts, the fact remains that the national debt is= increasing. I should be glad to believe that this .bill will do what is claimed for it by the Assistant Treasurer, but I cannot believe that it will. On the contrary I am firmly convinced that, under theby present system offinance,'no sinking fund will ever wipe off the national debt. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

169,Mr CURTIN,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"Fremantle) [2.48] Will the Assistant Treasurer take into consideration the advisability of amending the financial agreement in relation - to the sinking fund, in view of the proposals now being considered to fund treasury-bills? That really means that, to the - extent that the bills are funded, the sinking fund obligation will become an increased burden on the States, unless it is .arranged that there shall be a reduction of the sinking fund rate on that part of the - debt which has 'to do with States. I take it that that point has not been overlooked.",32
170,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"The Government is aware - of the position. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. NATIONALITYBILL 1934. SECOND READING.  - for the Interior) [2.50] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. ""The object of this bill is to give effect to Articles S, 9 and 10 of the Convention on certain questions relating to the con'flict of nationality laws, which was concluded at The Hague in 1930. Those articles read as follows:Article 8 - If the national law of the - causes her to lose her nationality on marriage with a foreigner, this consequence shall be - conditional on her acquiring the nationality the husband. Article 9 - If the 7iational law of the wife causes her to lose her nationality upon a - change in the nationality of her husband occurring during marriage, this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring Tiand's new nationality. Article 10 - Nationalizatio n of the husband during marriage shall not involve a change in the nationality of the wife except with her consent. Everyone must agree that it is very - desirable that steps should be taken to remove the serious difficulty which arises when a British woman - becomes stateless by reason of her marriage. The Commonwealth nationality law is based on the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914. All the self-governing British dominions have adopted Part II . of that act with a view to the carrying out of a uniform system of naturalization throughout the Empire, and the defining of who are British subjects. It is obviously desirable that such uniformity should be maintained. The general principle which underlies the British law is that the wife of a British subject shall be deemed to be a British subject, and the wife of an alien shall be deemed to be au alien. The Commonwealth law, however, in common with the general British law, already provides that where a man, during the continuance of his marriage, ceases to be a British subject, by becoming naturalized in a foreign State, his wife may retain her British nationality by making a declaration that she desires to do so. It also provides that the Governor General may grant a certificate of naturalization to a British-born woman married to an alien who is the subject of a State which is at war with His Majesty. There is at present, however, no provision in the Commonwealth law by which a Britishborn woman, who becomes stateless on her marriage with an alien, may retain or regain her British nationality whilst her husband is still living, except under the special circumstances just mentioned. The foreign law which has affected British women to the greatest extent in rendering them stateless on marriage, is that of the United States of America. Since 1922, a woman who marries an American citizen does not thereby acquire wife her husband's nationality unless she becomes naturalized on her own account after at least twelve months' residence in of the United States. As she lost her British nationality by reason of her marriage, this meant that she had no nationality. Thousands of British woman, including many Australians, have become stateless her hus- through marrying American citizens. The position was regarded so seriously by Canada, which was naturally the British dominion most affected, that it lost no time in passing legislation to give effect to the Hague Convention. The Canadian bill became law in 1931. The British Parliament passed the necessary amending aet last year, and New Zealand is now following suit. It is very desirable that the Commonwealth should lose no further time in fulfilling its obligations and doing its part to restore uniformity in the nationality laws throughout the Empire. Anomalous situations are arising on account of the lack of uniformity. Eor example, wives of American citizens are arriving in Australia from time to time in possession of British passports in which they are described as British subjects, under the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1933. An Australian-born wife of an American citizen would be entitled abroad to claim the rights of a British subject, but in this country she must still be regarded as an alien. This anomaly should he remedied as soon as possible. Strong representations have been made by women's organizations in Australia and elsewhere that the Hague Convention should not be ratified until it has been revised to embody the principle of the equality of the sexes. These submissions have received the careful and sympathetic consideration of the Government from time to time, with the result that before the matter came up for reconsideration at the League of Nations Assembly in 1932, the British Government and the League of Nations were advised in the following terms:Australian Government is prepared to accept principle that a woman on marriage shall not lose her nationality or acquire new nationality without her consent and to amend nationality law accordingly, provided His Majesty's Governments in United Kingdom and British self governing dominions are agreeable to take similar action so that uniformity of nationality laws throughout the Empire may be preserved, euch uniformity being of importance in the interests of the system of Imperial naturalization now in force The Government still subscribes to the views expressed in that message, and the Prime Minister will raise the matter at the Imperial conference next year. Requests have been received during the last year that the Commonwealth Parliament should take a lead in passing legislation embodying the wider principle, and the subject has been given very earnest consideration by the Government, but it has been strongly felt that nationality, insofar as British subjects are concerned, is a matter which should be dealt with on an Empire basis, and that any attempt on the part of the Commonwealth to get out of step with the rest of the Empire would only lead to confusion. It may, however, be emphatically stated that this bill is not an alternative to the demands made by the women's organizations, but is designed to remove a real hardship experienced by many women, and to go so far as we can go in step with Great Britain and Canada. It does not close the door further consideration of the principle of naturalization?  equality and to the acceptance of the women's demands when a more general agreement on them can be reached by the various governments of the Empire. The bill provides for the substitution of a new section for section IS of the principal act. The proposed new subsection 1 repeats the existing provision that the wife of a British subject shall be deemed to be a British subject and the wife of an alien shall be deemed to be an alien. Proposed new sub-sections 4 and 6 re-enact the existing exceptions to the general principle, and proposed new sub-sections 2, 3 and 5 add new exceptions. Proposed new sub-section 2 deals with a British woman who marries a foreigner but does not thereby acquire his nationality. It provides that whether she was married before or after the enactment of this provision she shall retain her British nationality. Proposed new sub-section 3 makes a similar provision for a. British woman, who, having married a British subject, is liable to become stateless when her husband has become naturalized in some other country. Proposed new sub-section 4 also applies to a British woman whose husband changes his nationality after marriage; but as a result of the provisions of proposed new sub-section 3, this provision will in future apply only in cases where, under the law of the foreign country, the woman acquires her husband's new nationality. Pjroposed new sub-section 5 is intended to give effect to article 10 of the convention, which provides that naturalization of the husband during marriage shall not involve a change in the nationality of the wife except with her consent. Proposed new sub-sections 3 and 4 deal with this provision insofar as British women are concerned, hut proposed new sub-section 5 applies to an alien woman whose husband acquires British nationality by the grant to him of a certificate of naturalization. After March next, such a woman will be afforded an opportunity to declare whether she too desires to acquire British nationality.",33
171,Mr LAZZARINI,NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND,"Will she also have to to go through the whole process of  let me repeat that the passing of this bill will not place any obstacle in the way of the future consideration of the principle of sex equality. ""Whether we believe in that principle or in the principle that the nationality of the wife shall followthat of the husband, we are not committed by acceptance of the provisions of this The passage of this measure will remove a hardship and avoid the confusion that is resulting from the fact that Canada and the United Kingdom have already passed legislation containing similar provisions in the belief that Australia and the other self-governing dominions would follow suit.

SECOND READING.  for the Interior) [3.1] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. Under the Seat of Government - (Administration) Act 1924-1929, under which the Federal Capital Commission was constituted, certain lands contiguous to the Federal Capital Territory were vested in the commission. In addition, certain lands outside the Territory, which had been acquired under the Lands Acquisition Act, were transferred by the Commonwealth to the commission. In 1930 the commission ceased to exist, and by section 7 of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1930 .all lands which were vested in the commission became vested in the Commonwealth. So far as lands in the Territory were concerned, they could then be disposed of by lease or otherwise in accordance with laws of the Territory. ""With respect to such lands which are outside the Territory, there was not, however, any provision for leasing or otherwise disposing of them. Section 63 of the Lands Acquisition Act provides that lands which are acquired or deemed to be acquired under that act may be disposed of if not required for Commonwealth purposes. There is no reason why the lands to which the bill relates should not be subject to disposal in the same manner as lands acquired under the Lands Acquisition Act. All such lands, in fact, were acquired under that act, but by reason of the Seat of Government (Administration) Acts 1924-1929 and .1930, bill. they have ceased legally to have that characteristic. The object of this bill is, therefore, to bring these lands once more under the provisions of section 63 of the LandsAcquisition Act. Debate (on motion by Mr BEENNAN) adjourned. NA (No. 2) 1934.

172,Mr CASEY,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Corio-Assistant Treasurer) [3.4] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The Royal Commission on the Wheat, Flour and Bread Industries has presented its first report and a supplementary report, and these have been laid on the table of the House. As was stated by the Minister for Commerce (Dr Earle Page), in his second-reading speech on the Wheat Growers Relief Bill (No. 2) 1934, the commission has drawn attention to the serious financial position of wheat-growers, and has recommended that the Commonwealth Government shall provide assistance to the amount of £4,000,000 for distribution to wheat growers who have sown wheat for grain during 1934, this assistance to be provided partly by an excise duty or sales tax on flour and partly from other Commonwealth moneys. This measure is to give effect to the royal commission's recommendation regarding the imposition of a tax on flour, and it provides the machinery for collecting the tax on imported and Australian-made flour, and on flour used in the manufacture of imported goods, such as biscuits, macaroni, &c. The bill is practically the same as the previous flour tax act which operated from the 4th December. 1933, to the 31st May last, with certain minor alterations, which experience of the previous act has shown, to be desirable. The tax will be imposed by three separate taxing acts, which will be submitted later to Parliament, and will provide for a rate of £2 12s. 6d. a short ton of 2,000 lb. of flour. Provision has been made in this act for the tax to be imposed for a period of twelve months only, commencing on Monday, the 7th January, 1935. The tax may be described, firstly, as an excise duty payable by millers on all sales by them on or after the 7th January, 1935, on all deliveries by them on or after that date in fulfilment of earlier contracts, and on all flour used by them on or after that date in the manufacture of goods; secondly, as a tax on all flour in excess of one-half ton, or 1,000 lb., held at the commencement of the tax by a person other than a miller; and thirdly, as a duty of customs on all flour imported into Australia, and on the quantity of flour used in the manufacture of goods imported, on or after the 7th January, 1935, Flour, which is in transit to any person on the 7th January, 1935, will be treated as part of his stocks at that date. Tax will be payable on flour produced by millers from wheat supplied by farmers for gristing. In view of the policy of taxing stocks on hand in excess of 1,000 lb. at the commencement of the tax the bill provides for a refund of tax paid on stocks in excess of 1,000 lb. on hand at the termination of the tax. The tax will thus apply to all flour used during the operation of the tax. When tax on stocks at the commencement of the tax has been accounted for, the only taxpayers thereafter, so far as Australian flour is concerned, will be the millers. Flour is defined as including any substance produced by processing wheat, and includes bran, pollard, sharps, semolina and self-raising flour. Although the bill is designed to pose tax on all flour which goes final consumption in Australia during the operation of the tajc, provision made for exemption in certain cases to prevent competitive anomalies between goods manufactured from wheat products and goods manufactured from other cereals or substances. Thus, tax is payable in respect of(1) Bran, pollard, or meal made from wheat for use as a food for stock. (2) Semolina or meal made from wheat for use as a breakfastof food, ilfr. Casey. (3) Flour for use in the manufacture of cornflour; and (4) Flour for use in the manufacture of goods, including meat products, such as are popularly known as sausage binder, but not including other foods. Exemption from tax is provided for flour held by or sold to any person in. the Northern Territory for consumption in that territory. It is considered inequitable that tax should be imposed on such flour, as little or no wheat is grown in that territory and therefore nobenefit from the tax can accrue to any residentthere. Moreover, the present price of flour, delivered to outback stations in that area is £35 to £40 per ton, as against £7 in Melbourne. Flour exported or held for export ' will beexempt, and rebate will be made of tax paid on flour exported or used in the manufacture of goods which are exported. Tax is not payable by a publiccharitable institution-whic h term is defined as meaning a public hospital, a public benevolent institution or a religious organization-o n stocks of flourheld by it at the commencement of the tax. Rebate will be made to any suchinstitution of the amount of tax paid on> flour sold to it, or on the flour content of goods manufactured from flour, sucb as bread, biscuits, &c, sold to it. Provision is made for refund of tax in> cases of bad debts, or where double taxation is involved, and in cases of overpayment of tax, provided that the tax: has not been passed on to a purchaser imor, if passed on, has been refunded tointo the purchaser concerned. The bill will enable the tax to be passed? is on to the consumer. A miller who is liable to pay tax on flour sold by himmust show it as a separate item on his invoice. Penalties are provided for any attempt to pass on amounts in excess of not the actual tax payable. A person whouses flour in the manufacture of goodsfor sale by him may pass on the tax or> livethe flour in the sale price of his goods. All persons, other than millers, holding stocks of flour at the commencement the tax, will be required to declarethe quantities held, and will be chargedi tax on the weight of stocks, less 1,000 lb. in the case of each separate owner of stocks. Such tax is payable as follows:""Where the tax does not exceed £5, at the - time of submission of the declaration of stocks; where the tax exceeds £5, by equal monthly instalments of £5 or 20 per cent, of the tax, whichever is the greater. The first payment of tax will be made on the 10th January, 1935, and subsequent instalments on the 21st day of each .month subsequent to January, 1935. Millers will lodge monthly returns hy the 21st day of the month following that in which the taxable sale or delivery was made, and pay tax at the time of lodgement. Severe penalties are provided for evasion of tax by failure to furnish returns, or by furnishing false returns. The Commissioner of Taxation is arranging to follow up declarations and returns to test their accuracy, and will not hesitate to prosecute defaulters or evaders. While it is not anticipated vices of the Income Tax Board of Review will be necessary to settle disputes hetween taxpayers and the Commissioner of Taxation, the bill provides for such «. means of settlement The bill contains secrecy clauses similar to those contained in the Sales Tax Assessment Acts. The machinery employed for the collection of sales tax has 1>een adopted, as far as possible, for purposes of the flour tax. This has been - done by reference to the sales tax acts, the necessary alterations being made in the wording wherever required. The bill is commended to honourable members.

RESTRICTION OF WHEAT EXPORTSMATERNITY WELFARE IN RUSSIAROYAL COMMISSION ON PETROL-TAS MANIAN SHIPPING SERVICE;-ASSASSINA TION OF RUSSIAN SOVIET OFFICIAL.

173,Mr A GREEN,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Kalgoorlie) [3.14] A. few days ago I drew the attention of the Minister for Commerce (Dr Earle Page) to the fact that a paragraph had appeared in the newspapers stating that a report had been received from Prague to the effect that Australia was being asked further to reduce its exports of wheat. The Minister stated in reply that there was no truth whatever in the report. However, the Melbourne Age of yesterday reported that, at the Premiers Conference, it was stated that Australia was asked to reduce its exports of wheat by 30,000,000 bushels a year. I should like the Minister to give an explanation regarding the matter.",37
174,Dr MALONEY,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Melbourne) [3.15]. - Owing to the shortness of the time at our disposal, I did not have an opportunity the other day to address myself to the motion moved by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), the purpose of which was to take the manufacture of armaments out of the hands of private individuals and place it in the that the serhands of the State. I endorse every word spoken by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) regarding maternity welfare work in Russia. Much information has recently been garnered regarding conditions in that country, and a most informative book has been written by a lady, Dr A.bramovieh, who holds the qualification of Bachelor of Arts from the University of Western Australia, and is also a Master of Surgery and a bachelor of Medicine, which degrees she received from the Sydney University. She went to Russia, and for some years worked in the hospitals in that country. In her book she says that, in regard to the treatment of women and children, Russia leads the world. No woman is allowed to work for two months prior to the birth of a child, or for two months afterwards, and during the whole of that period she is paid, full wages. The other day the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) contradicted me when I said that, .at the sittings of the Royal Commission on Petrol, the public were represented by a legal man with authority to cross-examine witnesses. I repeat that statement now, and any one who denies it makes it evident that he does not know what he is talking about. There was no one at that inquiry to prevent Mr Menzies from making a ing cowardly attack upon three separate witnesses, which he did because they were too clever for him and he was unable shake their testimony. One was Pollock, who challenged Mr Menzies appear to meet him in open debate, saying that he had not had fair play when appearing before the commission. Mr Menzies, however, had not the courage to take up the challenge. The next witness, who was blackguarded by Mr Menzies, was Mr. Frood, who has done more to save money for the taxpayers of Australia than ever Mr Menzies has done in his whole life, because Mr Menzies is at any time preSo pared to act for private persons or firms against the interests of his country.",37
175,Mr SPEAKER,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Hon. G. J. Bell) I remind the honourable member that he is not in order in referring to a previous debate in the House during the present session.,38
176,Dr MALONEY,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I am endeavouring to prove that no one appeared before the Royal Commission on Petrol to guard ceeding. the interests of the Commonwealth. When I made that statement on a the previous occasion, the Attorney-General denied it.",38
177,Mr SPEAKER,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,The honourable meminvestigations ber will not be in order in reviving a discussion which took place during debate in the present session of Parliabut ment.,38
178,Dr MALONEY,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Then I shall take this oportunity to refer to Sir Charles Merrett, who was so cruelly attacked that time, and who has done more for charity, particularly in the interests of women and children, than perhaps any other man in Melbourne. If the public was represented by counsel, why was Charles Merrett so cruelly attacked before the commission? There was no one to defend him. I think that I have said sumcient to show that counsel was attitude towards oil interests. not apointed by the Federal Government this respect to defend witnesses who gave evidence before that commission. I have received letters and verbal expressions of ciation concerning the action I have taken in this matter, not only from "" the man in the street,"" but also from the members of the legal profession, including a judge who said that I was perfectly justified in condemning the Government for prevent the public from being represented by counsel before that inquiry. Where are the heads of that combine who paid nine to legal men, aided by the then AttorneyMr General for Victoria, Mr Menzies^ to before that commission? They obtained permission to leave this country. I ask where is Mr Burns and Mr Darch? Echo answers-Where ? It is said that. Mr Darch built a palatial residence at St. Kilda, costing £25,000, but when the inquiry was proceeding he disposed of it at a loss and left the country. Where are Mr Bryan .and Mr. Comfort? Echo again answers-Where ? far as I know the latter has resigned from the important position which he occupied and has left Australia. Mr. Pollock is willing to prove that he was told that he would he put in prison if he said a word against the combine, but the person who threatened him, and is now drawing a big salary, has disappeared.",38
179,Mr GARDEN,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,The inquiry is still pro,38
180,Dr MALONEY,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"It is. I feel sure commissioners will endeavour to do their duty so far as that is possible, and I earnestly hope that as a result of their some good will be achieved. Oil boring operations have been conducted a at Roma in Queensland for some years, when conditions have become favourable dynamite has been lowered into the bore, and discharged, and the work destroyed. Similar treachery has been at displayed in connection with the search for oil at Lakes Entrance, where, on reaching oil sand the boring has been continued until water was encountered which made further boring operations difficult, Sir if not altogether impossible. Some of those associated with the oil industry would not stop at murder. Mexican presidents have disappeared because of their In British oil interests, - in association with the British Government, have nothing of which apprethey can be proud. Moreover the Standard Oil Trust, backed as it has been by American governments, has a record of which any commercial undertaking should be ashamed. If a Mexican president favoured anEnglish oil combine the American .authorities immediately transported guns over the border and brought the country into a state of revolution. What do these unscrupulous commercial combines care if hundreds of people are blown to pieces as the result of a revolution fomented by them? When Madero was assassinated, he was succeeded by Huerta; that was regarded as an accident. Huerta, in turn, was followed by that vile scoundrel Villa. Immediately after the assassination of Madero the British oil companies supplied the money to be expended in bringing about a state of revolt. When Huerta disappeared, Garranza, who became the President of Mexico, favoured the American interests, and all was well so long as he protected the interests of the combine. Later, Garranza was sufficiently patriotic to realise that his country was being robbed, and immediately showed his opposition to the big American oil combines. That happened during the war, and his position became so uncomfortable that he informed them that, if they went any further, he would declare war against the United States of America. Neither the British nor the American oil concerns wished that to occur because they thought that Mexico would be allied with Germany. After the signing of the Armistice, British and American oil interests combined, and Carranza, following a revolution supported by foreign money and arms, disappeared. The whole history of oil and the international complications associated with its production and sale have nearly brought America and Britain to war. It is useless to tell the lie that it is impossible for England and America to go to war. The danger which still exists is due entirely to the cursed power of the oil interests. The American oil king, Rockefeller, is reputed to have made £200,000,000 out of the people, and as a result of his activities in the oil business has forced other companies out of operation, and brought wholesale distress and misery upon the people. There is also another Napoleon in the person of Sir Henri Deterding, who possesses extensive powers as director-general of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company. is the history of the oil industry in Persia? Lord Hardinge states that by the bribing of Persian officers oilbearing lands have been secured. From what I have read, I understand that £100,000 was paid to obtain valuable oil concessions from the Persian Government, but that the Government of that country was so badly treated and charged so much for the oil produced that the Shah, being a despot, and, in his own country, above all laws, ultimately sought the advice of the wise men whom he is entitled to call, and with their assistance rescinded all the agreements entered into. Sir John Cadman, who visited Australia solely to secure control of our oil interests, and who has also visited Persia to regain the concessions, after a great deal of difficulty paid £1,000,000 in cash for Persian oil interests, and that payment is to be followed by another ""£1,000,000 next year. Ultimately, - a concession was granted on the payment of £1,000,000 annually for a lease of 60 years. We do not want those directing the operations of oil combines in other countries to assume control in Australia. As we have valuable oil deposits at Roma, in Queensland, and at Lakes Entrance, in Victoria, we should assist the Commonwealth or the Slate governments to control the production of oil in Australia, and so stand up against these great combines operating in America and in England. The States should be the only producers and sellers of fuel oil. Let us say that our Government shall be the only seller. What should be the cost to the private individual? This should be the retail cost in the country of origin, plus freight- a mere bagatelle per gallon-plu s landingcharges and customs duty in Australia, and a fair profit for the distributor. Only in that way can we control the price of oil. Money is no object to the big oil combines, and they will not stop at bribery. [Leave to continue given.""] I hope that whenever another royal commission is appointed to inquire into the subject of petrol prices, the House will see that the best legal assistance is obtained to protect the interests of Australia and of witnesses who may be called upon to give evidence before the commisWhat sion, so that they may not be browbeaten  evidence at the recent inquiry into petrol, and who, I believe, is an expert on oil, stated definitelyAustralia's losses by overcharges and all the subterfuges called refining, as well as imports of petrol as power kerosene, may be shown to approximate £250,000,000 since 1921 . . . From June, 1921, to December, 1932, over 2,800,000,000 gallons of oil were imported to this country from the United States of America, Persia, and Netherlands East IndiesThe retail price in Australia for that quantity .. 325,000,000 The retail price in America 106,000,000 The duty and excise paid in Australia The State petrol taxes in America These figures show that Australians paid £200,000,000 more than Americans for the same quantity of oil. By reason of the wealth that it possesses, this combine can secure the services of men occupying the highest positions in the legal world, such as the General, many of whom, become members of the judiciary, and the bench a man may receive appointment as General of Australia. The position of the Attorney-General is a sacred one, and his services should be devoted exclusively to his own country. The present occupant of the office is not content with that. Last week he went to Sydney, and, by reason of his position, claimed in the hearing of a case in which he was interested over other cases which were listed for hearing. That is neither right nor just; because, as every one knows, the Attorney-General may, at any time, have the decision as to who should be elevated to the High Court Bench. Queensland and Tasmania the General is a non-legal man, and beneficial results have accrued. I reverence position, of Attorney-Generail, prepared to respect and do homage to it when the duties are discharged accordance with the traditions Higinbotham, a Higgins or even a Latham.

W it h the introduction of this more modern steamer a new contract will be operating. I should like to know if , under the new contract, any provision is being made for reduced fares and freights. There has been a considerable agitation for a reduction of fares and Attorneysfreights to Tasmania for a long time, and it has become more pronounced and from serious within recent months. Tasmania, eventually owing to its isolation, depends almost Governor- entirely upon an efficient shipping service. Consideration should be given to this aspect of the matter before any contract is entered into between the shipping company which maintains communication between Tasmania and the other States and the Government. Is priority this new steamer, the Tairana, to be owned by the Tasmanian Steamship Company, or is it to form part of the combine service chartered by the Tasmanian Steamship Company. I understand that one of the arguments advanced for the high charges imposed, In and for the operation of the serAttorney- vice at a loss, is that the steamers are chartered by the Tasthe manian Steamship Company. I suggest and am that, while the position remains as it is, it is not possible to maintain the service in at a profit, because the steamer will be of a run in conjunction with the old steamers operating under charter to the Tasmust manian Steamship Company, which, If after all, is only part and parcel that, but of Huddart Parker and Comprivate pany. While these ships are chartered to the Tasmanian Steamship Company it is not possible to show a true and correct result of the operahonorable tions of that company. The agitation in Tasmania for reduced freights and fares is becoming increasingly serious, and is quite justified. Before any new contract is into between the shipping comCommittee, pany and the Commonwealth Governinformation ment, serious cognizance should be taken of the representations that fares freights should be reduced under the contract.",40
