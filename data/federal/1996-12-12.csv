3,Mr ANDERSON,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994, the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1965, and to repeal the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965. The bill will also introduce minor technical amendments to the following portfolio acts to correct formal errors, omit redundancy and fix misdescribed amendments: Dried Vine Fruits Equalisation Act 1978; Forestry and Timber Bureau Act 1930; Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989; and Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Act 1991. The proposed amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994, when enacted, will ensure that information provided by an active constituent company, at the request of the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals-otherwise known as NRA-is accorded the same level of compensatory protection as currently applies to information provided in respect of an agricultural or veterinary chemical product. This action is in response to concerns expressed by some companies involved with the marketing of active constituents. The active constituent compensation provisions, when enacted, will apply between the primary applicant with a protected active constituent and a secondary applicant seeking access to certain information relating to the protected active constituent. Furthermore, the proposed amendments will facilitate the generation of information about active constituents for the review program of active constituents and existing chemical products. That review program, in part, provides information for assessing the implications of active constituent residues in export commodities. There are also a number of consequential amendments, including a decision made by the NRA to use protected active constituent information for certain approval purposes to be appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for merit review of that decision. The proposed amendment to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 will prevent recipients of the drought relief payment (DRP) or their partners 'double dipping' by receiving support in a couple-rate payment under this act while at the same time obtaining payments or allowances identified separately under the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986. When a DRP is calculated, an amount for the partner is included in the DRP payment. Hence, if the partner were to claim such a partner or parenting allowance in his or her own right, he or she would in effect recei ve the same support twice-once as a component of the DRP and again as a separate payment under the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Following this amendment such a case would not be possible. The amendment to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 will extend the provision at subsection 79(2) of the act for wool industry funding to the Australian Animal Health Council by extending the sunset date from 30 June 1997 to 30 June 2000. The Australian Animal Health Council is funded by contributions by the various animal industries. The Wool Council of Australia has sought, and supports, the amendment which extends this interim measure by extending the sunset clause of 30 June 1997. The Wool Council is considering alternatives for longer term funding and will advise its preferred position in due course. The repeal of the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965 is designed to facilitate the adjustment of the Australian tobacco industry towards international competitiveness. In July 1995, the activities of the Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee (ATMAC) were wound up in anticipation of the repeal of the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965 under which A TMAC operated. A TMAC was established primarily to recommend to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy the annual price and quantity for Australian tobacco leaf purchased by Australian cigarette manufacturers. It has been agreed by all the industry organisations which contributed to ATMAC funding that all rights, assets, obligations liabilities held by ATMAC would be transferred to the Tobacco Research and Development Corporation (TRDC) at the time the act was repealed. I commend the bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Fahey, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
4,Mr FAHEY,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is a central plank of the package of bills to replace the Audit Act 1901. The other main bills in the package are the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1996 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996. Completing the package is the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996, which will amend the multitude of other Commonwealth acts that connect with the Audit Act in a variety of ways. It provides the necessary formal machinery for the Commonwealth to make an orderly transition from its current, ageing and inadequate financial framework. The Auditor-General Bill 1996 is designed to achieve a number of related purposes: foremost, the re-establishment of the Office of the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, but in a way that both symbolically and practically strengthens the functional independence of the office beyond that available under current laws. The bill declares the Auditor-General to be an 'independent officer of the parliament', as an expression of the primary and unique relationship which the office has with the parliament. In keeping with the government's publicly stated commitment to confer genuine functional independence on the Auditor-General, a range of statutory safeguards are included in the bill to prevent inappropriate influence being exerted and on the Auditor-General by either the executive or the parliament. The bill's other main purposes are to specify, clarify and broaden the powers and functions of the Auditor-General as the external auditor of all Commonwealth bodies; to establish the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory agency; and to provide, in tum, for the independent audit of the Australian National Audit Office. Many of the provisions in this bill reflect the significant and valuable work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in pressing for a strengthening of the role of the Auditor-General. The JCPA, following its comprehensive 1988 inquiry into the operations of the Auditor-General, produced report 296 entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament. The committee recommended profound changes to the Auditor-General's operations, including that the Audit Act be replaced with more modem legislation. Subsequently, the recommendations arising from JCPA reports 331 and 346 allowed further shape to be added to the bill as it now stands. I should mention that the government has accepted the proposition that the JCPA assume the additional role of Audit Committee of the Parliament. Appropriate changes to the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 to that effect are included in the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996, and are complemented by provisions in the Auditor-General Bill. I now wish to provide an outline of the Auditor-General Bill. In establishing the Office of Auditor-General for the Commonwealth of Australia, the bill details the processes of appointment and conditions of the office. As a statutory office-holder, the Auditor-General will continue to be appointed by the Governor General on the recommendation of the appropriate minister-whom the administrative arrangements orders are expected to continue to specify as the Prime Minister. Under arrangements proposed in this bill, prior to advising the Governor General of the proposed appointee, that minister must seek the JCPA's endorsement to the proposal. That is, the parliament-through the JCPA-is to have the right of veto over the government's choice of Auditor-General. The bill also retains the current safeguards for the removal of the Auditor-General by the Governor General following a petition by both houses of the parliament in the same session. The Auditor-General is to have a broad mandate enshrined in legislation, replacing the existing arrangements whereby the Auditor General's mandate is only partly derived from legislation and partly from government policy. The Auditor-General will have a mandate to audit the financial statements of, and conduct performance audits on, all Commonwealth bodies. For bodies that are government business enterprises, in recognition of the fact that General. they are subject to the overlaying accountability framework that requires them to pursue optimal market performance and to improve the return to the Commonwealth as shareholder, the Auditor-General would not subject them to performance audits unless requested by parliament-through the JCPA-or a minister. If the body concerned is a partially privati sed Commonwealth company, however, it would not be subjected to a performance audit. In this regard, the government has reflected on the need to continue the principie, as already accepted under the Audit Act 1901, of forbearance in consideration of the investment interests of private shareholders in such companies. Performance audits are an extra feature on the accountability landscape peculiar to public sector bodies. It does not follow, however, that the often high parliamentary profile given the reports of such audits would always be beneficial to the interests of the companies' private investor/shareholders. To avoid the claim that, through imposing this extra tier of performance auditing, the Commonwealth was, thus, 'oppressing' the minority private shareholders, the Auditor-General's surveillance over the operations of partially privatised Commonwealth companies is to be exclusively as the mandated external auditor of their financial statements. The bill seeks to permit the Auditor-General to enter into an arrangement with any person or body to conduct financial statements audits or performance audits for them, or to provide them with services of a kind that are normally performed by auditors. These arrangements would be at the discretion of the Auditor General and be undertaken if it is within the Commonwealth's constitutional power to do so, and the Auditor-General considers there is a benefit to the Commonwealth. The bill seeks to establish the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority with exclusive functional responsibility to the Auditor-General. The government sees the establishment of the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority as an important symbolic step to demonstrate our commitment to the functional independence of the AuditorThe staff of the Australian National Audit Office are to be appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922, as a reflection of the fact that auditing the operations of the executive is a core service to the public through the parliament. Should the staff's existing skills and expertise need to be augmented from time to time, the bill also seeks to preserve the Auditor-General's flexibility to engage any person-for example, to contract with auditors or other specialists from the private sector-to assist in the performance of an Auditor-General function. The bill proposes that the Auditor-General and authorised officials have full and free access to information and documents in the performance of mandated functions. These powers are considerable in their scope but are necessary if the Auditor-General is to fulfil his or her obligations to the parliament. The information gathering powers are complemented with strong secrecy and penalty provisions for any person performing an Auditor-General function. The bill also seeks to re-establish the Office of Independent Auditor who is the parliament's auditor of the Australian National Audit Office. It provides for the appointment and conditions of the office which, as far as are appropriate, mirror those of the Auditor General in relation to his or her audit functions for the balance of the Commonwealth. The Independent Auditor is to be a part-time statutory officer appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the appropriate minister-again, this is expected to be the Prime Minister-with the JCPA having the same right of veto over the government's choice of nominee as it does in the selection of Auditor-General. As I have already indicated, the government has drawn heavily on the recommendations of the JCPA in framing this legislation. While the committee's recommendations have not been taken up in their entirety, the provisions of this bill and the complementary provisions in the other bills in the package provide the statutory environment in which the Auditor General-with all the professional and functional freedom required for the task-can fulfil, fearlessly and independently, the role demanded by parliament on behalf of the Australian people. The Auditor-General plays a vital role in giving credibility to Australia's system of parliamentary governance and this legislation will preserve and strengthen that role. I am pleased to present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. NA ACCOUNTABILITY BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Fahey, and read a first time. Second Reading",14
5,Mr FAHEY,FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill, together with the other two main bills that are part of this package-namely, the Auditor-General Bill 1996 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996-will replace the Audit Act 1901. Before dealing with some of the details included in this bill, it is important to point out the boundaries of coverage over the Commonwealth's financial affairs that will be established by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act. In relation to financial administration, every Commonwealth body falls into one of two categories, according to the basic legal financial status that each body has. It either has the legal capacity, in its own right, by virtue of its incorporating legislation, to acquire ownership of money or other assets coming into its possession; or the body will function only as a financial and custodial agent for the legal entity that is the Commonwealth, without acquiring separate legal ownership of the money and assets it deals with on the Commonwealth's behalf. The proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act is to apply to the operations of bodies that fall into the first category; that is, financially autonomous incorporated Commonwealth bodies that can acquire legal ownership of money in their own right. The proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is to apply to the second category of bodies that, financially, are agents of the Commonwealth. This bill is concerned, therefore, with establishing the regulatory/accounting/accountability framework for dealing with and managing the money and property of the Commonwealth. It specifies responsibilities and powers necessary for the efficient, effective and ethical use of the resources lawfully available to the Commonwealth to carry out its programs; and it provides for appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the stewardship and management performance of those who are responsible for those resources can be made visible and, thereby, allow them to be held accountable. The proposed law will provide a legislative framework for effective and accountable financial management that is not only matched to the public sector environment of today, but a framework that will also be flexible enough to meet the evolutionary changes to Commonwealth financial management practices that the future will inevitably bring. At the same time, the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is intended to preserve, clarify and strengthen the traditional strengths of the Audit Act's key principles of financial control. The explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill deals comprehensively with its features. There are, however, a few elements that I would like to mention specifically. The definitions of 'Agency', 'Chief Executive', 'official', 'public money' and 'public property' between them describe the proposed boundaries of the act's application. Within those boundaries, the principles set down in the act will be fleshed out, where necessary, by subsidiary legislation-regulations and Finance Minister's Orders-to provide procedural substance for the day-today application of those principles. Such a legislative framework is patterned on the structure established by the Audit Act 1901 for regulations and finance directions, except that, unlike finance directions which are administrative in character, provision is made for Finance Minister's Orders to be tabled as disallowable instruments. The legislative framework will be completed by instructions which chief executives will be authorised to issue to officials of their agencies. The act will preserve the role of the Minister for Finance as central to the orderly functioning of the Commonwealth's financial administration. The finance minister is, for practical purposes, the custodian of the constidisallowable tutional 'Treasury of the Commonwealth', so that the range of statutory powers and responsibilities for the proper custody of the Commonwealth's money is vested in that office. The finance minister will retain the sole power to agree appropriate banking arrangements for public money, to make orders concerning the handling of receipts and withdrawals of public money, and as to its investment. The existing power under the Audit Act 1901 to arrange overdrafts and advances from banks has been clarified to specifically limit such arrangements as short-term cash management tools-overdrafts on operational bank accounts for up to 30 days; borrowings from banks as advances paid to the Commonwealth for up to 90 days; and other types of credit arrangements, to be prescribed by the regulations, such as those represented by credit card and cabcharge transactions, for up to 60 days. It should be noted that these arrangements confer no power for the Commonwealth to spend otherwise than as authorised by parliament through appropriations. One of the most visible changes to be brought about by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is in relation to the accounting classifications of money in the Commonwealth's possession. The trust fund established by section 60 of the Audit Act 1901 is to be abolished and replaced by two purpose based funds-the reserved money fund and the commercial activities fund. Apart from components of the reserved money fund that may be established pursuant to other enactments, the components of these two funds will be established or varied by finance minister's determinations. The effect of such determinations will be to specify the kinds of money that may be drawn from the consolidated revenue fund or loan fund and credited to the particular component and the purposes on which that money may then be spent. Since the spending of money from such a fund is, in all respects, an appropriation, the proposed act will require that these determinaall tions by the finance minister be tabled as instruments that do not take effect until the period for disallowance has passed. This procedure is more visible and provides a greater measure of parliamentary control than has traditionally been the case in the establishment of trust accounts under the Audit Act 1901. Payments of public money, including debiting a fund against an appropriation, will be controlled by a system of 'drawing rights', to be issued by the finance minister. This system is predicated on the fact that the laws made by parliament relating to appropriations, variously compelling or permitting the executive government to spend, always specify the fund being appropriated and the purpose of the spending. Such laws may also specify an amount and a time frame. It would be a breach of section 83 of the constitution for spending to occur in any instance outside of those parameters, so the act will stipulate that the finance minister no capacity to issue valid drawing rights that are inconsistent with the terms of the relevant appropriation law; and makes it an indictable offence for an official or minister to knowing- adjourned. ly spend, or seek to spend, otherwise than in accordance with a valid drawing right. The act would put into the principallegislation the powers that are presently carried only in finance regulations in relation to providing a source of authority for the Presiding Officers to approve expenditure under appropriations for parliamentary departments. The present Audit Act 1901 is generally silent on matters of management performance. The new act seeks to remedy this through particular responsibilities being expressly placed on chief executives of agencies for which they may then be held accountable. They are to be required to manage the affairs of their agencies efficiently, effectively and ethically to the extent allowed by law. They will also be required to implement fraud control plans and establish audit committees. The accountability mechanisms to mesh with these responsibilities will include powers of the finance minister to obtain financial statements and other reports more frequently than annually from agencies. Importantly, it is proposed that chief utives be permitted to subdelegate to officials any of the act's finance minister's powers or functions, unless the minister has imposed a restriction prohibiting or limiting such subdelegation. These arrangements for subdelegating are intended to achieve a major strengthening in the financial framework. Chief executives are better placed than the finance minister to manage, to monitor and to control the activities of those officials who perform the delegated tasks. It will thus be practicable to hold chief executives accountable to the finance minister in these respects, whereas it is currently quite impracticable to do so under the existing Audit Act's delegation structures where thousands of individual officials are directly delegated by the finance minister. This proposed law will be a lever for muchneeded change to sharpen and strengthen the framework of Commonwealth financial has administration. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) NA AND COMPANIES BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Fahey, and read a first time. Second Reading",16
6,Mr FAHEY,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996 is one of the main bills in the package of legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901. The initial trigger for this bill is the necessity to replace part XI of the Audit Act which currently provides standard financial, reporting and auditing provisions for Commonwealth authorities. However, only about two-thirds of Commonwealth authorities rely on part XI of the Audit Act. The rest, instead, have their own financial, reporting and auditing provisions. exec- Similarly, the memoranda and articles of association of wholly-owned Commonwealth companies contain their own requirements in so far as accountability to ministers is concerned. Consequently, at present, we have a myriad of variations on a similar theme scattered throughout the statute book and the constitutions of Commonwealth companies. The underlying purpose of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act is to replace all of these diverse accountability requirements with a single set of core requirements. The approach proposed will enable the accountability requirements of Commonwealth controlled bodies to be viewed as a whole and should significantly streamline the focus of the government's and the parliament's interest in this area. Many of the bill's requirements relating to Commonwealth authorities are modelled on comparable areas of the Corporations Law as well as best practice currently applying to individual authorities. Another important feature of the bill is it extends the mandate of the Auditor-General to be the sole external auditor of all Commonwealth authorities and companies, and their subsidiaries. At the same time it will modernise the requirements for the Auditor-General's reports on the financial statements of authorities and make them consistent with those required by the Corporations Law. It will have become apparent from what I have already said that, in some areas, the bill traverses ground that is covered, to varying degrees, in the establishing legislation of authorities and the constitutional documents of companies. These areas of overlap will be removed by consequential amendments to the establishing legislation and are contained in the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996 which is part of this package of bills. Similarly, it is intended that areas of overlap in the memoranda and articles of association of Commonwealth companies be replaced with cross-references to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. For the purposes of the bill, a 'Commonwealth authority' is, in essence, one established by an act as a body corporate for a public purpose and which holds money on its own account. A 'Commonwealth company' is one in which the Commonwealth has a direct controlling interest-that is, there is no interposed entity between the company and the Commonwealth. All Commonwealth companies will be subject to the requirement for the Auditor General to report on their financial statements, and the financial statements of their subsidiaries, and for their annual reports to be tabled in the parliament. However, only 'whollyowned Commonwealth companies' are to be subject to the other provisions in the bill relating to companies-those other provisions are essentially concerned with the furnishing of information to ministers and keeping them informed. This distinction between 'wholly-owned' and other Commonwealth companies reflects the difficulty-in the case of Commonwealth controlled companies which have private shareholders-of imposing a general regime that which requires the provision of plans and reports only to ministers: namely, a risk of oppression actions by minority shareholders who might perceive discrimination against their interests. I will now briefly outline the main provisions of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. The annual report is seen as the centrepiece of directors' accountability to the parliament. The bill proposes that directors of Commonwealth authorities must prepare an annual report containing a report of operations, financial statements and a report by the Auditor-General on the financial statements. The report of operations and the financial statements must be prepared in accordance with Finance Minister's Orders; the directors and the Auditor-General must certify whether, in their opinion, the financial statements give a 'true and fair view' of the matters required to be reported. I should mention that the Finance Minister's Orders will be disallowable instruments, thereby ensuring an ongoing role for the parliament in determining the reporting obligations of directors of Commonwealth authorities. The directors of both Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies will be required to give the responsible minister a copy of their annual report which the minister must, in tum, table in each house of the parliament. There are a number of other reporting obligations proposed by this bill which I will briefly mention. The finance minister may require Commonwealth authorities and wholly-owned companies to prepare half-yearly or quarterly reports. The reports must be given to the responsible minister within two months after the end of the period to which they relate and must be tabled in each house as soon as practicable. It is envisaged that this requirement to prepare interim reports will mainly be applied to bodies with a high degree of independence, such as government business enterprises. A body will formally acquire the status of a GBE by regulations made under the proposed act. Directors will be required to keep the responsible minister informed of the operations of Commonwealth authorities and wholly-owned Commonwealth companies, including their subsidiaries, and to give the responsible minister and the finance minister such documents and information as they may require. Where the finance minister requires such reports, documents and information, it is intended that, in the normal course, he or she will first consult with the responsible minister and provide a copy of such reports or documents to that minister. Directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly-owned Commonwealth companies must also notify the responsible minister of certain proposed activities such as significant acquisitions or disposals of shares or businesses, changes in business activities or involvement in partnerships, trusts or joint ventures. However, the responsible minister may give written guidelines as to the coverage of the matters to be notified and may, in writing, exempt the directors from notifying particulars of proposals to form or participate in the formation of a company. Directors of a government business enterprise, whether constituted as an authority or a wholly-owned company, must prepare a corporate plan at least once a year and give it to the responsible minister. This is a key planning document that will provide the responsible minister with financial and other performance information. The bill also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions relating to the governance of Commonwealth authorities and wholly-owned Commonwealth companies. The bill proposes that the responsible minister may, after consulting with directors, notify them of general policies of the government that are capable of being applied to the authority or wholly-owned company concerned. The directors must ensure that such policies are carried out and, as far as practicable, ensure that they are also carried out in relation to any subsidiaries. Such policies cannot be in conflict with any statutory obligations of a particular authority or company. I should emphasise that this provision does not confer on responsible ministers, or the government, a general power of direction as to how authorities and wholly-owned companies are to carry out their particular functions. It is only intended to cover government policies that are applicable to the Commonwealth public sector in general, such as, for example, policies relating to trade contact with particular foreign countries or for the observance of equal employment opportunity policies, et cetera. The bill also provides that directors must establish and maintain an audit committee. The government views this as a step in improving internal control and communication within Commonwealth authorities and whollyowned companies as well as sharpening the accountability of their management. It will also ensure that directors have appropriate assistance in the discharge of their accounting and financial reporting obligations. I will now mention briefly some of the provisions of the bill which only apply to Commonwealth authorities. Consistent with a recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its 1989 report entitled Government companies and their reporting requirements, the bill provides that a Commonwealth authority must ensure that none of its subsidiaries does anything that the authority itself does not have power to do. This does not, of course, preclude the parliament from passing legislation to empower a subsidiary to perform a particular activity that exceeds the powers of its parent. The government is committed to maintaining the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act in ways that, as far as practicable, will keep it in harmony with comparable provisions of the Corporations Law, as they exist from time to time. The bill therefore imposes standards of conduct on officers of Commonwealth authorities that are the same as standards already imposed on officers of companies by the Corporations Law. The bill establishes a penalty regime modelled on the Corporations Law. Accordingly, a number of its provisions are identified as 'civil penalty provisions', the breach of which may attract civil or criminal sanctions depending on whether the breach is accompanied by a dishonest intent. Contravention of these provisions may lead to the disqualification of directors from appointments to boards of Commonwealth authorities. The term 'officer', as it is used in the provisions of the bill relating to Commonwealth authorities, is given the same meaning as it has in the equivalent provisions of the Corporations Law. Consequently, an 'officer' is a director or any other person who is concerned in, or takes part in, the management of the authority. The bill also provides that a director of a Commonwealth authority who has an interest in a matter that is being considered, or about to be considered, by the board, must, as soon as possible after he or she becomes aware of the situation, disclose the nature of the interest concerned at a meeting of the board. The director must not participate in deliberations on the matter concerned unless the board or the responsible minister determines otherwise. Finally, in accordance with another recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its report entitled Government companies and their reporting requirements, the bill provides that the responsible minister shall table in each house particulars of any new or varied direct Commonwealth interest in a company. The particulars required are to be prescribed by regulation. The proposals put forward in this bill will have no direct impact on government revenues or outlays. However, I am confident that, through the implementation of a more streamlined and consistent operational and accountability framework for Commonwealth authorities and companies, improved performance and value for money will be achieved both for the Commonwealth and Australians generally. I present the explanatory memorandum for the bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. AUDIT (TRANSITIONAL AND MISCELLANEOUS) AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Fahey, and read a first time. Second Reading",18
7,Mr FAHEY,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill proposes the repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and deals with the transitional and consequential matters arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of proposed replacement legislation, namely, the Auditor General Act 1996, the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1996 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1996. The Audit Act 1901 is a pervading, operational act that gives flesh to certain basic constitutional requirements for the raising and spending of money by the Commonwealth; and, to that end, provides a procedural framework for day-today financial administration and audit across the whole spectrum of Commonwealth activities. Its repeal and replacement, therefore, has an extensive impact. This bill is intended to permit an orderly transition to the new framework. The extensive impact of replacing the Audit Act can be seen in schedule 2 to the bill-in the proposed consequential amendments to the relevant provisions of the numerous other acts which refer in specific ways to the current Audit Act 1901. The proposed amendments will remove all such 'Audit Act' references that occur in other legislation and replace them with provisions that appropriately link those acts to the framework of the new financial legislation. Schedule 2 of this bill also specifies consequential amendments to the enabling legislation of Commonwealth authorities so as to link those authorities to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1996. This bill also includes amendments to the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 to create a significantly enhanced role for the committee. These amendments flow from the government's acceptance of the proposition that the role of the Audit Committee of the Parliament be undertaken by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The committee's enabling act will be amended to reflect this new, additional role by expanding its listed statutory duties to strengthen, on behalf of parliament, the relationship with the Auditor General and the Australian National Audit Office. The committee's responsibilities are now proposed to include consideration of the operations and resources of the ANAO and to report on matters arising out of those considerations; to examine the draft estimates of the ANAO and to make recommendations to both houses of the parliament and the responsible minister on those estimates; and to determine the audit priorities of the parliament and to advise the Auditor-General of those priorities. The Public Accounts Committee Act will also be amended to reflect the committee's role, as provided for in the proposed Auditor-General Act, in approving recommendations to the Governor General for appointments to the Office of Auditor-General and that of Independent Auditor of the ANAO. At a procedural level across the range of Commonwealth financial administration, the transitional matters provided for in this bill include the formal transfer, as appropriations, of balances from the Audit Act's existing fund accounting structure to the new structure established by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act 1996; the continuation of the appointment of the Auditor-General in office as at 30 June 1997 for a period not exceeding 10 years from the date of his appointment-in 1995-under the Audit Act; the continuation of the existing arrangements for the position of Independent Auditor as auditor of the ANAO; the continuation for the time being-until regulations under the replacement legislation come into effective operation--of the current safeguards, as agreed by parliament, under section 70D of the Audit Act, in relation to the nature of audit and financial reporting disclosures for the security and intelligence agencies; and for regulations to be made to cover a range of situations, at a procedural level, that might need to demonstrate legal certainty to support their smooth transition to the new legislative framework-for example, for the continuation of the myriad contractual and other arrangements entered into under the authority of the repealed act, such as operating bank accounts, contracts, audits in progress, debtors' repaythe ments by instalments, et cetera. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",21
8,Mr WILLIAMS,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 amends a number of acts coming within the Attorney-General's portfolio. It also amends two acts within the responsibilities of the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Finance. The bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature, makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation and repeals a spent provision. The amendments are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the bill. The amendments will not have any significant financial impact. The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 will establish a Small Taxation Claims Tribunal within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, AAT. Rather than creating a separate structure, the Taxation Appeals Division of the AAT will be known as the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal when it is exercising powers under the new part IIIAA of the AATact. It is intended that the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal will provide a cheaper and more informal means of resolving disputes between the small taxpayer and the Commissioner of Taxation. There will be an emphasis on mediation as a form of dispute resolution. As part of the current AA T structure, the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal will also be able to draw on the resources and expertise of the Taxation Appeals Division. All of the powers of the AAT and the Taxation Appeals Division will be able to be exercised by the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. The amount of tax in dispute, which will determine whether an application for review of a taxation objection decision can be heard in accordance with the new part IIIAA, will be $5,000, unless a higher amount is set some time in the future by the regulations. Applications for review of a taxation objection decision will have to involve less than the determined amount in order to be heard by the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. It is intended that the non-refundable filing fee for small claims matters will be $50, but the tribunal will be able to waive this fee in of hardship. The bill will make a procedural amendment to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 arising from advances in technology. There are now films that provide what is known as 'click-on' access to a range of viewing options. This can make classification difficult as the classifier cannot be sure that all of the viewing options available have been accessed for classification purposes. The amendment will put the onus on the applicant to inform the Classification Board of the presence of any contentious material in the film. Failure to do so will, if this material comes to light after classification, result in the film being automatically declassified if the material would have led to the film receiving a different classification. The bill will also amend the act to align with the amended criterion in the national classification code the criterion for refusal to approve an advertisement under the act on the grounds that it contains child pornography. Commonwealth, state and territory censorship ministers have amended the code to tighten the child pornography criterion to make it easier to deal with material where it is difficult to determine the age of the person portrayed. The amendment to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 will allow a member of the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal to receive remuneration as a member of the tribunal in accordance with the act while concurrently holding judicial office or the office of magistrate, provided that office is remunerated on a part-time basis. The bill will also correct drafting amendments. The bill will also make some minor amendments to the Evidence Act 1995. One of the amendments will extend the operation of a certificate given under section 128 of the New South Wales Evidence Act. Such a certificate gives a witness use and derivative use immunity in respect of self-incriminating evidence given in any New South Wales court. Other amendments will correct drafting and minor technical errors in the Evidence Act and its explanatory notes, achieve total consistency in drafting expression between that act cases and the New South Wales Evidence Act and insert further explanatory notes. The bill will also make a number of drafting and technical amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, consequential upon the amendments made by the Family Law Reform Act 1995. The previously existing jurisdiction of magistrates courts in defended child maintenance matters will be restored. The amendments will clarify the relationship between parenting plans under the Family Law Act and child support agreements under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, making it clear that one document can be used for both purposes. Technical anomalies will be corrected. In addition, two new matters will be added to the particular matters about which rules of court may be made by the judges of .the Family Court of Australia. The addition of trial management will allow the making of rules of court that will further advance the simplification of procedures and provide greater certainty about procedural aspects of trials. The addition of conciliation to this provision will provide a clear power to make the rules that provide for conciliation conferences. Such conferences are an important aspect of assisting parties where appropriate to resolve their disputes without requiring a judicial determination. The bill will also make a number of minor policy amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. The court will be able to appoint marshals for the purposes of the Admiralty Act 1988 as officers of the court. Currently appeals can be brought to the Federal Court from the Supreme Court of the ACT when it is known as the Court of Disputed Elections. The stated intention of the ACT legislature is that there be no appeal from the Court of Disputed Elections. The bill will provide that an appeal to the Federal Court cannot be brought from the Supreme Court of the ACT when it is known as the Court of Disputed Elections. The act provides that the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions may bring a reference appeal on a question of law arising in a trial in the Supreme Court to the Federal Court. This has been interpreted to mean that only the Commonwealth Attorney General and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions may bring these appeals. The bill will ensure that reference appeals can also be brought by the ACT Attorney-General and the ACT Director of Public Prosecutions. The bill will also provide that reports of reference appeals may in certain circumstances be published. Amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 will provide a mechanism for establishing an applicable rate of exchange in relation to the registration of foreign judgments. The amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 will make provision specifying the method of conversion of New Zealand currency into Australian currency with respect to the enforcement of certain New Zealand judgments. The amendments to the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 will make provision specifying the method of conversion of foreign currency into Australian currency with respect to the enforcement of certain conferences foreign judgments. The day on which the rate of exchange is to be established will also be changed. Currently it is the day of the application for registration of the judgment. It will be the second business day before the day on which the application for registration of the judgment is made. This is necessary to enable the judgment creditor time to obtain the necessary evidence from authorised foreign exchange dealers. The Judges' Pensions Act 1968 will be amended to provide that a retired federal judge is entitled to receive the federal judicial pension and hold judicial office in relation to a territory, provided that the judicial office is not remunerated on a full-time basis. The Judiciary Act 1903 will be amended to provide the Federal Court with jurisdiction under sections 75 and 76 of the constitution. Currently clients of the Australian Government Solicitor, when successful parties to proceedings in all courts, are entitled to recover party-party costs. The Judiciary Act 1903 will also be amended to allow for the recovery of costs in Federal Court proceedings by successful parties represented by state or territory government lawyers. The Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 will be amended to provide that the act will apply to the Australian Capital Territory on the same basis as it applies to the states and the Northern Territory. The Privacy Act 1988 will be amended to give the Privacy Commissioner the power to determine that an agency is to be a credit provider for the purposes of the act. This amendment is intended to deal with the situation where an agency provides credit on a commercial basis. The amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 will also allow a credit reporting agency to list an overdue payment under a guarantee on the guarantor's credit information file. This will only be permitted where the credit provider has first satisfied several conditions, including notifying the guarantor and allowing him or her a 60-day period to make the payment, as well as taking steps to recover the amount of the payment. For this purpose, the bill also inserts in act a definition of the term 'guarantee' and a transitional provision to ensure that the amendment does not operate retrospectively. The amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 will clarify the Privacy Commissioner's powers in relation to the copying and retention of documents produced to him or her under section 44 of the act. The bill will make some amendments to the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992. None of the amendments will make any significant policy change. The states and territories were consulted about all the amendments. Two amendments will correct drafting omissions. Two of the amendments will take account of changes in state practices by providing for the use of bail justices in Victoria and by allowing sheriff s officers and bailiffs of prescribed states to execute interstate warrants of apprehension for the enforcement of lower court fines. The other amendments will: align the period for entering an appearance to an originating process served interstate more closely with the period applying when an originating process is served within the state of issue; simplify the procedures applying in some cases when a person who is under a restraint on his or her movements is arrested under an interstate warrant; and provide for the situation where a person, in the course of his or her transfer in custody intrastate, is taken into another state. The amendment to the Superannuation Act 1976 will widen the pool of Administrative Appeals Tribunal members who are eligible to hear applications for review of decisions made under the Superannuation Act 1976. It will extend the requirement that at least one member hearing an application for review be an eligible member or pensioner under the 1976 scheme to include a member who is a member or pensioner of the scheme established under the Superannuation Act 1990. The Taxation Administration Act 1953 will be amended consequentially upon the establishment of the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. The amendments will also provide that the the hearings of taxation matters in the AAT will be in private where a taxpayer so requests, except if the matter is being heard in the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. In small taxation claims matters, the normal AAT provisions will apply, so that a hearing will be in public unless the tribunal is satisfied that it should be in private. The amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 will correct a minor drafting error and the amendment to the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1983 will repeal a spent provision. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. NA Approval of Work Motion (by Mr Warwick Smith) agreed to: That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 10 December 1996, namely: improvements to signage and pedestrian access for the National Gallery of Australia and High Court of Australia precinct. Motion (by Mr Warwick Smith) proposed: That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 10 December 1996, namely: redevelopment of Opposition Party Room and demolition of Press Gallery additions at Old Parliament House.",22
9,Mr LEO MCLEAY,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"I would just like to make a few remarks on the proposals to do work in the Old Parliament House. It is commendable that the current government is continuing the decisions of the previous government to ensure that the Old Parliament House becomes restored to the way it was in the 1920s and the 1930s, so that it becomes a very good constitutional museum and parliamentary museum here in Australia. When people go to other parts of the world, they often see very good examples. of the constitutional history of a country which allows people to partake themselves-to go into the chambers and to have the access that you do not have in this building, which is a working parliament. For those of us who have served in the old parliament and have fond memories of the place, to see the building open to the public the way it is now is a very good thing. The worry I have is that the government now seems to want to change things down there quite considerably. In the last day or so, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) advised us that they are going to start to vandalise old chamber by bringing up the Speaker's chair from that chamber. The chair is very much in keeping with the ornate style of that chamber and very out of keeping with the style of this chamber. It has been suggested that the government is going to spend between $300,000 and $500,000 to move the chair up here. The government was telling people yest.erday that those receiving meals on wheels will have to pay $30 a week more. It would .seem an absolutely disgraceful waste of public money to spend nearly half a million dollars ripping the chair out of the middle of Old Parliament House and bringing it up here. There are also some symbolism problems that I think we should take into account in doing that as well. As members. might recall, the old chair is a very ornate piece of work. It has a lot of attributes that would make it look out of place in this chamber. The ol.d chamber was a closed-in type of chamber; thiS is a very open chamber. To have the Speak-r sitting up in a chair that has a canopy over looking like he or she was in a c-bby.hole-:­ which is what it would look like In thiS building-I think would look aesthetically ridiculous in this chamber. Mr Abbott-You would have looked great in that chair, Leo. Mr LEO MCLEA YI say to the honourable member for Warringah that, if he had been around when we were down there, I would have looked great in that chair down there. I know the sneaking regard the member for Warringah has for that chair. I know he has been down there and has had a good look at it. I know what he likes best about it. What the member for Warringah likes best about the old chair isMr Latham-Elevated. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-It is elevated because he is so short. But, more importantly, what the member for Warringah likes best about the chair-he is one of the people in the Liberal Party pushing for the chair to be moved-and the thing that stands out most on that chair is the coat of arms. Is it the coat of arms of Australia that should dominate this the chamber? Of course not. It is the coat of arms of the British monarch. If we brought that chair up into this parliament, what would dominate this House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, the people's House of the Commonwealth of Australia? The coat of arms of the English monarch. I think that would be a bit ridiculous. I know that is the agenda of the member for Warringah, who is one of the empire loyalists, and the agenda of his colleague the Government Whip, who is going to jump into this debate after me. It is a ridiculous agenda. It would be absurd in the extreme if in the year 1996 the Liberal Party, in looking backwards, decided that they wanted the coat of arms of the English monarch to dominate the House of Representatives. Mr Latham-Empire by stealth. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-It is empire by stealth, as my colleague the member for Werriwa says. I think there are a number of reasons why we should not bring the chair up. There is the $500,000 cost. There is a lot of poignancy in the fact that the same day the It, government gets up and announces that It wants to spend about half a million dollars bringing this piece of furniture up here the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) tells the House that pensioners who earn l-ss than $200 a week for the single pension will, in her words, 'make a modest contribution of an extra $30 a week to get meals on wheels'. Pensioners are going to have to pay about 20 per cent extra of their pension so that they can eat-and the government is willing to waste $500,000 ripping apart the old House of Representatives chamber and ripping apart the old building! A hole will have to be knocked in the wall to get the chair out and the doors of this building will have to be taken off to put the chair in here. Later on government will probably have to pay for a replica to go down into the old chamber-and that would cost more money. I am opposed to this proposal on the basis of cost. To have the old chair up here with the Speakers looking like they are sitting in a cubbyhole crouched in the back of the room would make this chamber look ridiculous, and it certainly would not fit in with the style of this building. Mr O'Connor-It would be out of place. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-It would certainly be out of place.",25
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! I remind the honourable member for Watson that the actual question before the House relates to the work at Old Parliament House. His contribution should relate to that. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-I was just getting on to that. We are talking about the redevelopment of the opposition party room. That was the room where the Government Whip, who is going to speak after me, got up and rammed these silly motions in the old parliament about why we should have the chair moved up here. The member for Warringah's close friend and predecessor was the person who got up in that opposition party room and ran the argument in those days to bring the chair up here. So this debate about what we should do with the Speaker's chair in the House of Representatives was canvassed quite considerably in that historic opposition party room which has now been refurbished. That is where this silly debate first started. There is a great symmetry in this argument here before us today about the excesses of the former member for Warringah and the excesses of the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) in the old opposition party room down there when they first began this plan to have the House of Representatives chamber here dominated by the crest of the British monarch. If the government now want to reinsert those ideas of domination into this House let them stand up and say so but let us not do this by stealth. What happened in that opposithe tion party room was that the debate was won and lost down there and it should have stayed down there. It should not be brought up here now, nearly 10 years after we have moved into this building. We most certainly should not have this massive waste of public money-half a million dollars or so to move it up here and then more money for a replica. It would be a little bit interesting to know why the government want to bring up only the Speaker's chair; why in that debate they had in the opposition party room was there never any discussion about bringing up the President's chair? I do not know whether the reason for that could be that the President's chair was given to us by the Canadian parliament-and those opposite are not all that interested in the Canadians. But the House of Representatives Speaker's chair was given to Australia by a now defunct body. What was that body? When you work out why the English monarch's crest is on it, it makes you twig what the body was: it was the Dominion Parliamentary Association, a body that does not exist any more. The Dominion Parliamentary Association was made up of all those little unfree countries that finally got away from the motherland and became the Commonwealth. That chair has a little sign on it saying it was given to us by the 1,200-odd parliamentarians who made up-I am sorry, it was not the Dominion; I was wrong. It was worse! It was the Empire Parliamentary Association and it was not even the poor old Dominion that gave it to us; it was the United Kingdom branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association. The member for Warringah will love that even more because we have come full circle and we will bring the Empire back up here into the House of Representatives chamber and we will have the crest of the British monarch, representing the Empire, staring down at us every day. This is really back to the future; this is mad stuff. Not only that, in these times of financial stringency, we are going to waste half a million dollars to bring the Empire back and have the monarch's crest dominate this chamber. I have never heard of anything more ridiculous in the many years I have been in this parliament. We argued this down there and the debate should stay down in the old House as part of its history; the chair should stay down in the old House as part of its history; and the people on the government side who are so in love with the Empire should try to get themselves back into the 20th century and fall in love with Australia. That is what we should be doing.  21st. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-As my colleague the member for Chifley says we should be looking forward to the 21st century, not back to the 19th century where these people were very comfortable. When we are looking at the development of the Old Parliament House we ought to be seeing that the history of that House stays intact so that when the taxpayers of Australia come to look at that building they see it intact and when they walk into the House of Representatives chamber they do not see a sign that says, 'The Liberal Party has wasted half a million dollars taking this chair out so they could take it up to the new Parliament House and have the Empire look down on Australia.' I think we ought to forget about this argument. We ought to go on. The chair that is here now is a very beautiful piece of furniture and it was made by Australian craftsmen.  Mr LEO MCLEA Y-Yes, it depicts the Australian wattle as the signage over the chair. It is in keeping with this country and it is a great example of Australian craftsmanship. It should not be banished to some storehouse somewhere while we bring up the contribution of the Empire. The Empire has gone; the chair is down there and we ought to pass on. Mr Warwick Smith-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I point out that the but matter proposed here has nothing to do with the prospect of moving the chair. Indulgence is accorded to a former Speaker to give an entertaining history lesson. I am sure he appreciates that but I would not want the parliament's progress to be delayed in debating this matter when this is a straightforward motion for upgrading the old parliament, an important Heritage Commission",27
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"There is some merit in the minister's point of order. He acknowledges that he gave indulgence to the honourable member for Watson on the basis of a position he formerly held. I am sure the honourable member for Chifley will take note of those comments.  Absolutely, Mr Deputy Speaker, but might I inquire whether there is any discrimination in the very worthwhile suggestions made by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith)? I am pleased to participate in this debate. I have to confess that I have never visited the opposition party room in the Old Parliament House. It is a room that remains a mystery to me. I regret to say that I am now very familiar with the opposition party room in this House. I note that it is proposed to demolish the press gallery additions at the Old Parliament House. I can well remember, as a new member in the old parliament, trying to get across from the Senate side to the House of Representatives side via the parliamentary press gallery. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, it was an absolute rabbit warren. I made several attempts but I got completely lost and ended up very frustrated. I think that all members of parliament, particularly those who had the privilege of serving in the Old Parliament House, have a concern about what is happening to it. I think we would all agree that there need to be improvements. I note that the additional accommodation provided for members in 1984-which, on my understanding, was to be for new members but was purloined by existing members-has not been demolished to date. I wanted to bring that to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the hope that you might raise with the Speaker the concerns that I and other members have about that very functional but temporary accommodation still being in existence. You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the rooms I refer to occupy part of the House of Representatives gardens and stick out like a sore thumb. I am not sure whether they are put to any good use-possibly they are-but if we want to restore the temporary parliament more closely to its original construction, these 1984 additions certainly should be removed. Those who served in the Old Parliament House and had the privilege of coming up here would be aware that the two buildings are radically different. I have said on more than one occasion that I miss the intimacy of the old chamber. I miss the intimacy of the rabbit warren of corridors. But I would never trade those things for the extra space we have here. As the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) mentioned, some of the features of the old parliament are missing in this new House of Representatives chamber. I know that other members have raised the factalthough we have not had a debate or even a straw poll about it-that members of the public are not able to come onto the floor of this chamber",28
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! I have shown a great degree of tolerance so far-I am not sure whether I will regret that at some later stage-but this motion relates to work within the parliamentary zone, specifically at the Old Parliament House. While I am willing to allow comments about the way in which the Old Parliament House is developed and redeveloped-that includes comments about the temporary accommodation",29
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Yes, but comments about the nature of this chamber and things in this building are well outside the motion before the chair.  tion, Mr Deputy Speaker. The last thing I would want to do is defy your orders but I am trying to make a point about the two chambers. If you will extend to me a degree of leniency I will finish that point. The point I wanted to make is that the Senate provides that access to the public. We have talked about taking part of what was in the old House into the new House. This is a very different building, but I would like to see some consideration given to this issue such as the Senate has done. I have a chair in my room that comes from the old parliament, which I am very pleased to have. But I will not get on to the subject of chairs. We seem to be exhibiting a great deal of sensitivity on that subject. In conclusion: all members are pleased to see the development of the Old Parliament House as an attraction to many Australians to witness its history. It is a great feature of this place that it is the No. 1 tourist destination and has so many school children visiting, more than were able to visit in old House. The ghosts of the old parliament will still wander there but it no longer has a life of its own. Being such a young nation, as far as European settlement is concerned, it is very important that we preserve what we can of our history. The Old Parliament House should be preserved in its entirety. In fact, while I have suggested that some things could be demolished, I certainly am not advocating that anything be taken from the Old Parliament House. I conclude my remarks on that point.",29
14,Mr MCMULLAN,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"I realise that everyone is getting excited about speaking on this matter of the work being done at the Old Parliament House, but since it is something taking place in my electorate, I wish to say something about it and support what is being done. I will not take undue time. Despite the fact that I have very strong views about issues such as the transfer of the Speaker's chair, I will not be speaking about that. ",29
15,Mr MCMULLAN,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"You were equally circumspect, and I will not be transgressing into those matters. I will find another opportunity on some occasion to do so. Mr W arwick Smith-There will be a debate about it.",29
16,Mr MCMULLAN,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Of course, and I will not take any more time on that having said that I will not. I support this work being done for two very simple reasons. The first one, which is probably the strongest reason in the long term-about which I will not speak because I think everyone in the House agrees with it, so I will simply note it and move on-is its merits in the evolution of this building as a museum and as a representation of our democratic history, which is very important. That has some economic significance here in the ACT as a minor contribution to the tourism potential of the city. not exaggerated. It is not that which drags people here, but it is something to which they go when they come, and I welcome that. I want to briefly comment on the fact that I support this because it is just about the piece of capital works expenditure which this government is supporting in the ACT. We are in a situation here in Canberra where for the first time since 1982 the unemployment level is above the national average. There is a certain symmetry in that of course because that was also a period when John Howard was responsible for the economy. He had unemployment here above the national average then; he has done it again now. I support this proposal because it is a very small capital works proposal, but it is something. Mr Warwick Smith-It is $400,000.",30
17,Mr MCMULLAN,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"It is $400,000, and I thank the minister for his advice. worth doing in its own right and modestly useful as a contribution to employment here. It is not much of a compensation for the loss of the three office buildings which were going to be built, not much of a compensation for a planned systematic public works program which was in place to do worthwhile things for the taxpayers whilst generating employment without the boom and bust of the past. I was very proud of playing a part in developing that. I regret the fact that the decisions that have been made mean all those jobs have gone and all that security of employment here is gone. I regret the fact that it has contributed to the loss of private sector jobs here in the ACT as well as some public sector jobs-the biggest contributor has been the Public Service cuts. I have to say those reasons combine to say it is not surprising that the indications made recently are that the Liberal Party is going to wimp out on contesting the Fraser by-election, and I am not surprised. Nevertheless, I support this proposal.",30
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! Just before putting the question, I might refer to some remarks that the honourable member for Chifley made when he asked that I refer certain comments he made to the Speaker. The Speaker and the President no It is longer have any responsibilities for Old Parliament House; which portfolio it resides in I am not quite sure. I would suggest to the honourable member for Chifley that he might like to take up the matters that he raised with only the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, which I know previously had an interest in what was going to happen to that temporary building.",30
19,Mr WARWICK SMITH,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.55 a.m.)-On indulgence, I can advise the House that Old Parliament House comes under the jurisdiction of the communications and the arts portfolio, but any changes or any nature of capital works in the parliamentary triangle is dealt with through the National Capital Planning Authority, for which I am responsible in the It is clearly territories portfolio. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Public Works Committee Reference",30
20,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of facilities for 5 Aviation Regiment at RAAF Base Townsville. This proposal seeks approval for the Townsville army aviation works project. The 5 Aviation Regiment provides air mobility, medium lift and aerial fire support to army units. Its main customer is 3rd Brigade ed at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville, which provides a ready deployment force for the ADF through air mobile, air portable operations. Under restructuring, the Australian Army's 5 Aviation Regiment will continue to be based at RAAF base Townsville to provide helicopter support to land force units located in northern Australia. Since the introduction of the Black Hawk, unexpected corrosion has been identified the helicopters based at 5 Aviation Regiment. The level of corrosion is such that maintecontrol plan. nance costs associated with corrosion are expected to exceed sustainable funding levels. In addition, the capacity to operate the helion copters through to life of type is diminished. To ensure that the Black Hawk can be operatsecurity ed through to life of type, the Department Defence has instigated a corrosion control program. To support the corrosion control program, it is proposed to construct a number of additional facilities at 5 Aviation Regiment. These facilities will reduce corrosion caused by operation and storage of the helicopters in the humid, salt laden atmospheric conditions and will include helicopter environmental protection shelters, a helicopter wash facility and dehumidification equipment for Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters. Degradation of the helicopters from high temperatures and ultraJoint violet radiation will also be reduced. The existing 5 Aviation Regiment transport compound and some technical workshop have facilities are inappropriately located remote from the 5 Aviation Regiment precinct. The facilities are inadequate and their locations my remarks. present an ongoing cost to unit efficiency. The works proposed include the construcbe tion of a purpose built transport compound and workshop complex for vehicle mainteture nance and general engineering. Other ancillary works to correct existing deficiencies at Aviation Regiment include the relocation the small arms repair section and the refuron bishment of the gunship helicopter loading point known as ordnance loading area No.6. Subject to parliamentary approval, works are planned to commence in March 1997 with locatconstruction to be completed by December 1998. The preliminary estimate for the proposed construction works is $19.1 million at December 1996 prices. The outturn cost is $2l.332 million. The Public Works Committee in its report tabled on 11 December concluded in part that the proposed environmental protection shelters, the provision of dehumidification equipment and the helicopter wash facility can be justified as providing the in necessary facilities for the successful and economic implementation of the corrosion The scope of works for the transport compound and workshop facilities can be justified the basis of considerably improved working conditions and improved shelter and for the extensive fleet of vehicles, of resulting in improved efficiency. The extent of proposed ancillary work will improve the small arms repair section and ordinance loading aprons. The committee recommends the development of facilities for 5 Aviation Regiment at RAAF Base Townsville at an outturn cost of $2l.332 million. I would like to thank the committee for their support and I commend the motion to the House.  want to make a few brief remarks about this proposal. I certainly would not oppose it. Members of the Defence Subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade have had the opportunity to visit 5 A viation Regiment at Townsville. Many members have said in this House that they been impressed by the way the regiment have gone about their business after this most recent tragedy. But that is not the purpose of The minister in his statement-and I would grateful if he might elaborate-said that this was required and was part of the restrucof the army. It is true that there has been a ministerial statement, with one speaker on 5 each side, about Army 21. I have to say that of the main committee of the Joint Committee Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was pleased to receive its first briefing on the matter. It is a sore point with me for two reasons. The ministerial statement on restructuring was very brief and gave few details. Although some may feel that is an unfair criticism, no documentation was presented with the report. The briefing yesterday has posed as many questions as it has provided answers. I am not coming at it as someone who is opposed to Army 21. I am really interested to know whether the minister can assure the House that the Public Works Committee has been adequately briefed on the restructure of the army. Certainly, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade would not consider it has been adequately briefed. If the minister cannot provide that assurance to the House, how then can he move this motion? I think that all members of the House, particularly those that take an interest in defence, should be given the opportunity to come to grips with and understand what underpins the most radical restructuring of the army in 50 years. I do not want to labour the point. I just want to put my concerns on the record. They are not negative; they are to seek information. But, with the minister stating to honourable members in the House that this is part of the army's restructure, and my knowledge that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has not adequately been briefed, how can he assure the House that the Public Works Committee has? I do not oppose the motion.",30
21,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,in reply-I have had no criticism from the committee of the procedures that went on. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference,32
22,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which w-s referred t? the Parliamentary Standing CommIttee on PublIc Works and on which the committee. has duly reported to Parliament: Development of Infrastructure on the Townsville Field Training Area. The Department of Defence proposes to develop the Townsville field training area to allow subunits, units and formations to conduct collective training in manoeuvre and live fire training activities. This proposal will all?- army to develop the area to improve trammg and to ease the environmental pressure on the currently used training area. The p,roposal will provide fencing and warning SIgns; office. ac-ommodation for the range control orgamsatIOn; communications facilities and access road; basic infrastructure for a 350-man camp; crossing points for creeks, roads a?d railways; and vehicle washpoints. The estImated outturn cost is $18.694 million. It is anticipated the construction will start in March 1997 and be completed by May 1999. The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 11 December 1996, concluded that, firstly, a need exists to provide the necessary infrastructure to enable elements of the Australian Defence Force to undertake collective and joint training in live firing and manoeuvre at brigade level in the Townsville fiel? training .area. Secondly, of development optIOns exammed, the preferred option is the prov-sion of infrast-cture to support training at bngade level which will allow the range to be developed close to its maximum potential and provide training benefits within a realistic time frame and at realistic costs. Thirdly, the extent of the proposed development can be justifi-d on the grounds of public safety, effectIve management and maximum use of the range in accordance with the user requirements and concepts for manoeuvre operations. Fourthly, the committee supports the use of army engineers on elements of the project which would provide training benefits and not directly compete with the private sector. Fifthly, design standards will conform with relevant codes, statutes and operational manuals and procedures, Sixthly, the committee recommends the development of infrastructure on the Townsville field training area at an estimated outturn cost of $18.694 million. I would like to thank the committee for their support and I commend the motion to the House.",32
23,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"I welcome the news this morning of the government declaring these matters emergent and that these works for 5 Aviation Regiment and the Townsville field training area will proceed. In my electorate, $40 million is a very substantial amount of money and I look forward to further dollars being allocated in the coming year for other urgent works that need to be done at Lavarack Barracks. In til! brief time that I have been the federal member for Herbert, I have had a tremendous level of contact with the different branches of the Australian Defence Force. Townsville has had a long and close association with the ADF. Townsville is the location of Australia's largest army and RAAF bases. The recommendation this morning for this approval of work is a reflection on the importance of 5 Aviation, Lavarack and 3rd Brigade and the role they play in the wider national defence picture. I thank the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr lull) for bringing this matter to the parliament this morning and I am pleased to see that this recommendation is going forward.

24,Mr WARWICK SMITH,COMMITTEES,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (11.09 a.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. These are amendments to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 made by the a Senate last night. The Senate made 17 amendments which have been circulated to honourable members this morning. These amendments in effect make six key policy changes to the bill as proposed by the government in the Senate. I will detail the government's position. Fundamentally, the government wilI accept alI of the amendments. Amendment No. 1 relates to the commencement provisions for the bilI. Clause 2 of the bill as introduced provided for commencement on royal assent, with the exception of item 25 of schedule 1 of the bilI, which would commence on the first day after the minority interest sale time. Amendment No. 1 substitutes a new clause 2, which provides for, firstly, the amendments to the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to commence on 1 May 1997 and, secondly, the amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 to commence on royal assent. The later commencement for the amendments to the Telstra Corporation Act will ensure that they do not commence until after the Senate Economics Legislation Committee has reported on the matter of public equity in Telstra Corporation Ltd, with particular reference to the suitability of redeemable preference shares or other capital raising options for public participation by way of investment in Telstra. New clause 2 also removes the special commencement provisions in clause 2 of the bill 25 of schedule 1. This amendment is consequential on the removal of item 25 of schedule 1 in Senate amendment No. 17. Amendment Nos 2 to 5, 7 to 10, 12 and 14 to 16 have the effect of extending the new customer service guarantee from carriers to all service providers, which we talked about the other day in the House. Amendment No. 6 will extend the range of matters about which Austel can make performance standards for the purposes of the customer service guarantee to include other matters in relation to which Austel thinks it appropriate to develop standards. Amendment No. 11 increases the proposed statutory cap for damages payable under the customer service guarantee from $3,000 to $25,000. Amendment No. 13 makes a minor technical change to ensure that the power to issue evidentiary certificates in clause 87H does not affect the right of a customer to complain to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman about a breach of a performance standard under the customer service guarantee. Amendment No. 17 relates to the proposed removal of the directions power in section 9 of the Telstra Corporation Act. Item 25 of schedule 1 of the bill as introduced omitted section 9 of the Telstra Corporation Act which enables the minister, after consulting with the board, to issue directions to Telstra in the public interest. Amendment No. 17, the last one, omits item 25 of schedule 1 of the bill, thereby retaining the power of the direction in section 9 of the Telstra Corporation Act. This statutory power has never been exercised. It is the government's expectation that any public interest controls would be exercised through regulatory mechanisms which apply to alI carriers and that, if the Commonwealth sought to exercise any control over Telstra in its capacity as a shareholder, it would do so by exercising the rights attaching to the two-thirds of the shares which it owned not by exercising the power of direction. As I mentioned at the commencement of remarks, the government is prepared to accept the amendments made by the Senate and hopes for speedy passage in relation to item in this place.",33
25,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"Werriwa) (11.13 a.m.)The Labor Party wilI be supporting each of the 17 amendments made by the Senate. In particular, we were pleased that amendment No. 17 was carried in the Senate and we are pleased to support it in the House of Representatives. As the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) has just mentioned, amendment No. 17 relates to the power to give ministerial directives to the board of Telstra. The Labor Party sees that power as an essential third tier in the safety net, guarding public interest concerns about the operation of Telstra-particularly with regard to regional Australia. The first tier of the safety net for regional Australia is public ownership. One of the very sad aspects of the government's decision to privatise one-third of Telstra is that the people of Australia are losing their full public ownership of the great telecommunications company of this land. Nothing is sadder than the loss of public ownership of the infrastructure for the information superhighway. If there is one aspect of Telstra that should absolutely be held in public hands, it is the cables and the pipes of Telstra, because they are the essential infrastructure for the information superhighway. As our society moves more and more towards an information society, it is essential that public ownership of the pipes and cables be maintained. The second tier of the safety net for regional Australia is section 183, something that was used effectively, interpreted as such by the former minister, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). The interpretation of the new government has changed, because they are reading section 183 in tandem with section 185. Two days ago the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, in the MPI debate, said this: ... section 183 fundamentally says there shall not be a price discrimination except in certain circumstances under the exemptions, and 185A is one of the exemptions-that is, where a carrier can show that there are cost justification reasons for Quite clearly, it costs a lot more to provide call systems in remote or regional areas than it does in some closely populated urban areas, and that is why the exemption is there. That is a statement of laissez-faire. That is a statement of the government's determination to see Telstra operate according to solely commercial grounds in private ownership and disregard the universal service obligations that have been put in place to protect regional Australia and regional telephone consumers. In tandem with the government's determination, initially, to abolish the ministerial directives, the Howard government was wiping out each of the three tiers of the safety net for regional Australia in telecommunications: public ownership-gone; 183-reinterpreted to read as a charter for laissez-faire operations for Telstra; and ministerial directives-gone. Each of the three tiers of the safety net, carefully constructed by the former Labor government, was going to be abolished by this government. Out of the terrible decision of the Senate and the terrible sell-out by the Independent senators in that place, one thing at least has been salvaged; that is, the third tier of the safety net-the ministerial directives and how they will need to be applied under the new ownership arrangements for Telstra. As this government moves towards the commercial charter, those ministerial directives will need to be applied to safeguard the public interest, to safeguard the idea of universal service provision in regional Australia. We all understand how there is pressure now for a differential local call rate in Australia. Optus have moved to the 20c local call in the elite affluent parts of Sydney, and is planning to do so for the same types of suburbs in Melbourne. But under this government that is not an opportunity which will be made available to regional Australia. This government is basically saying that the policy guideline for adoption is user pays. If there is an extra cost for regional Australia, a cost not experienced on the north shore of Sydney, then that cost for regional Australia should be covered with a user-pays philosophy. That is a shameful reversal of the principles of universal service obligation and access that doing so. the former government had in place. The ministerial directives need to be maintained. (Time expired)",34
26,Mr LEE,COMMITTEES,"I begin by thanking my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) for outlining the opposition's position on our attitude in supporting all of the 17 amendments. I will confine my remarks to amendment No. 17, which blocks the government's attempts to delete the minister's ability to issue a direction to Telstra. I place on record my appreciation to Senator Harradine and Senator Colston for supporting the opposition's amendment in the Senate. We think this is a very crucial power for the minister for communications to have. I am not a lawyer-I am an engineer-but I do know that when judges have to make decisions on legislation that is passed by the parliament, they sometimes take account of what ministers say. Given the fact that this minister, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), and this government have tried to frustrate our attempts to retain that power of direction in the hands of the minister, I hope that any judge that is making a future decision about the legality of these issues will take account of the views not just of the government and this minister but also of the parliament. The fact that the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government is at the dispatch box this morning accepting this amendment means that their party and their government is accepting that the minister for communications will retain that right, that power of direction. There is no point in the minister for sport trying to use some weasel words-as he did in his earlier remarks this morning-by saying that in some way the government is only going to be entitled to the rights that they are entitled to as the owners of certain shares in the company. Minister, there is no point in trying to use your words in this debate to in some way undermine the amendment that you are accepting. What this amendment does is give the minister for communications the power to issue a direction to Telstra. If we had not been successful in the Senate, the minister for communications could not have issued directions, because that would have been oppressing the minority shareholders. Even though the government has two-thirds of the shares, you cannot oppress the minority shareholders. If this government allows Telstra-whether it is one-third privatised or not-to take certain decisions, here are a few examples where we would be calling on the minister to use that power of direction. If Telstra tried to introduce charging for directory assistance, that would be a breach of the undertakings given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this chamber earlier this year. We would be in here calling as loudly as we could for the government to issue a directive to Telstra to stop the introduction of such charges. If the power of direction were not there, the public could not rely on the government to use its two-third shares to ensure that there would be no charge for directory assistance. The second example is the one we have been talking about this week. If there were an attempt to introduce differential local call charges across the country, we would demand that the minister issue a directive to Telstra. After 1 July 1997, under the government's new legislative regime, if the government does away with section 183 in the act that prohibits discriminatory pricing, and if the government tried to allow Telstra to drop the price of local calls only in the suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne where Optus is competing, we think that would be against the public interest. We think it would be wrong for the people who live in the other suburbs of Sydney to also not get access to a 20c local call. It would be wrong for them to be paying 25c if the residents of Chatswood, Hunters Hill and other places in the Prime Minister's electorate were to get 20c local call rates. It would be wrong for the residents of Launceston, in the minister's own electorate, to keep paying 25c if Telstra customers in the affluent suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne had the benefit of that lower charge. They are just two examples of why we think it is imperative that even a part-privatised Telstra operates in a regime where the minister for communications retains the power to direct. The minister can only use that directive after he follows certain procedures, so the minister has to be accountable to this parliament. The point I want to make is that, in accepting these amendments, the government are accepting that they are going to have this responsibility in future years. There is no point in the minister in his contribution today trying to argue in some way that the power of the minister is limited to the power of the representative shareholder who owns that two-thirds share. That is something I would appreciate the minister conceding in his future remarks in this debate.  to follow up the points made by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) about this most important insertion of amendments to give the minister for communications the power to intervene. I take up the point that the honourable member for Dobell has said about legislation and, perhaps, some future judge looking at the situation. I also want to add that I forgive him for being an engineer. I still think he is a fine representative for his electorate. Mr Lee-Despite that.  to be drawn out on that, but in spite of that. I think you have to understand that, when you are privati sing a minority shareholding, a third, effectively what you are doing is handing control of the company to that one-third owner, as we are proposing to do, with the Commonwealth having control over the remaining two-thirds. Your directors get locked up into fiduciary responsibilities so that you have this conflict between the Commonwealth having a responsibility to ensure that services are provided comprehensively and adequately and their role as a shareholder. Then you find that the Commonwealth cannot exercise it because directors argue that they have a fiduciary responsibility. This is probably one of the most crucial amendments that has been made. The position of the opposition is that we oppose the sale of Telstra. We see Telstra as providing a most important infrastructure to all Australians. We want it provided equally so that there is an equity of access and a universality of access. We do not want it defined as the ordinary service or POTS-plain old telephone service-if I can use that terminology that was developed some time ago. What this power is doing is saying that, notwithstanding the partial privatisation, the minister for communications and his representative in this place are going to have certain responsibilities. He cannot mince in here saying, 'Look, I would like to help the bush, I would like to help rural and regional people or I would like to help the urban poor and make sure that they have access to the means of delivering the superhighway, but I can't. My hands are tied. This is a partially privatised entity. It's market forces that will dictate the situation, and if there ain't a profit in Australia, if there ain't a profit in regional Australia, tough.' The opposition and the Senate have insisted on a degree of ministerial accountability by the minister representing the minister for communications in this chamber and, of course, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. Senator Alston bleated this morning that this has probably diminished some of the sale price, and so it should. We should not be in this situation at all. But he is not going to be able to mince in here saying, 'I don't have the power.' This House of Representatives, this opposition, has sought quite clearly to ensure-and the Labor Party sought to ensurethat he had this power of direction so that you would not get differential pricing and differential services throughout Australia. We are not opposing these amendments; in fact, we are supporting them. But we want to place on the public record that we are going to be holding the government accountable and, if you fail to exercise your ministerial duties that you have to all Australians, we will be in this place reminding you that you have the power. It was given to you by this House and the Senate with the support of the opposition. Unquestionably you will have the power so that there will not be differential benefits derived, for example, in the area of local calls. I have raised the issue of fiduciary responsibility before with the minister when this matter was being debated some time ago. I believe that these amendments will have the people's house, the parliament of Australia, overriding the fiduciary responsibilities(Time expired)",35
27,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Before I call the next speaker, I thought I might query whether the member for Chifley intended to be quite so pejorative in his description of the minister's walk.  going to see a lot of situations where coalition ministers mince in here avoiding their responsibilities.",37
28,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEES,"The hypocrisy and gall of the Labor rural Party never cease to amaze me. Here they are, once again, being both the poacher and the gamekeeper. They are putting the tentacles of socialism into the commercial market yet again. What they are forcing upon us again, by using their manipulative powers in the Senate, is an amendment that is non-commercial. We are prepared to accept it because there is a greater public interest. But what hypocrisy on the part of the member for Chifley (Mr Price), the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who say, 'Oh no, we're going to keep you accountable,' in the same way as the member for Dobell constantly used that discretionary power of protection! How many times was it used? Zero; the big zero; the big goose; the golden duck. Yet the ALP is saying, 'We're going to keep you accountable.' This is yet another example of the hypocrisy of the ALP when it comes to the day to day operations of a commercial organisation. You cannot be both the poacher and the gamekeeper. You have to realise that point, once an enterprise is going to be sold, even in part. Even back in the days when you sold part of Qantas, there was no direction in relation to Qantas. Yet, in relation to Telstra, they are claiming there is a certain reserve power that needs to be kept for the minister. It is totally uncommercial. We are prepared to sell perhaps the nation's most significant to the private sector-one-third of it. Mr Lee- Mr Acting Speaker, I take a point of order. On a point of clarification, is the honourable member speaking in favour of the amendment or is he opposing it?",37
29,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,There is no point of order.,38
30,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEES,"It does not surprise me that the member for Dobell should take a point of order because this cuts right to the heart. The member for Dobell realises that this is yet another example of the tentacles of the Left infiltrating the fair and forthright tentacles of the Right within the Labor Party-those tentacles that are saying, 'Listen, let's have a responsible commercial approach to this sale.' But no, they have to retain the discretion on the part of the minister, which has absolutely zero effect, because they know, as we know, that the discretionary power has never been used. Yet when it comes to the float of one-third of Telstra, the tentacles of the ALP will cost the Australian taxpayers perhaps billions of dollars because a non-commercial direction remains in the sale process. The most important point is that we are going to support this amendment because, in the broader interests of the Australian people, one-third of Telstra has to be sold. It is not because the enterprise can do with some private sector interest. It is not just because governments should not be in the business of running telecommunications companies. It is because we want to make a $1.2 billion commitment to the environment. It is the Labor Party that is continually talking up the environment and then undermining it, talking up telecommunications, getting services out to the bush and getting services to the people in most need, and then taking the rug out from underneath them. As the member for Dobell knows, the ALP has done absolutely nothing for the people in most need in terms of telecommunications services in rural and regional areas of Australia. Yet the hypocrisy which has filled this chamber and the Senate over the last few months whilst the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill has been debated has been asset overwhelming when it comes to the lack of commitment by the Australian Labor Party to, firstly, a commercial enterprise and, secondly, getting services to those most in need. The member for Dobell talked about cheaper phone calls for the city and the people in the bush not getting the opportunity for cheaper phone calls. As part of the overall telecommunications package which was introduced by my colleague the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), people in the bush are going to get a fair go, and they are going to get a fair go through competition. (Time expired)",38
31,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,"Hunter) (11.34 a.m.)I think it is appropriate, as a member representing a rural seat, that I speak briefly to these amendments to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. It is particularly important because it is clear, as I said during the discussion of a matter of public importance earlier in the week, that very few members of the National Party or the Liberal representing regional seats are prepared come into this place and defend rural and regional Australia. I do note that the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) is in the chamber the moment. I look forward to his contribudefend tion. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, of the point I made two days ago when I said that during the second reading debate on the Telstra sale bill only two National Party members were prepared to come into this place and defend rural and regional on this issue. I recognise, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, that you were one of them. I want to speak in particular to amendment No. 17. I do not want to go to the technical points. I want to pick up on what the member  need for ministerial direction in order that services be maintained in rural and regional Australia. I would like to pick up on what the member for Chifley said by drawing an analogy partial between the sale of Telstra and the sale of Commonwealth Bank. I ask honourable ministerial direction. members how many of them have had Commonwealth Bank branches close in their electorates and how many of them as a result have contacted the state managers of the Commonwealth Bank and sought their assistof ance. Mr Hockey-You sold it.",38
32,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,"I ask how many of rural them were told, 'Well, you must understand that we've partially'-at that 'privati sed the Commonwealth Bank. We have to keep in mind the interests of our shareholders. We can't be making such Australia decisions on the basis of the protection of rural and regional Australia. This is a business now and we must protect the investment of those shareholders.' How many members have experienced that? How many members went to the Treasurer the day to seek his assistance? members were told the very same thing: 'Look, the government can't intervene in these decisions. This is a partially floated business now. We have shareholders to got protect'? The member for North Sydney Hockey) whinges and whines and tells me it Party was my government. I tell the member for to North Sydney it was not my government at all. I was not part of that government. I am not in this place to defend the decisions of the at previous government. I am in this place to my constituents in my rural electorate. But, more particularly, I find myself having to come in here and defend all rural and regional Australia because there are simply no members on the other side, with a couple of exceptions that I have mentioned, that are Australia prepared to do so. Clearly, unless we maintain ministerial direction, rural and regional Australia will miss out. Kids in rural and regional Australia will not have the same opportunity as their city cousins. We will not talk about the the missed opportunity of people in rural and regional Australia through price reductions as they will experience massive price increases in the cost of their telecommunications services. That will be the case even under the privatisation of Telstra; but it will the certainly be the case if we do not maintain Let's not make the same mistakes that we made in the past. I am happy to recognise them. I did not support the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. I certainly was not part that government. Let's learn by our mistakes. As I said, I am not here to defend the previous government. I am here to protect and regional Australia. And it is about time a few more people on the other side got time at leastup and did the same.",39
33,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"O'Connor) (11.39 a.m.)Protection of regional and rural Western interests me greatly as that is exactly how my electorate would be defined. It is 220,000 square kilometres, has 62 local authorities and the people have re-elected me with ever-increasing margins and with an erosion of two per cent of the Labor vote of every time, and they know and trust my How many advice on these things. It is worth looking at this whole issue in the way that these people opposite are trying to portray it. To back up their arguments, they their majority with the socialists of the (Mr Democrats and others to put up a second report on cross-subsidy and all the problems of the rural areas. They made sure they had control of that particular committee, the report of which they called Telstra-to sell or not to sell. They ignored the fact that previously when they were in government they got their expenditure committee, of which they also had control, to put up a report, which is in our records, labelled Poles Apart. It specifically dealt with the cross-subsidy at a time when it was not their government that was running the cross-subsidy story; it was Telecom, as it was then known, trying to protect its monopoly. The reality of all this was that they wanted a different outcome. So, with the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) in control of the expenditure committee, they brought out Poles Apart. But what did Poles Apart say about cross-subsidy? Paragraph 7.8 states: Whatever the accounting difficulties, the Committee still supports the present cross-subsidy for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is crucial to guish between 'cross-subsidy' and 'profitability'. Telecom customers in high-cost areas are not necessarily unprofitable for Telecom. They contribute less per service than users in low-cost but their contribution to Telecom's revenue is still positive. Non-metropolitan customers of Telecom in 1984-85 paid for all the direct costs incurred in their districts as well as for $433.8 million of Telecom's total indirect costs. They are trying to tell us that a new and privati sed company will throw that sort of revenue away. But they went on to say: A further benefit to the system provided by urban and remote users which may be offset against the costs of their service lies in what economists call an 'access externality'. Put simply, this means that the value of telecommunications systems to any particular user will increase as the total number of users with whom he or she can communicate increases. In other words, it takes two phones to make a telephone call and a lot of people would not buy a metropolitan service if they could not ring people in the country. They are not my words. They are the words of the Labor Party dominated expenditure committee. I think the minister at the table, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), was also there and he will confirm that that committee was dominated by the Labor Party. When it suited you to put that issue down, you produced the facts. There they are in 1984-85. Probably $1 billion now of Telstra' s indirect operating costs are being funded by its rural people. The suggestion is that you are going to run around and tell them that you do not want them as customers. In a commercial arena of course you will. Then we have this problem that we have to have ministerial control because of jobs. I see that the matter of public importance yesterday was, 'If you privatise National Rail there'll be a loss of jobs.' That raises one simple question: if a private operator is going to reduce the number of employees on the grounds of efficiency in the national interest, in the taxpayer's interest, why has it not happened already? Why are you, as the representatives of the taxpayer, demanding unnecessary jobs? A business organisation, be it the property distinof the taxpayer or the private sector, should not be a welfare organisation. It should operate efficiently and of course welfare should be a separate vote in the budget and districts we should have all the compassion in the world when we deal with that situation. But any job that is not productive within Australia, whomsoever the employer, is very damaging to our economy. We have to be prepared to differentiate, in the interests of all the people of Australia, not some little section that believes they have the right to a job where there is no work. That is outrageous.(Time expired)",39
34,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"Werriwa) (11.44 a.m.)The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) was a little confused earlier because he was talking about a clean separation between a public ownership model and a private ownership model. But that is not the government's proposition-at this stage. This is a one-third private, two-thirds public model. The member for North Sydney was getting ahead of himself. He looks forward to a future in this place and perhaps in his own mind he was trying to rehearse a second reading speech for the sale of the final third of Telstra, not the first third of Telstra. Mr Lee-He was letting the cat out of the bag.",40
35,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"As the member for Dobell points out, the member for North Sydney was letting the cat out of the bag; he had the wrong speech. What the member for North Sydney was doing, with all his rhetoric about poachers and gamekeepers, was poaching on the plan of his own Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Poaching on his own Prime Minister's plan, he let the cat out of the bag-the smelly mongrel cat-that it is one-third sale, followed by one-third sale, followed by one-third sale. A third, plus a third, plus a third is the full sale of Telstra. Mr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Australian Labor Party promised the shareholders in the Commonwealth Bank that they would not sell more than one-third of the Commonwealth Bank.",41
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Vaile)There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,41
37,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"It is a big, round angry cat that is out of the bag. The member for North Sydney knows, as does every government member, that a third, plus a third, plus a third equals the whole sale and privatisation of Telstra. So let the Australian people be in no confusion about this matter: the government is talking about a full sale of Telstra, as certain as night follows day. As certain as night follows day, it is a third, plus a third, plus a third. The hide of the member for North Sydney, having let the big cat out of the bag, to then go on to talk about the sale value of Telstra, implying that the Senate's insistence that ministerial directives the act will downgrade the sale value of Telstra. Members on the government side should be thanking the opposition with regard to the sale value of Telstra. The truth is that the shareholder value of Telstra improves year after year after year. The Labor Party is passionately opposed to the privatisation. But any financial analyst would tell you that, if you are silly enough to try to privatise Telstra, now is not the time to do it because the shareholder value of this instrumentality has been improving by 20 per cent year after year after year. These figures are a great credit to the former minister, the member for Dobell, who is present in the chamber. There is Telstra's huge profit increase of 31 per cent in the last financial year. Telstra's unit costs have been cut by 10 per cent during the past financial year and, on its own reckoning, are now eight per cent below the average for world telecommunications companies. At 30 June this year costs were $565 per line per year, compared with a world average of $612. For the past few years the shareholder value-and until now there has been just one shareholder, the Commonwealth of Australia-has been increasing by 20 per cent. Do not lecture us about the sale value of Telstra. If you are silly enough to privatise, you are doubly silly if you do it now because the value is increasing by 20 per cent year after year after year. We know where the member for North Sydney gets these ideas from, because he is a protege of the member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey). When Mr Fahey was Premier of New South Wales, taking the flawed advice of the member for North Sydney, it was well known throughout the State of New South Wales that they only ever had one plan-and that was to renovate the Premier's penthouse while at the same time the Premier was taking T A. So, having only one plan in New South Wales, they have a faulty sale planMr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Clearly, that is right off the line of the argument and totally out of order.",41
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Yes, I take the point. The member might direct his comments remain into the debate.",41
39,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,But these failed state advisers and failed state premiers are now coming here with a faulty sale plan forMr Hockey-How did you get in here?,41
40,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"Failed? Talk about the 1991 and 1995 election campaigns-they put you out of business, Joe. They put you out of business and put, in that case, the cat back in the bag. He is now down here as member for Macarthur, trying to sell Telstra at a time when every financial analyst in the country says, 'If you're silly enough to sell Telstra, you are doubly silly to do it right now because the shareholder value a year from now will be improved by 20 per cent, two years from now by some 35 per cent and three years from now by some 50 per cent.' So the Liberal Party should not have the hide to come into this chamber and lecture the Labor Party about the share value. If you think the sale of Telstra has been delayed throughout the course of 1996, you should be thanking us. (Time expired)",41
41,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEES,"There are a number of points that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) raised, and I just want to touch on a couple of them. When I first came down here, I was pretty magnanimous. I really did not believe all those stories I had heard about the Australian Labor Party saying one thing in this House and then going out into the electorate and saying something else. I really did not believe it. But, gee whiz, have I had a rude shock. Here we have the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), the member for Dobell (Mr Lee),  member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) saying, 'Well, really, we don't want to be associated with what the previous Prime Minister did.' I would not have believed that someone could be more out of touch with reality than was the previous Prime Minister, Paul Keating. But I have discovered that the member for Werriwa is. After having made a point point of order on the grounds of relevance. You intervened on behalf of the honourable member for North Sydney",42
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I take the point of order. The member for North Sydney might address his remarks to the amendments before the House.,42
43,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEES,"The member for Werriwa was talking about the fact that Telstra would be worth more some time in the future if it were to be sold. Can I give the member for Werriwa a little tip? The all-ordinaries index of the share market is travelling at somewhere around 2,150 points. When the ALP sold the Commonwealth Bank, the initial tranche was around 1,600; when they sold Qantas into the market, it was probably around 1,800. If we are to be logical-and I know that it is very hard for the member for Werriwa to understand-usually the market continues to grow. It is a good idea to sell into a rising market. It is only the ALP that tends to sell into falling markets. Initiatives such as the amendment-an amendment which makes it uncommercial-to give a power of direction to the minister do have a detrimental effect on the share price. But this government will even address the problem that has been given to us by the Australian Labor Party. Firstly, we have said that, if we are to try to have some direction on Telstra, we will use the regulatory powers to do so, in the same way that we would have that effect on Optus or any other provider that comes into play after 1 July next year. Secondly, we wiJ] not do what the ALP does: we wiJ] not be abject hypocrites. We wiJ] not come into this chamber and say, 'Listen, we're not going to tell you about anything we do not do.' We are saying that we are selling one-third of Telstra now, and we will go back and make a pledge to the Australian people about further sales down the track. But we will not be the hypocrites that the Australian Labor Party has been. The Australian people are very mindful of the failure of the Labor Party to tell them about Qantas, to tell them about Australian Airlines and to tell them about the Commonwealth Bank. Who can forget the first prospectus of the Commonwealth Bank which contained a message from the Minister for Finance saying to the shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank, 'We won't sell any more than one-third of the Commonwealth Bank'? Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for North Sydney is talking much more about the Commonwealth Bank than he is about Te!stra. These are Telstra amendments from the Senate. He should actually say something about Telstra.",42
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"I take the point of order. The member for North Sydney might tum to the point of the amendments, although the member for North Sydney is discussing privatisation. Mr Neville-Further to the point of order: before you entered the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Hunter introduced the Commonwealth Bank into this debate in a very forceful way. I think the rebuttal is quite in order.",42
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I appreciate the point of order raised by the member for Hinkler. I will draw the member for North Sydney back to the point of the amendments.,43
46,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEES,"All I am doing is pointing out the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party when they come into this House and talk about being honest with shareholders, and that is particularly in relation to amendment 17. They went to the Australian people, they went to the purchasers of the first tranche of the Commonwealth Bank and they pledged in writing in the prospectus that they had no intention whatsoever of selling the remaining shareholding of the Commonwealth in the Commonwealth Bank. They lie. There is no doubt about that. It is proven and it is on the record. Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: if he is accusing members on this side of lying, he has to withdraw that.",43
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"I take the point of order that has been raised by the member for Werriwa. But I think the ruling has been that unless it is directed at an individualMr Latham-I take offence at that. He has been talking about members on this side and the Labor Party. None of us have told lies on these matters, and he should withdraw.",43
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The member's time has expired.,43
49,Mr LEE,COMMITTEES,"I say to the minister at the table, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), that we will keep jumping as long as government members keep provoking us. If he wants this debate to continue, then keep provoking us. Before I put a few questions to the minister, perhaps I could respond to some of the provocati ve remarks that the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), who seeks to describe our attempts to retain the minister's power to direct Telstra as-to quote his words-'the tentacles of socialism'. It is the tentacles of socialism to allow the Minister for Communications to block Telstra if they want to introduce a charge for directory assistance. It is the tentacles of socialism if we try to help the constituents of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) and make sure that his constituents do not pay more for a local call than the residents of Chatswood. It is a terrible thing, this tentacles of socialism, isn't it? We could almost imagine Jack MCEwen being one of the greatest devotees of the tentacles of socialism as described by the honourable member for North Sydney. It is just ridiculous for the honourable member for North Sydney to try to describe an amendment that his own minister and his own party are accepting as the tentacles of socialism here today. He seeks to say that the issues we are raising can, in some way, be dealt with through the normal regulatory powers. He nods his head in agreement with that. He is agreeing with himself. The problem he has not yet understood is that the telecommunications competition regime that his government has announced does not protect the subscribers in the way that they should. His government's telecommunications regime will allow Telstra to drop the price of local calls in his electorate, and Telstra will not be forced to drop the price of local calls in Bathurst in the electorate of Calare, or in Gladstone in the electorate of Hinkler, or even in Launceston in the electorate of the minister at the table. That is what the government's regulatory powers do not cover. That is why we say that, ultimately, the minister should be held accountable. In case people think that, in some way, the Labor Party is exaggerating the risk, let me remind the House that 10 days ago the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) also thought these protections were there. The Prime Minister misled his own party room when he gave this pledge, according to the Weekend Australian: ... Howard's pledge to the Government partyroom that those in remote areas will have all the ""whiz-bangery"" that the new technology has to offer-at the same price as those in the cities. So the Prime Minister even believed that protections were there 10 days ago. Yet after the Prime Minister got into trouble on Monday of this week in question time, the Australian stated on Tuesday: His office said later that local call charges would not be allowed to rise in regional Australia-or anywhere else-but the extent of price reductions could vary between areas. Further in the same article: The Minister for Communications, Senator Alston, has confirmed Telstra will be free to charge different prices for consumers in different towns when the industry is opened up to all-comers So your own Prime Minister and your own Minister for Communications (Senator Alston) have admitted that this can happen under your own new regulatory regime. There is no protection there. That is why you need to make sure the minister retains the power of direction. I would like to put three questions to the minister. I know other members might wish to jump to continue this debate but I would ask them to show some restraint and let us have the answer from the minister to these questions. Then perhaps they might jump after the minister. Having appealed for restraint from other members who might be about to jump, I would ask the minister if he might answer these questions. First of all, if Telstra does seek to introduce a charge for directory assistance, will the government use the minister's power of direction to stop them? Secondly, if Telstra tried to drop the price of local calls in Chatswood and in the suburbs where Optus is currently competing but not in the rest of Australia, will the minister issue a direction to make sure Telstra retains that standard 25c local call charge across the country? Thirdly, will the minister also give us an assurance that, if Telstra acts in any way that is against the public interest, the minister will issue a direction? Three simple questions: if Telstra introduces charging for directory assistance, if Telstra introduces differential pricing for what we now have as the standard uniform local all, or if Telstra acts against the public interest-will you use that power of direction? Will you protect the public interest? What is your answer, Minister? Are you prepared to answer now or are we going to have this debate go on all day? (Time expired)",43
50,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"When the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) said that the ALP was passionately dedicated to the public ownership of Telstra, it nearly took my breath away. I just remind the House of the long track record of his party in terms of the privatisation of public assets, with TAA, cities or Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. There is one defining difference between the two sides of the House: at least we went to an election saying exactly what we would do; you went to numerous elections telling people what you would not do and then sold the lot. You were only ever going to sell part of the Commonwealth Bank. You sold the lot! Mr Fitzgibbon-You've just done the same, though.",44
51,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"But we went to the public and told them what we were going to do. There is a vast chasm between what we did and told the public we would do and got an overwhelming mandate to do, a two to one mandate to do-and what you guys did.",44
52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Vaile)Order! The member will direct his remarks through the chair.,44
53,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"Those guys, Mr Deputy Speaker, went about doing the exact opposite-promising one thing and delivering another. If, member for Werriwa, you were so passionate about the public ownership of Telstra, why was it that, just prior to last election, you were prepared to sell off the technology division of Telstra with 400 jobs? You are not passionate about it at all. When it suits you to do something or sell something, you do it. The other thing I find breathtaking is that, while you talk about being passionate about the public ownership of Telstra and you talk about being passionate about defending the rights of the bush, how is it that you wouldn't support the $250 million telecommunications infrastructure fund? If you were really fair dinkum about rural Tasmania and rural western Queensland, which are probably the two most vulnerable parts of Australia in terms of telecommunications-not, I hasten to mention, through any fault of Telstra's but because of the geography of those areas-why didn't you support that fund? Quite frankly, you are all over the place like a mad dog's breakfast. Then the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) had the gall to come in here and do the Pontius Pilate act, saying, 'Really, I didn't want to have anything to do with the Commonwealth Bank.' Come on! Your party went to the 1993 election saying that they would not sell it. The closure of branches, much as I deplore it, be it Westpac, National, ANZ or the Commonwealth Bank-they're all the sameis a fact of life. Banking has changed immeasurably with the ATM, EFTPOS and a whole range of banking plastic and electronic banking. Things have changed. The member for Hunter asked me: 'What would you guys do about it? You've done nothing about it.' I happen to have done something about it. I ask my shire councils to buy the old banks and then to make them available to credit unions and building societies at peppercorn rents. By doing it that way, we have been able to introduce into at least two centres in my electorate a form of retail banking.",44
54,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,That's the agrarian socialist in you coming out. Mr Latham-The tentacles are out.,45
55,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"I don't mind. If it's wrapping the tentacles around the country people for their defence, I will wear that criticism as a badge of honour. Winding up on this little segment, I find this business about being passionately dedicated to the public ownership of Telstra overwhelming. If you guys fully expect the Australian public to believe that, then you're in cloud-cuckooland.  that we are degenerating into a degree of abuse in the Telstra debate and not really sticking with the issues. I will return to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), who called me a hypocrite. I did not seek to have that withdrawn, but I will address that in a minute. I noticed they wheeled out the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) to intervene in this debate on the issue of community service obligations. The basic text of what he was trying to advance is that there is no such thing as community service obligations. The Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who is at the table, well knows that when he was shadow minister there were studies done--one by the Bureau of Transport Economics, another by the Industry Commission and, of course, Telecom did its own study. There may be a debate about the size of community service obligations but there is no debate as to whether they exist, as the honourable member for O'Connor argues. I think that is absurd. I am surprised that he seeks to attack the report entitled Poles apart, which, from memory, was not dissented from by a coalition member at the time, whether they were of the socialist variety or the socialist hating variety. I have heard some absurd propositions advanced for the bush. The high priest of contestability, Henry Ergas, the mentor of the present minister, is one who has advanced a lot of crazy ideas, but the craziest idea was that we should actually set aside areas-like the electorate of the member for O'Connorrequiring infrastructure and put them up for the highest bidder. In other words, do not force Telecom to provide the service. That is absurd. Back to hypocrisy. I have only a couple of minutes to say that I defend every intervention I have made or association I have had in terms of communications changes. I have always sought to grow Telecom, to see it in a stronger position for a competitive environment. There ought to be some benchmarks so that when we return in the future we can see what has been accomplished. What is happening with research and development in communications? Will this increase dramatically as it has over the years, or will it be cut back? We know Telstra is presently cutting it back. What about the jobs? We can talk about the jobs being shed. I invite every opposition member to ring up their line depotMr Fitzgibbon-The member for O'Connor said it doesn't matter.  matter. But you should ring your line depot and find out whether it will be closed in preparation for privatisation or whether it will be downsized-and what effect that will have on waiting times. Let us see what happens in relation to employment. As far as industry and exports are concerned, whatever abuse you heap on us about our time in government, communications exports soared. We have seen modest, minuscule Australian companies grow, spending a disproportionate amount of their revenue on research and development, exporting like crazy-read the MCKinsey report, for goodness sake. Let us have that as a benchmark. What happens to Australian owned companies and exports if we do not secure that, if all we do is have this lean, mean machine importing equipment from overseas? You are cutting out generations of Australians from future jobs. Let us see how technology is opened up for all Australians, whether they are sighted, disabled or able; whether they live in rich areas like the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey); whether they come from urban poor areas like mine; or whether they come from regional electorates like the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren), the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) and the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). Let us see how they go, whether they are going to be advantaged by all these changes. Mr Fitzgibbon-But the member for North Sydney doesn't care about that.  member for North Sydney is concerned about is the dollars that they get and the slush funds they put part of the money into. What he is not concerned about is this industry and this opportunity to provide for the future, the fastest growing industry in Australia-(Time expired) Mr Hockey-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do take offence at that allegation that all I care about is the money.",45
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Vail e)There is no point of order.,46
57,Mr ANDREN,COMMITTEES,"I think both sides have taken a high moral ground in this argument and neither side of politics in this country can take any high ground because they are both guilty of deceit. The sale by the Labor Party of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, and the privatisation program it embarked on-continued by this government-are going to impact on regional Australia in a way that perhaps will not be shown until many years down the track. I just want to concentrate on one thing in this debate on Telstra because the vote has been lost by those of us who wish that Telstra would remain in public hands. That billion dollar trust being set up for the environment is an absolute fraud. I wanted to ask the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) the other day, but I did not get the opportunity: does he realise that it costs a dollar wholesale for one root stock to be planted out there in the countryside? There are one billion trees available from this billion dollar fund. We have already embarked on a billion tree planting which is yet to show any sign on the horizon of any impact on the enormity of the environmental problems facing us out there. When I made a speech in this House on the heritage bill, on the need to improve our spending on and our commitment to the environment, I mentioned the Murray-Darling alone as of such enormous environmental consequence that it would not be a 2001 project we should embark on but a 2101 project. The former spokesman for the opposition, the member for Barker, Mr MCLachlan, came up to me afterwards and agreed that it is a 100-year at least project that we are looking at in the Murray-Darling alone, if I remember his statements correctly. This billion dollar trust, part of which has already been committed, will go absolutely nowhere. To show just what sort of a fraud this billion dollar trust fund is and how much we have given away to establish it, I will read from Chain Reaction, a magazine I received yesterday. It states: The Howard Government's proposed Natural Heritage Trust is a 'blatant and cynical political fraud', a senior Government adviser has admitted to Scitech. He said the policy-the Coalition's claimed answer to rectifying Australia's enormous environmental problems-was 'invented overnight' as a mea-s of a-tempting to soften potential public reactIOn agaInst the planned sale of one-third of Telstra. The plan had been essentially devised-as a 'purely political exercise' - by the Federal of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb, and had then been 'imposed' on the former shadow Minister ... Senator Rod Kemp, and subsequently, on ... Senator Robert Hill ... T.he adviser said Coalition MPs openly joked behInd closed doors about the policy and admitted to the fact that it could not possibly-in its form or size-make any serious impact on the n--ion'- massive problems of land degradation, ailing nvers, and loss of biodiversity. Mr Fitzgibbon-That says it all.",46
58,Mr ANDREN,COMMITTEES,"That does say it all. The article also said about the adviser: He said the extent of the deceit had 'sickened' him. That is the sort of hypocrisy we have in the establishment of this fraud. I have argued strongly, as did Senator Kernot when she took up this argument, that we should have established a $250 million per year quarantined fund f?r the environment if we had any real commltment to the environment. I have argued for the retention of Telstra on a jobs basis in regional Australia, as a community service obligation and as a cross-subsidisation factor to the telephony services which will not be delivered in a private market and will not be delivered by market forces because the profit margin is just not out there. I think the export earnings we could have earned from a publicly retained Telstra are obvious. There is $2 trillion worth of business out there in Asia over the next 10 years of which Telstra will be part. But, unfortunately, the Australian shareholders, those who own those shares now in that publicly owned corporation will not enjoy that. That is the price. That is what we have given away and that is why I am so impassioned not only about the destruction of this publicly owned institution but also that the billion dollar fund is a fraud. Where do we go after that to fund the environment? I am as committed to the environment as the next person-I think perhaps more than most-having watched the degradation of the environment in my region over 20 years. I know what the problems are as do the people out there. If you claim it is a mandate to give away a third of Telstra I say: think again. '",47
59,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"Werriwa) (12.14 p.m.)The member for Calare (Mr Andren) is Director correct: coalition members believe in the Na-ural . Heritage Trust only because they beheve m the sale of Telstra. Coalition members believe in the regional telecommunications fund only because they believe in the sale of Telstra. In believing in the sale of current Telstra they are wrong because they are ripping away the tiers of the safety net that provide protection for people in regional Australia in the basic service of telecommunications. They are ripping away the first tier of t-e safety net-public ownership-and rippmg away the second tier by talking down instead of talking up the provisions and use o- sectio? 183. Initially, in the Senate they tned to np away the third and last tier of the safety net, the ministerial directives. That is why it is so important for this House to restore the ministerial directives to the coalition's bill. The ministerial directives are - aramount and critical because they are the mstrument by which government, in quality hands, can actually provide universal service obligations and provisions for regional Australia. Australia is a unique country . We do not easily fit the textbook economic model. Australia is a large country geographically with dispersed centres of population and economic activity. In those circumstances, there is an extra role for government in funding the additional cost of distance-the cost of distance and service provisions that the free market alone will not provide. The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) has adopted the fatal flaw of the free market model for the distribution of services and universality in Australia. He will need to rename his society from 'John Stuart Mill' to 'Adam Smith'. He needs to recognise that the so-called tentacles of socialism are very important in funding the extra cost of distance in a country as large as ours. If government does not fund the extra cost of distance in telecommunications, railways, transport and all the basic services in regional Australia, the free market will not. That is why it is paramount to have ministerial directives by which universality can be imposed upon the new board of Telstra. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) so correctly asked the minister at the table, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), to answer these three points: will this government apply ministerial directives to the charges for directory assistance; will this government apply ministerial directives to the uniform local call rate; and will this government apply ministerial directives for any other public interest consideration coming before the new board of Telstra? They are the three points that the minister needs to address in his final statement to the House. Other than that, I express the concern of the Labor Party that so many tiers of the safety net have been ripped away for regional Australia. Regional Australia has suffered enough at the hands of this government without losing the strength of the universal service obligations in telecommunications. Take one seat in regional Australia, the seat of Dawson, and you will find: the closure of the Taxation Office and Family Court facilities; the abolition of regional development programs; the loss of university and employment funding and programs; the reef tax hurting tourism; the loss of taxation concessions for cooperative companiesMr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: this is totally unrelated to the context of the amendment.",47
60,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Vaile)Order! A point of order has been raised on the ground of relevance. I draw the attention of the member for Werriwa to the amendment.,48
61,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"And now we have the weakening of the universal service obligation. To get a telephone line through in Mackay, in the seat of Dawson, there is a $750 government subsidy. That is now at risk-on top of all the other cuts to regional development. It is no wonder that so many people in regional Australia are looking at the lack of representation from members of the National Party-like the member for Dawson (Mrs DeAnne Kelly)-and the lack of representation from members of the Liberal Party, and are looking again to the Australian Labor Party to recognise that the additional costs of distance are a legitimate role for the public sector. If government does not fund universality and service provisions on a regional scale, the free market will not. That is why these ministerial directives are absolutely critical to maintaining the strength of service provisions and that sense of sameness, that all Australians should have the same access to the basics of life-banking, transport, communications and, in this case, the local telephone service. Let's keep the ministerial directives and, more importantly, let's have a minister willing to commit this government to their effective use.",48
62,Mr WARWICK SMITH,COMMITTEES,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (12.19 p.m.)- Mr Deputy Speaker, we have had a longer debate than was anticipated but I thank members on both sides, and the Independent member for Calare (Mr Andren), for their contributions. It is recognised that the Senate amendments17 in total-to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 are a significant issue. I indicated earlier in the day that the government will accept the amendments and, since the opposition have indicated that they will accept the amendments, they will pass. There has been a great range of debate, much of it covered in previous debates, and some of it, I do not doubt, will be covered in further debate about the post-1997 arrangements for the telecommunications industry. I want to make only a couple of points. The first is the question of ministerial direction, which is amendment No. 17. We will be accepting that amendment and it will pass. That effectively means that the power of direction will be part of the regime that will emerge from the legislative process. The power of direction is a statutory power that has not been exercised in the past. As to the questions raised by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), the government's expectation is that any public interest controlswhich is fundamentally what they were asking about-would be exercised through the regulatory mechanisms, which apply to all carriers. If the government sought to exercise any control over Telstra in its capacity as a shareholder, it would do so by exercising the rights attaching to the two-thirds of the shares owned, not by exercising the power of direction. Secondly, and also in respect of amendment No. 17, which is a key amendment, the government will seek further advice on the operation of the Corporations Law-the requirements of disclosure and the prospectus, and the requirements of the stock exchange as to where those securities are to be listed. You would appreciate that that is an issue on which we would take further advice. As I said, the government is prepared to accept the amendments. I do not want to enter into the other debates about regional funding and the Natural Heritage Trust, and so on. Those matters are best left for another time. This is a very significant point in the consideration of the telecommunications legislation. Those who have been following this debate for some time will appreciate that fact. By accepting the Senate's amendments, the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 will become law and the one-third sale of Telstra will proceed. I thank members for their contributions to date, even though at times they were not relevant and went over time. All in all, democracy has taken its course today. Question resolved in the affirmative. FLAGS AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 December, on motion by Mr Jull: That the bill be now read a second time.",48
63,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"In winding up my presentation on the Flags Amendment Bill, I would just like to retrace what I have said. Flags have been around since II22BC and have always been the insignia of leadership. We have talked about the development of the Australian flag from its earliest manifestations in the era of 1606I traced it from then right through to today. I point out too that that has carried with it the development of our legal and parliamentary codes, and for that reason the flag has a very important position in our democracy. There is one aspect that I have not spoken about that I would like to touch on briefly before I finish. That is, the flag, as an insignia of leadership, as the embodiment of the history and the character of the nation, is the thing that we carry into battle. Although the flag perhaps does not have the same significance in this mechanised and atomic age that it might have had in the past, it is still very much an important symbol to those who have served in the Australian forces. The flag was always used as a symbol of identifying friend or foe. It was a rallying point-was it not?-in battles. Even as recently as the Second World War, there were a number of occasions where battles were turned with some young soldier racing forward with the national flag, a banner, and using that as a rallying point for troops. For that reason, one can understand that the many RSL sub-branches around Australia have a great affection for this flag. The people they represent have played a significant part in defending that flag not just with words and not just with deeds but with their sheer physical effort, many times with their imprisonment and still, more importantly, on many occasions with their lives. Last year during the Australia Remembers activities I met with RSL clubs in little communities like Eidsvold, Monto, Childers, Gin Gin, Miriam Vale, Calliope, Biloela, even those in little mining towns like Moura and those in the bigger centres like Bundaberg and Gladstone. I noticed that wherever I went there was a universality of affection for our flag and what it represented. Therefore, if we are planning to change the flag, we need to have mechanisms in place that ensure that the Australian population as a whole has a say in how that would happen. One of the great tragedies of this era that we have lived in-where we have discussed the republic, the constitution and the flaghas been the way many people, including the former Prime Minister, have made light of our symbols, criticised them overseas and played with them in the parliament. With this Flags Amendment Bill 1996, we have laid down very clearly once and for all that this flag can be changed only by a majority of the electors in the states and territories and that they must be given a choice between the current Australian flag-the one that is viewed with so much affection-and other flags, and that whichever flag is chosen will become the flag of this country. It also provides the mechanisms whereby such a referendum would occur, and they appear under proposed subsection 3(2) and proposed subsection 3(3) of the bill. Finally, although I have a great affection for this flag-I recognise the price in blood that has been paid to defend it, I recognise the history that it contains, I recognise the character that it embodies-if under this bill a majority of Australians decide they do want to change it, I will be satisfied that it is a full and frank expression of the national will, and that is something that I would readily embrace. In the meantime, I believe that we have been well served by this flag and that it should be retained and be recognised with a place of honour in this nation.",49
64,Mr BARRESI,COMMITTEES,"I rise with great pleasure to speak on the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. Following on from the comments of the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) in which he displayed his affection for the flag, I too concur with those comments that the Australian flag-although it has been officially with us in terms of being proclaimed only since 1953-is a flag which has certainly touched the hearts and won the affection of all Australians. I want to speak to this bill as a sign of my support for the current flag and the pride that I have when displaying it, be it in my office or in the presence of the local RSL communities or even seeing it displayed in this chamber. The key intent of the bill is to reflect the intention of the Australian national flag belonging to the Australian people. The Australian people, not the parliament, have a right to be consulted in any proposal to change our flag. This bill provides the parliament with a means to give the people of Australia a guarantee that, if they determine a change is needed, the current flag will always be included in any vote. It does not really matter to a great extent whether I have an affection for the flag, whether I agree with the flag, whether I like the design or not-even though I would like to convey my opinion on the matter-but it does matter whether or not the other 181;2 million people in Australia have an affection for the flag and whether or not they wish to retain the flag and see it flown over our buildings and our institutions. It is their wish that must be abided by. It is their confidence that we need to take into account when looking at designs of flags and whether or not the flag should in fact be amended. When announcing the government's intention to introduce this legislation, the Prime Minister, John Howard, on ANZAC Day earlier this year, said: This will mean that no politician, no political party and no special interest group will be able to tamper with the design of our flag. That is exactly what the intent is. While at this stage we have the Australian Labor Party and a whole lot of other groups saying that they have no intention of tampering with the flag, I am not so sure what the situation will be in years to come. Will legislators in the future have that same desire not to tamper with our flag? I am not confident of that eventuality and I want to make sure that the flag is protected against that level of tampering. The Flags Amendment Bill 1996 amends the Flags Act 1953 by providing that the present Australian national flag can only be replaced if a majority of state and territory electors agree. The Flags Act 1953 formerly established the Commonwealth blue ensign as the Australian national flag. At that time, the then Prime Minister Robert Menzies, in his second reading speech, said: The bill is very largely a formal measure which puts into legislative form what has become almost the established practice in Australia. I say this for a very important reason. Many on the Labor side-detractors of the Australian flag---claim that the flag has only been with us since 1953 and that Australians have not fought under the flag. They have fought under the American flag, the British flag and the South African flag, but not the Australian flag. What happened in 1953 was merely a formalisation of what had taken place in previous years. The current Australian flag flew over the site for the national capital as early as 1908, on the first ships of the new navy in 1910 and at the first Australian base on the Antarctic continent-that white expanse to our south-in 1911. Since 1953, it has been flown continuously by all our territories and states, including the Australian Antarctic bases. It is fair to say that all Australians will have a chance to decide on the change to one of the most important national symbols-our flag. The history of the flag must also be recognised and mentioned in this debate. I would like to refer in part to it. When six Australian colonies federated to form a single Commonwealth on 1 January 1901, a new nation was born and a new century was heralded. At that time there was an urgent demand for a new emblem. An official competition was arranged for a design which attracted 32,823 entries. Five of these, which submitted almost identical designs, were placed equal first. Apart from later changes in the magnitudes of the stars and the number of points, they produced the present Australian flag. The new flag heralded Australia's entry into nationhood. The flag is an important symbol that has been flown in this country for many years. One of the most symbolic displays of the Australian flag is often attributed to sporting events and, in particular, to the Olympic games. It is interesting to note that since 1908 it has been raised for medal winners at every Olympic Games-a long tradition with this nation and a tradition that must be upheld. Younger people identify the flag with Australia's sporting success and achievement. They see their sporting heroes wrapping themselves in the flag. It is an unashamed display of pride in being Australian, pride in the flag and in what it symbolises. Who could forget the emotional scenes during the Atlanta Olympics when our sporting heroes had the flag raised. Cathy Freeman, from my electorate, wrapped herself in the flag. While there have been those who have criticised sporting heroes like Cathy Freeman for running around the track with an Aboriginal flag, the national Australian flag has always been present. Cathy Freeman has expressed the pride she has in displaying the Australian flag-and so it should be. In my 10 months as the member for Deakin, I have had the pleasure of being part of numerous school flag presentations. It is not unique. Every member in this chamber is called on from time to time to present school flags to exchange students going overseas. now When you unfurl the flag to have a photo taken, you can see the beam on their faces. They have great pride at being Australian and in being able to take this symbol overseas. The students that I presented with flags have gone to countries such as Germany, the United States, Italy, Spain and Portugalsome have gone to the Paralympics. They have all had the flag to take with them as a reminder of their nation, their culture and their identity. The exchange students have used the flag as a gift for their host families. These young Australians are proud ambassadors of our country. They take with them the Australian flag and symbols kits as a means to educate their hosts on who we are and what our emblems are all about. The flag is very important for, every day, it represents us in hundreds of places around the world. We may not have paid diplomats or peacekeeping soldiers in these places but we have ordinary Australians overseas who proudly display the national flag-young and old alike. Its mere presence overseas is a simple but potent reminder of where we live, who we are and our role in the international community. At citizenship and other ceremonies, emotion wells up when the flag is raised on the flagpole. As Australians we need these symbols. Although symbols may be changed and symbols may be introduced as we progress through generations, the symbols of the past must be retained. One of the symbols that emerges from time to time and that people say we should have some attachment to is the boxing kangaroo. The boxing kangaroo was a powerful symbol for that period in history when a certain event took place. We have symbols in the form of songs which we hear every now and then. One example is the song, I still call Australia home, by great Australian singer and song writer Peter Allan. That conjures up high emotions when we hear it. Mr Hockey-'C'mon Aussie c'mon'.",50
65,Mr BARRESI,COMMITTEES,"The member for North Sydney reminds me of 'C'mon Aussie c'mon'. These are very powerful symbols which are relevant for young and old Australians alike. The flag was our national tag in battle. Hundreds of thousands of Australians have fought under it outside Australian territory. The emotional significance of this fact must never be forgotten. As I go around to the various RSLs in my electorate-the Mitcham, Blackburn, Croydon and Ringwood RSLs-and as I watch veterans march down the streets to their memorials one can see the unashamed display and identification with this flag that takes place. It would be betraying these people if future legislators changed this national symbol without the Australian population being considered when designing a future flag. This bill gives power to the people in making changes to our flag if and when required. I have spoken about the symbolism of the flag in the past. As we are becoming more global and opening up our borders-we see this in Europe and with the various trade pacts with NAFTA and APEC-we are becoming a more unified world. It tends to make us want to revert to some of the more tribal and more traditional ties that we have. We see this taking place in Europe. I refer particularly to the regionality that is taking place, whether in Italy, Spain, Holland or eastern Europe. As the borders are coming down people are looking for symbols and ties and they say, 'Yes, I am European or Australian or American.' They can then say that they are from a particularly territory. In Spain are Catalonians. In northern Italy we are starting to see the emergence of the Northern League as a means of identification and unification. These things will happen as we move towards a more globalised world. Symbolism is important. Identification with our flag will have even greater prominence as a symbol of who we are in the world. As I said earlier, we should retain our flag with great pride. The main argument I hear from those opposite is that the blue is great, the Southern Cross is great because it symbolises where we are in the world, the seven pointed star is fine as the points represent the states and territories, but it is the little thing in the left hand corner that they do not like because it represents a colonial past which we must get rid of. As someone who does not come from Ireland, Scotland or England and does not have any ancestors from that particular part of the world, but whose ancestors are from Europe, I look at the flag as an entire entity. I do not consider the flag to be broken up into three separate components. I consider the flag in its entirety. I look at it and say, 'That is my flag.' I am proud of that flag. I do not say, 'There is the Union Jack in the corner. I cannot have that because I am not British.' That is an absurd argument. It reflects on where we have come from. The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) made the point, when responding to a comment by a member relating to a seven-year-old child saying, 'Why change our flag? It is our flag after all' about whether that seven-year-old child would have the same views when he is 17, 27 or 57 years of age. I say to the member for Throsby that a flag is not something that you discard like clothing because all of a sudden you have grown out of it. A flag symbolises a nation in its entirety. In 10, 20 or 50 years time are we expected to change our flag and our symbols? Are we to end up with roving symbols of a nation, symbols which reflect how we feel at the time and the mood of the legislators? Support for the flag is fairly widespread. An AGB MCNair poll taken on 26 to 28 June this year asked 2,057 voters whether they thought they the Australian flag should be changed. Some 66 per cent said no, 27 per cent said yes and seven per cent did not know. Subsequent public opinion polls, whether they be Morgan or AGB MCNair polls, have come up with similar figures. Two-thirds of Australian people do not want our flag changed. It is a powerful statement. This result has been consistent all the way through. Mr Martin-It just looks like New Zealand's.",52
66,Mr BARRESI,COMMITTEES,"The member for Cunningham says that it is just like New Zealand's. The member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), who is not in the chamber at the moment, raised the issue in his speech-and I am sorry that the member for Cunningham was not in the chamber at that time. Should we change our flag just because it is similar to New Zealand's and someone was embarrassed when they were overseas and the New Zealand flag went up rather than the Australian flag? If embarrassment is caused by that, then it should not be Australia that is embarrassed but the host who did not know what flag to put up. There are many flags around the world that are very similar. Tricolour flags are very common. The colours can either be horizontal or vertical. I do not know the difference between a lot of them. I know that many people in this chamber would not know the difference between a lot of them. The member for Hinkler rightly referred to flags from Germany and Scandinavia as being very similar to other flags. Does it mean that those countries should change their flags because there is some confusion in the minds of foreign visitors and dignitaries about what flag they fly? It is absurd to suggest that we should change our flag because it is similar New Zealand's. As we move towards a global community and as people come to know what Australia is-that we are not Austria-and that we are in the Southern Hemisphere, there will be a recognition of all our symbols, rather than Australia simply being recognised as a country where kangaroos hop down Pitt Street. Every now and then the Ausflag committee comes up with various designs. I have some designs in front of me at the moment. They are not unattractive designs. Some look like they would make very good rugby tops; some look like they would make very good symbols for a footy team. But they are not our flag. The symbols that often come up on these flags are symbols such as the Southern Cross-we have got the Southern Cross; another is the seven point star-we have got the seven point star; another is the kangaroo-the kangaroo is represented in our coat of arms, and rightly so. There is already a place for those symbols. Some people say that we should have a green and gold flag. The green and gold is already embodied in one of our other symbols-the national colours. Some even raise the issue of the Union Jack not being ours. One of our national symbols is the golden wattle, but let us look at where the golden wattle is distributed on the Australian continent. It does not exist in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland or Tasmania. It partly touches the southern comer of South Australia. Does that mean that the people of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and Tasmania are unrepresented in our floral emblem? Of course it does not. These symbols are representative. They are part of our identity, whether or not we have a direct connection with one of them because of our ethnicity or geography. In making this legislative change, the Howard government seeks to end the process of removing by stealth, without consultation, important symbolic practices and traditions. Changes that took place under the previous government included removing the portrait of the Queen and removing the use of the word 'royal' in official government titles and to institutions. I commend this bill to the House.",53
67,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. I do not intend to speak for long. It is with great pri?e that I rise to support the bill. It does nothlOg more nor less than put in the people's hands the power to decide whether the flag is going to be changed. This bill came about because of the fear that was placed in the Australian people and in coalition members when the ALP were in government that they would change the flag without reference to the people. They had in the past made various changes to national symbols and national colours without proper reference to the people. While I did not disagree with many of those decisions, I believe that the people should always be consulted on these matters. In this bill we are simply saying to the Australian people, 'If you want to change your flag, whatever your opinion is, well and good. But that decision is not one for the parliament. That decision is one for the people of Australia.' I do not think that anybody could object to that course of action being taken. There has been a tactic around to denigrate the Union Jack, as it is sometimes called, taking up a quarter of the flag in the top-left hand comer. It has been a symbol ridiculed by some. They have said it is outdated, that it is a cause of shame in this country and therefore, we have to change the flag. To me it has meant something else. We are basically still an Anglo-Celtic country, though that is changing, and there is nothing wrong with that. But the system of justice that we have in this country that has served us so well, for all its faults, comes from the United Kingdom. Our system of democracy, which I will admit we sometimes take too much for granted in this country, largely comes from that part of the world. Our system of education, for all its faults, comes from that part of the world. The language that we predominantly speak in this country, our official language-the English language--comes from that part of the world. So much of every day life, so much of the good things that we enjoy, so much of our traditional basis and standard of living, come from that part of the world. Whether you come from Italy, as the previous speaker did, or Macedonia, Albania, Cuba, Ethiopia-or even England and Ireland, as my forbears did-it is undeniable that this country has been shaped, rightly or wrongly, by the influx of people from that part of the world. That was recognised when the flag was put in place at the beginning of this century by having the Union Jack-the Union Flag, as it is sometimes called-in the top-left hand comer of the Australian flag. I do not see anything wrong with it. Some people think it means that we are somehow subservient or still tied to the apron strings of England, that it is a thing of shame, that it represents a cultural cringe in this country. While I can see some validity in that argument, I think it means quite the reverse. It should show, if it does not, that we are a mature society, that we are very confident in ourselves and that we are Australians. All it represents is the heritage which exists in this country and which I mentioned earlier. It does not mean that we are subservient to England or anything else of the type. We are, to a large extent, a multicultural society in this country and we are becoming more so. We have a mix of blood from 150 to 170 countries running in our veins. Those that, people came here by choice. They came here by choice because they looked at Australia and saw that it was good place and, in most cases, a better place than that whence they came. They came knowing that the Union Jack flies in the comer of our flag and, to a large extent, they are quite happy with that. I would also like to comment on the fact that it is a very beautiful flag. I had not fully appreciated that, I have to say, until this debate sprang up in the last decade or so and I looked at some of the suggestions that have been put forward if we are going to change our flag to another flag. For the first time in my life I realised how difficult it is to design a flag which is acceptable to everyone and, at the same time, pleasing to the eye. Some of the suggestions put up, for example, by the Ausflag competition are quite ludicrous. Most countries in the world-I have only just consciously come to realisehave only two or three stripes running horizontally, vertically or, sometimes, diagonally across their flag. With the odd exception, such as France, which is well known because of the Tricolour-the red, white and blueyou would not have the faintest idea which country those flags represent. It is very confusing indeed. They seem to have every combination of colour running in every possible direction for no particular reason. Ours is a very distinctive flag. There are that many countries in the world that have very distinctive flags with symbols on them which actually mean something, which represent the people who live in the country and their traditions. One of the latest flags to be designed is the present flag of South Africa, which is very distinctive. It is a very complex flag, but it represents the many peoples who live in that country and the things that that country stands for. I think that is a very good flag. It is an example where a flag that has been changed with very good reason seems to be working very well. Perhaps, in the future, someone will design such a flag for Australia. All we are asking for in this bill is that that design be put forward to the Australian people and let a majority of the Australian people in a majority of states vote on that. If that is the will the Australian people, I, as a person who stands up for democracy, am prepared to go along with that. At present, I am quite content with the flag we have. The previous speaker had a bit of argybargy with some people across the chamber that our flag was very similar to the flag of New Zealand, and I acknowledge that point. It is a valid point, but I do not necessarily think we should change our flag because it is similar to the flag of some other country. It would be a bit like changing our name because the name of Australia is an Anglo name, it is not an Aboriginal name, and it is a name that is very similar to another country's name, namely, Austria. I suppose that is a valid point of view to put forward, but I happen to be one who is very proud of the name Australia. A lot of the great countries of the world have names that begin with A and end in the letter A, such as America, Asia, Africa, Antarctica, et ceteraand Austria, for that matter. Just because we have a name similar to that of another country in the world, I do not think we necessarily should have to change it. The polls that have been conducted on this seem to run consistently very strongly in favour of retaining the Australian flag. While that continues to be the case, I do not think the Australian flag will be changed. That is not not to say that in 25, 50, 100 or 1,000 years time we may change to another flag. It happened in Canada. It was done relatively successfully there and, as I have said, it has happened in South Africa, with good reason. But there does not seem to be that imperative in Australia today. Before I finish my speech, I would like to make some comments on another phenomenon that is sometimes associated with our flag-that is, the fact that some people, on occasion, choose to desecrate our flag. They often bum it in public to gain publicity for the particular cause that they are championing at the time. I think this is a very cheap way to get publicity-to desecrate Australia's great national symbol in such a manner. Other countries, not Australia, have penalof ties for doing this. For example, our near neighbour New Zealand has a penalty for doing it. Norway has a penalty for doing it. Many other countries have penalties for doing it. They vary from fines right through to, in totalitarian countries, where you are virtually shot. It is regarded as a traitorous act. I have introduced into the parliament a private member's bill to say that perhaps we should have penalties in this country for desecrating the flag. There are arguments on both sides as to whether we should or whether we should not. I want to say that people who desecrate the flag with impunity, for whatever reason, should give very serious consideration before doing so. If they are doing it because they do not like the flag, I think that they should lobby legitimately in a democratic country to change the flag in a proper and a mature way. If they are doing it because they are championing some other cause, then I believe that they should not use the flag in this way, because it offends many people. We should respect the flag, whatever else we might think of it, and we should respect the thoughts of others. Some say it is just a piece of cloth. If you say that it is just a piece of cloth, you have not got a soul. It represents much more than that. I conclude by reading the poem Keep the Flag into the Hansard. It was written anonymously. It says: The Flag bears the stars that blaze at night In our Southern sky of blue And a little old flag in the corner, That's part of our heritage too. It's for the English, the Scots and the Irish Who were sent to the ends of the earth, The rogues and the schemers, the doers and dreamers Who gave modem Australia birth. And you who are shouting to change it You don't seem to understand, It's the FLAG of our law and our language, Not the Flag of some faraway land. Though there are plenty of people who'll tell How when Europe was plunged into night, That little old FLAG in the corner Was their symbol of freedom and light. It doesn't mean we owe allegiance To a forgotten imperial dream; We've the stars to show where we are going AFld the FLAG to show where we've been.",53
68,Mr MOORE,COMMITTEES,"In winding up the debate, I thank all those who have taken part. The list of speakers has been long and this debate has certainly engendered a lot of interest amongst government speakers. I am sure that every aspect of the flag's history has been covered. Those who took part certainly showed genuine support of and feelings for the Australian flag. I now wind up the debate.",56
69,Mrs BAILEY,COMMITTEES,"I rise in support of the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Flags Act 1953 to ensure that the current Australian national flag can only be replaced if a majority of voters in all states and territories agree. This bill seeks to protect Australia's greatest national symbol, our national flag. It means that no government can legislate to replace the flag without first receiving approval from the Australian public, voting at a referendum or a plebiscite. This is the way it should be, for the government does not own the flag-it belongs to the people of Australia. It is a symbol of who we are and where we have come from. It is the one thing that unites us all as Australians and, therefore, we should all have a say in whether it should be changed. Before Federation, the Union Jack was the official flag of the six Australian colonies. However, with Federation, a new nation was born. With it came the urgent need for a new emblem to represent that nation. Shortly before the opening of the first parliament in 1901, the Commonwealth government decided to hold a competition to design two flagsone for official and naval purposes and the other for merchant ships. This competition was run in conjunction with one conducted by a newspaper called the you, Review of Reviews. The competition attracted more than 32,000 entries from throughout Australia and around the world, from people of all ages and backgrounds. The entries received were many and varied, ranging from the stately and expected to the more peculiar-such as native animals playing cricket with a winged cricket ball. Five designs, which were almost identical, were selected as equal first and shared the £200 prize money. The winning designs were named the Australian red and blue ensigns. On 3 September 1901, Prime Minister Edmund Barton announced the winners of the national flag competition. A flag of the winning design was flown on the Exhibition Building in Melbourne. This design was exceedingly similar to the one we fly proudly today. Under the union of the British blue ensign was a large white star with six points representing the six states. In the fly of the flag there were five white stars representing the Southern Cross. I am both pleased and proud that, 95 years on, the Howard government has officially proclaimed 3 September as National Flag Day, so we will always remember the birthday of our most important national symbol. In February 1903, it was announced in the Commonwealth Gazette that King Edward VII had approved a design for the flag of Australia and also one for the flag of the merchant navy. Since then, the Australian national flag has remained largely unchanged. The only alteration in this time was made in 1908 with the addition of a seventh point to the Commonwealth star to symbolise the Commonwealth territories. The only alteration at this time was made in 1908, with the addition of a seventh point to the Commonwealth star to symbolise the Commonwealth territories. The new flag heralded Australia's birth as a nation. It flew over the site for the national capital at Canberra in 1908, and at the opening of both the old and new parliament houses in Canberra in 1927 and 1988 respectively. It flew on the f-rst ships of. the new navy in 1910, and at the fIrst Austrahan base on the Antarctic continent in 1911. Since 1908, it has also been raised for our medal winners at every Olympic Games. In 19-6, i- flew with pride as the flag of the host natIOn m Melbourne, and it will do so again in Sydney in 2000. The flag has also been carried into battle by the cruiser HMAS Sydney in the first naval battle of World War I, by the ANZACs who landed on the beaches at Gallipoli and by the diggers who were victorious in France in 1917 and 1918. In World War II, when Singapore was retaken in 1945, the first flag to be flown was an Austr-lian flag secretly made by Australian pnsoners of war inside a Japanese prison camp. The men risked instant execution if found out, but made the ensign to help boost morale. When the camp was liberated the flag was proudly flown, a symbol of hope and freedom. The flag was also carried into the jungle battles of the Vietnam War and into the recent Gulf War. It is true that nothing symbolises a nation like its flag, and the Australian flag is firmly entrenched as one of our most cherished institutions. When we think of Australia our identity and national pride, one of the' first things that comes to mind is our flag. Some of our greatest achievements as a nation have been made with an Australian flag in sight. Who can forget the emotion and sense of pride we feel as we see our country's flag hoisted high during a medal ceremony at an Olympic or Commonwealth games, or when Australia's first astronaut, Andy Collins, proudly flew the flag in space; or the patriotIsm we felt when champions such as the Oarsome Foursome, Kieren Perkins or Cathy Freeman draped themselves in the Australian flag after winning their respective medals at this year's Atlanta Olympics; or the pride we feel when we see thousands of children and adults line. the streets of cities and country towns wavmg our flag during ANZAC parades, welcome home parades for our Olympians and the Australia Remembers parades of last year? Who can forget that emotional moment a- the closing ceremony of the Atlanta OlympICS when the Australian flag was raised to the - hee-s of the thousands of people at the stadIUm m honour of the host nation of the 2000 Olympics? Our flag is an authentic home-grown symbol of our nation. Despite claims to the contrary, there was no requirement in the official.-les of the government's original flag competItIOn for there to be a Union Jack in the design. It was put there by the designers themselves and chosen unanimously by seven judges, representative of all Australians. It is true that until 1953, when the Flags Act formally established the Blue Ensign as the Australian national flag and prescribed the Red Ensign as the proper flag for merchant ships, there was some confusion about which flag could be flown publicly. Many people were uncertain whether the blue could be flown publicly or was restricted to official and government purposes. Before the Flags Act became law, both Prime Minister Robert Menzies and Prime Minister Ben Chifley issued press statements encouraging the Australian public to fly the blue ensign freely. The Menzies government also began issuing flags to all public schools and community groups, and directed that the flag be flown by all Commonwealth government departments. This tradition is continued today by the Howard government. We continue to promote the flag by enabling members of parliament and senators to issue Australian flags free of charge to all schools, local councils, churches and other non-profit or benevolent community organisations. In my electorate of MCEwen I have received hundreds of requests for flags from community groups and schools within my electorate since the last election, and also from individuals who have been chosen to represent Australia overseas on exchange or study programs. Every time. I present an Australian flag to a group in MCEwen I am constantly struck by the level of pride shown in our flag, whether it is by older Australians, such as members of the Broadford Senior Citizens' Club, or by a young Australian like Daniel Proud from Nagambie Primary School. The Australian flag is much more than the Union Jack, the Southern Cross and the Commonwealth Star on a blue background. It is a reflection of our national pride and evokes memories of times when we are uniquely proud to be Australian-in war, in sport, in great achievements and memorable events. It is indeed unfortunate that many people, particularly members of the opposition, have in the past tried to dissect our flag and deem it unsuitable or no longer relevant. I refer in particular to one statement by Senator Chris Schacht who told Channel 9's A Current Affair program in 1992: We haven't yet defined our image of who we are and it is very confusing having a flag which gives pride of place in the top left-hand corner to the of another country and I think that it is a confusing image anywhere in the world. It may be confusing to Senator Schacht and other members of the opposition but it is certainly not confusing to me or to the majority of Australians. Almost every opinion poll conducted over the past 17 years has shown that a majority of Australians wish to retain the current flag. This overwhelming support for the current flag should be a strong indicator to this government and to future governments that the people should have a direct say in any proposal to change the current Australian flag. People in my electorate of MCEwen agree. During my travels around my electorate, not only to present flags but to attend a multitude of functions, people of all ages have spoken of their love for the current flag and of their desire to be consulted before any changes are made. To give an example, one student from Yarra Glen said to me: More than any other emblem that captures the nation, I identify with the Australian flag as a symbol which not only represents our past, but one which will carry us through to the next century. I understand that there are people today who question the relevance of the flag or that would seek to include or exclude certain particular aspects. However, I would hesitate to make permanent ch-nges without consulting the body of people WhICh would be most affected-the Australian public. Australians were directly involved in the initial search for an Australian flag 95 years ago. Therefore, why should they not be given a say in any move to introduce a new flag? Australians have a right to decide what their greatest national symbol should be. They should not have change forced down their throats just for the sake of change. Our flag does not exist for the convenience of other countries. Australia recognises its history in its flag through the Union Jack, just as other countries do. For example, Mexico's flag includes the red of Spain, France's flag includes white for its monarchy, and the state of Hawaii's flag also features the Union Jack despite America's independence from England more than 200 years ago. We cannot ignore our flag history while, at the same time, we cannot be restrained by it. A flag is the symbol of a nation. It is meant to unite a nation and last throughout the centuries. It is not meant to be a reflection of a country in its present state and change according to the trends of the time. What if another flag were chosen and in 100 years it too was deemed irrelevant. Would it too be cast aside in favour of a more trendy alternative? This is best put by the prominent historian Geoffrey Blainey who said: The flags of the world are full of symbols that belong to the past... Flags aren't up-to-date information sheets. Without doubt, any move to change the flag without consultation with the Australian public would cause bitter and lasting divisions within the community. There would never be complete acceptance for any new flag and millions of Australians would always resent having any change forced upon them. Without doubt, any move to change the flag without consultation with the Australian public would cause bitter and lasting divisions within the community. There would never be complete acceptance for the new flag, and millions of Australians would resent having that change forced upon them. In an article 'The Flag: Symbol of our National Identity' in the IPA Review of 1991, Santo Santoro said: Any move to change our flag would lead to a lengthy and probably bitter debate, with the tial to exacerbate political divisions, to set comer against native-born and migrant against migrant. It is unrealistic to imagine that any alternative could command anything like the degree of support for the current Australian flag, particularly after the acrimonious debate which any change is certain to entail. While some people claim that the current flag does not do Aboriginal history justice and that true reconciliation cannot take place until the flag is changed, I think we should take note of the Canadian example. When Canada adopted its red and white maple leaf flag 25 years ago, it was meant to unite Canada. However, as we all know, problems continue in Canada, culminating in the well-documented attempts of the Quebec separatists. I readily acknowledge that some people object to the Union Jack being in our flag, but I do not believe that that is cause for removing it. We cannot change history by ignoring it. The truth is that we have a strong historical tie with Britain and the majority of our population is descended from the British. The Southern Cross is a symbol which unites all Australians. It reflects our position in the world and features in Aboriginal folklore, while the Commonwealth star represents Federation and our birth as a nation. For a government to change the flag without consulting the people whom it would most affect would be outrageous. When moves were afoot in the mid-1970s to change the national anthem, the Fraser government did not force change upon the people. It put the question to the Australian public in the form of a poll. In fact, Prime Minister Fraser wanted Waltzing Matilda as our national song, as did our current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), but instead of legislating that change without consultation they left the decision in the hands of Australians. Australians voted for our current anthem, Advance Australia Fair. If such a democratic system was good enough for our national anthem, why should our national flag be treated with any less respect? Over the past 12 years, the coalition has made repeated efforts in parliament to enpoten- trench the current flag in legislation and new- ensure that it cannot be changed without the support of the people. Unfortunately, the Labor Party has thwarted each of these attempts, refusing to support a simple democratic proposition. There can be no justification for changing the existing Australian flag without first receiving majority support from all Australians. Our flag is a symbol for all, not just for the government of the day. We have no right to introduce a new flag without consulting the people for whom the flag is flown. This government has acted on its promise to protect our great national symbol, the Australian flag. As our Prime Minister said when he announced the plan on ANZAC Day this year: This will mean that no politician, no political party and no special interest group will be able to tamper with the design of our flag ... All Australians can be assured that no one will be able to change our national symbol without the nation's consent. I believe that is exactly how it should be, and I commend this bill to the house.",56
70,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,"I wish to enter the debate briefly. I want to make a number of points in relation to the matters that have been raised in the course of the debate on the Flags Amendment Bill. The question of national emblems is very important. The right of the people of the nation to determine those national emblems is equally important. That is why I am happy to support this bill, but I think it is important that people realise in that context that some of the historical anecdotes that have been raised today tend to be a little selective. I support this bill. It gives the Australian people the right to vote on the flag, a right which they have never had before. In the history of this country, people have never before had the opportunity to vote to select the flag that we now fly as the national flag; nor, for that matter, to select any other flag that they might prefer in its place. The member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) referred to the competition that was run at the tum of the century and the fact that that competition endorsed two flags, a red and a blue ensign. She also referred to the fact that there were five different competitors who basically put forward the same design. One of the interesting things about that is that one of those five was not an Australian at all; he was a New Zealander, a Kiwi. That might explain why our two flags are so similar. As the shadow minister at the table, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), commented to me a little while ago, it has in fact happened in the past at Olympic ceremonies, when Australia has won the medal, that they have hoisted the New Zealand flag. That is a point of confusion which occurs not only at Olympic Games, I might add. Were we to take the New Zealand flag to a number of places in Australia and present it as the Australian flag, I suspect few would be keen enough to notice the difference. Another interesting link that this flag has with New Zealand, arising from that early competition, is this question about a sixor a seven-pointed star. We refer to that as signifying the states and territories, but on 4 September 1901 the Argus reported: Should it ever happen that the people of New Zealand change their mind and decide to enter the union, a very slight alteration still to stand. It will only be necessary to place a seven-pointed star instead of a six-pointed one beneath the Union Jack. The simple fact is that the history of the flag and the history of the star identify that people who are not Australian were involved in its creation. In fact, the thought of a sevenpointed star at the time of its adoption in 1901 had to do with New Zealand's involvement as part of the Commonwealth of Australia rather than any consideration that is now attributed to the seven-pointed star. The other thing which I think is important to note is that in the course of the debate a good deal has been said about the flag having been proudly carried by Australian troops in battle, and that is indeed true. But, of course, it is not the only flag that Australian troops have carried into battle since Federation. During the First World War it was just as common for Australians to fight under the red ensign as it was to fight under the blue ensign. Indeed, it was just as common for them to fight under the British flag as it was to fight under either of those two Australian flags. Even in the Second World War, many Australian troops fighting in Australian formations fought not under the blue ensign but under the red ensign. My father, who served in New Guinea, served in a unit which fought under the red ensign. There is any number of ex-service personnel and records that will attest to that fact. So why do we have the blue ensign today as our national flag? It is not because the people of Australia had a vote on it. They did not in 1901, and they have not since. The reason we have the Australian flag as a blue ensign is that a group of politicians in the Australian parliament in 1953 legislated to make it so. In other words, the high ground, principled position that I have heard so many members in this chamber, particularly from the government side, espouse about the terrible evil of allowing politicians to determine this matter has glossed over the fact that it was precisely that mechanism that arrived at the current flag as our national flag. The process that has been denigrated is precisely the process which was used in adopting the would enable the flag current flag. I said at the outset that I support these changes, and I do, because I think it is important that the people of the country do have the right to determine these matters. But let us get some modicum of balance into this debate and let us understand that the flag we have today was never adopted by the Australian people. We are quite properly giving that authority to the Australian people today, but we need to be realistic and honest about the past and we need to be honest about the flag we have today. It is important, and it is an important symbol of our nation, but let us be honest in recounting on the record here in the parliament exactly how it came to be our national emblem. It was not adopted by the people; it was not arrived at by decision of Australians alone. The seven-pointed star was not something that was intended to accommodate territories; it was intended to accommodate New Zealand. The simple fact is that the flag is confusing in other parts of the world when Australians winning a gold medal at the Olympics have stood under the New Zealand flag. As the country moves forward into its second century of nationhood, we as a nation might have a mature debate both about the real history of the development of our emblems but, more importantly, what it is we see for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren as the enduring emblem for them into the future of a unique Australia.",59
71,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"I rise today in the debate on this very significant Flags Amendment Bill to make a contribution not only as Minister for Veterans' Affairs but also as the member for Maranoa. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the link that my portfolio has with the ex-service community. I have listened with great interest to speakers on both sides of the parliament. Whilst I understand that the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and the other side are supporting this bill, he did seem to be hedging his bets a little in suggesting that we need to have a mature debate about this. That probably underlies a lot of opinion on the other side of the House. They would like to change our flag by suggesting we need to have a mature debate about it. Wherever I have travelled since becoming the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I have found that the ex-service community have no doubts in their minds as to the support they give to our Australian flag. It has always been important to the services of this nation. It is an issue that is raised with me constantly. When I raise the issue in terms of this amendment bill they break into spontaneous applause. It is a measure of the support that we have out there in the ex-service community for this amendment bill. Another event to look back on is the very successful Australia Remembers celebrations last year on the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War. To see people, young and old, lining the streets of our small country towns and our cities, waving our Australian flag so proudly, demonstrates to us all in this parliament and to legislators around this nation that the people of Australia, overwhelmingly, support the flag we have. The celebrations last year that we saw in our streets during the celebrations which marked the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War are ones that all members of parliament should hark back to. They were about the grassroots people of Australia demonstrating in a very meaningful way their support for our flag. I also want to touch on the pilgrimage that I made this year to Vietnam, along with the shadow minister, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who I acknowledge played a very important role in that pilgrimage to Vietnam, because it is very much linked with our flag and the ex-service community's support for the military presence and the fact that they fought under our Australian flag. As I travelled with those Vietnam veterans and the widows of veterans who fought in Vietnam, that moment that I stood with them at a service at Nui Dat, where our task force headquarters were, gave me a much greater understanding of the price that was paid by so many hundreds of thousands of Australians who paid the supreme sacrifice defending freedom around the world and fighting for our flag. It just means so much to those people. The price that was paid really struck me as I stood at that small service on 18 August this year at Nui Dat in Vietnam. For those who have served this country in times of war and conflict, and for those who stand ready to serve it today-and that is important; they stand to serve it should they be needed-our flag is a very special symbol to them. It symbolises what they are fighting for. It also symbolises where they have come from and where they have been and where they are going, and when we think back through the annals of military history it has never been any other way. Look back at the great recruitment marches that used to come through rural Australia into our capital cities. There is an excellent exhibition down at the National Library on the First World War. The exhibition contains some of the memorabilia associated with the marches and with fighting 'For king and country: follow the flag', as it is called. It is a very good exhibition. The brochure which I have with me here in the House demonstrates that the flag has always been part of military history and has been so very important to our nation as a whole. One of the many publications on the history of our flag describes it like this: The flag was carried into New Guinea at the outbreak of World War I by the naval and military force which captured the German colonies, by the cruiser Sydney in the first naval battle of the war, by the ANZACs who landed at Gallipoli and by the 'diggers' who spearheaded the victories in France in 1917-18. It was seen around the world again in World War II. When Singapore was retaken in 1945, the first flag to fly was an Australian ensign made secretly in a prison camp. I also had the great privilege last year of attending the 80th anniversary commemorative celebrations in Turkey, and I attended on ANZAC Day at Gallipoli. I was at ANZAC Cove for that dawn service. I still remember-it is a very vivid memory-the people who attended that very small but very significant service on ANZAC Day last year. Many young people, Australian and New Zealander backpackers, made their way out of their holidays to Turkey and then to Gallipoli for ANZAC Day. To see them waving the Australian flag is another demonstration by the young people of Australia of their support for our Australian flag and what it means to them. They were clearly taking time out of a European holiday to be on ANZAC Day at ANZAC Cove in Gallipoli. They were associating themselves not only with our flag but also with our history right back to Gallipoli and that first landing at Gallipoli. I believe most Australians feel that a lot of the - ustralian psyche and the Australian character were born on those beaches at Gallipoli. The achievements have really been marked by the planting, or the raising, of the flag. Troops for so long have fought under flags. Those who have lost their lives have been buried with their flag. Victories have been celebrated with many flags. The importance of the flag in military encounters is emphasised by Dr C.E.W. Bean's history of the First World War. With reference to the operations to capture Passchendaele on 17 October, Dr Bean writes: Only one Australian division, the 3RD , was wholly employed in this day's offensive. But that division was to capture Passchendaele, and, in spite of the depressing conditions, it was eager to achieve the distinction of doing so. One unit carried an Australian flag, to be planted in Passchendaele, and the Commander-in-Chief had been informed and had told General Monash, that, when this flag was planted, the news would be immediately cabled to Australia. From Dr C.E.W. Bean's history again, I quote the words of Lieutenant Rollings in France in 1918: Enemy infantry surrendering very freely. Have sent scores back and killed scores, others running away. Enemy artillery nil. Have toured round Framerville and upset all their transport etc. Australian flag hoisted at 11.15 on German Corps HQ. These men fought with the flag, they fought for the flag, and the job was not done till the flag was hoisted. The views of the ex-service community are very strong on the issue of our national flag. They express it quite simply. They fought for everything symbolised by our flag. It united them, at times it comforted them, and always it inspired them. The issue we are addressing here is not the design of our flag. It is not a logo or brand or natty marketing device designed to win favour of a particular target market. It is a symbol for all Australians, for all that is good about being Australian. We should not be concerned with the merit or otherwise of the design of our flag, although personally I am very firmly of the view that our flag is not only a very beautiful flag but also very inspiring. It is a highly emotive flag. The issue, quite clearly, is that our flag, and all that it symbolises, is far too important to be subject to change by political whim. Our flag means what it does because the people of this country have believed in it. It has been a constant in times of war, in conflict, in turmoil, in disaster and in depression, reminding us all of the freedom and equality and hope and opportunity that characterises this great nation of ours. There have been contributions made about the linking of our Australian flag to great sporting events, whether it is on the football field or at the Olympic Games or the Commonwealth Games. So often in the sporting arenas we see people linking themselves to the Australian flag because of what the Australian flag means to them. It is a symbol. It is a national symbol. To see athletes at the Olympic Games proudly collecting an Australian flag and draping it around their shoulders and doing a victory lap of an arena or of a swimming stadium clearly demonstrates that it is a national symbol and one that should not be tampered with. It should only be through the united will of the Australian people that change should come about. That is what this legislation does. It ensures that change can only come about through the will of the people, not a political party or an individual. That is why I am so pleased to be here at the dispatch box today supporting this amendment bill. It is a further demonstration that we are carrying out what we said to the people before 2 March. We said that, if we were given the mandate by the people of Australia, we would introduce legislation that would ensure that the flag could only be changed by the people and not by a political party or by an individual. We are now delivering on yet another of the promises that we gave to the people of Australia before 2 March.",61
72,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"in reply-May I thank everyone who has participated in the debate on the Flags Amendment Bill. The fact that we had such an exceptionally large number of members contribute to this debate really demonstrates that this chamber has a respect for the flag and, indeed, indicates the respect of the Australian community as a whole for the Australian national flag. I am very pleased that we are facing this debate in a bipartisan way because the Flags Act, when it was passed in 1953, also received bipartisan support. Similar support for this bill will demonstrate to the people of Australia the principle that we, their elected representatives, have no intention of usurping their most important national symbol, their flag, the flag of our nation. The Australian national flag should not be changed without a vote of the electorate. If I can turn to a point that was raised in the debate by a number of members, particularly by the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) in his speech, where the constitutional validity of this legislation was contested. Some members opposite have suggested that the bill may lack validity because it attempts to construct a different legislative power to section 1 of the constitution. That section, of course, vests legislative power in the federal parliament consisting of the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives and they thought this might have happened by the inclusion of the Australian people in the above legislature. Can I assure members that the government is satisfied that the bill as drafted is constitutionally valid. The member for Reid also-I thought quite mischievously-sought to raise doubts as to whether, if a vote for a new flag does occur, there would be any significance in the way the votes are counted. The explanatory memorandum and the bill are quite clear, and I restate it for the sake of clarity: a new flag can be adopted if and only if a majority of all electors voting nationally vote for a new flag. The government's intention is that any vote on whether to adopt a new flag shall be on the basis of a national vote counted on a national basis. It does not matter how the majority view stacks up in the various states and the territories. The government believes that the choice of a national flag is not one which affects the balance of power between the Commonwealth and the states, as may occur with a change to the constitution. Rather, it goes to the issue of how we express our national identity, which is a decision for the will of the Australian people acting as a whole. The member for Reid and the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) drew attention to the fact that the bill makes no provision for variations to the flag should the Northern Territory become a state. The Commonwealth star has consisted of seven points since 1908-one point for each of the states and the seventh point to represent all of Australia's territories. The Commonwealth star is an integral part of the flag. In fact, it is a national symbol of significance in its own right. Its symbolism has been widely adopted in Commonwealth heraldry, as it formed part of the original Commonwealth coat of arms granted in 1908 and the present arms granted in 1912. It is found in the insignia of many of the elements of the Australian system of honours and awards, and one example of this is on the uniforms of the Australian Federal Police. The government's position is quite clear: given the significance of the Commonwealth star, the Australian people should also be consulted before any change is made. Another area of concern was raised under section 8 of the Flags Act. Some of the opposition members oppose the retention of section 8 of the Flags Act, which states that nothing in the Flags Act affects the right or privilege of a person to fly the Union Jack. Clause 8 has no bearing on the bill's objective, which is to ensure that the Australian people alone approve a new national flag. There is absolutely nothing in the Flags Act or this bill which prevents people from flying, subject to flag protocol, any Australian flag or, frankly, the flag of any nation. In her speech, the member for Prospect suggested that the government had failed to act on the concerns of many Australians that thousands of British subjects who are not yet Australian citizens would be eligible to vote on whether or not to change the flag. She has not, however, urged such a course herself. I think she is probably too experienced for that. In 1981 the Commonwealth and the states agreed that Australian citizenship should be the basis of the right to vote in Australian federal and state elections but that non-Australian citizens who already enjoyed the vote should retain it. These persons included citizens not only of the United Kingdom but of nearly 50 members of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Republic of Ireland. This bill is about enfranchising all elements of the Australian community in decisions about the national flag. Frankly, the government is not interested in proposals to disenfranchise certain groups of people from this decision. The government believes that all persons who have the right to vote should be entitled to do so at federal, state and territory elections and at constitutional referenda and to vote, if need be, on the national flag. Once again, may I thank all those members who took part in this rather long debate, and I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Jull) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1996 Cognate bills: MIGRATION (VISA APPLICATION) CHARGE BILL 1996 IMMIGRATION (EDUCATION) CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 19% Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 December, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time.",63
73,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"This migration legislation, as I indicated previously, shows that the government believes that migrants are second-class citizens. It is an attack on fundamental family values and a repudiation of the coalition's pre-election commitments. I want to draw the attention of the House to the statements made by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) when he was the opposition spokesman on immigration when amendments were made to the Migration Act to make it plain that a minister could not cap visas. The present immigration minister, when he was opposition spokesman, said: I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through the year, 'We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia-no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents.' I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups. They were his words in opposition. Yet what he is proposing with this legislation is precisely that. He is giving himself the power to say, 'We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia-no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, no more aged parents.' It is little wonder that in the Senate we saw a report concerning the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996 which endorsed the many fears and concerns raised in submissions from church groups, from the Human Rights Commissioner, from the Australian Law Reform Commission and from others that what this legislation, amongst other things, would do is, firstly, breach Australia's international obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child; secondly, represent a significant withdrawal from Australia's lawful commitment to the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Sex Discrimination; thirdly, increase the potential for corruption; and, finally, it would be an admission that the government's proposed legislation would be discriminatory and would breach Australia's international undertakings. Those are the concerns that have been expressed by people in the community who are aware of the provisions of this bill. It ought to be said very clearly that this is not about levels of migration. We in opposition have made it clear on a number of occasions that we have no argument with the government about the size of the program that it announced for 1996-97. The minister went to some pains in his media release at the time he announced the program to say that the size was about the average of the last four years of the Labor government-and, indeed, it is. But that fact makes a lie of the cries that Labor allowed the immigration program to get out of control. It is also important to note there was no hint of the coalition's cry about Labor allowing the program to get out of control during the election campaign-not at all. In fact, the coalition committed itself specifically in giving priority to family reunion-as compared with what it is trying to do nowwithin a program of a similar size to that which Labor had managed. Some of the statements made by government members during this and other debates on migrants and race have been described by one commentator in the broader debate as 'dog whistling'. That is, the message is coded and pitched at a certain frequency to which a particular audience will be attuned but it can be denied whenever necessary. It is most regrettable that some government members have indulged in this practice, endeavouring to send out what are effectively coded, racist messages to those in the community who are receptive to such messages. I think most members of the House would reject that sort of approach. It should also be noted that some government members have claimed that the power to cap these visa levels was put in place by the previous government. That is not the case. If that power exists at all under the current legal framework, it would certainly give rise to legal contention and controversy and would require some implementation of regulations to accompany it. We need to put on record that no government previously explored the existence of such a provision or sought to cap the number of spouse, aged parent and dependent child visas that can be granted in any one year. So let there be no mistake that bill capping the spouse visa has nothing to do with immigration as such. It means that Australians will not have the right to choose to marry the love of their life. That will be restricted by the government setting a number of spouse visas that can be issued each year. So, if you make that decision early in the life of the program and visas are still around, you can be in luck, but too bad if you meet that person or make that decision later in the visa cycle. The answer may well be, 'Sorry, no more visas for spouses this year. Try again next year. Better luck next year.' Similarly, that right to meet the responsibility of caring for our elderly parents-one which until now we have taken for grantedwill be denied as well. The minister wants the power to say to Australians---<:itizens and permanent residents alike-that if their parents happen to live overseas only some will be able to meet that responsibility this year, and the same applies for dependent children. In his second reading speech on the bill, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs said this is crucial to restoring public confidence in immigration which had been greatly eroded under Labor and that Labor had allowed immigration to get seriously out of control; yet when in opposition the same minister said that it would be unconscionable for a government to say midway through the year, 'We have enough spouses in now. We will close off that category. No-one else will be allowed in this year.' So the minister's comments in opposition and his comments now are absolutely inconsistent and ought to be shown up as hypocrisy and pre-election rhetoric. Let me also add our strong opposition to the introduction of the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill to roll the existing migration charges into one. The visa application fee will rise by over 2S0 per cent, the English education charge will go up by nearly 2S0 per cent-and there is the health services charge. In particular, the English education charge increases are not acceptable to the opposition. Learning English is very much a part of the resettlement process. It is absolutely essential for people who have been granted the right to make this country their home under the claim of our non-discriminatory migration policy to be able to learn English. I draw the attention of the House to the coalition's policy description of English as 'the glue of a cohesive nation'. But what are the coalition doing here? They want to raise the charge to $S,SOO per person, thereby making it unaffordable to many. This plainly will discriminate against non-English speaking applicants. Also, it is completely inconsistent with that survey to which I have previously pointed that indicates most coalition MPs, most coalition candidates, regard the ability or capacity to speak English as an essential part of being truly Australian. Therefore, the opposition opposes the increases to the English education charge. The government has rolled all these into one bill. They have refused to separate them out to enable the opposition to support those parts of this bill which we do not disagree with. It the seems to me that, in so doing, they are playing politics with this issue. Let me further draw the attention of the House to what has happened in my own electorate as a result of the government's mismanagement of the migration program. A constituent who is a permanent resident engaged to a woman from Pakistan applied for a visa under the prospective spouse category. The government's decision to require sponsors to be Australian citizens rather than permanent residents saw that application rejected. But the Senate, in tum, defeated that unfair measure with the result that the constituent's fiancee can apply again, more certain that the application will be approved, but another application fee must be coughed up. Again, a constituent who is a permanent resident seeking to bring her 17-year-old Fijian son to Australia submitted her application, along with the necessary fee for which she had saved. She was quite confused and angry when told by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that her application had failed because she is not an Australian citizen. Before June and after October this would not have been a problem. But the bungled manner in which the government sought to amend the provision means that she too will have to line up with another application and another application fee. What the government has done in relation to migration and what it is doing with the bill before the House do this nation's reputation no good in the eyes of prospective migrants who are confused and angry and who deserve a better explanation. This is typical of the way in which the Liberal Party has been treating migrants. (Time expired)",64
74,Mrs STONE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996, the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996 and the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill 1996. Unlike the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), I believe that this legislation is in the very best interests of the current population of Australia, our newest arrivals and those who wish to become Australian citizens in the future. These amendments are necessary if our government is to achieve a migrant intake which balances family, skill levels and humanitarian considerations. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Helsinki accords assert a universal right of immigration. However, there is no international disagreement about a government's right to determine who should be admitted to their country, at what rate, who should be granted citizenship and how many. There are fundamental moral and human rights issues associated with any immigration policy, true; and, yes, it is a fact that an individual's opportunities in life are profoundly affected by the lottery of their birth. Quite obviously, an infant born today in Zaire will have an entirely different life experience compared with that of an infant born on this same day in Canberra-and, of course, we would have to agree that that sounds unfair. But we cannot and do not live in an ideal world. All resources of every nation are finite. The argument in favour of national sovereignty control over immigration is common sense. Anything else threatens the well-being of the host population and, in particular, the most vulnerable-the most recently arrived, the immigrants in the host nation. It is not surprising then that all governments carefully try to formulate and implement migration policies in an effort to protect their border security, economic well-being, political stability and cultural identity. Therefore, these amendments are important in that they give to our Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs the ability to control our incoming numbers to ensure that the future economic and social well-being of all Australians is protected. The tools are necessary as a part of our forward planning so that we can deliver on our migrant intake policies. Australia, along with other countries like the USA and Israel, has been built on wave upon wave of migration.",66
75,Mr SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Order! It being 2.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue making her speech when the debate is resumed. FRASER ELECTORATE: ISSUE OF NA",67
76,Mr SPEAKER,WRIT,"I inform the House that it is my intention to issue a writ on Monday, 30 December 1996, for the election of a Member to serve for the Electoral Division of Fraser, in the Australian Capital Territory, in place of Mr John Vance Langmore, resigned. Issue of the Writ-Monday, 30 December 1996 Close of roll-Monday, 6 January 1997 Date of nominations-Friday, 10 January 1997 Date of polling-Saturday, 1 February 1997 Return of writ--on or before Wednesday, 9 April 1997. NA Unemployment",67
77,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it not a fact that today's employment data confirms the dreadful employment trend since the budget with employment growth only half that is needed to achieve the moderate budget forecast and predictions of an increase in unemployment in 1997 to over nine per cent? Does the government still stand by the moderate budget forecasts on employment? If not, what action is the cabinet unemployment committee taking to ensure that unemployment goes down, not up as predicted?",67
78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Batman for his question. Can I say to the House that the unemployment data that was released today showed that employment grew by 24,000, unemployment fell by 31,700 and the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage points to 8.5 per cent. I remember that, when I was asked a question a month ago in relation to the previous figures, which from recollection had gone in the other direction, I said it was unwise to place too much reliance on one month's figures. I say the same thing of today's figures. I think it is always unwiseMr Crean-What about the trend?",67
79,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would counsel the member for Batman and also the member for Hotham not to place too much reliance on one month's figures. I make the point that the level of unemployment indicated by these figures is the lowest since July. But whatever may be the interpretations that either side of politics would seek to place on these figures, can I make a couple of points. The first is that, if we want intelligent debate on unemployment in this country, we should stop making exaggerated claims in either direction about particular figures. I did not give a doom and gloom response to the figures a month ago. I am not today going to make an exaggerated claim because there has been a pleasing break in the other directionit is a break, I must say, that was against some of the predictions. It does show a very solid employment growth. I mean, 24,000 at this time of the year is solid growth and I hope it can be continued. But, as the honourable member for Batman will know, these figures are notoriously unpredictable. The second point I make is that reducing unemployment is something that will only be achieved over time. The best advice available to me is that the budget predictions in their various areas are on track. In relation to those predictions, I can only repeat the advice that I have received. I also take the opportunity to remind the House of a number of measures taken by the government which we believe will strengthen the employment outlook for Australians. We have put in place a fiscal consolidation strategy. We have seen significant reductions in interest rates. The combination of a cut in interest rates and better than expected employment figures on the eve of Christmas will boost consumer confidence. Boosting consumer confidence is a good thing for the economy because there is a psychological element involved in economic recovery. It is not all statistics. There is an element of psychology. The combination of a cut in interest rates and better than expected employment figures ought to be seen by all Australians as unambiguously good news on the eve of Christmas. We believe that the passage of the workplace relations bill will create more productive workplaces with higher productivity underpinning higher real wages. We have introduced a number of measures to help small business: the provisional tax uplift factor; the very generous changes to the fringe benefits tax regime; the abolition of the unfair dismissal law; and the injection from 1 January next year of an additional $1 billion of spending via the family tax initiative-all of these things together will work to produce a higher level of confidence and a greater disposition on the part of consumers to spend. I believe the lower interest rate climate will induce a greater desire on the part of people to invest. Can I finish the answer by saying, again, that I welcome these figures. They are good figures; they are not bad figures. They are a cause of feeling positive. But I say, as I did with figures that were commensurately less welcoming a month ago, nobody with any real understanding of this situation should place too much reliance on one month's figures. On both sides of the House I think there should be an absence of extravagant language and a willingness to understand that only over time can employment be boosted and unemployment reduced. Telstra",68
80,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What action has the government taken to give Telstra workers and their families an opportunity to have extra financial interest in the communications industry?,68
81,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government warmly welcomes the passage through the Senate of the Telstra sale legislation. It will be the law of Australia when the legislation is proclaimed that one-third of Telstra can be sold into public ownership. This heralds a new era in the involvement of the Australian public in the direct ownership of the great utilities of Australia. One of the interesting things about privatisation is that the critics of privatisation have suggested that it represents selling a public asset. I see it in exactly an opposite light. I see it as giving the members of the public an opportunity to buy public assets. What is going to happen is that tens of thousands of Australians, for the first time, are going to have an opportunity to invest in Telstra. I can predict now that they will, I believe, support the sale of one-third of Telstra very strongly. This is going to generate enormous public interest. It is going to generate enormous public support. I predict that, when the float takes place, the measure of support from mainstream Australia will be such that those who opposed the sale of Telstra will want to forget that they did that very silly thing. Very importantly, I want to assure the parliament, in particular the member for Capricornia, that as well as the general public being able to participate in buying shares in the Telstra float we are going to make special arrangements for the employees of Telstra. The workers involved in Telstra will get a special deal in the public float. We are reserving two per cent of the one-third float especially for Telstra employees. There are going to be special measures to encourage those employees and their families to acquire shares. Under a generous employee share ownership plan, a special offer of one free share every four shares purchased will be made to Telstra employees with a maximum of 500 free shares per employee. In addition, there will be very generous loyalty bonuses available to Telstra employees who hold their shares in Telstra for at least 12 months. Telstra has already been made fully aware of this employee share ownership plan which was announced by the coalition before the election and which I confirm today. Full details of this generous priority allocation to Telstra employees will be announced with the public release of all details about the one-third float. I say again that the sale of one-third of Telstra will be a bonanza for the average Australian. It will be an opportunity for the average Australian to buy directly into one of the great public utilities of Australia. represent a new partnership which will involve the average Australian in the ownership, the development, the expansion and the full reach of telecommunications technology to all parts of Australia. Those who voted against it will live to regret the day they did so. Industry Policy",68
82,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Is the minister aware of an article in this week's Business Review Weekly which reports a poll of the top 1,000 chief executives officers and finds that since the budget 'business support for the way the government is doing its job has collapsed', with almost every industry sector having a low opinion of the government's understanding of business, with 82 per cent of manufacturers seeing no vision coming from the government on industry policy and with more job losses predicted by these chief executive officers? How can the government crow about its achievements when it gets results like this? When are you going to develop an industry policy? Will you reaffirm your 200,000 jobs target in manufacturing?",69
83,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am surprised that the member for Hotham is back at it again so early in the piece, because yesterday he for completely missed the mark, as usual. The government, since coming to power, has gone about a financial consolidation which you were never able to do. Remember the Beazley black hole? We have talked about that for some time. We had to work, and continuously work, at that to pull it down. The business community were extraordinarily complimentary about the budget. It was the best received budget since the Second World War. As a consequence of that, the Reserve Bank has been able to move down interest rates for the commercial sector to the lowest level they have been for 25 years. All of commerce is extraordinarily interested in those moves. It will generate interest. That has been measured by the increase in consumer confidence by the bank indexes. Because of those measures alone, all the quesIt will tions you go on with are irrelevant. One thing I have noticed about the member for Hotham is that he has the potential to tell whoppers. He would not have got that from his father, because he was an honourable man. He learnt this at the ACTU or as a Keating minister. The person who should be looking out for this is Mr Beazley, because he is the one he will be telling whoppers to soon. Djerrkura, Mr Gatjil",69
84,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the recent appointment of Mr Gatjil Djerrkura as Chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission supported by the indigenous and non-indigenous community? Have you met Mr Djerrkura since his appointment? Have you met the other 13 new members of the ATSIC board? Is the government committed to working constructively with ATSIC in finding practical ways of addressing issues affecting indigenous Australians, issues such as deaths in custody?",70
85,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can tell the honourable member for Longman that the general reaction to the appointment of Mr Djerrkura as the new Chairman of ATSIC has been very positive. I note the very favourable comments that have been made both by the Leader of the Opposition and by Senator Collins, a member of the Labor Party who has a very deep understanding of indigenous affairs. I have had the opportunity of meeting Mr Djerrkura on two occasions. I met him privately several days agoMr Latham-And what about your mate Daryl?",70
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I also acknowledge the comments that have been made by the member for Banks. I apologise to my cricket playing mate over there for having left him out. He has been very generous in his reactions. I think he is almost embarrassed now that the member for Werriwa asked me to include him. He is looking very embarrassed. That is what the Right does to you, Daryl. Mr Latham-We're all mates.",70
87,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They always dob you in. You are all mates; that's right. Seriously, I think the appointment of Mr Djerrkura is one of the more important appointments that has been made by the government. I had the opportunity today of meeting and congratulating all of the new members of the ATSIC board. I think something like 13 of the 19 are newly elected. There are under the legislation two appointments made by the govemmentthe chairman and Mr Dillon, who is a well known and well respected member of the Queensland Police Force and who has risen to a very high rank in that police force. I believe both men will bring very great talents and particular capacities to the work of ATSIC. Mr Djerrkura is extremely well qualified for the job. He is a senior tribal man of the Wangurri people in the north-east of Arnhem Land. He is very aware of the importance of traditional indigenous culture and also the problems facing indigenous people in remote areas of Australia. As general manager of a business enterprise of a contracting company for the Nabalco bauxite mine on the Gove Peninsula and the employer of some 60 indigenous and non-indigenous people, he is very aware of the importance of economic independence for Aboriginal people. When I met the members of the board today, I took the opportunity of making two points in particular. I pointed out the desire of the government to work in a very constructive fashion with the ATSIC board and that, naturally, when there is a change of government goals are sometimes pursued in different ways, but it does not mean that the goal of a far more equitable treatment of indigenous people and the redressing of lack of advantage and disadvantage will not be just as steadfastly pursued by the new government as it may have been pursued by former governments. I assured Mr Djerrkura and the ATSIC board of the goodwill of the government towards the indigenous people of Australia. Our commitment to the reconciliation process is quite steadfast. I also expressed concern to the members of the board-although I do not profess to have an instant answer to the problem-about the continuing high level of deaths in custody. This is an issue that I think concerns all Australians. It is a direct consequence of the high incarceration rate of indigenous people which, in tum, I think everybody will agree is a consequence of their deprived social circumstances, the absence sound family and community structures and the alienation that many young people, black and white, feel within our community. As I say, I did not pretend to the ATSIC board that I had an instant solution to that I do not think anybody does-but I did underinvolved take that that would be something that concern and preoccupy the government. hope that over time some proposals to which the government is giving consideration can put forth in that area, which I hope will some benefit. I very warmly welcome Djerrkura to the board of ATSIC. I wish him and the other members of the ATSIC board well. I again assure him and the indigenous people of Australia of the goodwill of the government and our desire to constructive fashion with the members of the ATSIC board, naturally doing things different1y from our predecessors but no less steadfastwould ly pursuing the goal of greater justice, better treatment and certainly greater economic independence for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia. Dental Health",70
88,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of the Victorian government's decision to introduce charges of up to $100 for dental care for school children and new co-payments for emergency and preventative dental care for pensioners? Do you agree with the Victorian Liberal Minister for Health that the introduction of these charges is the only way to compensate for the $27.1 million the federal government cut from Victoria in the budget by abolishing the Commonwealth dental health program? Doesn't this demonstrate how ordinary Australians are the real losers under your plan to hand back health and community service program responsibilities to the states?,71
89,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is no and the answer to the second part of the question is no. The third part of the question was whether ordinary Australians will lose by handing back responsibility to the states. What we are trying to do is rather important. It is prefaced on the assumption that how things are at the of moment is working. The simple fact is that, if you wanted to pick an area of the federation where it was not working, you would probably pick health. The difficulty with having two governments is that you get problems at the would boundaries and you do not get sensible I decisions being made. A very good example is what happens in Western Australia with be palliative care. Western Australia probably be of has the best home based care service anyMr where in Australia, provided by a group called Silver Chain. Silver Chain can provide palliative care for an average cost of about $50 per person per day in the last weeks of someone's life, even applying up to six hours work in a very of one-on-one care. Some 80 per cent of people who are dying prefer to die at home. You have to ask yourself: if the majority of people who are dying would like to die at home, and if that can be provided for about $50 a day, why on earth are people still dying in state public hospitals? The simple answer is that the states pay for hospital care and the Commonwealth pays for palliative care, largely through the home and community care program-and the two cannot get together. In fact, in 1994 Silver Chain found 4,500 public hospital bed days where the only reason someone had gone to die in a public hospital at $500 a day was that the amount of money they were allowed to spend on palliative care had run out. That is the sort of thing that happens when you have two levels of government that do not have any capacity for flexibility in boundary programs. So trying to sort out roles and responsibilities between the Commonwealth and state is driven by no more than trying to provide better and more flexible services to the public. Another good example is aged care, where we can give someone a nursing home bed at $32,000 a year but we cannot give someone $2,500 of continence aids to help their family keep them at home. This is very significant when so many people who are frail aged and could be in a nursing home are being looked after at home by their relatives. They are the sorts of things that drive the issue of trying to rationalise the roles and responsibilities in health, no more than that. Things can go wrong, as you found when you handed over immunisation to the states in 1987. That was a disaster. What went wrong then was that it was handed over without any responsibility. It was handed over without any monitoring. It was handed over and forgotten. I can assure you that anything we do in terms of roles and responsibilities will not be our just vacating the field; it will be our trying rationalise how we can do things better and meet people's needs better.",71
90,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, a supplementary question: if the minister is not aware of the Victorian government's decision, will he ask his staff to provide him with a copy of this morning's Melbourne Age, and if he does not agree with the Victorian minister, will he pick up the telephone and ring Rob Knowles?",72
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The supplementary question is out of order. Violence Against Women,72
92,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In light of the women's safety survey figures published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics yesterday, what measures are being undertaken by the government to address the worrying incidence of violence against women?",72
93,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I imagine that most members of the House would have seen press reports of the survey into women's safety which was published yesterday. The survey was carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and I believe that it has provided us with the first comprehensive national data on the extent and the nature of violence against women. It records a number of sobering facts. One of those is that women are far more likely by a factor of four to one to suffer violence as they go about their lives than are men. I am sure that it provides all members of this House with the opportunity to express their personal repugnance at any kind of violence in our society and, because of the greater danger that women suffer in relation to violence, particularly their repugnance in relation to any acts of violence against women and children. I think it is necessary to recognise that, although the great bulk of the community shares the view that I have expressed, there remains a minority who regard violence against women, particularly where there is a close domestic relationship, be it married or otherwise, as something quite different from violence of a random kind against another member of the community. That is an attitude to that needs to be changed and I would imagine-in fact, I am confident-that there would be bipartisan support in this parliament for such a statement of attitude. Some comments have been made, both by way of interjection and in news reports this morning, that decisions that the federal government has taken in respect of legal aid sit oddly with any concern about the incidence of violence against women. Can I say a couple of things in relation to that, firstly to point out the respective roles of the Commonwealth and state governments when it comes to the provision of legal aid and that violence against the person is a crime punishable under state law. But, more importantly",72
94,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Look at the cuts to legal aid.,72
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"People interject about cuts. I think, more importantly, I should point out that in this year's budget there was a very significant increase in the amount of money directed towards a campaign against violence and crime. More resources have been put into the campaign to prevent violence occurring in the first place. We have put more funds into marriage and relationship education. We are endeavouring to attack the causes, as well as recognising the need to provide support in relation to responses. I would say to those who would glibly criticise the decision of the government in relation to legal aid: look at the additional resources that have been put into preventing it occurring in the first place. We are often told that prevention is better than responsible cure.",72
96,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Less money for Family Court issues.,73
97,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And to those people who are critical of what the government has done in the legal aid area: look at the $13 million that is going into the national campaign against violence and crime,73
98,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is a net loss in the program.,73
99,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Look-look at the doubling of funds that has gone to marriage guidance counselling; look at the programs that have been developed in association with organisations like the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul, and in the states in order to better provide support, in order to educate those who need to be educated in the community to be better parents.",73
100,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, yes; and look at what has led to that situation.",73
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Freemantle.,73
102,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I finally say, Mr Speaker, that I am sure I speak on behalf of all members of the House when I say that I find any example or incidence of violence against women in our community absolutely unacceptable, absolutely outside the kind of conduct that should be acceptable as part of a civilised society, and something that all members of this parliament should find utterly repugnant. China: Anti-Dumping Laws",73
103,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs representing the Minister for Trade. Minister, why has your department advised the Anti-Dumping Authority that it no longer considers China to be a command or non-market economy for the purpose of applying Australia's anti-dumping laws? Exactly how has the Chinese economy changed since the publication in August of a DFAT country economic brief on China, a report which highlighted the continuing domination of the Chinese economy by stateowned enterprises? Is it not the case that DFAT's change of advice followed an undertaking given by your colleague Mr Fischer to China's minister for international foreign trade, Madam Wu Yi, in discussions on or about 1 September, which also concerned the axed DIFF scheme? Why should Australian manufacturers see this as anything other than a tawdry deal to repair the damage caused by your DIFF fiasco?",73
104,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the honourable member rightly pointed out in his question, this is a question which, in normal circumstances, would be directed to the Minister for Trade. But as my colleagues pointed out, in light of the length of the question, I was able to go through the minister's folder and find the appropriate answer on the Chinese anti-dumping matter. I can tell the House-since you seem to be, for reasons which are almost totally incomprehensible, linking this to the DIFF issue-that the Minister for Trade discussed this issue with Madam Wu Yi, China's minister for foreign trade and economic cooperation, when he met her in Beijing in September. The Minister for Trade asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to review the issue to ensure our policies were still appropriate. Over a period of nearly two decades, China has clearly undergone profound economic reform and structural change in its transition from a centrally planned economy to a more market based system. Two cases which have come up recently-one concerning laminated glass and the other glyphosate acid-have provided an opportunity to scrutinise the prevailing market situation for those industries in China. Australian Customs officials visited China in October to undertake two in-country investigations on these products. They found that in these specific instances they had not identified any recent instances of dumping. Their investigations do not mean that we have made a decision to change Australia's position with regard to China as a centrally planned economy or non-market economy. Such a specific determination is not in fact required under the Customs Act. Economy",73
105,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the state of the economy in light of today's employment figures and yesterday's cut in official interest rates?,73
106,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Prime Minister has already said, the government welcomes the fact that the labour force figures for November show an increase of 24,400 in the number of jobs created for the month. That also follows on from a similar increase of 25,500 jobs created in the month of October. The Prime Minister noted that the series is a volatile series. However, taking the two months together, that is 50,000 new jobs in the last two months. The budget forecast was for two per cent employment growth throughout the year. For the September quarter the growth was half a per cent, which was right on target for the annual rate, and, of course, the contributions for the last two months will add to the number of jobs created. Growth remains solid in the Australian economy with 0.8 per cent growth in GOP in the September quarter-3.8 per cent for the year. The national accounts were consistent with budget forecasts showing continued strong growth in business investment, which was up eight per cent in the September quarter. The Australian Bureau of Statistics' capital expenditure survey reinforced the view of strong growth in business investment through 1996-97. The fourth set of expectations is almost 20 per cent higher than the relevant estimate last year and around eight per cent higher than the third estimate for 1996. There are good prospects for a pick-up in the dwelling sector during 1996-97, suggesting that this will improve conditions in construction and manufacturing. Low inflation in the Australian economy, with the CPI rising only 2.1 per cent over the year to September, and national accounts measures showing even more positive signs for low inflation, has enabled a series of reductions in official interest rates, the third of which was yesterday-allowing a reduction of 1.5 per cent in official interest rates the election, coupled with reductions in mortgage rates fuelled by competition. Housing standard mortgage variable rates are now the lowest they have been since June 1974, the lowest home mortgage rates for 22 years. For home buyers in Australia on an average mortgage, they are now $188 per month better off as a result of the reduction of those interest rates. We see an emerging picture which is consistent with the budget forecasts. Of course, we will be doing a mid-year review and releasing that in early January. We are seeing a picture consistent with solid growth, low inflation, good investment and reducing interest rates. We have seen opportunities in relation to the housing sector for next year and conditions which are protecting the position for families and home buyers. There was a question earlier from the member for Hotham about the Business Review Weekly's surveys. I say at the outset that the government does not live and die on surveys but, since apparently the member for Namadgi does, she will no doubt live on the survey in BRW to be released tomorrow, which says that 54 per cent of chief executives expect better business conditions over the next 12 months. Expectations for profits were unchanged since the last survey, although still strong. Mr Crean-You're hopeless!",74
107,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You, member for Hotham, are the one who lives and dies on surveys. I said the government does not. I am telling you tomorrow's news. Expectations for profits were unchanged since the last survey in the September quarter. Some 64 per cent of CEOs are expecting higher profits, 12 per cent are expecting weaker profits, 42 per cent of respondents are expecting to increase employment over the 12 months and 25 per cent are expecting to layoff. For those who live or die by surveys, tomorrow's survey is good news for the economy and, I am afraid, more bad news for the Labor Party. Western Australia: Regional Power Costs",74
108,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs explain why since a mining company generating power for domestic and business consumers using light fuel oil enjoys an excise rebate when Western Power, generating power in the same way, does not? Does the minister agree with Westem Power that this unfairly imposes higher power costs for regional Western Australians?  his question. He will probably recall that the previous government changed the Customs and Excise Act to make light crude oil taxable or subject to excise at the same rate as diesel fuel. Previously, a number of operators were altering their engines so that they could run on light crude, thus evading the duty for those sorts of engines. Now, whether it is light crude or diesel, they are subject to the same rate of excise and do not receive the rebate. The provision you sought advice on in regard to the mining industry is specific to the mining industry. The diesel fuel rebate covers a number of categories in the mining industry. It is a scheme designed to assist the international competitiveness of Australia's mining industry. If, in any case, a mining company were to sell their power generation and the power generation company sold power to a town site of any sort, that would not fit the category of eligible rebate criteria. Tax Minimisation",74
109,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the measures the government is taking to close tax minimisation arrangements and protect PAYE taxpayers?,75
110,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question and the interest that he has shown on behalf of the many small businesses in his electorate and the contribution that he has made to these matters. Let me assure him that one of the reasons this government has taken action to crack down on tax minimisation schemes is that we think the PAYE taxpayers, who bear the brunt of the taxation system, are owed measures by the government to prevent those richer people or those with higher incomes from escaping the taxation net through minimisation schemes. That is why on 23 July, together with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, I announced the government would end syndicated R&D arrangements. They were set up in 1987. Under complex financial structures, which had developed over the period since then, investors were able to invest and face no commercial risk but yet make use of accumulated tax losses in research companies. Mr Crean-Not under the guidelines. That is wrong.",75
111,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, they were called guarantee return syndicates. Mr Crean-That is just wrong. You continue to be wrong.",75
112,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They were able to claim risk free returns and substantial tax benefits. As a result, the revenue costs of syndication expanded rapidly. The cost of the program increased almost tenfold over the last six years from $50 million to $475 million. Prior to the announcement of the abolition of the scheme on 23 July, in excess of 120 applications were lodged with the board which would, if approved, have attracted tax benefits of $1.4 billion. Mr Crean-If approved!",75
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,75
114,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Commissioner of Taxation examined in excess of 100 syndicates and of those more than 90 per cent exhibited excessive tax benefits. Tax benefits ranged from 1.4 to 2.4 times the amount spent on R&D. Mr Crean-And they didn't get up.,75
115,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last night the Australian Democrats indicated that, in principle, they were in favour of scrapping syndication. I pay tribute to the Australian Democrats in relation to that because they are prepared to stand by the PAYE taxpayers. The Australian Democrats do not want to see tax rorts continue. But there is one political party that wants to see the tax rorts continue. Mr Crean-Which party?",75
116,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One person has been interjecting very noisily over there. He wouldn't be the same person that is running around the city of Melbourne boasting in business circles of his measures to keep R&D syndicates in place, would he? It wouldn't be the member for Hotham, would it? In accordance with long-established ACTU tradition, he is always looking for the main chance, always making sure that something of enormous benefit for the high income earners comes to the attention of his ears. This is a government that had the courage to stand up in relation to syndicates. We welcome the support of the Australian Democrats. It is regrettable that the Australian Labor Party has not had the courage. They introduced these rorts, so I suppose they would be embarrassed about voting to take them out. But there still is time for the Australian Labor Party in the Senate to reconsider their position and stand by the PA YE taxpayers. They made a mistake. They were led into it by the member for Hotham. There is no reason why the whole of the front-bench should bear that error. I call on them to reconsider. Pharmaceutical Industry",75
117,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I remind the Treasurer of the government's commitment to announce the future of the factor F pharmaceutical scheme by November 1996. Will the government provide the pharmaceutical industry with certainty about the future policy environment by confirming that the scheme will be continued beyond its present expiry date?,76
118,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a matter which is under discussion by the governmentbetween the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and me and other members concerned. We will announce the government's position in due course after there has been proper consideration. Medical Provider Numbers",76
119,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of the concerns of junior doctors and medical students about the budget decision to restrict provider numbers? What improvement has the minister introduced to alleviate these concerns and how do these measures mesh with the Howard government's commitment on health at the March election?,76
120,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am delighted to be able to inform the House that the government and the Australian Democrats have reached agreement on the provider number legislation to ensure its passage through the Senate. In doing so, I have taken on board a number of concerns that the Australian Democrats had to enable the smooth transition of this legislation. There were four principal concerns. One is that general practice training be extended from four to an optional six years to give people guaranteed time off for family or other reasons. I have agreed to this. The second is that there be an oversight mechanism to have a look at the implementation of the proposal. We have agreed to institute a medical training review panel. That can, in an open and transparent way, examine this implementation over the next couple of years. The third is that I have agreed to a sunset clause. The program will be reviewed after five years. Fourthly, I have agreed that there be a one-off additional 250 places available in rural areas for doctors who are not able to find a training position or a job. This will be administered through a register of medical opportunity and, again, will mean that there is no reason any medical student or young doctor need have concern about not being able to get training or a job. It also means that the government can deliver on its three original aims of this legislation. The first is that we want to have better qualified GPs, which is in the Australian public's interest. Secondly, we want to have more doctors in country areas, which has been a chronic feature of the Australian health system in the past. Rural people have the right to have access to medical services. Thirdly, it contains growth in expenditure on MBS items. In this respect, the changes will be met out of the implementation costs which were already counted for so the net effect to the budget bottom line is zero. This fits in with what we undertook to do before the last election-that is, to improve the position of general practice. There have been a number of reports in recent years that have shown the parlous and difficult state that general practice in Australia is in. Peter Baume concluded in a work force study that general practice has been progressively deskilled over the last 30 years. Bob Douglas from the ANU showed in research last year that a third of Australia's doctors would leave work tomorrow if there was something else they could do. This is very disturbing news for our basic, primary health care delivery service in Australia. This package will help the status and quality of general practice. It will mean that general practice no longer has to be the dumping ground for the entire medical profession. It builds on our budget initiatives whereby we reversed a decision prior to the election to take $400 million out of the better practice program. It builds on a decision whereby we have made general practice the centrepiece of coordinated care. As a result of that, 14 trials are now under way around Australia with the full support of divisions of general practice. It also builds on our decision to change referral mechanisms whereby general practitioners have to be the persons to whom specialists come back to so that someone can be the focus of patient care. All in all, it is good for the bush, it is good for general practice and it is good for the Australian public.",76
121,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer the minister to his media release of 19 November regarding plans to split the massive reef tax hike into two taxes-the two for one tax-in which he states: Under the new arrangements the EMC (reef tax) will rise from $1 to $2 from 1 January 1997. A $4 (tourist visitor) charge will be levied on users commercial facilities and craft from 1 January 1998. Can the minister confirm that the new $4 tax to be levied on 'users of commercial facilities' will now apply to all business activity in and around the Great Barrier Reef, such as restaurants, shops and hotels? Will the minister also confirm that, by definition, the term 'craft' will mean that individual boat owning families who use the reef will also be exposed to the reef tax? Finally, will the minister heed the warning of the Queensland Sunday Mail editorial of 24 November which stated 'every few thousand dollars that the reef tax raises will put another school leaver out of work'?",77
122,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The environment charges levied in the last budget are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, so direct your question to the right person. As the question relates to the tourist areas, I point out that those charges will not be extended to hotels, restaurants and so on. Privatisation",77
123,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Has the minister seen suggestions that ideology is the only reason the government is seeking the part privatisation of Telstra? What will be the benefits from the use of the public capital currently committed to Telstra? Mr FAHEYI thank the member for her question. I am aware that on Melbourne radio on Monday of this week the Leader of the Opposition indicated that the government's motivation for the partial sale of Telstra was based on ideology. The Leader of the Opposition continues to attack the government on privatisation. Since coming to office, it is this government that has completed the third stage Reef Tax of the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. It is this government that has completed the issuing of the loyalty shares, the completion of the Qantas sale. Who was it that was responsible for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the sale of Qantas? It was the now Leader of the Opposition in his former capacity. He was an enthusiastic supporter of privatisation in the past. of It was the Leader of the Opposition who led the charge. It was the Leader of the Opposition who was a key player in the privatisation efforts of the former government. It was the Leader of the Opposition, from the right wing of the party, who stood against the ideology that came forward from the left wing of the party when it came to the sale of various assets by the former Labor government. The reason he did this was that he was convinced of the merits of privatisation. As early as 1990 he was prepared to stand up in this House and be counted on asset sales. He indicated, in endeavouring to justify the ditching of the ALP's policy on the sale of Australian Airlines, that there was a reason for Australian Airlines to be sold. He said at that time: ... we think that there are other things that to be done in the public sector with injections capital that would be capable of being implemented were Australian taken out of it. Let me repeat, 'other things that ought to done with injections of public capital'. What, for example? Does this include the repayment of debt? Does it include the best environmentIn al package that this nation has ever seen? Back then you were gung-ho in respect of privatisation, the sale, of government assets. You were a supporter at that time. You saw the benefits of privatisation. You said such words in that debate as 'more competitive markets' and 'freeing up our public entities act in a commercial manner' . You us for wanting to put public capital to better use, particularly when there is private capital to replace it; and that is the case with Telstra. It is the hypocrisy! It is all right for Labor Party to sell off $5 billion worth assets. It is all right to put your collective hands on your hearts and say, 'We won't sell the CBA, we won't sell Qantas, we won't Australian Airlines', but you simply sold them. We had the courage to go to the Auscarriageway tralian people and say, 'We will sell Telstra.' We had the courage to say what the public benefit of using the capital of Telstra would be. The Labor Party has no credibility on privatisation. Privatisation",77
124,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance. On the basis of that logic, is it now your intention to sell Australia Post? If not, why not? Mr FAIlEY-I can say the government has given no consideration to the sale of Australia Post. Road Toll",78
125,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is society addressed to the Minister for Transport Regional Development. Minister, how many Australians are being killed and maimed each accidents. year on the nation's roads? Can the minist-r advise what road trauma costs AustralIa presently? Further, what is the government doing to reduce the road toll, and how can members of this place assist?",78
126,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable ought member for Moreton for his question. It is a of very important question, particularly at this time of the year. Last year, 1995, some 2,017 people were killed on Australia's roads, some be 30,000 people were seriously injured, and some 90,000 people sustained minor injuries. This is an improvement over previous years. 1985 there were nearly 3,000 people killed on our roads. So we have been able to make the some improvement to the road toll. This is shown up in a host of areas. It is worth noting that our road trauma costs Australia some $6,100 million per annum. So it is not only an enormous emotional and social cost to the to country but also a substantial economic cost now attack to Australia's economy. The coalition government is doing everything it can to try to reduce the road toll. Over the last 10 years, on average, some 60 the people per year have been killed on t-e of Pacific Highway, one of the worse roads In Australia. We have announced a $3,100 million funding package, in partnership with sell both the New South Wales and Queensland governments, to upgrade that road to a dual four-lane standard. That is something that should have been done many years ago. We think that will reduce the road fatalities on that section of the highway by something in the order of 85 per cent, if past experience is any judge for the future. We have also announced a new black spots road funding program, which has been financed to the tune of $149 million. That will see some 400 projects undertaken each year identifying our worse accident sites around Australia. Going from past experience, that should save something in the order of 72 lives each year. We have also embarked on a national and rural road safety action plan, which is targeting specific groups in our that are more likely to be involved in and motor accidents, and therefore trying to educate them about avoiding those motor This week all members will receive a road safety kit, coming from the Department of Transport and Regional Development. That road safety kit will provide information to all members as to how they can participate in a national education program for the Christmas holiday period, designed to reduce the road toll. Last year some 41 people were killed in the Christmas-New Year holiday period. This road safety kit is designed to try to reduce that number of fatalities during the ChristmasNew Year period. I would urge all members of parliament to take up the opportunities presented to them through the provision of this kit. I hope they will ensure that their electorates, their communities, are educated about the dangers of driving during the Christmas-New Year period. The fundamental point that I hope all members will be passing on to their constituents is that people who are considering driving should not drink, and people should wear their seat belts. Surprisingly enough after many years of having compulsory seatbelt wearing, not enough people are wearing their seat belts, and this shows up in accident results. I am also asking motorists, through members putting out this information in their electorates, not to speed and to ensure that they drive according to the conditions. All members of parliament can participate during the Christmas-New Year period in reducing the road toll by helping to educate the members of the public within their electorates through the provision of this road safety kit. Extreme Right Wing Organisation",78
127,Mr HOLDING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to my letter to him in March this year in which I asked him to investigate the activities of the extreme right wing group headed by Lyndon LaRouche. Does he agree that the material provided to him indicated that this organisation had conducted extensive investigations, constituting almost harassment, of prominent Australian citizens-all of Jewish religion-and their wives and families? Does he agree that members of that organisation, non-Australian citizens, came into Australia in breach of our immigration laws? Does he also agree, on the evidence available, that they have divided Australian families? Does he also agree that, in their newspaper, they make continual criticisms of Australia's head of state, Her Majesty the Queen, who they describe as 'the head of an international drug cartel'? Does the Prime Minister need any more time to indicate whether or not he will create an independent inquiry into this organisation and their abuse not merely of Australian citizens but also of the processes of this House where, on one occasion, two prominent Australian citizens were smeared and maligned under parliamentary privilege?",79
128,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that I do remember him writing to me. I am aware of his very long held and legitimate concern about this organisation. Frankly, I will have to go and look at my records before I attempt a point by point response to everything that he said. In relation to that organisation and organisations of that kind, any organisation in Australia that engages in fomenting antiJewish feeling will be condemned utterly by me and will be condemned, I hope, by all members of this House. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",79
129,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say that absolutely and without any qualification. The question of whether the mere making of extravagant and palpably inaccurate claims about Australia's head of state of itself represents a justification for an inquiry is a matter that I would like to take on notice. I am not sure in accordance with the normal willingness of the Australian community to allow robust and free flowing debate that that of itself is somethinghowever absurd, palpably wrong and ridiculous such claims may be. There is always a fine line that has to be drawn on occasions such as this between on the one hand defending the right of stupid, bigoted, prejudiced people to say things but on the other hand determining whether those ridiculous, prejudiced, stupid things are said in such a way and with such frequency as to constitute an undermining of the normal canons of behaviour according to which all of us are meant to conform. It is a fine balance between free speech but by the same token not allowing systematic behaviour that takes advantage of the freedom that a society such as Australia provides. They were the sorts of difficulties that have been involved in other decisions that have been made by the government and by the former government, and I think, as a member of that former government, the member for Melbourne Ports would be very familiar with that. If I have been engaged in any undue delay, I apologise to the member for Melbourne Ports. Whatever formal response I give to the honourable member and whatever decision is taken, let there be no doubt that amongst the credentials of which this government is proud and of which I am personally exceptionally proud is my total abhorrence of any kind of anti-Semitism. Defence Industry",79
130,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel and Acting Minister for Defence. This government has made a commitment to boost the Defence Force's capabilities by quarantining the Defence budget from cuts and redirecting funds from administration to enhancing combat capabilities. In particular, the government made a commitment to provide greater direction for defence industry and ensure appropriate recognition to the importance of people as a Defence asset. Can the minister advise the House what steps have been taken to meet these commitments?",80
131,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When this government took over, we made a determination that we would have in Australia a self-reliant Defence Force within the framework of our alliances, backed up by a sustainable defence industry. What we have had previously very simply was a policy which required a series of projects to be filled, and it had no sustainability. Sustainability means that we must have firms engaged in defence industry which can survive losing a contract. That, in tum, meant that we had to introduce methods by which foreign firms doing business here would follow guidelines that meant that they would make a commitment to Australia. Accordingly, at the procurement conference earlier this year, I introduced a five point guideline for foreign firms to follow in order that they may be successful in this country in gaining contracts. They are: an investment which is significant in facilities and plant; a significant employment of Australian citizens; successful participation in major defence contracts, that is, runs on the board; significant levels of research and development in Australia; and that they show a demonstrated independence of action which, at the end of the day, means that they can successfully compete with a parent company for a contract. We have issued a new unclassified version of the Pink Book so that industry can be involved in the procurement process a lot earlier and that the existence of the ability of our industry to contribute to a project can be taken into account when the capability is determined. We have also entered into a series of more alliances with DSTO to enable the commercial development of ideas that emanate from DSTO, which, as well as assisting with the lengthening of the life of platforms, also means that they can be commercialised and make money. It is important to us as well that we have IP which is owned in Australia so that we can enhance our exports. For instance, in the last several years we spent billions of dollars on the shipbuilding industry, yet we can export none of it because we do not own the intellectual property. The intellectual property on the submarines is owned by the Swedes, on the ANZAC frigates it is owned by the Germans and on the minehunters it is owned by the Italians. Accordingly, we require R&D to be done here in the development of indigenous intellectual property. Further in the line of personnel, we have had a completely difficult philosophical shift. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Might it not be more appropriate for the blonde Bonaparte to make a ministerial statement?",80
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat! Government members-Withdraw! Withdraw!,80
133,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the member for Watson is a comic figure; he has just proved it. If I can go back to talking about our personnel: without our personnel, we do not have an ADF. We have had a major philosophical shift. We do not regard our personnel, as the Labor Party did, as public servants in uniform. We regard them as separate and distinct. Accordingly, from that philosophical shift, policies are moulded. One of them is the inquiry into the military compensation scheme and whether or not it is adequate. It has the capacity to be reviewed back to 1994 when the last government introduced that scheme. We have also introduced, as we promised we would, and acted upon, the promises we made before the election. They have either been totally implemented or are in the process of being implemented. They include: increasing the family support funding program from a maximum of $25,000 to $50,000; increasing the home owner defence loans scheme for mortgages from $40,000 to $80,000; and providing the child-care places we said we would. Along with my colleague Minister MCLachlan, introducing the defence efficiency review and the restructuring of the army, a strategic review, I can simply say that we have delivered on our promises, we will continue to deliver on our promises, and defence is in good shape. Family Benefit: Child Care",80
134,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Can the minister explain the 'win' from the family tax package for the following family in Rockingham, Western Australia: the father is a courier driver earning $25,000 a year, the mother earns $10,000 as a casual shop assistant in a small business and they have two children in community based long day care. This family qualifies to receive only $8.70 per week from the government's tax package con, but the government's cuts to child care mean they will pay an extra $40 per week for child care. Isn't it the case that this family in Rockingham will be more than $30 per week worse off? Why is the government punishing families in such an appalling way?",81
135,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to take this question in the two parts in which it was given. First of all, in relation to the family tax package, the Department of Social Security analysis does show that 80 per cent of families with dependent children will benefit from the family tax package. This is such a negative view. This is a person who says the glass is half empty instead of looking at it and saying it is half full. Our package is clearly aimed at benefiting families with dependent children in their vital role of raising their families. Mr O'Connor-They have to pay $2,000 more.",81
136,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Corio.,81
137,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I draw your attention also to the independent report of the National Centre for Economic and Social Modelling into the government's family tax package. That study clearly shows that the initiative will achieve its objectives; in particular, that families with children, especially single income families and especially sole parents, have adequate levels of income and in fact sole parents stand to benefit more than anyone else in the community. Those with children stand to gain $900 a year extra in their income. On the child-care issue, I want to expose the shadow minister for what she is. She is running around this country spreading misinformation about the family tax package and about the child-care system. In fact, in response to a letter from someone in Townsville recently who has been told that her child-care fees will be raised by $56.44 per week, we took the opportunity to ring that parent. We ran through the figures with her. We found that her child-care fees would be raised by only 56c per week. Government members-Oh! Oh!",81

The figures that the member keeps touting around this country can be demonstrated to be totally inaccurate. So we do not accept the figures that she has put forward at all.

148,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Merry Christmas. I draw the minister's attention to the government's commitment for pathways to real jobs for young Australians. Can the minister inform the House what action has been taken by the government since the March election to improve the employment and education prospects of Australia's young people?,82
149,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for LaTrobe for his question. His question of course goes to the heart of the major initiatives for which the employment, education and training portfolio has been responsible this year. The portfolio had the challenge, following the election, of addressing the major failures of the Labor governmenta government which persisted in putting unemployed young people through demoralising programs which locked tens of thousands of qualified young people out of university places, which denied many thousands of young people jobs because they were unable to put into effect effective literacy and numeracy programs and denied many thousands of young people apprenticeship opportunities. The Labor Party failed in this area because they were always pursuing industrial and short-term political objectives. Mr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I draw your attention to standing order 145 concerning relevance. The member for LaTrobe asked the minister what the government has done for employment and education for young people. That may be a shallow area for an answer; nevertheless, I ask you to bring him back to the question that he was asked.",82
150,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is addressing the question.,82
151,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reason the Labor Party failed to provide effective programs for young Australians was that they were constantly pursuing industrial and short-term political agendas. They had an industrial agenda for their labour market programs. They were trying to hide the long-term unemployed and redefine them as short-term unemployed. They had an industrial agenda for their training programs. They had an industrial agenda in the schools. The reason they pursued their university policies was very largely to ensure that the college unions had the same employment conditions as staff in universities. The fact is that, if the unions did not tell them what to do, they did not know what to do. That was the only source of policy that they had. The great contrast between the former government and this government",82

This dishonest calumny stands to no credit of the minister but it also happens to be irrelevant.

Training provided in one state is to be recognised around Australia. in Complex century old regulations which have prevented apprenticeships and traineeships House coming through are now agreed to be abolished by all the states and territories except since the Carr government in New South Wales. And one-stop-shop apprenticeship shops are being established around the states. In schools, we have discovered that 30 per cent of 14-year-olds cannot read properly. This is after 13 years of the Labor Party in government. We now have the first national literacy goal. We have the first national English literacy survey for 16 years, and national benchmarks are being established for years 3 and 5 in literacy. The disastrous impacts of the Dawkins reforms are being wound back in relation to vocational education, and the government is investing $187 million in vocational education in schools. Committees between schools and local businesses are now being established around Australia to provide young people with the opportunities that the opposition denied them, particularly in electorates which you claimed to have represented. This is a record of very substantial achieveMaxwell ments so far, but there is a long way to go. There is a long way to go to correct the failures of the previous government, but this government is firmly set on the path of expanding opportunities and choice for young people and families.",83

One of those is that women are far more likely by a factor of four to one to suffer violence as they go about their lives than are men. The statistics on which that quote was based show that women were four times more likely to be assaulted by a man than by a woman. It does not alter the fact that women are especially prone to suffer violence. The technical inaccuracy no way affects the substance of my answer, but I wanted to correct it. NA",85

224,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,As far as the proceedings in the House today are concerned--can you hear me? Opposition members-No!,87
225,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"Our proposition is that the House will rise today at 6 o'clock as usual. That is because that was the arranged hour, and some people may have made plans for this evening. Whilst tomorrow's sitting will be in effect an adjourned sitting from today, it is, however, proposed that at 5.30 p.m. today we will facilitate the usual adjournment debate--even though technically we will not be doing other than going on into the following day. It is proposed that tomorrow we will resume at 10.30 a.m. I do not see any point in us starting at 9.30 a.m., as essentially the task before the House tomorrow is to await the return of matters from the Senate. I expect that the Senate will sit relatively late so we should have a number of matters which the House can deal with at 10.30 a.m. In terms of the other matters before the House, we do have some bills which we have been debating in the last couple of days. I think the migration and bounty bills are still there and the flags bill is proceeding. We also have bills to be returned from the Senate. Members would be aware that there is a range of those. It is proposed that tomorrow we will have the valedictories at 4 o'clock in the usual form. We also expect that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) will be making a statement tomorrow, and the usual courtesies will be provided in respect of that statement to his opposite number. Lastly, as time permits, we would propose-we will discuss this during the day with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean)-a grievance debate and 90-second statements, again, emphasising as time permits. In terms of the schedule for the Senate tomorrow, we understand that the Senate could sit as late as midnight tomorrow night or the very early hours of Saturday morning, which means that we will keep the House sitting until the Senate has completed and after the completion or adjournment of the Senate, because there may be a time lag between when matters finish in the Senate and then have to be transmitted to the lower house for completion. I cannot otherwise give members an indication of the likely completion and adjournment of the House but at this stage I do expect that it could easily be 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or even later on Saturday morning.",87
226,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,Opposition members interjecting,87
227,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"We are serious. Unfortunately, your people have been running a filibuster in Telstra for three days this week. If you have any complaints, I suggest you lodge them in the office of the Leader of the Opposition who failed to exercise some authority over those in another place about dealing with this. If you do not believe me, you should read Alan Ramsey's comments on it in tonight, yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald. Leaving aside the interjections and the likely powerful address to be made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), that is how we expect matters to proceed in the next 24 hours plus. We will of course-as we have been doing in the last 24 hourscontinue to advise the Manager of Opposition Business of developments. If anything else transpires, we would be happy to keep people properly informed.",87
228,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"On indulgence, the processes that have been put in place by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) are not new. They are the sorts of procedures used at this time of the year. This is generally the position we arrive at. I want to answer one or two completely gratuitous points that he made on the question of the handling of the Telstra debate in the Senate. I point out these things. The opportunity to vote on Telstra has come up three times in the last month in the Senate and only recently has the government chosen to take advantage of the fact to put it down. The second point is that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) is today moving an unprecedented guillotine of Senate business to ensure that Senate business is completed. This contrasts extraordinarily with the way in which we, when in government, were massively disrupted in the Senate by the other side. I also point out that this comes on top of extended evening sittings of the Senate, on top of extended days in the Senate and on top of two extra weeks in the Senate for consideration of government legislation, virtually all of which has arrived-including their budget legislation-in the latter stages. Mr Reith interjecting",88
229,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"You made the gratuitous points, you get the answer. All of that has come as a result of our determination to not treat the government in the Senate in the shabby way in which we were treated for 13 years. Our record is manifestly better in terms of opposition behaviour. If the Leader of the House does not think so, perhaps he could point out to me when they, in opposition, were prepared to not only accept but move a guillotine on the business before them. You ought to be a bit grateful for it instead of graceless perorations in this place. NA Th!legatioD to the Kingdom of Cambodia",88

233,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,I am not revisiting. I am asking two questions to add to the explanation the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has given.,88
234,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,I think these questions can be resolved outside the chamber.,88
235,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"Firstly, will there be a dinner break provided for tomorrow night? Secondly, could we have the hour of valedictories brought forward to accommodate the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley)?",88
236,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"These are questions which in the normal course of business should be addressed outside the chamber, unless the minister wants to address them now.",88
237,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"As they were two genuine questions and not a furthering of the debate, I will answer them. As to the dinner break, we have not given consideration to that but it would be my view that we should have a dinner break. We will discuss that with you. As to the time of the valedictories, I think 4 o'clock has been agreed with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I was not aware it was inconvenient for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). Obviously, we would like it to be convenient for both sides, so we will have to discuss that. NA Australian Economy",88
238,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter your from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The stagnation of the Australian economy under the Coalition Government. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",88
239,Mr GARETH EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Just about every available bit of evidence, numerion calor anecdotal, is currently telling exactly the same story about the Australian economy: that it has gone backwards under'the coaliably tion, that it is stagnant, that it is underjustify performing and that it is, 'Flat, flat, flat,' the Financial Review was saying a few days ago. It is not a matter of the opposition doomsaying or a matter of point a matter of stating the simple truth. The evidence is all around us. It is evident in the job figures, it is evident in the growth figures, it is evident in the consumption and retail sales figures and it is evident in about dozen other indicators presently around. In particular, it is evident in what business leaders are presently saying about this governus ment. I hope Mr Costello, the Treasurer, whostand yes-is coming into the chamber, will have had the opportunity by now to read the full survey in the Business Review Weekly from which he partially quoted today. I think a little bit of that cinemascope smirk, that Panavision smirk, that Imax smirk, will wiped off his face when he sees what the survey says about what 1,000 CEOs in this country think of the government's handling the economy and of its economic performTreasurer ance. In the September quarter, with the triumph of optimism still overexperienced, you had 52 per cent of CEOs saying that the governbeen ment's performance was good or very good. In the latest quarter survey reported in BRW this week, you have just 29 per cent of CEOs prepared to give the government the Treasurer their endorsement for the management of the economy. As the BRW ments in the accompanying article, this characterisable as nothing else than 'a colthat lapse of support in the business community for this government's economic management'. The Treasurer will no doubt say, 'How you say all this in the context of today's figures? Don't they tell a different, more optimistic story?' The short answer is they do nothing of the kind. The government has been bit inclined, as one would expect, to be triumphalist today about these figures and, the face of it, improvement in the unemployment rate from 8.8 per cent to 8.5 per cent does give us all something to be reasonpleased about. Whether it is enough to Senator Vanstone, the minister for as employment, saying that we are beginning to see the benefits of the government's policy to bring about fundamental changes to the economy to create real jobs, however, is a marker she might well later regret having put scoring; just down at this stage. The truth of the matter is that, if there were signs in all of this that the economy was back on a growth path, that unemployment was on a the way down again and that the human misery associated with it was being reduced, we would all be delighted-not least those of in the Labor Party because it is primarily our people, the people whom we support and for, who are affected by this. But there are still nearly 800,000 Australians unemployed; there are still 15,000 fewer full-time jobs than there were at the time of the budget. There is simply no foundation for optimism in today's figures. Let me say why. It is not be a matter of taking the seasonally adjusted figures and attributing great significance to them, because they do jump around. The more of appropriate figures to have regard to, as the ought to be aware because his own minister for employment and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have acknowledged it, are the trend figures. Senator Vanstone has saying all year-she first said it back in April-that not too much weight should be the placed on month to month fluctuations in such a volatile series. The important thing is and the underlying trend. When you look at the trend figures for comunemployment and employment you see a is much less sanguine, less happy, story from which the government is inclined to tell about the condition of the economy. Trend unemployment is rising and is at its worse can level for two years-since 1994. The government appears on all the available evidence to have no chance whatsoever of achieving even its very modest budget forecast of a reduction in unemployment to 81,4 per cent by June next year. The Treasurer conceded as much in a speech he made earlier this week. Moreover, when you look at trend employment you find it crawling along at 0.08 per cent a month. That is equal to annualised employment growth of just one per cent at the moment, just half the government's forecast for employment creation. More generallyand I hope the Treasurer will acknowledge this-labour force figures follow current economic activity with a lag. The current economic activity is very flat and there is nothing going on at the moment in the economy that can possibly give anyone any hope of a strong acceleration in employment growth this coming year. What do we know about current activity in the economy as a whole? What else do the statistics tell us about growth in the economy? Growth in the economy is running now at around two per cent. Last week's national accounts make that perfectly clear when you look at the trend figures and the recent quarters and extrapolate from them. Compare that two per cent with the 3V2 per cent that was forecast in the budget and the four per cent growth that was averaged by the Labor Party in government over the last three years, the fi ve per cent that was achieved by the Labor Party government in the year to March, and also the four to five per cent growth which your current leader, Prime Minister John Howard, last year said had to be achieved and sustained over the rest of the decade and beyond-four to five per cent-if we are to 'make lasting inroads into unemployment.' You are not getting four to five per cent; you are not getting 3V2 per cent at the moment. You are getting not much better than just two per cent. The consequences of that for the condition of the economy and, in particular, the plight of the unemployed and those who fear they will be unemployed in the future are immense. The government says, and we will no doubt hear it again from the Treasurer, 'It is not the right figure; the right figure is 3.8 per cent. Look at what the national accounts actually said.' But that is 3.8 per cent in the year through to the current quarter-the last quarter reported. Of that 3.8 per cent, 2.9 per cent was achieved as growth under Labor. The last two quarters have generated respectively just 0.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent for a grand total of 0.9 per cent. The Treasurer might be heard to say, as I think he was again in question time today, 'Well, 0.8 per cent is really pretty good, isn't it? If we can multiply that over the next three quarters of this financial year we won't be doing real bad.' Well, you won't be doing real good because even if you were able to extrapolate in that way, that only gets you to 3.2 per cent which is still less than the miserly 3.5 per cent that you have hung your hat on for the budget. It is not enough to generate any kind of significant reduction in unemployment; it is just not a good enough performance. Moreover, there is every reason to believe that that 0.8 per cent will not be sustained. It is based, as you ought to be prepared to acknowledge, on a very high stocks build-up in this last quarter. Stock to sale ratios are the highest since December 1993 and, given what we know about private consumption at the moment, that stock build-up is not going to be drawn down in any significant way and these figures about growth are not going to be sustained. It is a gloomy picture so far as growth is concerned. Similarly with private consumption, the national accounts figures showed almost no consumption growth over the last quarter. Retail sales figures from the ABS a couple of weeks ago showed them falling for an utterly unprecedented three months in a row. Yesterday you did not know about it in question time when you were sprung with it. You dissimulated, you fudged and fiddled, but the Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index showed consumer confidence falling a full 6.7 per cent-back below where it was at budget time and back below consumer confidence when the Labor Party was in office, before you came into government. That is a devastating indictment of your management, given in particular that private consumption constitutes around 60 per cent of national expenditure. It makes a huge impact on the economy. What about business investment? Is that going to make any difference? Does that tell a different story? The truth is that business investment has been holding up reasonably well in the aggregate. We acknowledge that. It may meet, alone of all these other figuresMr Crean-Telecommunications and mining.",89
240,Mr GARETH EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Exactly, because - hen. you look at it more closely you see it IS beIng concentrated in those areas of the economy which we all know are not and ne-er will be major employment generators. It IS also the case that such investment as is occurring at the moment, as distinct from that which is contemplated, is a function by and large of the degree of confidence that was around at the beginning of the year when the Labor Party was still in office. You are residual beneficiaries of that. Moreover, because of the worries which pr-sently do exist about private consumption beIng so weak and about company profitability having declined as much as it has, there is every reason to be concerned as to whether those predicted or expected levels of future - nvestment will hold up. Again, in terms of its Impact on the entire economy, it is around only 10 or 11 per cent of the total economic expenditure. Overwhelmingly, the muscle has to come from private consumption and that ma- wel- swamp any positive impact that bUSIness Investment has to contribute. The interest rate cut which occurred yestert-at day was extremely welcomed, and it will do something-I hope, something significant-to redre-s the situation I have been describing. That IS why we argued for it; that is why we have very warmly welcomed it. But the point about it is that interest rate reduction confirms exactly what we have been saying about the economy: it is not a reward for good management of the economy by this government; rather, it is an overdue bail-out ?y the .Reserv.e - ank for' an economy which IS mamfestly In Increasing distress. There are always two questions that have to be. answered in the affirmative if you are gomg to justify an interest rate cut: does the condition of the economy make it desirable' and, is the inflation environment or outlook such as to make it possible? Here, the answer was yes on both counts, because the inflation lega-y of the - abor Party government is m-mfestly holdIng up-helped, it has to be Said, by the stagnation of the economy at - arge. But - verything else about the economy IS flat, making It absolutely desirable-in fact unavoidable-that that particular changshould occur. - veryone ought to be acutely aware-it is a simple truth of economic management-that you cannot rescue the economy, you cannot - enerate employ.ment growth, by monetary or mterest rate polIcy alone. You have to have a complementary budget and fiscal strategy. We in the Labor Party would say more than that;, that you have to have a wages policy, a senSible approach to that part of the tripod of actions and policy responses. The government has not done that. The government's budget strategy has been totally m-sconceived in terms of the real problems of thiS economy at this stage. The slash and bum, fast track deficit reduction that has been adopted basically involves the government in saying, 'Hang the consequences of all this for growth, hang the consequences for employm-nt. Leave that to labour market deregula-lOn, leave that to the IR legislation. That will solve that particular problem for us.' The government now has the IR legislation that it says it wanted, and it will become evident very quickly to the Australian public any suggestion that it will make any difference to the employment situation is simply illusory. Here, as elsewhere, the electorate has been sold a very large and scraggy pup-by the 'dog' on this particular occasion. The ALP's budget strategy, the opposition's budget strategy, is very different indeed. We make no bones about stating with confidence what an alternative approach should be. We acknowledge the importance of reducing the deficit, and we want to contribute to a reduction in budget deficit, to improve national savings by that means as well as by actions in the private sector. But we say, and will continue to say, that this is not the highest pnonty for the Australian economy at the moment. It should not be regarded as a priority which completely outstrips the much greater need at the moment, which is to do something sensible and serious about unemployment. Australia does not have the kind of deficit or public debt problem that afflicts most industrialised countries in the world, particustagnation. ' larly in Europe. We do not have to take drastic action because of runaway current account or inflation problems. We can afford to take a moderate and balanced approach which does not add to unemployment, which does not involve sacking public servants, taking half a percent off growth. The irony, as we continue to assert, is that you can do all those things by an approach which gets you there but without any of the pain that this government seems determined to perpetrate. There is a high cut road to balance; there is a low cut road to balance. You take the high cut road, we will take the low cut road, and we say that we can get there before you with a much more sane and humane balance being achieved in public expenditure and fiscal achievement as a result. This government has squandered a very golden opportunity to deliver strong growth and falling unemployment. It inherited an economy that was really rocketing along at five per cent growth, with 700,000 jobs being created, unemployment coming down from 11 to 81f2 per centMr Wilton-Better than good. Mr GARETH EV ANS-Better than good in every possible way, with inflation a sustainable 21f2 per cent at the same time. It is quite an achievement to take that economy and, within six months, knock the stuffing out of it. You can run but you cannot hide. (Time expired)",91
241,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That was the wrong spokesman, wrong day, wrong analysis. It occurred to me that perhaps the reason the opposition had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) get up today to do the MPI is that it might be his last occasion here as a spokesman on economic matters. I cannot imagine why they would have chosen the day when the labour force figures showed a 24,000 increase in jobs for the month to run an MPI on the stagnating economy. All I can think of is that earlier in the week they sat around and said, 'Look, Gareth has had a bad year; we'd better give him the last debate of the year. other What will we do it on? We will do it on The only trouble is that at 11.30 this morning this 'stagnating economy' produced 24,400 jobs. I do not know if they told the shadow Treasurer that and he went ahead in ignorance, or whether they gave him the shortest straw and said, 'We've got nothing else to do today; you'd better hop up there and run your line on the stagnating economy.' Perhaps the most prescient explanation is the one I give, and it will be very interesting to see whether the deputy leader is back here next year or whether he is still a spokesman on the economy. It has not been a happy entry into the House of Representatives for him. We understand that it is a different place from the Senate, but it would have been easier for him if his party had allowed him to actually run an economic position. Clearly, the Labor Party has been at sixes and sevens with itself on economic policy. I take that into account as one of the difficulties that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has faced. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that the Labor Party started off by saying that there was no deficit. That was the first claim after the election: there was no deficit. Don't you remember? At that point, the deputy leader was sent in here to say that it was all a con, that it had been concocted. That was the first economic proposition that the Labor Party was putting: there was no deficit. If that were right, no deficit reduction strategy was required. The former Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), had to maintain that line because he had been assuring everybody during the election that the accounts were balanced. Once the accounts were disclosed and released to us, we knew what he had every wit of knowing during the election campaign, that we were facing up to a $8 billion deficit at that stage and a $8 billion deficit the year after. When the accounts finally came in, it had worsened. Far from this deficit having been engineered or somehow put into place by the government, the fact was the outcome was a $10 billion deficit. Do you not recall coming into this House after March-and I think I would ask my advisers, if I were' you, for an explanation as to why they put this proposition up-saying that there was no deficit, it was all a con-in fact, there was nothing to be balanced? That was the position you were running on behalf of the Labor Party in the aftermath of the election. Once the accounts were disclosed and the Labor Party could not maintain that myth any further, it then said, 'We will agree to a deficit reduction strategy and balancing the budget.' Your argument at that point, you may recall, was that, again, it would be too much to balance this deficit over two years; what should be done was a balance over three years. That was your argument in the run-up to the August budget; in fact, that was your argument the day after the budget. Mr Gareth Evans-And still is.",92
242,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And still is-this is a new development today. What the government did in the budget is put down a three-year program. When you were asked the day after the budget on ABC radio on the Couchman program, 'What would you have done differently?' you said, 'We'd have balanced over three years.' In fact, the night before we had set out a program to balance over three years. Plainly you had not been able to comprehend the budget documents. You were asked, 'What would you have done differently?, and you said, 'We'd have balanced over three years.' The budget had balanced over three years. It had been announced the day before. It was in the budget paper. That was the position the day after the election: that it would be a different strategy to budget over three years. Oh, what a tangled web we weave! You come in here and say it still is your proposition to balance over three years, but the day after the budget it was a different strategy to the government's to balance over three years. Now, apparently, it is the same strategy. I have often said in relation to these matters: where there is no understanding, there is no conscience. Then we had the Labor Party, in its preand post-August budget incantation, saying that what it would do differently is that it would balance the budget and it would balance it over three years. Of course, never having an eye for consistency or credibility in relation to policy, what that eventually meant was that it would balance the budget over three years by opposing all expenditure cuts, which meant either one of two things: it really had a tax agenda-since it is in opposition and did not move any taxes that could not have been its position--or it had no comprehension that to close a deficit you have to we will agree to reduce spending. Most people would understand this proposition: if you are spending more than you are earning and you want to get back into a balance, you have to stop spending as much. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has a proposition. He says, 'You can have a $10 billion deficit and not cut your spending and somehow it magically disappears.' Mr Gareth Evans-Growth, it is called.",93
243,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is maintaining it even now. It is all so easy. Why didn't we think of this? If you have a $10 billion deficit and you don't do anything, it disappears! What I do not understand is, if all you have to do is nothing to close a $10 billion deficit, why hadn't you done it? Why hadn't you done it in 1995-96? If all that was required to close a $10 billion deficit was nothing, why hadn't your policy of nothing in 1995-96 closed it? If all that is required to get back into a position of balance when you are spending $10 billion more than you are earning is nothing, why hadn't it worked? The proposition only has to be stated to be viewed as absurd. Mr Latham-You have said it four times. Why don't you say it again?",93
244,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will say it again because you may understand it. I will give the member for Werriwa this: I don't think he would have gone to the dispatch box and tried this one. I don't think he would have gone to the dispatch box and tried the proposition that all you have to do to balance $10 billion of deficit is nothing-and wouldn't governing be much easier if that were the case? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition comes in here and says, 'Business investment's holding up. Yes, capital expenditure's holding up. Yes, we concede that it was good that today it was announced that 24,000 jobs were created in the month. Yes, it is good that we have had three interest rate cuts, but wouldn't it have been great, so much the better, if the government had done nothing?' Where do you think all of these things flow from? Where do you think the reductions in interest rates flow from? Has it ever occurred to anybody in the Labor Party to ask this question: in late 1994, official interest rates went up 2% per cent-if it were so easy to reduce official interest rates, since you were going to an election in March 1996, why didn't you reduce them? If it were just a matter of doing nothing, why weren't the official interest rates reduced between late 1994 and March 1996? That is when the Labor Party knew it was going to an election. Obviously, home buyers and business would have benefited from interest rate reductions. Why didn't it occur? The reason was the Labor Party couldn't do two things, and these are the two policy responses that have enabled this situation to be set up: one was to lock low inflation and low inflation expectations in-and that was done by the statement of monetary policy and the position we are taking in relation to wages-and the second was to address the fiscal problem. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says he really would like to see the budget balanced because somebody told him, 'Look, Gareth, if you don't say that, you'll really the cat out of the bag, you'll know that there's no understanding behind the words. So at all costs you've got to say that you believe in a balanced budget, but just go out and oppose every proposition that would get you there and we'll see if we can get away with that kind of political tactic.' You won't; you can't. Nobody is going to believe you. There is no respect for such a discontinent position amongst the people who actually are interested in this area. Mr Gareth Evans-Incontinent or discontinent?",93
245,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You suffer from discontinence and various other maladies as well, may I say, but for the moment that is the only one I will refer to. It was necessary to put that budget strategy into place in order to make fiscal policy consistent with monetary policy. The truth cannot be faced, because the truth of the matter is that dealing with fiscal policy and getting the benefit in relation to interest rates exposes where Labor really stand. They are against putting the fiscal accounts back into balance, which means they are in favour of higher interest rates. I suppose they have sat back and said, 'Look, just go out there and we will see if we can get away with this line that you can have it all. You can balance budgets which are $10 billion in deficit by not cutting. You can lower interest rates by running deficits. You can have growth without changing any of the fundamental structures. We will just go and argue that, if the government had done nothing, everything would have been as rosy and-if you want the topping on the cakeeven rosier.' The do-nothing strategy would have produced all of these things. But, if the donothing strategy could have produced all of these things, why didn't it under the Labor government? Why didn't you, in exercise of the do-nothing strategy, put any of these measures in place in the lead-up to the March 1996 election? The fact is that, until the Labor Party can come to grips with its failures in economic policy and, more importantly, come to grips with the fundamentals of the let argument, it will not be taken seriously on really let people these matters. Let me just give an indication of where the Australian economy stands. Growth in the September quarter was 0.8 per cent. Over the year to the September quarter it was 3.8 per cent. They are the outcomes. You talked about various figures. That is the figure. That is the report of the national accounts. The national accounts showed strong growth in business investment-up eight per cent in the September quarter. The capital expenditure survey showed that the fourth set of expectations was 20 per cent higher than the equivalent estimate last year. There are prospects of pick-up in housing, as I said earlier. You have had a 24,000 growth in jobs in the last month. Employment grew by 0.5 per cent in the September quarter, which is consistent with the budget forecast. You have a consumer price index of 2.1 per cent, which is probably better than the budget forecast. You have had three reductions in official interest rates. You now have home mortgage rates as low as they have been right back to June 1974. Mr Latham-Bring back Gough.",94
246,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Gough was the one that destroyed it. Gough was the one that set off the price and wage spirals in 1974 that took away the prospect of low interest rates. We do not say that we can hang up now and say the job is done. It is a question of working towards it in a sustained way. But we can say there is solid growth in this economy. The reports in relation to the labour force prove that there is job creation. You have interest rates kicking in in 1997. You have a pick-up in the housing cycle. You have great opportunities for small business and great opportunities for home buyers. This is great news for Australia. I am sorry it does not fit in with the nostrums of the Labor Party, which was hoping for the economy to turn down, but it is good news for Australia. It ought to be welcomed by the Labor Party. They ought to take joy in seeing better opportunities for the people of Australia and they ought to acknowledge that the measures that were put in place to secure these kinds of outcomes are consistent.

257,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The deputy leader will resume his seat!,95
258,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Treasurer (Mr Costello) and I, as young parents at this time of the year, have the task of examining our young children's school reports. The problem for our children-and I have two: young Benjamin, who is 13 and in the gallery today, and Clare, who is II-is that, unlike the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) yesterday, they do not have the opportunity to write their own school report. It is prepared at arms-length, and all we as parents seek when we examine those reports - and I will have that opportunity on Saturday when, hopefully, I will be able to return home-is that they have performed to the best of their ability. That is the real question the Australian community ought to be posing at the moment. Has this government performed to its expectations, to the best of its ability, since it was elected on 2 March? The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said, when responding to the Prime Minister's own report card yesterday entitled 'The 1996 progress report to the people', that it was big on rhetoric and little on achievement. If you have any doubts about that, the Australian community ought to objectively examine the performance of the Howard government today with respect to the all-important issue of unemployment. I know it is not of concern to the Treasurer, who is leaving the chamber at the moment, because he comes from a well-heeled section of the Australian community and he is capable, unlike many Australians, of purchasing his children's way, irrespective of their ability, into a university place. I take the view that all Australians are entitled to equal opportunities in life. That requires that in examining this government's performance-its report card-today we critically examine its performance on the question of jobs. I'll tell you what: it is a pretty miserable performance. The Treasurer suggested today that Australia ought to be relaxed and secure in the knowledge that the trend rate of unemployment is 8.7 per cent. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, said yet again today that she is a friend of the trend-the 8.7 per cent rate. The Treasurer had the hide to come in here today and say that as we get closer to Christmas Australian families ought to be relaxed and secure in the knowledge that the trend rate of unemployment is 8.7 per cent. Do you know what that trend rate of unemployment 8.7 per cent means? It is not only the same trend rate as last month but also the worse trend rate of unemployment for 18 months. That is why the Prime Minister, unlike the Treasurer, was very cautious in question time today. He knows that his government is on the ropes when it comes to achieving their very moderate budget objective of 8.5 per cent unemployment. Compare that to the target we were prepared to set at the start of this term of government. I think our target of five per cent was realisable. The government has set a moderate target of 8.25 per cent. When questioned today, the minister for employment was not prepared to commit herself to the capacity of this government to achieve the moderate unemployment rate of 8.25 per cent. I would have expected, with the establishment of that all-important unemployment committee, that the Howard government coming up to Christmas could have come up with a few new ideas about how to assist industry, to build confidence in the Australian community and to ensure that we can do something about making substantial progress to reduce unemployment in Australia. I'll tell you what: what is the view of the Australian community about this government's report card and the performance of the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and their other millionaire ministerial mates who sit on the front bench? I note that in question time today the Treasurer referred to the Business Review Weekly. He selectively quoted reports from the Business Review Weekly about the performance of the government and the business community's view about the report card of the Howard government to date. An article in the Business Review Weekly of 16 December states: They feel the Government does not understand the needs of big business and that it lacks vision. The article by David Forman goes on to state that almost every sector has a low opinion of Canberra's sympathy for business. And well might the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) hang his head in shame. The Business Review Weekly says that we depend on confidence in business to invest, to create jobs that support regional Australia-that sector of Australia that this government walks away from-and to create economic well-being. What does the business community say about them? They say that almost every sector has a low opinion of Canberra's sympathy for business. It gets worse. Let us examine some of the fine print in the article that the Treasurer chose to ignore today. It states: Despite expectations of a much better year, business support for the way the Government is doing its job has collapsed. And well might it collapse. There is no support for regional Australia and no support for industry. Today the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) wanted to talk about young unemployed Australians. He did not tell the House today that there are 11,200 more young unemployed Australians now than when the Howard government assumed responsibility for the future of this nation in March of this year. Opposition members-Disgraceful!",95
259,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a disgrace. When Australian families come together at Christmas they will not feel relaxed and comfortable about the job prospects for their young men and women. Christmas is about families coming together with some sense of hope for the future. Hopefully, they are able to sit down and enjoy one another's friendship in the knowledge that they have a bright future and they have the right to feel relaxed and comfortable. The business community also states in this article: ... Top 1,000 poll, chief executives feel the Government has little understanding of their needs and is failing to provide the vision that it should.",97
260,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member for Capricornia will leave the chamber and return with his jacket if he wishes to enter.,97
261,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is people like the member for Capricornia who have created in the Australian community a low expectation about the performance of this government. Look at the type of people who were elected to this parliament. This quarter, it is no wonder that 29 per cent of the 151 polled considered that they have no real problems. None considered the government to have done a very good job in this area. That is a 23 percentage point fall in the approval rating compared to the previous quarter. An overwhelming majority also believe that the government should have a very clear, articulated vision for industry-that has not occurred and nor will it occur in the life of this parliament. That is not just the view of the business community. Tim Costello said last night in Melbourne: We also believe that we have a growing underemployment problem, people who are on contracts and casual work who are finding that the insecurity of their work hasn't allowed them to make financial planning to provide for themselves and their families and therefore they are turning to welfare agencies. Christmas is on our doorstep. I would have thought that in examining the report card the Australian community should have been relaxed and comfortable. The fact is that unemployment is not improving. The trend rate is 8.7 per cent. More young Australians are unemployed now than in March of this year. Not only that, the Australian business community, the engine room of job growth that we so much depend on and that the previous government did so much to support, encourage and push, has no confidence in the performance of the Howard government. I say to the Australian community: do not relax, continue to place pressure on the Howard-Costello government to face up to their responsibilities, to actually dirty their hands and get involved with Australian industry, to try to do something to assist with job growth, to try to build some confidence in Australian-(Time expired). Mr Costell- Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to table a transcript of remarks made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on radio 3LO in an interview with Peter Couchman. Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Surely there can be no indulgence in the middle of an MPI when the member for MCEwen was jumping to her feet to seek the call. The next member in the MPI was seeking the call, and there can be no indulgence in the middle of an MPI.",97
262,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Nehl)There is no point of order. Mr Costell-I am quite happy to rely on the transcript, which will expose entirely what you just sought to do. It said this: EVANS: ... We did have some issues that needed to be addressed. The budget deficits were getting too big againMr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Surely if the Treasurer does intend to claim that he was misrepresented, he can do that at a break after the MPI. But it is unprecedented for someone to get up in the middle of the MPI and try to knock over their own speaker-the member for MCEwen-in this debate. Surely this could be fixed up at the end of the debate if the Treasurer is so touchy.",97
263,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the honourable member for Watson for his point of order. You may not be aware that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did precisely this; he sought leave to make a personal explanation in the middle of the MPI. The Treasurer is not seeking to make a personal explanation. He has sought indulgence for a very brief statement. He will be brief. Mr Costello-I am happy to table this transcript. It reads: EVANS: ... We did have some issues that needed to be addressed. The budget deficits were getting too big again, they had to be brought back, but was a medium tenn task that we believed could have been accomplished with infinitely less pain over a three year period. I table the transcript. Mr Martin Ferguson-Prior to being able to seek the opportunity to table some documentation, the Treasurer sought the call. I seek to table material referred to in my speech on the MPI today. It is a report from the Business Review Weekly on the CEOs' expectation of the performance of this government, together with an AAP report. Leave granted.",98
264,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am trying to get this MPI finished and I would remind the Treasurer that when other business is before the House, he does need to seek leave to table his document. Mr Costello-I seek leave. Leave granted.",98
265,Mrs BAILEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have listened to a number of debates in this chamber. I listened to a number of people who are currently occupying the opposition benches when they were in government. I have heard some pretty outrageous statements and a lot of hypocrisy in this chamber, but rarely have I heard anything like the hypocrisy I heard in this chamber today. The remnants of the former government, who are occupying those benches opposite me, have the gall to start a negative campaign. The topic of this MPI today is yet another example of the negative campaign that the opposition has been waging. I think it should be remembered that this is an opposition who, when they were occupying the government benches, were responsible for the worse recession in 60 years. They were responsible for driving thousands of small businesses to the wall. That resulted in thousands of people losing their family businesses and their family farms, and it inevitably led to the break-up of many families. This is a group who, throughout their 13 years of government, were intent on deal making with interest groups at the expense of many of our major industries--certainly at the expense of our small business sector, the sector that is that going to increase job opportunities in our economy. They were the group who were responsible for a 300 per cent increase in Commonwealth debt and an 800 per cent increase in foreign debt. When the Australian people said on 2 March, 'We have had enough of the deceit, the false promises, the broken promises and the lost opportunities,' we discovered on entering government perhaps one of the biggest porkies of all times perpetrated by those opposite. They kept insisting that the accounts were balanced. Instead it was brought home to us that there was a massive $10.3 billion deficit, the end product of six consecutive underlying budget deficits. For the last five years of the Labor government, budget deficits totalled $70 billion. We heard the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) mention a school report card. I think it is about time that this House and those listening to this broadcast were reminded of the report card of that crowd over there who occupied the government benches for 13 years. Their report card certainly nothing to be proud of. If we look at interest rates under Labor, we see that we had the second highest prime rate amongst developed nations. Credit card in interest rates went up to 25 per cent. Housing interest rates rose above 17 per cent. In fact, many small businesses were paying interest rates of around 23 per cent. Proof of that on that report card can be seen, if you drive through many country towns like the ones in my electorate, in the number of vacant shops and the number of families who have their businesses-testimony to the very bad economic management of the former Labor government. Living standards is another item on their report card. Our world ranking, based on capita income, fell from tenth to 22nd in 10 years from 1983 to 1993. National savings were lower than at the depth of the 1982-83 recession. Household savings were at a record low level. Is it any wonder that they were such a low level when, over the past decade, it has taken two family incomes just to meet mortgage payments and household expendisent tures and keep families together? It has so tough for many families in my electorate that they have not even been able to afford send their children on school camps. During the 1982-83 recession, investment fell to 22.6 per cent of GDP. It recovered slightly to 25.7 per cent and then plummeted to 20.5 per cent in Keating's recession of 1993. At the end of the Keating era, it had only risen to 21.7 per cent of GDP. As is the case with unemployment, the damage done trous was greater and the recovery has been so much weaker. Investment was at a lower level in March 1996 when we came into government than was at the worse point in the recession of 1982-83. Those figures, while they are dence of the failure of the previous Labor government, do not show the pain, the sufferremind ing, the pressure, the tension and stress felt so many Australian families. Our current account was the worse in the OECD. For 13 years Labor fiddled around with the tax system, and every time they fiddled with tax system they created an even greater perfectly was compliance nightmare. Productivity levels under the previous Labor government were 10 per cent below the OECD average. We have heard some talk today from those the opposition about jobs. In the six years from July 1990, the beginning of Labor's recession, to March of this year, only 7,100 full-time jobs were created. Between July item 1990 and November 1992, 433,000 full-time jobs had been destroyed. Once again, those figures do not show the pain and the suffering that those families and those who have lost lost their jobs have gone through. This is the report card that the member for Batman did not want to talk about and did not want to share with those listening to this broadcast. At the end of the 13 years of Labor per government, that was a disgraceful report the card. The comments at the bottom of Labor's report card-the member for Batman might look at comments on the bottom of his children's report card-showed that Labor had at slashed real wages and productivity growth, that it had caused the worse unemployment since the Great Depression and that it had us spiralling into massive deficit, choking been every single Australian with debt. That has been the legacy of 13 years of to Labor rule. Is it any wonder that on 2 March of this year Australians in resounding numbers said that they have had enough? Yet the opposition have the audacity to bring this MPI on today. I believe the reason why the opposition are constantly being negative and constantly wanting to indulge in mythology is that they are still trying to hide their disasrecord. They are still trying to talk down the economy. They are still trying not to accept all the improvements and all the advances that have been made in our econit omy under the Howard government. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we evihave achieved so much in just the eight months since coming to office. I would the House and the few opposition by members present in the chamber that their report card has already been judged at the 2 March election. Just in case they did not get the message, at the Lindsay by-election the that Australian people again made the message and abundantly clear. In effect, what they said was, 'We will judge the Labor government by its failures. The Howard government will be judged for restoring hope.' (Time expired)",98

NA The following bill was returned from the Senate without amendment or request: Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996 NA BILL (No.4) 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",100
267,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.37 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill implements the government's election commitment to provide rollover relief for the disposal of active assets used by small businesses. Rollover relief has been eagerly awaited by thousands of small business operators that potentially faced a capital gains tax bill when they sold an asset and sought to invest the capital in a new one. The capital gains tax acted as an impediment to small business growth and jobs in the small business sector. This bill demonstrates this government's strong commitment to small business. This measure provides small business with a boost of $200 million per year. The removal of the 'like kind' business test and the extension of time for the acquisition of replacement assets further demonstrates our commitment to listening to the concerns of small business. Taxpayers eligible for the rollover relief are individuals, partners, companies and trusts. The measures will apply to disposals of assets on or after 1 July 1997. The bill also implements the government's election commitment to inject $15 million per year to provide more generous tax treatment for employee share schemes in recognition of the role of employee share schemes in strengthening employee participation in Australian business. The bill will double the income tax exemption from $500 to $1,000 per employee per year, with a matching increase in the deduction available to employers. This bonus to employees will be available SENATE for shares or rights acquired on or after I July 1996. The bill also eases the employee participation condition for employee share schemes to qualify for concessional tax treatment from 75 per cent to two-thirds of employees. Amendments to the employee share scheme provisions announced in the budget are also being made, together with a number of technical amendments raised in submissions. The bill also implements the election commitment to bring an end to the concessional 20 per cent prime cost depreciation rate for trading ships. Transitional arrangements will enable ships that already qualify for the concession to remain eligible, as well as ships in respect of which a purchase or construction contract was signed before 1 May 1996 provided the ship is delivered to the shipowner and registered in Australia before 1 July 1997. The amendments to section 160ZZS of the Income Tax Assessment Act announced in the 1996-97 budget are also contained in the bill. The bill will amend section 160ZZS to require public entities-that is, public companies, publicly traded unit trusts and mutual insurance organisations-to test for changes in the majority underlying interests in the assets of the public entity every five years from 20 January 1997 or where there is abnormal trading. To assist public entities to undertake these tests, streamlined rules for determining majority underlying interests will be able to be used by public entities. Taxpayers other than public entities will not be affected by the amendment of section 160ZZS. The pay-as-you-earn provisions, and certain rebate and exemption provisions of the income tax law, will be amended to replace the current references to Commonwealth education or training programs with a generic term-Commonwealth education or training payments. The use of the general expression in the tax law to describe the Commonwealth education or training scheme payments administered by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and some other Commonwealth agencies will ensure the taxation result intended to apply such payments is consistently achieved even when changes are made to those schemes or schemes are deleted or added. The bill will amend Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No.4) 1995 to allow companies the option to defer conversion to the class C franking account after they are paid a class C franked dividend or a trust or partnership amount with class C franking credits attached. The bill will also amend that act to eliminate an unintended dual liability to class A franking deficit tax or franking additional tax which may arise in certain situations. Technical amendments will also be made to the foreign source income regime, commercial debt forgiveness provisions, tax file number provisions and provisions relating to equity investments in small and medium enterprises. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House and provide an explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Tanner) adjourned. NA NA (No.2) 1996 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (4.43 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill includes a range of measures announced in the budget to amend the provisions of the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 190 1 relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The budget announced the government's intention to achieve savings in the scheme by tightening eligibility and containing growth in outlays which have resulted from decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal-the to AAT-and the Federal Court which have had the effect of widening eligibility under the scheme beyond its intent. In its recent performance audit on the diesel fuel rebate scheme, the Australian National Audit Office recommended that the purpose and objective of the scheme be clarified and that a range of measures be introduced to improve administration and accountability. The genesis of this scheme lies in providing relief from excise on diesel fuel used 'off road'. This link, which hypothecated excise for road funding, was terminated in 1959. The rebate scheme introduced in 1982 was more restrictive than the previous exemption scheme. Subsequent amendments mean that it is now highly focused on activities which contribute directly to the competitiveness of the mining and primary production sectors. It is no longer appropriate to consider the scheme in its historic context. Excise and customs duties raised on diesel fuel are general taxation measures. The diesel fuel rebate scheme provides rebate of duty on diesel fuel for certain activities, mainly in the mining and agricultural industries. Its primary purpose is to maintain competitiveness in these key export industries, in a manner consistent with the government's broader fiscal objectives. The scheme also has a very limited number of community and social welfare objectives. The principal changes to the scheme proposed by the bill involve: 1. amendments to address the effects of recent AAT and Federal Court decisions which have had the effect of widening eligibility; 2. removal from eligibility of certain activities under the mining operations category; 3. a range of measures to improve accountability requirements, clamp down on misuse and improve administration of the scheme; 4. the repeal of the current provision relating to notices of intention; and 5. an amendment to enable rebate to be refused or recovered where diesel fuel is not used in eligible activities due to loss in any way. It is proposed that the changes in items 1, 2 and 5 take effect from a date to be proclaimed which will be shortly after royal assent to the bill. The changes to items 3 and 4 require publicity, client education and technology changes and will therefore be proclaimed to take effect six months later. 1. Effects of recent AA T and Federal Court decisions There have been several decisions in recent times which have had the effect of expanding eligibility under the scheme beyond what the government believes was intended, with consequent effects on outlays. In some areas, the potential financial impact of decisions is very significant. The particular amendments will ensure the continuation of rebate for diesel fuel used in carrying out mining activities but will preclude from eligibility certain activities, best described as undertaken for economic-marketing reasons, rather than the physical extraction of minerals, and activities which essentially involve the transport of inputs-materials for mining or beneficiation. The government's clear intention is that rebate paid under the legislation should be confined to the narrow definition of eligible activities in the legislation-that is, the tion is not that the legislation be defined broadly and beneficially. The amendments proposed in this bill are designed to tighten and narrow eligibility. It is the government's intention to continue to adopt such an approach in the face of any future broadening. The most significant decision which has potential for expansion in eligibility related an appeal by Dampier Salt (Operations) Pty Ltd against a decision of the AAT in relation to the point at which payment of rebate on the recovery of salt ceases. The Full Federal Court's judgment is considered to be the most far reaching ever delivered in relation to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It represents a fundamental shift from a scheme based on the concept of an activity, in this case mining, being regarded as a physical act, that is the extraction of a product from the ground, to a concept of the activity being an economic one. The Federal Court found that even though Dampier Salt's product could be sold in the condition it was in at the first stockpile, it was uneconomic for the company to do so. It was only economic to sell into the market it actually supplied. The court determined the second stockpile activities were so closely related to the process of extraction of salt from the brine in which it was embedded, that they fell within the concept of mining operations. The government has never intended to pay rebate to these types of operations. The amendments to the definitions, particularly beneficiation, make it clear that the physical act of mining or beneficiation is eligible for rebate. It ensures that payment of rebate does not extend to activities involved in getting the product to the marketplace, such as the broad economic factors which were the basis of the full Federal Court judgment. Several other recent decisions addressed what might essentially be categorised as transport activities. The only transport activities intended to be covered are the transport of minerals and ores for beneficiation at facilities remote from the place at which mining activity is carried out, and certain intenactivities specifically provided for. Amendments were made to the act in 1995 and 1996 to ensure that activities 'connected with' mining were no longer eligible for rebate. The interpretation of the so-called 'sweeper clauses' had been a source of contention over the years and gener ated most of the litigation under the scheme. These clauses were replaced with an objective list of activito ties that are eligible for rebate. In the decision of Dyno-Westfarmers the AAT found that driving explosive trucks over an average distance of 150 kilometres each way between the explosives depot and the mine sites was either 'mining for minerals' or 'the preparation of a site to enable mining for minerals to commence', as those long journeys were 'an integral part of this activity'. The government considers that it is wrong to apply the concept that an activity is eligible for rebate because it is integral to another eligible activity. It is the intent of the diesel fuel rebate scheme to pay rebate only on those activities that are explicitly mentioned in the legislation and not to activities that are said to be integral to, associated with or connected with these activities. The amendments are necessary to put the intent of the scheme beyond doubt. The approach adopted by the AAT in the DynoWestfarmers case would defeat the purpose of the amendments made in 1995 which removed the 'connected with' sweeper clauses. Similarly the AAT and Federal Court have considered the question of transport of materials-inputs to mining operations and beneficiation in recent times. Rebate is intended to be paid for beneficiation of minerals and ores, including transport where such beneficiation occurs at a place removed from the actual place of mining operations. Rebate is not intended to be paid for the transport of goodsmaterials-inputs for mining operations or beneficiation. The outcome of consideration of these issues has varied and this creates uncertainty as to the overall intent. In the Westrail matter, the Federal Court found that transporting coal to a place of beneficiation by rail was part of beneficiation itself, because the transport was 'integral' to having the bauxite beneficiated. This logic was comprehensively reviewed and rejected by the AAT in the Queensland Rail matter. The two decisions cannot stand together. This bill therefore amends the diesel fuel rebate scheme to ensure that only the transport of the minerals and ores to be actually beneficiated receives rebate. In another recent decision in the matter of Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Company Pty Ltd, the AA T found that processes resulting in the production of ferromanganese and si licomanganese by smelting operations constituted the beneficiation of a mineral and were therefore eligible for rebate. The amendment to the definition of 'minerals' will restore the original intent of the scheme that a mining operation must be in relation to a natural mineral. The amendment will also sharpen the focus on the beneficiation activities that are intended to be rebatable. 2. Removal of certain activities from eligibility in the mining category. The government announced in the budget that the diesel fuel rebate scheme would be revamped to curb overclaiming and contain growth. To achieve its objectives in containing growth in the mining category, it entered into consultation with representatives of the mining sector. The mining sector recognising the government's fiscal requirements accepted the need to tighten eligibility by identifying areas to be excluded from eligibility to ensure that the benefits are contained to mining activities. The changes put forward by the mining sector have been accepted by the government. The government accepts that these changes contribute to achieving the savings identified at the time of the budget. The government accepts that growth in rebate payments for eligible activities under the revised arrangements will occur. Once growth levels are established and forward estimates of expenditure are set it may be necessary as part of the budget planning process to put in place measures to ensure the overall budgetary strategy is achieved. Consideration is being given to appropriate means of ensuring that the expenditure levels once set will not be exceeded. Government and industry will work together to assess net growth which will be used in setting budget outlays and forward estimates. This will involve annual discussions which will also involve a review of the effectiveness and efficiency of the scheme in meeting its objectives and intent. 3. Measures to improve accountability and administration A range of amendments are proposed which will improve accountability requirements, assist in enabling a clamp down on misuse of the scheme and improve its administration. These changes apply to all claimants under the scheme. The Australian National Audit Office performance report highlighted a number of areas where improvements would significantly reduce administrative costs and lead to more effecti ve management of the scheme. These include: . adopting risk management principles and practices; adopting best practices observed in other programs; and making more effective use of information technology. Statistical analysis and monitoring of overall trends indicate that overpayments, that is payment of rebate to which claimants are not entitled, are made under the scheme. Additionally the analysis shows that there is a significant level of overclaiming, that is claims above the level of entitlement, which are made but detected prior to payment and do not result in outlays. To a significant extent, these arise from the prospective nature of the scheme and a lack of legislative support for the self-assessment nature of the scheme, including ineffective penalty provisions. Arrangements to modernise the administration of the scheme have been under way for some time. These focus on legislative reform to underpin self-assessment, to place the onus on claimants to make and retain documentation which will substantiate their applications for rebate with effective risk assessment measures in place to assess compliance. This will be backed by effective penalty arrangements which rely on strict liability requirements for claimants to maintain records to substantiate claims. To ensure that risk assessment measures are well grounded and effective claimants will be required to provide from time to time information on the nature of their operations relevant to their use of diesel fuel. While the government recognises these requirements impose obligations on claimants to provide more extensive information than that presently required, this is not considered too great a burden for a scheme which outlays around $1.4 billion of taxpayers' funds. It will serve to ensure that those entitled to rebate receive their full benefits and the scheme is not diluted by misuse. Importantly for a self-assessment scheme will be the ability of claimants to obtain advice from Customs on the eligibility of their activities and insure themselves against being penalised, on the basis that information contained in the request accurately describes the claimant's circumstances. The amendments in particular formalise a post transaction audit regime, make provision for voluntary repayment of overclaimed rebate without penalty and for adjustment to be made to claims. These amendments do not remove the ability for criminal prosecution where fraud or serious instances of overclaiming, which seek to misuse the benefits of the scheme, are involved. Recent successful prosecutions have resulted in significant custodial sentences. 4. Repeal of notices of intention Under amendments made in 1993, a provision was inserted to restrict payment of rebate to fuel purchased within three years before the application was received. To ensure that claimants were not disadvantaged, this provision allowed for claimants to give notice prior to 1 July 1994 of an intention to make an application in relation to purchases back to 1986. The effect of that notice was to preserve a claimant's entitlement and not have it constrained by the three-year provision. In excess of 2,000 notices were lodged under this provision and, to date, the bulk of these have not been translated into claims under the scheme. These notices of intention represent a potentially significant outstanding contingent liability on the Commonwealth. The bill therefore proposes to sunset this provision. Those who lodged notices of intention have had over two years to lodge claims, and it is intended by the bill to only allow another six months for this to occur. All those who lodged notices will be contacted, in writing, advised of the impending change and given the opportunity to lodge a claim before the expiration of the provision. 5. Refusal or recovery where diesel fuel not used in eligible activities There is uncertainty as to whether rebate can be refused, or, if paid, recovered diesel fuel is purchased for an eligible purproducts pose but is lost and consequently not used eligible activities. The bill provides that rebate is not payable or can be recovered where diesel fuel is lost, whether because of accian dent, theft or any other reason, and is not used in eligible activities. I commend the and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Tanner) adjourned. NA Members' Interests Committee",100

270,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am pleased to mended: present the report of the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microimprove economic Reform entitled Jet fresh: paddock to plate. This reference was first referred to this committee in the previous parliament and re-referred by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to the committee in the 38th Parliament. The committee received over 100 submissions and 38 exhibits. It conducted five public hearings Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. . Evidence was received from 59 witnesses business, representing 31 organisations. The report contains 16 recommendations. In this report, Jet fresh: paddock to plate, where the key messages are the need to export valued by the foreign market, target in markets, target high value products and get the quality right to meet the needs of overseas customers. For Australia to succeed further as exporter of perishable and time sensitive products, a cultural change is needed throughbill out the export chain and the incentive for change must be commercially based. With regard to cargo terminal operations, during the inquiry the committee inspected the cargo terminals at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. Evidence suggested that competition should be encouraged in the cargo terminal operations sector to provide to airlines and forwarders, to encourtable age improvements in service and because competition has the potential to lower prices. The committee has recommended that the government and Federal Airports Corporation facilitate effective competition in the CTO sector and that the FAC should allow offairport CTOs as long as Customs and AQIS standards are met. Report The committee received evidence on the  National Merchandise Manager Produce with Woolworths, said that Australian exporters needed to visit foreign markets, target suitable sectors in the foreign market and produce appropriate products. Other highlighted the need to supply the direct amount of product, design appropriate packaging and be able to negotiate successfully with foreign buyers. The committee recom. "" the Federal Government initiate action to the export business and marketing skills of producers who produce, or are capable of producing, high value perishable and time sensitive products in accordance with export market requirements. Particular attention should be given to: improving skills related to market research, promotion and negotiation; and facilitating strategic alliances and partnerships. in The committee also recommended: .. the Federal Government, in consultation with initiate action to facilitate industry support for research and development projects to develop appropriate packaging of exports of perishable products, including packaging which: maintains product quality throughout the handling process; is supermarket-ready; and extends the shelf life of the product. The success of the Western Australian Air Freight Export Council in improving export performance shows the value of an industrydriven and export-focused group. The committee has recommended that the government assess the feasibility of establishing groups based on the APEC model and that the government provide seed funding, if such groups are feasible, conditional on dollar for dollar contributions from state governments and/or industry, and subject to review. On the issue of freight capacity, the committee found Australian air freight rates for exports are some of the lowest in the world. They are sustained by passenger services and inbound freight rates. This has allowed low value products to continue to be exported. The amount of capacity available to exporters will be determined by the demand for passenger services and inbound freight. Exporters wishing to use dedicated freight services may have to pay a premium. There are some problems on a few routes-such as Japan, Hong Kong and Thailand-where air freight capacity is tight and, in particular, when peak harvest and holiday periods coincide in November and December. Impediments to the export of perishable and time sensitive products do not lie primarily with the transport sector. Forwarders can obtain capacity from the airlines for exporters who are able to coordinate regular loads over extended periods or who can anticipate capacity needs well in advance. Vanessa Fanning, Group Manager Public Policy, TNT, told the committee: If the demand is there and we have a quality product to satisfy it, then the transport solutions will be found. Quality assurance handling agreements are a significant milestone in creating a successful export culture because the correct handling of products is important to export success. The Australian Seafood Industry Council is developing assurance handling agreements. These agreements specify the requirements for appropriate handling as products move through the export chain. The committee has recommended that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy widely disseminate information concerning quality assurance handling agreements and that the government facilitate the further development of such agreements. The provision of additional infrastructure at airports, such as air-side cold stores, needs to be determined on a commercial basis. Exporters need to be willing to pay for this high level of service. The committee received proposals to create international air freight hubs, for example at Avalon, Balranald, Dubbo, Griffith, Narrandera-Leeton, Parkes and Wentworth. Decisions on substantial infrastructure projects such as building or upgrading airports need to be made on sound commercial bases. On the limited evidence provided to the committee, proposals for inland international air freight hubs are unlikely to be commercially viable. The committee recommended: .. , the Federal Government should make no decision to fund the construction of inland international air freight hubs without extensive further assessment into such proposals. The committee's recommendations contain important initiatives to improve the export of perishable and time sensitive products. The committee's final recommendation asks that the government, through the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, report to the parliament on the progress of these initiatives by 31 October 1997. In closing, the conduct of the inquiry would not have been possible without the help of the air freight exporting community and my colleagues on the committee in the 38th Parliament. Of course, I acknowledge the members of the committee in the 37th Parliament. I thank them for their contribution. I note in particular the work done by the Hon. Peter Morris, the chairman of the previous committee. In addition, I thank the secretariat: Dr John Carter, the inquiry officer; Ms Meg Crooks, the committee secretary; Ms Fiona Cornwell; Mrs Suzanne Stanfield; and Mrs Annette Fischer. I commend the report to the House.  p.m.)-by leave-I strongly endorse the remarks of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). It has been a harmonious committee, and the report of the committee has come forward as a unanimous one. Like the member for Lyne, I would like to thank the members of the committee and the staff who have participated in the preparation of the report and the conduct of inquiry in this parliament. Similarly, I thank my colleagues on the former committee in the 37th Parliament. There needs to be a change in culture from those who are aspiring to the export market and the use of international air freight services. Air freight is the most expensive form of freight in the world. It is not something that can be developed on the basis that you can get a back-haul rate from imports, enjoy a cross-subsidy from imports across to exports, and then expect the capacity that is available to you to develop and expand based on the back-haul rate. When additional capacity has to be utilised, has to be brought it has to earn its keep. It has to bear the full cost of the placement on that route and in both directions. That is the message that really has not been understood by many people aspiring to the export market and to the use of air freight services. Paragraph 2.11 of the report makes the point that if producers of perishable products want to export successfully then they need to produce high value goods, and they need to produce goods that are delivered on time and that are of consistent quality. That message has to be developed. The market in which we are competing is a market in which there are many players, and many established players. We have Israel developing crops in Australia for export out of Australia. We have New Zealand, to our east, which has done much better than Australia. One of the unexpected points that came out of the inquiry was that New Zealand is utilising Australian air freight capacity. New Zealand has developed a high quality product, a stronger market, better product identification, reliable delivery and consistent quality. For those who are interested, if they look to paragraph 3.55, table 2.1, of the report they will see that New Zealand can get a better rate out of Australia than they can from New Zealand. For instance, the rate to Hong Kong is $A2.78 per kilo ex-New Zealand. But exNew Zealand via Sydney to Hong Kong is only $A2.06. Similarly, the rate to Tokyo is 16c per kilo cheaper exporting from New Zealand via Australia than it is exporting directly from New Zealand into Tokyo. It is the same with Singapore. New Zealanders are always hungrier, go harder and develop these more prestige quality markets and are utilising our freight capacity and getting a better and cheaper rate for it. That was a surprise to the chairman, to me and to all of us associated with the inquiry. As we work through that, we need to get the message across to those in the potential producer side of the industry that they need to go out and develop their market, develop a quality product and develop product identification. Similarly, in respect of market intelliin, gence-that is covered adequately in the report-producers need to identify the section of the market they want to be in and they need to produce a product that the market wants. This was a point made by Peter Pokorny, National Merchandise Manager Produce with Woolworths. Producers need to go out and talk to their potential customers, identify the product they want, the quality they want, when they want it, what volumes they want and then go for it rather than saying, as we have in the past when there has been a bit of surplus production in Australia, 'We'll see what we can do in respect of export.' New Zealand is the model. There are people in the industry who are very skilled at exploiting and developing that export market utilising air freight services. We need to follow through on what they are doing. Coming back to the costs that the chairman referred to, because there is a substantial and effective cross-subsidy from imports to exports utilising air freight, we need to recognise that the scale of capacity available and the frequency of capacity available is a function of existing passenger services and a few dedicated freight services. Where the passenger services are is where the capacity is. The capacity can be drawn to where it is needed if the exporters develop that premium product with proper identification, a product that is able to bear the additional rate that is needed to justify the provision of air freight service in and out. The thing that kept coming up all the time was that it was a case of exaggerated expectations, that it was always the transport costs that were the barrier rather than the exporter having sought out a market or selling a product that was able to bear the cost of the freight involved. The conclusion in 4.130 of the committee's report adequately deals with it, saying: ... that the impediments to the export of perishable and time sensitive products do not lie ly with the transport sector. While ... some participants in the freight chain may be seeking to blame other participants for poor service, the committee considers it is more important to address the underlying reasons and to move forwardI believe there is considerable potential there to be exploited but the exporters have to go out, pick and identify their market, and go for that premium price and get it. As Vanessa Fanning from TNT said, 'If you have got the product and you are able to pay for the service, the service will be made available.' I commend the report to the House.",105
271,Mr TANNER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I, too, commend Meg Crooks, John Carter and other members of the secretariat for their work on the production of this report by the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform. I also commend the chairman of the committee, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) for his work in producing what is, as has been noted, a unanimous report to the House. I echo the words of the honourable member for Short that emerges from this report is that, although there are some problems in the transport chain with respect to air freight of perishable produce from Australia, by and large the problems that Australian producers do have in this area do not relate to the transport sector. One of the things the report does is expose, as the honourable member indicated, exaggerated expectations in that regard. There is no one big problem in this area; there are significant small problems or medium-sized problems in various parts of the chain but there is no one big bang sort of problem that can be addressed. There are structural issues that are hard to get around, for example the fact that Australia is not in a hub position as a transport operator but is largely at the end of the line. There are some significant and important suggestions and recommendations in the report such as the proposals for more competition in the container terminal operator area and more assistance to exporters to develop greater skills in marketing and promotion for their productsparticularly a greater export focus, which I think is clearly the major difference between primariNew Zealand and Australia and is the area where we have to improve. Another important recommendation is to establish industry freight export groups, giving the capacity for a market driven and industry driven strategy which should improve our performance in this area. I would like to comment finally on the question of the feasibility of an inland freight airport, be it at Parkes, Narrandera, Wentworth or anyone of a number of locations that have been suggested. As the chairman of the committee indicated, the recommendation from the committee is that the government should not make a decision to establish and fund such an airport without extensive further investigation of that proposition. The committee was of the view that such an airport would be unlikely to be viable. The great problem is that we cannot put the cart before the horse. The demand for freight services, in my view, is not at this stage sufficient for the establishment of such an airport and the expenditure of large sums of taxpayers' money to establish such an airport. The critical mass is not there at the moment. It could well be in the future; one would hope that that will be the case but certainly at the moment it would be unlikely to be economically viable. It is important to emphasise, however, that we had only relatively limited evidence before us. We were not the feasibility study into these proposals and should not be considered as such. The finding of the committee on this issue should only really be considered as an indicative or interim finding. It is up to the government to give further consideration to this proposition. As I indicated, my view-as was the unanimous view of the committee members-is that at this point it is unlikely to be viable. But it is something that Australia and the government should continue to keep in mind for the future as something that may become viable at some point. It is something that certainly requires further examination. I thank again the members of the secretariat and the chairman for their great contributions. I commend the report to the House.",108

Ordered that the report be printed.",109
274,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I take pleasure in tabling the review of Auditor General's Audit Report No.6 1995-96 on the community development employment projects scheme, the CDEP scheme. This is the first report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs for the 38th Parliament. Audit Report No.6 is phase one of a twopart performance audit of the CDEP scheme by the Auditor-General. Phase one addresses the administration of the scheme by the Cairns regional office and the Queensland state office. It also considered the role of the central office in Canberra. Phase two, which is due to be tabled in February 1997, will provide an overview of the administration of the CDEP scheme throughout the country. I will take the opportunity of commenting on two issues-the CDEP scheme itself and performance audits by the audit office. The community development employment projects scheme is of enormous benefit to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout this country. It provides a form of employment where there are few or no alternative employment opportunities, and it delivers services to the communities themselves. Total participant numbers as at 30 June 1995 were 27,041, of whom 19,256 were in remote localities and 7,785 in rural and urban communities. The scheme has undergone significant change since its inception 20 years ago, particularly in regard to the enormous growth which it has experienced in the last 10 years. This growth places many pressures on the administration of the scheme. Report The Australian National Audit Office has an important role to play in the examination of government activity. When parliamentary committees review audit reports, they add pres- value to the work of the audit office by following up the response to the audit reports. Committees can also playa valuable role in scrutinising the activities of the audit office to ensure that the audit process has been undertaken to the satisfaction of alI parties concerned. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has a general duty to review audit reports, but there is great merit in the subject specific committees taking up this work where appropriate. I commend the practice to other committees. In relation to the CDEP scheme, the Auditor-General has made an important contribution by helping the scheme meet the changing demands of government reporting requirements and the needs of the scheme's participants. The committee welcomes this first report of the two-phase audit process. The ANAO made 16 recommendations which address the performance of ATSIC relation to the CDEP scheme at the central, state and regional office levels. The commitAboriginal tee believes that these are important audits which make a real difference to the adminconsider istration of the scheme and, more importantly, to the almost 30,000 indigenous participants. The objective of the committee was to examine and review the findings of Audit Report No.6 and to follow up the implementation of the recommendations made that report, rather than to review the CDEP scheme in its entirety. It must be acknowaudit ledged at the outset that A TSIC has done considerable work to implement the recomthe mendations made by the Australian National Audit Office. However, successive reviews of the CDEP scheme have identified common problems. The ANAO commented that many of these problems still exist and made several recomrecommendations mendations in response to these concerns. that report. Information collection and analysis are an important part of the evaluation of any proMiddlebrook, gram. However, while the collection of data does not appear to be a problem, the analysis of this information and the feedback to indigenous communities need further work by the ATSIC administration. In relation to training, ATSIC has also put in place measures which the ANAO said represented good practice. The committee commented that A TSIC needs to ensure that it builds on the work that has been done. The commission should undertake an evaluation of the effectiveness of training initiatives and programs to ensure they are reaching the target audience. The committee also believes that ATSIC' s central office should take more proactive approach to the distribution of information to state and regional offices. The CDEP scheme has been operating for almost 20 years. In this time it that there have been many successful projects which have been of enormous benefit to indigenous communities, whether they are an economic, social or cultural nature. would be useful if there had been some analysis of the benefits of the scheme to indigenous communities. In addressing this issue, the committee has in recommended that ATSIC undertake an analysis of the benefits of the scheme to and Torres Strait Islander communities who participate. The analysis should the linkages between the objectives set by communities, the strategies to implement these objectives and the outcomes. The committee believes that this will be beneficial to the further development of the scheme. I would like to state that the committee's in report must, to some extent, be tentative because it is anticipated that phase two of the may encompass some of the matters raised in Audit Report No.6. For this reason committee has deferred final conclusions on some issues raised in the phase one report. When the phase two report is completed, the committee will have the opportunity to review the audit in its entirety. I look forward to examining further the implementation of the made by the audit office in Lastly, I would like to thank Judy Craig Dukes, Claressa Surtees, Penne Humphries, and members of the committee for their hard work in supporting this inquiry. I commend the report to the House.",109
275,Mr MEL HAM,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I rise to support the statement made by the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. In particular, I support his comments on the importance of the community development employment projects scheme. This scheme has many benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, not only a in remote areas but also in rural and urban centres. It is a scheme that affects the lives of over 27,000 indigenous people every day. It is a major source of income for many inis apparent digenous communities. The CDEP scheme represents approximately 31 per cent of ATSIC' s budget. For 1995-96, of 63 per cent of the funds for CDEP could be It offset against some form of Department of Social Security expenditure. This is a significant proportion of the total CDEP budget which normally would be administered by the DSS through various payments. The end result is many benefits for indigenous people. Some of these include assistance in the transition to more permanent work and access to more flexible training programs. It has also been shown to improve community self-esteem and self-confidence, and to assist in empowering indigenous people by providing a sense of community ownership and control. I would like to congratulate ATSIC on the work it has done, at all levels of the administration, to implement the recommendations made by the Australian National Audit Office. This has led to significant improvements in the delivery of this program to indigenous people and communities. It is a worthwhile program which can only be improved by the audit process and the implementation of the recommendations made. The recommendations made by the ANAO reflect the significant changes that the CDEP scheme has undergone in recent years. It is up to ATSIC to ensure that it builds on the good work that has been done, ultimately leading to improvements for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. All efforts should be made to retain the integrity of this important scheme. The Auditor-General has an important role in ensuring that this occurs. The Australian National Audit Office is in a position to identify problems and recommend how they can be solved. It is also able to identify of good practice in the administration of the scheme and bring these to the attention of the ATSIC administration with a view to their wider application across the country. I believe that it is reasonable to expect a high level of accountability for the expenditure of public funds to apply to the ATSIC administration. However, it must be remembered that the majority of the funding involved in the CDEP scheme is spent at the community level and is paid to participants in lieu of unemployment benefits. It would be unreasonable and discriminatory to expect community participants to demonstrate the same level of administrative expertise in providing details relating to the expenditure of CDEP funds as one would expect of public servants. The system of accountability should not place unfair burdens on the participants in the scheme. I look forward to the committee's examination of the phase two audit report and to assessing the progress that has been made in the implementation of the ANAO's recommendations more widely throughout the country. In closing, I would like to thank the committee secretariat for their hard work, particularly under the changed and at many times difficult circumstances of the new committee office.",110
276,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,by leave-I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Motion (by Mrs Bishop) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Blacktown SES,111
277,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"In this adjournment debate, I want to pay tribute to a voluntary organisation that performs an excellent service in the electorate of Greenway-that is, the Blacktown State Emergency Service. The State Emergency Service is a state-wide emergency and rescue service dedicated to assisting the community. It is almost entirely supported by volunteers areas with over 200 units located throughout New South Wales and comprising more than 10,000 volunteer members who are easily identified by their distinctive orange overalls. Australian communities live with a variety of hazards, both natural and man-made. The hazards include those arising from technology, human fault and hostile action. Some major natural disasters, such as cyclones and bushfires, are seasonal and regional, but other types of hazards, particularly those made by man, are less predictable and could occur anywhere. As far as natural hazards are concerned, I refer members to the giant hailstone storms that were experienced in the Hunter Valley yesterday. This would be the type of natural disaster that the local State Emergency Service would respond to. While Australia cannot be regarded as disaster prone in world terms, the cost of disasters which have affected this country in loss of life and injury, property destruction and social and economic loss has been considerable. This loss would have been significantly greater if it had not been for the work carried out by the State Emergency Service throughout New South Wales. The State Emergency Service has two primary functions under the State Emergency Act 1987: firstly, to act as a combat agency for dealing with floods, including the establishment of flood warnings, and to coordinate the evacuation of affected communities; and, secondly, to act as a combat agency for damage control for storms and tempest and to coordinate the evacuation and welfare of affected communities. The Sydney western division comprises of 14 local headquarters ranging from Ashfield through to the Blue Mountains. Last month I had the honour of attending the annual end of year presentation day of the Blacktown State Emergency Service. As part of the proceedings on that day, the controller of the Blacktown service, Mr Gary Fry, gave a detailed report of the services over the preceding 12 months. Gary detailed numerous calls for assistance from distressed residents because of damage caused by gale force winds, lightning, flash flooding and motor vehicle accidents. Assistance was also given by the SES in relation to a number of chemical spills and also to various community organisations such as the Smith Family, school displays, fun runs and RSL marches. The most hectic period this service experienced commenced in the early hours of Saturday moming, 31 August when a vicious gale struck the Sydney metropolitan area causing damage totalling over $50 million. Over the next seven days, from 31 August to 6 September, the service responded to over 212 requests for assistance across almost every suburb in the area affected. Man-hours for this operation were considerable. To cap all this activity, the most important role carried out by the service was its involvement on three separate occasions in searches for lost children. I am pleased to advise that on each occasion the children were found safe and sound. You can gather from these brief remarks the valuable service provided by the Blacktown State Emergency Service. To achieve these results, the SES-like the great Defence Force-has to devote an enormous amount of time to training and planning for any possible major disaster. There may be tendencies by some people to regard the SES volunteers as unskilled and amateurish, but this is far from the truth. SES members today are required to achieve a high level of skills to achieve their objectives and, as such, are highly trained, multiskilled, unpaid professionals. On this particular presentation day, Mr Barry Wademan, the unit rescue officer, received a national medal for 17 years of dedicated service to the SES. Other certificates were received by volunteers completing training from first aid, radio communication and map reading courses. The Blacktown unit is also responsible for a wide range of engineering and heavy duty four-wheel drive vehicles, flood boats and a communication van, and all require a high level of skill to maintain and operate. The Blacktown SES has a long history of service to the wider community and has assisted in such major disasters as the Granville train disaster in 1977. (Time expired) NA",111
278,Mrs SULLIVAN,UNICEF,"Moncrief£) (5.35 p.m.)In 1990 the World Summit for Children adopted the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children and a plan of action for implementation in the 1990s. For the first time, the global community agreed, at the highest critical level, upon international goals to reduce rates of mortality and disease, malnutrition and illiteracy and to reach specific targets by the year 2000. As a result of the plan of action, UNICEF has a number of important achievements to its credit. A million fewer children under the age of fi ve will die this year than in 1990, in spite of unprecedented population growth. Every year about 80 per cent of the world's children are immunised against the major childhood diseases before their first birthday. Polio is well on its way to eradication. Guinea worm, which afflicted millions in Africa and South Asia until five years ago, is now on the verge of elimination. In just five years, an additional 1Y2 billion people are now using iodised salt, striking a major blow against iodine deficiency disorders and preventing mental retardation in some 12 million infants every year. More people have access to safe drinking water. Some 50 million more children are now enrolled in primary school than in 1990. Oral rehydration treatment, which prevents or treats the dehydration caused by diarrhoeal disease-the major killer of children under the age of two-has now reached 60 per cent coverage. Today the Parliamentary Association of UNICEF was pleased to host the launch by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) of the 1997 'State of the world's children' report here at Parliament House. This report, which is published annually by UNICEF, is one of the world's most respected summaries on the progress made against major specific threats to the health, education and protection of children in the developing world. Children do a variety of work in widely divergent conditions. At one end is child labour, which is exploitative, life threatening and harmful to the child's development. Extreme forms of child labour include the slavery suffered by children in bonded labour and prostitution. At the other end many children are involved in work that may be beneficial, enhancing learning skills, selfesteem and a sense of responsibility, and which does not interfere with schooling, leisure or rest. The impact of child labour on the child's development is the key to determining when work is a problem for children. Drawing largely on ILO data, the UNICEF report estimates some 250 million children aged five to 14 are involved in child labour in the developing world. This estimate is a sharp revision by ILO from its earlier estimate of 73 million child workers between 10 and 14 years. The majority of child labourers153 million-live in Asia. It is estimated that 80 million children work in Africa and 17Y2 million in Latin America. Many child workers are hidden from view, particularly girls doing domestic work. Their numbers push the total even higher. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said today, this issue must be attacked from all sides. There must be increased awareness of the problem both nationally and internationally, enforcement of existing legislation, the adoption of international law, cooperation between national governments and their police forces, extension of voluntary labour programs, the existence of strong local women's groups and NGOs and, above all, increasing access to basic education. As an Australian legislator, I am proud that Australian governments, both present and previous, have taken an active approach in this region towards assisting countries of the region in working towards the elimination of child labour. As the 'State of the world's children' report says, it is time morality prevailed. As we step into the next millennium, hazardous child labour must be left behind, consigned to history as completely as those other forms of slavery that it so closely resembles.

279,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,CURRENT ACTIVITIES UNDER THE AID PROGRAM,"As Christmas approaches, I suggest to Australian familie- they have no cause to be relaxed and secure about the question of employment. If you have any doubts about that, you ought to really examine the job figures of today. That is not just my view. It is also the view of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, who, when questioned today, refused on a number of occasions to nominate a time frame for a possible fall in unemployment. If Australians at large ought not to be relaxed and secure about their job prospects, it is women who ought to be most concerned. The participation rate for women has dropped more this month than the rate among men. This seems to reflect a very deliberate endeavour by the government to put in place policy parameters aimed at forcing women out of the work force. I dare suggest that they are deliberate strategies, such as changes to childcare costs. It is really about social engineering and political correctness in the mind of the government. The ABS labour force figures suggest that employment growth today is stagnant. Until the ABS data shows a more positive trend in jobs and that we lock it in, Australians cannot be relaxed and secure about their job prospects. As the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs said today, she is a friend of the trend. She ought to be concerned-and I agree with her refusal to set a time frame for a possible fall in unemployment-because the trend rate of unemployment is locked in at 8.7 per cent, the worse trend rate for almost two years. That is nothing that the government should gloat about. I know why the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has his head down at the moment. He knows that the economic strategy of this government has created economic chaos out there and a lack of confidence in the performance of this government. Over recent months we have had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) saying, 'When we fix industrial relations and we get our budget strategy through, all will be right on the jobs front.' Time and time again, the Prime Minister has said that to the House of Representatives. For example, on 12 September he said: The reality is that unemployment in this country will not be turned around until the policies of the new government are allowed to operate. Those policies include the passage of the budget and the passage of the industrial relations legislation. The problem for the Prime Minister is that he now has his industrial relations and economic agenda in place and all of a sudden, over the last couple of days, we have started to see the new excuse. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) ran out the new excuse earlier this week. He started to suggest that the participation rate is the cause of high unemployment in Australia. When you talk about the participation rate, it is really code for the fact that women now feel as though they have a right to participate on an equal basis in the Australian workplace. One of the real achievements of the last decade has been that women have really felt confident enough, because there was a government in place that supported their aspirations and desires, to actually go out into the workplace. If this government has a problem with the participation rate, all I can say is that we were prepared to cope with that problem. For the information of the House, if the participation rate were the same now as it was when John Howard was last the Treasurer, Australia's unemployment rate would be 3.3 per cent. So code for participation rate is opportunity being withdrawn from women. It is making it hard to get access to child care and is saying to women that, because of the increase in the cost of access to nursing homes, your job is now back to being a carer. It is a 1950s concept. It is a concept embraced and supported by the Prime Minister. It is not about choice. It is about conscription back into the home. It is about the withdrawal of opportunities for women. When the Treasurer raises the participation rate it is code for saying to women, 'You are no longer welcome in the Australian workplace. Your job is as a carer in the home. We do not regard you as equal participants in the Australian workplace. We are going to attack your industrial rights.' (Time expired) Garrawarra Centre for Aged Care",116
280,Mrs VALE,CURRENT ACTIVITIES UNDER THE AID PROGRAM,"I wish to bring to the attention of this House a matter which depicts the conflict between ordinary Australians and the bureaucratic structures which increasingly govern our The matter raises questions of paternalism in regard to the treatment of aged and vulnerable people. The Garrawarra Centre for Aged Care, which lies just south of Waterfall within my electorate of Hughes, was initially built in 1907 as a sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis. The architecture and approaches to care depicted those of the 19th century and reflected a need to separate people with this affliction from main society. Although the purposes for its use changed from tuberculosis to aged care in the 1960s, no significant capital works occurred over the years and neither have they occurred since. Within this system, a culture of paternalism, lack of privacy and overcrowding persisted until the last decade. In fact, the culture was more akin to that of a 19th century poorhouse than that of a modem aged care facility. Why did different governments and state health bureaucracies allow this to persist? Perhaps it was because its residents were basically asset poor and suffered from conditions-such as frailty, dementia and chronic physical impairments mixed with increasing age-which made advocacy virtually impossible. Through these times the staff gave care of the highest order, but in conditions which prevented anything but the basic needs being satisfied. During the enlightened term of the previous Fahey and Greiner state governments, it appeared that a new era was dawning in this institution. Capital development plans were drawn up, a new village complex was proposed and advanced to the procurement phase and a commitment to the care of people with a dementing illness was strongly indicated. With a change in the area health board and state government in New South Wales, all of these proposals were aborted and a downsizing process commenced. This process occurred under the guise of the Commonwealthstate agreement in regard to state government nursing homes. It appears that the process was initiated with some secrecy and to those involved at the grassroots level the process has not been transparent. Let me document the facts. From an initial lives. 280 bed nursing home complex associated with a 28 bed hostel, the centre has now been reduced to 250 beds. Under the new proposals, it will be reduced to 120 beds. The hostel will be phased out. One hundred of these beds are to be allocated to the Illawarra area which leaves the Sutherland shire, with its 200,000-plus population and a rapidly expanding aged sector, left in a deficit position with regard to the stringent Commonwealth nursing home ratio of 40 beds per 1,000 residents 70 years and over. The situation will be even more devastating as the centre has developed programs for those persons who have severe challenging behaviours associated with dementia. The residents from this category have been accepted from both the Sutherland and the Illawarra areas because of the extenuating circumstances which preclude them from being placed in traditional nursing homes. There are 80 such persons in the Garrawarra Centre which gives some indication of the magnitude of the problem being discussed. The centre has also initiated nursing development units dealing especially with the palliation of long term dementia sufferers once they are less mobile. The changes being pursued in regard to this Commonwealth-state agreement have occurred in the absence of any resident, carer or consumer consultation. This is almost inconceivable in 1996. In fact, if this had occurred in the non-government or profit sector, the Commonwealth or state bureaucracies would have unleashed their wrath and power to prevent such actions being taken. Compounding the situation is the fact that there is no guarantee that the money saved will be redirected into aged care or that promised capital rebuilding for dementia care will actually be pursued. Given the track record of these matters, it might be predicted that the alternative will happen. Although the analogy is odious, the process being observed here is very similar to that which was experienced by the Scots in the clearances of the last century. This act allowed disempowered people being moved and relocated for economic ends without consultation or guarantees. These people who are affected are among the most disadvantaged and powerless in our society. These are our elders. They deserve better and in this proposal they appear to been betrayed by bureaucratic double speak. My concern is not that the conditions of accommodation and care at the Garrawarra Centre should be improved. It is that under these governmental agreements the specialised care given at Garrawarra will disappear altogether, that money saved will disappear into the abyss of state Treasury and the citizens of my electorate will be seriously disadvantaged by these processes. Party Standards  Mr Howard became Prime Minister he promised new and higher standards for this parliament. We have seen a minister and a parliamentary secretary resign from the ministry because they did not conform to the ministerial code of conduct. We have seen other ministers stay on in the ministry because the Prime Minister has now walked away from his own ministerial code of conduct. In relation to the parliament, we have witnessed a couple of things. Firstly, we are sitting longer, but there is no net gain in available time. Secondly, we have seen one of the most important institutions of the parliament, the committee system of the House of Representatives and the Senate, severely restricted and cut back so that they are unable to fully perform the functions that they were designed for. If they are still performing are certainly not growing and developing as they should. I want to point out to the House that I had four notices of motion on the Notice Paper specifically designed to pick up some of the alleged new standards that the Prime Minister talked about. At the end of the first year of the Howard government you cannot point to one reform. There is a notice of motion relating to question time which seeks to limit the time for a question and the time for the answer. We have not even been permitted to have a debate on that. I would have thought that the notice of motion relating to gagging the debate on a dissent from the Speaker's ruling would have at least merited discussion in this place. We have witnessed already in one dissent debate speakers being gagged and have the Speaker's ruling left undefended by the government. What a pitiful situation. There is the proposal-I have said that it is not mine-to have a staffing and appropriations committee. It is true-I do not say this about Speaker Halverson-that it has been traditional for Speakers of this House to resist setting up such a committee. It is well known that the overseas travel by the President and the Speaker, because they are in the Department of the House of Representatives, which is not scrutinised, can be buried. The staffing and appropriations committee would have far more functions than just dealing with that matter. I say to Speaker Halverson-I reproach his predecessors-that we really do need a staffing and appropriations committee, the need for which was no more evident than when we were hacking and slashing the committees. The fourth notice of motion I put forward was to have a new form of private members business--constituency statements in the Main Committee. This would be of three minutes duration and each week 20 minutes would be allocated to each side of the House, which would allow members to be seen to be responding to those things that were of a priority, of an urgent nature, or which needed publicising in their own constituencies. Not one of these propositions has merited a discussion. Indeed, it is always up to the they Leader of the House (Mr Reith) to pick them up, and I have invited him to do so. Even if he cannot himself come to grips with the propositions, at the very least they could be referred to the Procedure Committee. I must admit I regret that I am no longer a member of that committee. The point I want to make is this: it is no good talking about the higher standards required in the parliament and not living up to them, whether that refers to ministerial conduct-it is a matter of pity that the former Liberal Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, would not have hesitated; you would have seen more ministers go--or whether it refers to the issues· that I have raised by way of notice of motion. I think it is a condemnation of the government and Mr Howard's advice of higher standards that not one of these notices has been debated or discussed in this parliament or in this House, picked up by the Leader of the House or, indeed, referred to the Procedure Committee. (Time expired). Berklee Ltd",117
281,Mr MAREK,CURRENT ACTIVITIES UNDER THE AID PROGRAM,"I wish to bring to the attention of the House a matter of grave concern for the small business sector of Australia and the community at large. It concerns the harsh, unconscionable and deceptive conduct of a publicly listed company, Berklee Ltd, an exhaust component manufacturer from Ballarat Victoria. Early in 1988 Mr Sid O'Toole, now a constituent in the Capricornia electorate, decided to investigate the possibility of going into small business. During a meeting with the national marketing manager of Berklee Retail, Mr O'Toole was told the Rockhampton store, which he was contemplating buying, was the most successful in Australia and that it was one of a few yet to be converted to their franchise. The marketing manager also told Mr O'Toole that there were 120 franchised stores Australia-wide and that not one of them had ever gone bankrupt. In addition to this, he told Mr O'Toole that 50 per cent of the royalty payments made by the franchisees would be spent on advertising, promotion and marketing, demographic surveys, store assistance and staff training. all sounded good so Mr O'Toole made the commitment and purchased the store and its assets to operate as a Berklee franchise. In 1989, in support of what management was saying verbally, Berklee Retail issued a booklet on their franchise system titled 'The Berklee way-making money'. This booklet stated that over 100 Berklee Australia exhaust centres operated across the nation. The booklet went on to say what franchising involved and how it operated. Then, in March 1990, the company issued a company video which stated they had 120 franchised outlets across Australia. Both the booklet and the video promoted the same information management was telling Mr O'Toole to convince him to take the Rockhampton business. As it turned out, the company had only 25 franchised stores at the time and failed to meet any of the commitments and promises they had made. These were all blatant untruths. It is now evident that Berklee Retail, under the auspices Berklee Ltd, deceived and induced people through its management and its promotional literature to become franchisees on the pretext that they were experienced franchisors; that there were more franchisees than were actually operating; and, that big profits were there for the taking. As honourable members would be aware, section 52 of the Trade Practices Act precludes misleading and deceptive conduct. The misrepresentations made by Berklee to its dozens of franchisees and potential franchisees clearly breach this section. There were a number of other promises Berklee made that can be proved to be misleading and deceptive conduct and a breach of section 52 of the Trade Practices Act. Berklee promised franchisees the exclusive right to distribute Berklee products. This only lasted about 18 months before they removed their embossed name off their product from 1 July 1989, and began to flood independent stores-not, I might add, with a different product but with the same product. This action alone destroyed their own franchise operation completely and took with it almost everyone of the 40 franchise operators and their investment. Further breaches of section 52 of the Trade It Practices Act are as follows. Although promised time and time again, there was no company plan to guide these franchisees and there was no in-store training by competent staff employed by Berklee Retail. There was no back-up and support for these franchisees, such as computer packages to control the business or a proper financial profile of a model store and a demographic report based on the exigencies of the franchise agreements.",119

The franchisor accepted payments of moneys for goods and services it did not intend to supply to its franchisees. This seriously contravenes the provisions of section 58 of the Trade Practices Act. A concerted effort by franchisees to have Berklee address the problem was not forthcoming, so the franchisees took their case to the Motor Trades Association of Australia.

F. against the member for Jagajaga in the House about communications concerning the very harsh impact of child care cost increases on Australian families; (c) and calls on the Minister for Family Services immediately to correct the record on this matter and to apology to the member for Jagajaga for making false allegations against that Nelson, B. J. member; (d) notes that the ""someone"" referred to by the Minister in the House yesterday is in fact a woman who had expressed outrage about the consequences of the introduction, from April 1997, of changes to child care arrangements which she says will see low income wage earners, and single parents especially, having to quit their jobs, pull their kids out of child care West, A. G. and stay at home all because of the draconian consequences of the Government's Budget; and (e) notes the complicity of the member for Herbert in this matter. (2) calls on the Prime Minister to discipline the Minister for Family Services for misleading the House and to enforce the code of conduct on the behaviour of ministers, particularly in regard to their misleading the House. Motion (by Mr Reith) put: That the member be not further heard. The House divided. [l0.37 a.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. R. G.

309,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"I move: That standing order 399 be suspended for the remainder of this period of sittings, except when a motion is moved pursuant to the standing order by a Minister. I move this motion so as to ensure that the House can proceed with the business before it today and so that we can conclude matters in a timely and orderly manner. Members may not know this but today we are celebrating, so I am reliably informed, the 21st parliamentary birthday of the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the member for Ryan « Mr Moore). I know I speak on behalf of all members-including, I am sure, those on the opposite side-when we congratulate them on their wonderful parliamentary contribution in the last 21 years. This also allows me to say that probably in the last 21 years neither member has ever seen an opposition as feral as the opposition that today occupies the other side of the House. There are a number of examples of this but, just as one example, members would be interested to know what has just transpired in the last hour and a half, which has been entirely at the instigation of the other side. In fact, it is normal practice for an opposition on the last day of a sitting-and today is, technically, an extended sitting from yesterdayNOES Mr Crean-With no question time.",129
310,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"With no question time, as is the usual practice. It is standard practice. When the House resumes in the morning, the opposition comes in and moves a motion to suspend standing orders to require a minister to come in and explain himself or herself. In fact, if you open the Hansard for last year--on 30 November 1995, which was actually Friday, 1 December 1995-when the PAIRS government was then in opposition, that is exactly what we did. We admire you for following our precedent from the previous year. In fact, we are so pleased that you should follow our precedent that we know exactly what you are going to do virtually day in, day out. However, if you look at the Hansard, when we lost that suspension last year-and we were exactly in your shoes-we then basically called it quits. That was our entertainment for the day. We enjoyed it; you enjoyed it. You responded in the traditional way, and that was the end of the matter. So it was, as I am sure members would be interested to know, that at the conclusion of that first attempt to suspend standing orders I had my usual discussion with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean). I must be a mug. I confess that I am a slow leamer, because I believed him. I must be mad. I said to him, 'Do you think this will be the last of the suspensions today? If it is not the last, obviouslyMr Crean-No. You said, 'Is this the only issue you're doing it on?'",129
311,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Here he goes again. He is recreating history within 10 or 15 minutes of its being made. I said to him, 'Do you reckon this is the last of the ones today, because I need to know whether or not we are going to move 399.' He said, 'No, I don't expect to be moving any more.' I said, 'Well, I appreciate it is not a guarantee; I don't ask a guarantee from you, but I would sort of like to know.' He said, 'I don't expect there to be any others.' Literally, by the time we had finished the divisions and I had sat down, he had the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) moving yet another suspension, simply as a tactic to disrupt the order and proceedings of the House. This sort of feral behaviour, unfortunately, is typical of this opposition that cannot accept the result of the election on 2 March. To me they their trivia is slightly exasperating, but it is typical of the way they operated. On Tuesday, for example, we had a motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the United Nations and anti-discrimination and the like. We had an agreement-5, 5 and 5 minutes for the three speakers on each side. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) went for 15 minutes. At the ten-minute mark, I said, 'We had an agreement. Why don't you keep the agreement?' He said, 'Oh, there was no agreement.' The fact of the matter is that there was an agreement. So the next day we got another motion up. This time it was on a statement by the Prime Minister discussing the wonderful achievements of the coalition government since 2 March. So we had an agreement that the Leader of the Opposition would speak for no longer than the time provided to the Prime Minister-a perfectly reasonable, fair arrangement. I said, 'Look, I was a mug for agreeing yesterday to a time arrangement with you, but please don't breach the agreement again the next day.' What happens? They breach the agreement the next day. I have an understanding about how we will manage business today. What does the Manager of Opposition Business do? He tears the agreement up before the hour is over. The fact is that, if you look at the way in which the divisions were conducted this morning, the normal arrangement is that a person moves the suspension, and we move that the member be not further heard. The seconder then stands to speak to the motion, and we move that the member be not further heard. Then the person in the chair states the motion and, usually, the motion is then put. These people are so feral that, first of all, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay)who prides himself on his understanding of the standing orders-just to delay the tactic, at his sort of lowest best, requires under the standing orders for the question to be actually stated. This is another little tactic. Then, just to delay people even further, instead of going straight to the division, which would have been the third division-and they know they are going to lose all three, so why have three in the first place?-they simply present the Manager of Opposition Business so that we have to have another put motion. That means four divisions, which wastes even more time. The House Procedure Committee has examined the matter of divisions. We are discussing it with the opposition parties. Contained within that report is an interesting evaluation and analysis of the number of divisions that we have had this year since 2 March. These people, as a result of their feral disruptive tactics, have doubled the average number of divisions for the House. That achieves absolutely nothing. It has forced us to sit longer than is necessary. It imposes additional costs for absolutely no possible imaginable reason whatsoever. I just hope that in the new year, after they have had themselves a holiday and a bit of a break, there is some return to semblance of order. For example-to show you how they have absolutely no understanding of what is going on-their only policy, dictated by the member for Watson, is to have a division on absolutely everything. I said to them, 'If the member for Jagajaga wants to have her say, we'll have two speakers a side on the 399 motion, but on the basis that we don't waste time with a whole lot more divisions.' What did they do? As soon as the next division opportunity came up, they called a division. When I said, 'The deal is off,' they said, 'We seek leave to call off the division so we can have the deal that you have just offered us.' We gave you the opportunity. We could not have been more reasonable. As soon as we are reasonable, you deliberately throw it back in our face because this is part of your tactics. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) is a new member. I am sure she is a half-reasonable person. She has tried to weigh up in her mind whether or not what I say is reasonable and has any glimmer of truth in it. Before she is entirely lost to the wily, cunning and seductive persuasion of the member for Watson, there might be a glimmer of appreciation on her part that, if these people had any idea what they were doing at any point in time, she could have picked up that offer I made. That is why, when that division was called-just so that it is quite clear with you people-we dealt with you fairly and firmly. But do not think we are going to give you an inch, because if we give you an inch you take a mile. Our experience of dealing with you is that as soon as we try to deal with you reasonably we get exactly that sort of reaction. All jokes aside, it is just absolutely ridiculous. We have no choice. I was not going to move in respect of standing order 399. You know I was not going to move it; I said it to you. As far as standing order 399 is concerned, let me put on the record that of course this is standard procedure. Mr Leo MCLeay-It's jackboots.",129
312,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"'Jackboots' is the interjection from the short-memoried member for Watson. For example, on 19 August 1993 the then member for Swan and Leader of the House, the now Leader of the Opposition, in fact moved this motion. As governments are wont to do, he blamed the previous government for setting the precedent. I am glad the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is here because Mr Beazley, the then Leader of the House, said: This standing order was not invented by the Australian Labor Party. I think it was invented by the right honourable member for New England ... It was certainly utilised first by the former member for Hume, Mr Fife, who is no longer in this place. It represents a reaction by the executive to a situation which, from its point of view, means that the business, if it is to be effectively transacted, to be capable of being transacted without interruption. He went on to say: This is a country that has to legislate. That is actually a rather bold statement, given that reform fatigue and paralysis had totally set in at that point in time under the previous government. He said: We have to legislate because we have a constitution which is not necessarily based on higher principlethis is a classic statement, actuallybut based on administrative arrangements-that establishes arrangements at a federal level, establishes arrangements between House and Senate and establishes arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states. It requires a government of whatever political hue to keep a very high level of legislation in operation. If someone is as articulate as that, they deserve to be the Leader of the Opposition! That was the precedent in 1993. I will go back a bit further. On 19 December 1991 the then Leader of the House, now opposition leader, said: This will help facilitate the business of the House for the rest of the day and ensure that what is an extremely tight program is gone through. This is the first time since we have been in office that we have moved this motion; as a precedent, we have the shining example of the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife), who I believe was the last Minister to move this motion, no doubt for similar reasons ... So it is with good precedent that we move the motion. In the debate then ensuing, the then opposition said that they appreciated it had been done in the past but that particular circumstances on that occasion should have been used to distinguish those circumstances in 1991 from the time that Mr Fife had moved the motion. In particular, in December 1991 the reason he thought it was inappropriate to move that motion was that the Labor Party was in the process of losing its Prime Minister on that very day and he felt it appropriate that the opposition should be able to move a motion for the suspension of standing orders-a not unreasonable argument, given the circumstances. It also should be noted that these are two has occasions on which the motion has been used or the standing order has been suspended. You will also note in the Hansard that on a number of occasions notice has been given so as to put the other side on warning that if they do unreasonably play up then that motion can be brought to bear. Of course, on a number of occasions Mr Beazley, in his capacity as the Leader of the House, did in fact give notice. I have records of notice being given on 6 May 1971, on 26 September 1979 and on a number of occasions through the 1990s-30 May 1991, 19 December 1991, 4 March 1992 and 19 August 1993. The process and procedure are given validity and justification in House of Representatives Practice, pages 358 and 359. Lastly, I tum briefly to the matters raised by the member for Jagajaga. Mr Lee-Finally.",131
313,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Well, it is typical that such a motion should be moved today, and we appreciate why you do so. Of course, there have been opportunities since question time yesterday for you to move it; but naturally you, being uncertain of your ground, have delayedMs Macklin-We had an MPI.",132
314,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,You had an opportunity in the MPI yesterday to raise the issue. Ms Macklin-We went and got the facts.,132
315,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"I have the facts; I have the Hansard in front of me. It was a particularly weak censure motion. If you try to say that somebody is misleading the House, you have to actually say where they have been misleading the House.",132
316,Mr SINCLAIR,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,And that she has in fact misled.,132
317,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"That is right. You actually have to substantiate it, and the usual way would be to have that in the motion. I actually got out the Hansard. Mr Bruce Scott interjecting Mr Lee-The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has encouraged us to move a substantive motion. If the Leader of the House is willing to accommodate us, we would be happy to move a substantive motion.",132
318,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,Mr Nehl)There is no point of order.,132
319,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"The member for Dobell is rather slow-witted if he thought that I might give him that opportunity. The member for Jagajaga has been carrying on saying that the minister had said that the member for Jagajaga had written a letter to someone in Townsville. That is what you are saying, basically. I got out the Hansard and found that is not what is said. What is said-I have the quote-is: On the child-care issue, I want to expose the shadow minister for what she is. She is running around this country spreading misinformation about the family tax package and about the child-care system. That is true. That can hardly be denied. Then she goes on to say: In fact, in response to a letter from someone in Townsville recently who has been told that her child-care fees will be raised by $56.44 per week, we took the opportunity to ring that parent. We ran through the figures with her. That is notOpposition members-Keep going!",132
320,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,Hang on. Just one bit at a time. You shouldn't get so excited. Mr Crean interjecting,132
321,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Look, Simon. You have had a bad year and you are in for another bad year and another bad year after that. This level of excitement is not good for you. You will have to see your cardiac specialist. Ms Macklin-What about the decimal point?",132
322,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"The interjection is, 'What about the decimal point?' I read that bit as well. Ms Macklin-Read it out.",132
323,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"I will, I will. Of course I am going to read it out. I am reading it out because it proves conclusively that this is just a sham. Of course it is a sham. It is a sham that oppositions bring on every last day of every parliament every year because it is part of the fun of politics. These are the words that the minister used: I am not sure whether this is a deliberate attempt to mislead the Australian public or . . . whether the member has put the decimal point in the wrong place. The figures that the member keeps touting around this country can be demonstrated to be totally inaccurate. There is no reference to a letter. How ridiculous! I suppose I should be restrained in cutting up the member like this, but just to completely demolish this 110 per cent I point out that the member was asked today in a doorstep interview whether the minister misled parliament by claiming it will rise by only 58cMs Macklin-Fifty-six.",132
324,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Fifty-six. When you are asked a question like that and you are running a little campaign like you are, the answer is, 'She definitively misled the House; this is where she misled the House', and you read out the Hansard. But what did you say? You said: Well, certainly she's given an impression that fees are only going to go up by 56 cents. How pathetic! Ms Macklin-And go on. What did I say after that?",132
325,Mr REITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Okay: This centre is saying that the fees for this parent are going up by $30.00. Not even the member was prepared to make the claim that the minister had misled the House. You could not even make the claim. Good on you for trying. It is great to see you with a bit of life in you right to the end. But you got nothing. This motion operates until the end of today only. It will prevent the opposition's disruptive tactics. It is the usual way for governments to proceed on the last day. I propose that the Manager of Opposition Business be allowed to have his say. I do not want anyone to say that we have not allowed him to have his say. Once he has had his say, that will bring the matter to an end.",133
326,Mr CREAN,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"I rise to indicate that we will move the following amendment: That the following words be added to the motion: "" provided that the answer to the question without notice from the member for Jagajaga to the Minister for Family Services appearing at page 7959-60 for 12 December be expunged from Hansard because it was false and misleading.' We will seek to have those words added to what the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has procedurally moved because of the way in which the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has failed to come into this House and defend herself. She is still being protected by the Leader of the House, who will not give her the opportunity to defend her disgraceful statement yesterday, and has been shown to be a failure as a minister in this House under intense scrutiny from the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). She demonstrated yesterday that, in addition to being a failure, she is also a fraud. She will come in and fall into the Peter Reith school of politics: say anything that suits the occasion; make it up as you go along; if you cannot find evidence, then you concoct it. Minister, you have not only compounded your failure as a minister but also demonstrated your fraudulent approach to and your deliberate misleading of this parliament. You misled this parliament yesterday, and you should apologise for it.",133
327,Mr SINCLAIR,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,Where?,133
328,Mr CREAN,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"She misled this parliament in saying that the member for Jagajaga had written highlighting figures that she had never made. Minister, you misled the parliament and you know it, and you should apologise. If you have a defence, get up and say it. If you think you have a defence, get on your feet and tell us. But you cringe under the protection of a failed former minister, and we all know about his sneaky approaches to business. We know the sneakiness of the member for Flinders, Sneaky Reithy, and we know that they are there protecting you. The reality is that you can run but you cannot hide in this place. We will pursue you and, even though the parliament is getting up today, we will persist in this pursuit because you are a failed minister and you have misled the parliament. Let me just go to the issue of the Leader of the House putting his understanding of what he said about procedures today in the parliament, just to demonstrate yet again that the Leader of the House is incapable of telling the truth. It is true that, when we came into this parliament at the beginning of today to move the censure motion, he asked me, behind the chair, 'Is this the only issue that you are going to be raising?' to which I answered yes. That is the conversation that took place. I said to him, 'Are you intending to move your 399?' - that is, the motion which we now have. He looked genuinely unaware of the fact that he had 399 on the Notice Paper Mr Reith-I put it on the Notice Paper.",133
329,Mr CREAN,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Someone put it on for you, but you seemed genuinely unaware that it was there. The fact of the matter is that the Leader of the House comes into the House and talks about the wasting of time. Let me just say this: had he allowed the motion that we were seeking to move to get the minister to come in and apologise to proceed, it would have taken 25 minutes. That is what is allowed under the standing orders. So the debate would have been finished no later than five to 11, or it could have been finished in two seconds if she had got up and said, 'I apologise.' So let us have none of this about the wastage of time. Twenty-five minutes versus the fact that we now are into the second hour, heading into the third hour-and why? Because they want to defend the indefensible. They want to use every procedural trick in the book to prevent us getting to our feet to demonstrate where the minister has misled the House and getting her to apologise. A waste of time indeed! But this is not the first occasion on which we have had the Leader of the House wanting to stop the opposition moving things. We have had the situation with the euthanasia bill where, by the sham of moving it up into the Main Committee and preventing that debate occurring in the main chamber, it backfired on him eventually, because we ended up with a debate in the main chamber that took most of Monday. Had that been agreed to right from the beginning, it should have taken place in this place. It only happened because the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) moved a procedural motion that sought to put some sense back into the issues that we were debating, and we finally had a debate-but not because the Leader of the House would allow it. He did the best he could to keep it out. But it does not stop there. The Leader of the House has for the first time gagged the appropriation bills in the detail stage, he has gagged the workplace relations bill in the detail stage-and do you know why? Their argument is that we have given sufficient time on the second reading. But the second reading speech, as everyone knows, is the generality of debate. What we have been saying and trying to point out time and time again is that, said. so far as this government is concerned, the devil is in the detail. The only way in which you get to the detail procedurally in this parliament is to allow debate on the detail-and that comes in the consideration in detail stage, it comes after the second reading. But time and time again we have had this government gag that very debate. The Telstra debate, the workplace relations debate, the budget bills-all of them have been gagged in the detail. And they say that they are in here lifting the standards of the place, making the parliament more accountable. These were the words, the pious words, of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his first speech in this parliament after having been elected: 'The one thing that we will do is lift the standards of the parliament to allow open debate, to allow accountability' - and they have debased them. They have prevented debate; they have cut the committee system; they have cut the resources to the committee system; they have had a procedural motion that went forever and that prevented the committees being set up in time. Again, the importance of the committees is to address the detail work of the parliament. But this is a government not interested in the detail. It does not want the Australian public to understand what it is up to in the detail. It wants to stick with the generalities and it does not want to go to the detail. Let me just say that we are in this debate at the moment in this place because we sought to move a censure against the Minister for Family Services. Let us just go through the circumstances surrounding what those opposite are protecting in the actions of the Minister for Family Services. She came into this parliament yesterday and implied that the member for Jagajaga had been misleading people in the electorate about the impact of their measures in the budget, particularly as they related to child care. That was the assertion, and it was also the understanding that everyone who listened in this parliament got yesterday. Regardless of your attempt to go back and look at the detail of the words, there is a clear understanding of what was Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.

331,Mr CREAN,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"If the Leader of the House reflect, thinks we have not got the Hansard, it another example of him trying to stop the debate by the raising of frivolous points order. But the facts of the matter are these: that the woman in question quoted by the Minister for Family Services in a way which implied that the member for Jagajaga had written the letter wrote to the Townsville Bulletin expressing concern about the impact of the budget on child care, indicating what the child-care cuts would mean to her. This who is alwayswoman also wrote to the minister, saying how much those fees were going up. What we then had was the minister coming into this parliament implying member for Jagajaga's letter. The member for Jagajaga never said that; she never wrote that letter. Mr Brough-And she never said it, either.",135
332,Mr CREAN,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,She did say it. We can go on and show that this was implied by the minister. The Hansard states:,135
333,Mrs MOYLAN,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"I am not sure whether this is deliberate attempt to mislead the Australian public or ... Or, wait for it, whether the member has the decimal point in the wrong place. How could you change the decimal point you had not written the letter? The reality is that she was referring to the letter, and she has misled the House in linking the member to the changing the decimal point. How could you change the decimal point if you had not written the letter? That is point of it. The Minister for Family Services thinks she is on clever ground by without naming who wrote the letter, but leaving no-one in this place in doubt that she was referring to the member for JagajagaMs Macklin-Too clever by half.",135
334,Mr CREAN,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"She was too clever by half because she departed from the script, in response to an intervention. Minister, you might recall that at the time the member Jagajaga got up to ask you to table the letter. The Speaker ruled that intervention out of order at the time because the time for asking the tabling was at the conclusion of the Nevertheless, the minister had time to during that intervention, on the standis ing order. That is when she got the smart angle from the Treasurer (Mr Costello )-we of could see it from over here-'Why don't you say they got the decimal point wrong?' She does not think of these things herself. She has to be given the lines. No wonder they will not let her get up and speak in this debatebecause she will muck it up again.

337,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,I think you know quite well. You withdraw it.,135
338,Mr CREAN,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"I withdraw. The Treasurer, who is always in here with the clever quip, also thinks he can trade them off to his ministers because he might get a bit of gooda will. He has been slipping behind the member for Flinders in the leadership stakes. He has put moved behind. He has got to lift his game. So he thinks he will help a person in trouble and if that she will be eternally grateful. The trouble is that, when she used the line, she directly implicated the minister. When you got up in this place and after the interjection said that the member has put the decimal point in the wrong place, you misled. By that the statement you were saying that it was the member for Jagajaga who was going around implying, making these statements. But there is more. At the end of the question, the member for Jagajaga again got up and asked the Speaker for the minister to table the letter from which she was quoting and which was supposed to be the letter from the member for Jagajaga to this person in question. What did the minister say?-'I am for quoting from a confidential document.' How can you have a confidential document that you actually quote in the parliament? It is ridiculous! It was the guise by which she did not want to put the document on the table because it would have demonstrated how much of a fraud she was, how much she had misled the parliament. The letter did not exist. Sure, it was confiFahey, 1. J. dential-it was non-existent! Yet your argument was to come in here to try to smear the member for Jagajaga who, as your counterpart in this parliament, has taken you to the cleaners. There have been many weaknesses on your front-bench, but you rate amongst the best of them. You are amongst the worse ministers in this parliament. What you have done is demonstrate your incapacity to argue a case with compassion in the cabinet. You have people out there having to sell their family home to get into a nursing home; you propose an increase on meals on wheels and an increase on child care.

Second Reading",136
342,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. I am delighted to rise today to introduce this Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and the accompanying bills, which give substance to a core commitment given by the government to the Australian people on 2 March. These bills reflect the government's faith in an Australian health care system which recognises both public and private providers and in which the private health sector actively complements the public services funded largely through Medicare and grants to the states and territories under Medicare agreements. The private health insurance incentive scheme, which this bill will implement, is the centrepiece of the government's strategy to assist Medicare from collapsing under the weight of demand for publicly funded hospital and medical services. The scheme does so by recognising the value of the private sector as an indispensable complement to the public sector and acknowledges that by making the fullest use of the sum of our hospital resources we will be able to ensure that Australians have reasonable access to the full range of public and private services. The private health insurance incentives are not simply a commitment to private health insurance in their own right. Rather, they reflect that private health insurance is the most favoured by Australians to gain access to the hospitals and doctors of their choice, when and where they need them. The scheme this bill implements is an essential part of restoring the necessary balance between the use of public and private health systems. This package of bills will give effect government's incentives to assist people to purchase private health insurance. They come not a moment too soon. It is a matter of record that, when our predecessors took office in March 1983, private health insurance covered 65.1 per cent of Australians. In June 1996, this coverage had fallen to just 33.6 per cent, with the burden of this exodus falling squarely on our public hospitals. Most particularly, the effect of the drop-out has been felt very heavily on public hospital waiting lists for elective procedures. Our predecessors chose to neglect the contribution private health insurance made to health financing, and deliberately allowed private health fund membership to slowly wither. It was seen as a boast by those responsible for our health care system that they personally disdain making any private provision for their health care. This government's election has ended that policy of neglect. Medicare is a successful and popular part of this country's health system, the support of which is a key government commitment. Medicare, however, was never designed to stand alone. It was originally devised as Medibank by John Deeble and Richard Scotton in the context of being complemented by a robust private health care system, primarily funded through a private health insurance system partially assisted by government through measures such as the private hospital bed day subsidy and Commonwealth contributions to the private health insurance fund reinsurance pool. These supports were taken away by our predecessors. As a result, the ongoing and increasingly precipitous decline in health fund membership threatens the financial stability of the entire health care system. The private health insurance incentive scheme, and the addition to the Medicare levy-to be known as the surcharge-for people on higher incomes who way have chosen not to insure themselves privately, are essential measures designed to arrest the catastrophic decline in the level of participation in private health insurance. The available evidence suggests that the biggest concern Australians have about private health insurance is the cost of preto the miums. The government's private health insurance incentives scheme provides assistance to people who purchase private health insurance by giving them incentive payments to assist in lowering the cost of their insurance either directly through lowered premiums or indirectly through taxation rebates. The incentives provided will make private health insurance a more financially attractive option to ordinary Australians, especially in providing much needed assistance to the one-third of Australians already providing substantially for their own health care. For if we can, as a start, stop the exodus from private funds, health care providers-both public and private-can better plan for the future health care needs of our nation, and a time of likely increasing demand for health services, with confidence based on real stability. I will now outline the main elements of the incentives scheme. The government has honoured its commitment to provide private health insurance membership incentives for singles, couples, and families. From 1 July 1997, single people earning not more than $35,000 a year may receive up to $125 each year towards the cost of their private health insurance premiums, and couples earning not more than $70,000 may receive up to $250. Families with one child earning not more than $70,000 may receive up to $450 per year. The income threshold will rise by $3,000 for each additional child, in line with the government's family tax initiative. The incentives will be paid as follows: eligible people with single memberships will qualify for a $100 incentive payment per year for their hospital insurance, which covers them for costs incurred during hospital episodes and a further $25 if they have ancillary cover which covers services such as dental, optical and physiotherapy; eligible people with couple memberships will qualify for an annual $200 incentive payment for their hospital insurance and a further $50 if they have ancillary cover; eligible families-including single parent families-will qualify for an annual $350 incentive payment for their hospital membership and a further $100 if they have ancillary cover. Eligible people will be able to choose the way in which they receive their incentive amount. They may either have the incentive paid directly to their health fund in return a guaranteed reduction in premiums or they may receive the payment as a taxation rebate after the end of the financial year. This choice recognises that many Australians who have private health insurance are pensioners and self-funded retirees who no longer pay personal tax. Aged pensioners with appropriate health cover will clearly be eligible for the incentives. Health funds wishing to participate in the scheme will register with the Health Insurance Commission. People wishing to receive the incentive as a premium reduction will obtain a booklet from their participating health fund. This will provide them with information about how to apply to receive the incentive payments. If they believe they are eligible, they will complete a statutory declaration stating their belief that they are eligible to receive the incentive amount appropriate to their level of cover. The health fund will then reduce the member's premiums by the appropriate amount depending on their membership status. The premium reduction will be pro-rata'd according to the period for which the member pays. If, for example, they pay for a full year's cover, their premium will be reduced by the full annual amount. If they pay for a month's cover, the premium will be reduced by one-twelfth of the annual amount. The fund will then notify the Health Insurance Commission to complete the registration of the single, couple or family membership as participating the incentive scheme. Health funds will receive through the commission, on a monthly basis, the incentive amounts applicable to their members. To enable this, health funds each month will send the commission details of all current members who are participants in the incentive scheme. The commission will then forward to the funds an amount equal to one-twelfth of the annual incentive payments for the registered memberships. The alternative to choosing reduced premiums is electing to receive the amount as a year end taxation rebate. People electing this course will fill in a section in their Tax Pack stating that they had for private health insurance, which fund they were insured with, at what level for, and what period throughout the assessment year. The Australian Taxation Office will then include a rebate amount adjustment in the taxpayer's final tax refund or liability. To ensure that ineligible people do not claim the incentive and that people do not claim twice, appropriate measures will be implemented. Care has also been taken by the government to ensure that information provided by health fund members will receive due privacy considerations. The bill contains a provision making it a criminal offence for unauthorised use or disclosure of the information provided by people under this bill. In addition, I will be formulating principles, modelled on the Information Privacy Principles of the Privacy Act 1988 to ensure that funds comply with privacy requirements for incentive related information in their charge, including its collection, use and storage. The private health insurance incentives scheme will cost an estimated total of $8 million in 1996-97, $491 million in 1997-98, $609 million in 1998-99 and $616 million in 1999-2000. These estimates include both amounts paid to the funds in return for lower premiums being charged to eligible members and taxation rebates direct to claimants, as well as expected running costs. It is estimated that about 2.5 million memberships of health insurance funds, covering more than five million people, will potentially be eligible for these incentive payments. These co stings are based on the assumption that the private health insurance participation rate will stabilise at just under a third of the population by 1 July 1997, and will then increase by two percentage points over time. This legislation will make private health insurance more affordable for the many Australians on lower and middle incomes. Those who have maintained private cover in the face of the premium rises largely driven by the previous government's policy will be rewarded for their perseverance. This is particularly so for those older Australians, many on very low fixed incomes, who have scrimped and saved against great odds to keep their cover. Those who have had to make the decision to let their membership go, and those who want to purchase health insurance for the first time, but have been unable to afford it, will also be able to benefit from the incentives. Another beneficiary will be the Australian health system. By providing this assistance, the government will restore $600 million a year of the funding that was deliberately and systematically cut out of the private health system when it removed bed day subsidies and payments to the reinsurance pool. It was on the basis of the private sector having this infrastructure that Medicare was introduced. These incentives will provide the injection of funds and public confidence into a private health system which for too long has been neglected, while our public hospitals are straining at the seams to cope with demand. The private health insurance incentives scheme and the related measures being introduced today highlight the government's absolute determination to turn this around, to make the most of our existing health care assets, both public and private, and to ensure that Australia and Australians can look forward confidently to assured quality health care, with the maximum of individual choice. I commend the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1996 to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.",137

On indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I place on record the opposition's disappointment that, once again, no advance copy of the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1996 was provided to the opposition until the minister was reading the second reading speech.

344,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. In order to ensure that the private health system remains a vital component of Australia's national health care system, the government has introduced into parliament the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1996. As a result of this bill, there are several consequential amendments that need to be made to other acts. This bill amends the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 to allow the commission to administer the incentives act. The bill also makes several amendments to the National Health Act 1953. These amendments require registered health benefits organisations to comply with the provisions of the incentives act. The amendments also require the funds to provide information relating to the incentives scheme to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. The council is then required to include such information in its annual report on the operations of the private health insurance industry. The bill also allows members of health funds to make complaints to the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner about matters relating to the incentives scheme. I commend the bill to the House and I present an explanatory memorandum to the bill.",140
345,Mr LEE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I move: That the debate be adjourned. I also note that, again, the opposition has not been provided with a copy of the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Incentives) Bill 1996 or the other two bills which are coming. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA BILL (No.2) 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Dr Wooldridge, and read a first time. Second Reading",141
346,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill complements the private health insurance incentives being made available to lower income earners by providing encouragement to high income earners who can afford to take out private health insurance to do so. The bill provides for a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge for individuals with taxable incomes greater than $50,000 or families with combined taxable incomes greater than $100,000 who do not have private patient hospital cover for themselves and all family members. Married and de facto couples and single persons with dependants are eligible for the $100,000 combined taxable income threshold. Trustees of trust estates who are assessed under section 98 of the assessment act-that is, a trustee who pays tax on behalf of a beneficiary who is under a legal disabilitywill also be liable for the surcharge if the beneficiary would have been liable. The required private patient hospital cover is cover under a private health insurance policy which provides benefits in relation to fees and charges for hospital treatment. This includes 'front-end deductibles', or excess, cover. Cover merely for treatment provided by a medical professional in a hospital-ancillary cover--does not avoid the surcharge. The amendments imposing the surcharge will apply from 1 July 1997, in respect of the 1997-98 and subsequent years of income. This parallels the introduction of the private health insurance incentives scheme. The surcharge will generally be payable when income tax for a year is assessed and is payable. However, provision is to be made for PA YE taxpayers to provide for their liability for the additional amount through the tax instalment deduction system. The Treasurer has stated in this House that this is a surcharge the government hopes noone has to pay. However, the government is assuming that a number of taxpayers liable for the surcharge will choose not to take even the most basic private health insurance cover for hospital. We estimate therefore that the surcharge will raise an additional $60 million in 1998-99 and $75 million in 1999-2000. Medicare levy low income exemption thresholds The bill also increases the low income exemption thresholds that ensure that low income individuals and families are exempt from the Medicare levy. The increases were announced in the 1996-97 budget. The thresholds for the 1996-97 and subsequent years will be increased to $13,127 for individuals and $22,152 for families. The additional threshold for each child remains unchanged at $2,100. These increased exemption thresholds, together with the change of Medicare levy rate already implemented for the 1996-97 year of income, result in changes to the income ranges over which the exemptions are shaded out. The new upper limits of the ranges for individuals, certain trustees and families are $14,346, $454 and $24,209 respectively. The estimated cost of raising these thresholds will be $2 million in 1996-97, $30 million in 1997-98 and $15 million in 1998-99 and 1999-2000. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Lee) adjourned.

347,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (1.02 p.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill amends the proposed Income Tax Assessment Act 1996 to provide for a tax offset as an incentive for persons to take out or maintain private health insurance. The tax offset is complementary to benefits available under the Private Health Insurance Bill 1996 in the form of reduced premiums for private health insurance. People will have a choice of taking the incentive through a health insurance fund in the form of reduced premiums or as an income tax offset claimable on assessment at the end of the income year. It will also be possible to choose to move within the year from reduced premiums to tax offset or vice versa since a taxpayer may claim the offset in respect of premiums that have not been reduced. The offset will be available for assessments in respect of the 1997-98 income year and later income years. The offset will involve a cost to revenue of $113 million in 1998-99 and $114 million in 1999-2000. The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to make changes in connection with the Medicare levy surcharge that applies to high income earners without private health insurance from 1997-98. The amendments ensure that prescribed persons with dependants who are presently exempt from the Medicare levy or pay a reduced amount of levy are liable for the surcharge where any member of their family is not also a prescribed person and is not covered by private patient hospital insurance. This ensures that those persons have the same choices as other Australians to take out private health insurance for their families, where their incomes exceed the relevant thresholds. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Lee) adjourned. NA Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report",142
348,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report, incorporating dissenting reports, entitled The implications of Australia's Services Exports to Indonesia and Hong Kong, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",142
349,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report refers to one of the more exciting of all those areas of the Australian economy in our interrelationship with other countries. The services area is one which obviously has been expanding both domestically and in our export trade, and it is one which has become more notable as time and circumstance vary. The definition of services was a matter of some conflict. In the report we have referred to some of the alternative ways by which it can be identified. The ABS identifies services as: . .. everything other than goods, income and unrequited transfers-according to the international statistical standards. It is very much a residual category. We do not try to identify any services that might be bundled in with goods; they are covered in our merchandise trade statistics. It is the ABS definition that this report essentially relates to. The real problem we found, however, in preparing the report was the lack of information and the degree to which we found it hard to identify where and in what direction statistics were available to look at the whole array of service exports. The first four recommendations of the committee specifically identify what we see as a requirement. The report states: The Committee recommends that: 1. as a matter of urgency, the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism re-establish a unit to provide advice on users' needs to the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the best approach to develop more comprehensive service statistics. 2. the Australian Bureau of Statistics continue in its efforts to ensure that service sector data brought into line with that of the manufacturing, mining and agricultural sectors. 3. the Australian Bureau of Statistics budget be adjusted to enable this to occur. 4. all government departments consider the extent to which relevant service statistics can be collected and published. For example, relevant service statistics can be collected in the field of law, where there are many legal firms operating abroad; in the field of health, where we know that there are many health services provided; in the field of education and so on. To the degree to which each of the departments with specific areas of interest can provide data, it would be a great help in trying to identify not only what is happening but something of the future in that area. The rapidity of the growth in service exports is again apparent from tables that have been prepared. In spite of the lack of specific information and although I am about to quote from some of those, there is a problem because in so many areas the data is embedded in statistics for other factors. For example, in major corporations, one cannot be sure when they are talking about trade in a particular commodity-for example, coal, iron ore or any of the other base metals-whether the service component has been included within that or whether they are separately identified. Certainly, in the figures available, we are relying on only the bald data so far as we are able to establish it. To give members an idea, according to the ABS, Australia's exports in services have risen from $5,836 million in 1984-85 to $20,373 million in 1994-95. So there has been an incredible increase in the volume of exports and that has more than offset the level of increase in imports. It means that service exports are at this stage contributing significantly to offset our balance of payments problem. In the report there are a good many other details, so far as we have been able to acquire them, looking at the data and identifying something of the measure to which services contribute to the whole field of the Australian trade pattern. The report also looked at a range of countis ries. We decided that, in identifying Australian service exports, it would not be possible for us to deal with them in general, so we picked two economies: Hong Kong, which we saw as a fairly sophisticated and advanced economy, and Indonesia, which is a rapidly developing country. Even in the statistics which reflect both of those countries, again the increase in the value of Australia's service exports to them has been quite remarkable. There are, inevitably, problems in competition. In trying to identify these service exports, we have looked at some of the impediments as well as some of the advantages. Chapter 3, for example, looks at the taxation element. There is little doubt that, when one looks at the complexity of the problems of tax, part of the problem still lies in the extent to which compliance costs do impose a burden on those involved in export. Our fifth recommendation picks up some of the problems that exporters have seen in terms of the compliance costs and recommends that the Australian Taxation Office should undertake a more comprehensive ongoing sampling of the views of individual businesses to ensure its actions are based on an accurate and realistic understanding of business problems and requirements. One of the difficulties has really been inadequate knowledge of international tax law. Again, in the information and evidence given, we felt that more needs to be done to ensure that there is a better understanding of the complexities of international tax law. We see this as one of the areas where, no doubt, there is need in the business and academic world to advance knowledge beyond that which is presently available. The committee believes that an understanding of all tax issues involved in the export of services is important in any analysis of that service trade contribution to the Australian economy. Of course, it is even more important for those who seek to become involved in the export of services. In relation to other impediments, advantages and disadvantages, we have analysed everything from telecommunications to problems in transport and in visas. In that respect, the committee has drawn on the recommendations that have flowed from the most recent Philippine discussions where there has been a new type of business visa settled between the Philippines, Korea and Australia. They call it the APEC business travel card. I think the APEC business travel card is a wonderful concept if we can develop that with other countries. Although this report relates Hong Kong and to Indonesia, the business travel card, which is based on an agreement with Korea and the Philippines, is a very good way by which travel between these countries in this region can be facilitated in future. I want to pay particular attention to that section of the report relating to evidence received from Mr Norman Fisher of Australian TAFE International. There is little doubt that there are wonderful opportunities not just at the tertiary level but also at the TAFE for providing an educational input into countries in our region. We found, particularly in the Indonesia and Hong Kong areas, there is enormous potential and great opportunity for Australia. One of the difficulties in service exports is the extent to which finance is available. Quite a number of exporters mentioned the problems of finance. The report has dealt with that, identified some of the problems and made some recommendations. In all, the report has 32 recommendations. We have looked at both the general and the particular. As I remarked, the report does concentrate on both Hong Kong and Indonesia. As far as Hong Kong is concerned, I think we need to understand that, with the change in sovereignty in its passage to China as of 1 July 1997, the pattern of trade with Hong Kong may well change. We identified a number of factors that have given us a competitive advantage in the past: English language, close proximity, the same time zone, recognition of a good overall standard if not a world leader in quality and a safe destination. All those advantages for Australia in its trade with Hong Kong will remain after 1 July next year, but the problem is that it is possible that, with the introduction of Mandarin as the language of government, some of the English language advantage of the past may go. We have looked at some of the problems that there are for the future, identified them and made recommendations with respect to them. We know that there has been quite a degree of discussion between the British government and the Chinese government on the basic law. to The committee has made a number of observations of our hope that, in the changes after 1 July, Australia will maintain a high profile in ensuring that the principles of the joint declaration and the basic law are upheld in Hong Kong to enable trade and investment to continue with confidence. We see that as one of the question marks after 1 July if change is implemented. With Indonesia there are wonderful opportunities. Again, the data is in the report. We have made a number of recommendations level regarding the opening of markets there. We have certainly recognised that there are a number of problems in the way in which the law and the identification of practices within Indonesia complicate dealing with that country. We have also set down in paragraph 6.66 on page 118 of the report a number of factors which we believe will contribute to the success of exporters in the Indonesian market. To those interested in trading with Indonesia, I would commend those points to them. The committee concludes that, although Australia is a small player in the large and expanding Indonesian service market, there are certainly great opportunities in the Indonesian market for us. Entry into the market is difficult, and the raft of regulations and licences, costs and cultural and business nuances to be dealt with should not be underestimated. The impact of these regulatory restrictions can clearly be contrasted with those in Hong Kong. No evidence was presented to the committee to suggest the current activities of the Indonesian government, in revising and updating its regulatory framework, are leading to more formalised nor more restricted market access conditions. In fact, some businesses consider life is easier the systems are developed to a higher level of sophistication. I believe the report does contribute quite significantly to a better understanding of the wonderful opportunities there are for Australia's services exporters. It is a report which began in the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade under the chairmanship of Michael Duffy, and I would like to commend him on the work he undertook in the early days of the inquiry. At that stage Bev Forbes was the secretary to the committee and she did much of the writing of the original report. I would like to extend my thanks to the other members of the Trade Subcommittee and, of course, to the staff of JFADT-in particular, Ms Joanne Towner, who is the secretary to the whole committee; Jane Vincent, who has been the secretary to the subcommittee; Elena Hull; Adrian Kirchner; and, of course, Bev Forbes. In the last few months, in spite of her commitment to other committees, Bev has made herself available to ensure that the report is available for members of the House and for others so that it can be a reference point. The one final thing I would say is that change is so rapid in this field. We found in the course of the preparation of the report that almost daily there are new developments. While one tries to maintain some currency in comments made, it is extraordinarily difficult to do so; more so given the changing status in Hong Kong and, of course, the rapid evolution of our near neighbour Indonesia. I commend the report to the House. I believe there is much in the report which will serve to help those who seek to export there. I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee Report",142
350,Mr CAUSLEY,COMMITTEES,"On as behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled The Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 and the Racial Discrimination ActSeventh report. Ordered that the report be printed.",145
351,Mr CAUSLEY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The seventh report is the result of a reference from the Senate in relation to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 and, in particular, issues raised by the minority report, which I believe was mostly put together by the member for Banks (Mr Melham). The minority report does dissent in some ways from the recommendations of the committee in that it argues that the alterations to the amendments could in some way be contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act 1993. The committee looked fairly closely at the argument put forward in the minority report. The committee has had some advice from the Attorney-General's Department as to their readings of how the amendments might affect the Racial Discrimination Act 1993. In the preamble and second reading speech introducing the Native Title Act into the parliament, the former Prime Minister made it very clear that special measures may be provided to disadvantaged racial groups without breaching the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act. It is the opinion of the Attorney-General's Department that any variation or withdrawal of those special measures is not contrary to the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act. I know that, in the minority report, the member for Banks and other members are arguing a point but I, as a simple layman, think the point possibly is a little pedantic. It is probably a political position for them. I am a little bit unhappy that we could not have come to a conclusion that everyone agreed on in what is a very important situation in Australia today and certainly before this parliament. I think that the sixth report fied that the act is not working as well as it should be. The act is not clear in some instances. I think that needs to be addressed for the sake of both sides-the Aboriginal people and also those who might have other interests in the land that is under claim. It certainly needs to be addressed quickly so that tensions do not build up. I think there are indications at the present time that that could be occurring. I believe that this issue has been carefully canvassed. The seventh report that has now been tabled looks very closely at the argument put forward by the minority report. It certainly addresses the points that have been made clear by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this House. He has said on several occasions that, when he puts forward the amendments to the Native Title Act, he has no intention to in any way transgress the Racial Discrimination Act. He has also made it very clear that he would ensure that the integrity of the Mabo act remained. Having looking closely at this, the committee agrees that the amendments are in fact the wishes of the parliament and, as such, do not transgress the Racial Discrimination Act. We believe that the amendments can be made and will be useful in making sure that this act does work a lot better than it does at the present time. I commend the report to the parliament.",145
352,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 is now a pivotal matter in the parliament's consideration of the government's proposed amendments to the Native Title Act 1993. It is unfortunate that history will record the race debate as having been one of the more significant aspects of Australian politics in 1996. For Australians of conscience and goodwill, however, the race debate will have confirmed the necessity to respect the varying rights enjoyed across the nation. This is not just an admirable principle; it is a moral imperative. Indigenous Australians who are native title holders enjoy common law status for those rights and, potentially, statutory recognition under the Native Title Act. Further, native title holders can exercise the right to negotiate over future developments so as to protect their certainly identiunique interests. The first minority report has led the committee to examine the government's proposed amendments to the Native Title Act through the prism of the Racial Discrimination Act. The second minority report, tabled today, dissents from the majority view taken on this question. The right to negotiate is a common law native title right. To this point it has been protected under the right to negotiate provisions of the Native Title Act. However, by virtue of the government's amendment proposals, that right is now under significant threat. In certain circumstances it will be lost altogether for some native title holders; for many others it will be grossly impaired. The impairment of these rights would amount to racial discrimination under the Racial Discrimination Act because the rights are possessed only by a particular racial group. If amendments are passed that allow native title rights to be impaired or extinguished, the native title will be impaired or extinguished for ever. Nothing should be done to the Native Title Act that could pre-empt the discovery of native title in the tribunal and the courts. More than enough has already been done in the parliament, the courts and on the ground to deny indigenous people their native title. An important way of protecting the unique rights of our nation's original inhabitants is for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to adhere to his undertaking to respect the Racial Discrimination Act. This can be done by the government agreeing to the recommendation to insert a clause in the Native Title Amendment Bill providing for the Racial Discrimination Act to take precedence over the amendment bill. That clause would simply honour the government's election commitment and commitments that the Prime Minister has made to this parliament and to a number of forums which I will read out. In the current climate, we believe it is important for this clause to be inserted into the Native Title Act. It has already been inserted by the Senate into the social security amendment bill, and that was done unanimously. The coalition's commitment was to retain the Native Title Act, to reserve the right to amend the Native Title Act to ensure its workability, to respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act and, further, to ensure that any amendments to the Native Title Act are preceded by wide consultation. In the Governor General's speech, which was incorporated in Hansard on page 18 on 30 April 1996, this phrase appears: Amendments will be made to the Native Title legislation to ensure its workability. These amendments will honour the basic principles of the Native Title Act. The Prime Minister, at the launch of Aboriginal Reconciliation Week on 27 May in the Great Hall, said: . . . we said that we would honour the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act. He repeated that in a subsequent speech to the minerals industry annual dinner in the Great Hall of Parliament House on 30 May 1996: . . . in making those changes, we would honour the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act. I accept that the government says that it is acting on advice. The clause that we propose be put into the Native Title Act is a safety net clause in the event that the advice that the government is receiving is wrong. We should not be afraid to send a clear signal to the broad community that we do not want to override or suspend the Racial Discrimination Act either willingly or inadvertently. That is why the opposition, together with the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Cheryl Kernot, who is a member of the committee, have again put this in the minority report. The Labor Party wants to and will look at these amendments in a constructive fashion. We will seek to hold the government to their election commitments. If we take the statements of this government at face value, then we can safely say that the recognition of the existence of native title and acceptance of the validity of the Mabo decision are no longer partisan issues in this country-and that is a good thing. Equally, the Labor Party shares the view of the government that the time has come to amend the Native Title Act 1993 to refine its processes and to more expeditiously deliver certainty and equity to all stakeholders. The Labor government set out to do just that with the Native Title Amendment Bill 1995, but that bill lapsed with the change of government. That is why we are where we are at today. However, to amend the act in such a way as to subvert rather than clarify and expedite its original intention would be both unjust and foolish. Any move that will see claimants lose faith in the processes contained in the act and revert to a myriad of expensive, lengthy and sometimes conflicting civil actions serves the best interests of nobody-not the native title claimants, not the miners, not the pastoralists and certainly not the majority of the people of Australia . The old legal dictum that justice delayed is justice denied is entirely applicable to this act. All interested parties are best served by delivering swifter certainty, but it must be a certainty based on justice and equity. Without this, the Native Title Act will rapidly become irrelevant as parties to numerous actions swamp the courts for years to come and resource development grinds to a halt. I repeat: resource development will grind to a halt if native title claimants are forced to resort to their common law rights and to the civil courts. What we want to see is a workable Native Title Act. I repeat the commitment I have given at the outset. I know that when the Prime Minister answered the first question that I put to him in this House on 6 May, he called for the Democrats and the Labor Party to support amendments. I am sure that we can work our way through this maze. But 161 pages of amendments to a 127-page act does not lead, on its present analysis, to a more workable Native Title Act. It is coming down very heavily against indigenous people and taking away existing rights that indigenous people have won within the courts and have been given in the act. This government says it wants indigenous people to be economically independent; it has a new approach to indigenous affairs. Well, you cannot have that philosophy and then bring in these amendments to this act, a number of which are basically taking away from indigenous people gains that they have received in recent Federal Court and High Court decisions. I look forward to sitting down with all the stakeholders in a constructive fashion, not in a political partisan way, so that we can hold the government to their promise. The devil is in the detail. It is one thing to go out and give the rhetoric; it is another thing when you look at the details of these amendments. We do not want a dispute between lawyers. That does not give certainty to the mineral industry, to the pastoralists or to indigenous people. We do not want this to be a lawyers' picnic. I commend the report to the parliament. I think it is part of that process of consultation that the government undertook to involve itself in. But consultation is more than just talking to indigenous people. You cannot say it is consultation if you go and talk to them and you do not listen and do not respond to their genuine concerns. Publications Committee",146
353,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"I present the sixth report of the Publications Committee. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. NA Delegation to Poland, Hungary and Potsdam (Germany)",148
354,Mr ROBERT BROWN,DELEGA TION REPORTS,"by leave-I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Poland, Hungary and Potsdam (Germany) in September-October 1996. The parliamentary delegation which visited Poland and Hungary in September and October 1996 was led by the President of the Senate, Senator Margaret Reid. I had the privilege to be the deputy leader of that delegation. Other members of the delegation included Mr Neil Andrew, the member for Wakefield in this chamber, Senator Alan Ferguson, a senator from South Australia, and Senator Michael Forshaw, a senator from New South Wales. So it is apparent that the delegation was well balanced. The delegation consisted of members from both chambers of parliament. It consisted of members from both the major parties within the parliament. The delegates represented two Australian states and the Australian Capital Territory. In addition, the composition of the delegation indicates clearly that it contained people with diverse interests who could, in a balanced and diverse way, contribute to the purposes and the objectives of the delegation. I pay special tribute to the President of the Senate, Senator Margaret Reid, for the great dignity and competence that she brought to her leadership of the delegation. My feelings were shared by the other delegates and by the people who accompanied us. We were proud to be led on that delegation by Madam President. The way in which she was recei ved at all levels and in every place reflected great credit on her and also indicated the degree of appreciation of the people with whom we spoke in the places that we visited. This was the first official delegation that Senator Reid Report has led since becoming President of the Senate. I also sincerely congratulate the other members of the delegation, whom I have already identified by position and name. If the parliament needs confirmation of the commitment of members of parliament from all parties and from both chambers when they represent the interests of the parliament and of Australia overseas, let me assure them absolutely that that delegation showed such commitment. The first priority of all delegates on all occasions was to serve the interests and objectives of the delegation, the parliament and Australia. They carried out those responsibilities admirably. They were dedicated. It was obvious from the response of the people we met that they were also very impressed with the quality of the delegation and the way in which issues were raised. I also wish to record a very special thanks from the delegation as a whole to the delegation secretary, Evelyn Keams, and the senior adviser to the President, Mr Fred Peppinck, both of whom accompanied the delegation. Their assistance was outstanding. In the case of the secretary, the arrangements that Evelyn Keams made and that she ensured were in place contributed in a very major way to the successful conclusion of the delegation. Her  in the drafting of the report which I have now presented to the parliament were also of very great value. The extent to which and the way in which the delegation was received, and the importance which was placed on the delegation in Hungary, Poland and Potsdam in Germany, is indicated by the level of people who were able to meet with the delegation. For example, we met at some length with the following people: the President of Poland, the Prime Minister of Poland and the President of Hungary. We met with members of the parliaments in those countries, with ministers and bureaucrats, and with leaders of the private sectors in each of those areas, as well as with officers in our overseas posts and private citizens. The hospitality and the courtesies that were extended to us as representatives Ian parliament were simply outstanding. I also make a special reference to the spouses who accompanied the delegation. In particular, I mention Tom Reid, the husband of Madam President. This was the first time. I had had a chance to get t6 know Tom Reid well, and I am pleased I did. He is a great fellow, and the other spouses who accompanied the delegation were great company and outstandingly supportive. While the spouses probably had a greater opportunity than the delegates to look at the areas of Poland, Hungary and Germany that we had the privilege of visiting, their first commitmentabsolutely, on all occasions, everywhere-was to the delegation and to the purposes of the delegation. I thank each of them, and I thank them collectively for the level of their commitment. The delegation to Poland and Hungary took place within the context of Australia's need to refine the development of the relationships between Australia and those countries in the wake of the collapse of communism and the disintegration of the old Soviet bloc. Poland and Hungary, as major countries within the old Soviet bloc, have only had about six years in which to undertake what to them has been quite a remarkable transition. I do not want to overemphasise the ease or the facility with which that transition has taken place. For example, the fact that recently Lech Wales a, who was the leader of the revolution in Poland and became its first president, was defeated by the young Aleksander Kwasniewski, who had been a member of the previous Communist Party government, indicates that there is a great deal of concern about some of the traumas associated with the nature of that transition. There was no attempt on their part to conceal from us some of the difficulties involved. For example, in answer to a specific question which was asked frequently, they said that the main difference between the material and living circumstances of the people of Central Europe in 1986 compared with 1996 is that they are worse off. There is unemployment. Living standards have fallen. There have been shortages. There have been of the Austral- difficulties. There are problems as a result of the breakdown in the traditional, historic, recognised discipline associated with centrally planned economies. As the discipline and social cohesion associated with those types of circumstances have gradually broken down, there has been an increase in serious crime and street crime. They are matters of importance to those countries because they are a result of the transition through which they have gone. Many people would be of the opinion that a different model could have been adopted for the transition, but it is now a matter of historic reality that the model which those countries adopted was a model of their choosing. The problems associated with it are among the problems which they now face. The development of Australia's continuing relations with those countries will depend upon the extent to which and the way in which we can develop our trading relations and the way in which Australia can find investment opportunities in those countries as those countries look for investment. It is not just a matter of Australia, for example, taking an interest in those countries in an exploitative way. They are seeking investment. The process of privatisation, in Hungary, for example, has been more on the basis of finding private sector buyers for existing industries. In Poland it has been more on a voucher type basis for the sharing and disbursement of public sector enterprises. In Hungary, for example, 30 Australian firms are now involved in joint ventures, with a total investment value of something in excess of $A400 million. So important opportunities exist. Both countries were very pleased with the extent to which Australia had shown an interest in developing investment in those countries, but they were disappointed that we had not yet been able to develop our trading relations to the same extent. One simple example which was developed by members of the delegation who have rural backgrounds, rural interests, was the recognition of the opposed weather and seasonal patterns between the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. Surely, that would lend itself to some type of integration as far as our rural industries are concerned. It would ensure a continuing supply, both to them and to us, of many of those products throughout the whole of the year. I understand that consideration is being given to those types of issues. The fact that they are now moving very strongly towards market based economies has necessitated an interest in the possibility of developing investment. They are concerned about growth, about some of the obvious inadequacies and problems that have arisen in the process of that transition. But, overall, there is a very clear determination on the part of those countries to pursue and to secure a much closer integration with the West. To a very large extent, that is historical. Both Hungary and Poland are members of the OECD. They are two of the more recent member countries to join the OECD. They are now looking towards membership of the European Union, the EU--originally known as the Common Market-and they are also seeking membership of NATO. They are looking to the West for their economies and their future defence arrangements-their security arrangements. By the tum of the century or shortly afterwards they will become members of the European Union. That means that they must necessarily at this stage take the opportunity to adjust their economies so that they are more in accord with the economies of the European Union. By doing that, when the time comes for them to join the EU the transition will be simple. They will just move in in a legal sense rather than seek to adjust their economies to move in in an integrated economic sense. They are in the process of doing that now. I do not want to take up too much time but there are a couple of things that I do want to mention in relation to those two countries. Everyone knows that the position which they occupy in Central Europe has placed them in a sense at the crossroads of many of the great historic traumas that have taken place in European history. For example, as a result of the agreements that were reached after W orId War I, Hungary finished up with only about 30 per cent of its previous territory. The old Austro-Hungarian Empire had been a political, military and economic entity in Europe of enormous importance. Today's Hungary has a population of about 10 million and Poland has a population of about 40 million. However, the determination of the people of those countries to retain their identity and to forge their way into the future is inspiring. For example, when I saw Old Warsaw rebuilt, I realised the amount of destruction which had been wrought on Warsaw by the Nazi war machine during World War II. I had no idea of the extent of the devastation. When the people of Warsaw were under siege, Nazi Germany urged them to capitulate but they refused to do so. Nazi Germany then said they would destroy the city. In effect, the people of Warsaw had said, 'Do your darnedest' - and the Nazi war machine did destroy the city. The people of Warsaw, the Polish people, said, 'We will rebuild Old Warsaw as it was' - out of the rubble that they salvaged from its destruction. Old Warsaw stands there today-what a remarkable monument to the courage, the sacrifice, the determination and the pride of those people-as a symbol of the finest elements of the human spirit. In Hungary, we had the great pleasure and privilege of visiting the Hungarian parliament. It was designed to be completed in 1896, which was the 1,OOOth anniversary of Hungary as a nation. We were there at a time when they were celebrating their 1, IOOth anniversary at that magnificent parliament house in Hungary, on the shores of the Danube. This is a beautiful parliament house and a parliament house that Australia is proud of, as it should be, because it is ours. always said to people that the Australian Parliament House is the best parliament house in the world. But in terms of the adornment and the sheer beauty of a parliament house, that parliament house in Budapest must be without equal. When we spoke to the President of Hungary, he asked Madam President if she would take the opportunity, while we were in Budapest, to place a red rose in the hand of the monument of Imre Nagy. He was the President of Hungary at the time of the Soviet invasion in 1956, and following that he was executed. The present President of Hungary was his friend and colleague and comrade. He was imprisoned as well. He is now the President of the new Hungary. So we did take the opportunity to do that. It was a very moving experience, as I am sure you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker. After Hungary and Poland, we went to Potsdam in the state of Brandenberg, in what is geographically, I suppose, East Germany but before was also in a sense politically East Germany, in order for Madam President to officially open the Centre for Australian Studies, which this parliament has endowed. I see the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) nodding his head. As a former Speaker of this parliament, he, together with the former President of the Senate, and with the support now of Mr Halverson, the Speaker of this chamber, and Madam President, Senator Margaret Reid, in the Senate, made an outstanding effort. It was an outstanding effort on the part of all of you, Stephen. There is great appreciation for the establishment of that centre at the University of Potsdam; it is well placed and well resourced. We have indicated that we want the states to come in and support that, as well. It was very well received. We had people attending the official opening from as far away as England, apart from ourselves. Mr Martin-I am sorry I could not make it.",148
355,Mr ROBERT BROWN,DELEGA TION REPORTS,"We were sorry you could not make it, as well. Let me say though, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to I have the member for Cunningham, the former Speaker, that there were people there who asked if I would convey their appreciation to you and the former President of the Senate for the contribution that you made to establishing that. So while you were not there, there were people who saw you there in spirit. I commend the report to all those people who might be interested in examining the way in which we related to those areas. I am not suggesting that that report necessarily covers all of the issues-it certainly does not-but it is a report which I can commend to any people in Australia who are interested in those places. I mentioned Evelyn Keams and Fred Peppinck. I should also mention all of those people who contributed in any way: people in our posts overseas, those people here in the Parliamentary Library and within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the ambassadors of Poland, Hungary and Germany and their staff, and their posts here. I am not going to go through all of them; that would be quite siIIy. But we have identified them at the back of the report. There are pages of those people who contributed towards the success of that delegation. We are very grateful to them, and they made it possible us to do what this parliament expected of us. And I hope we did it with credit, Mr Deputy Speaker. NA Membership",151

NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1996 Cognate bills: MIGRA TION (VISA APPLICATION) CHARGE BILL 1996 IMMIGRATION (EDUCATION) CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 December 1996, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time.",152
357,Mrs STONE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I speak in continuation of earlier remarks I made in this cognate debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996, the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996 and the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment BiII 1996. These amendments are very important in that they give the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) the tools necessary to forward plan and then deliver on our migrant intake policies; policies which have always been central to Australia's economic and social weIIbeing. Australia, along with countries like the USA and modem Israel, has been built by successive waves of very successful migration. Last century, it was largely the British and Irish who pioneered the primary industry development that continues to economicaIIy sustain our nation. And in the 20th century, British for and Irish migration has been supplemented by new Australians from every comer of Europe. They ensured our urbanisation and the manufacturing and service sectors grew. In the last few decades, Asian migration added substantiaIIy to the economic development of our major cities. This is not the first time that we have had waves of Asian migration to Australia. In the gold rush era of the 1800s, especiaIIy in Victoria, some 20 per cent of the Victorian population was made up of Chinese people. That was unplanned, outof-control migration of course, and a lot of those people did not intend to stay for generations in the country. The repercussions of the head-on competition for limited resources in the young colonies-colonies that lacked the social and physical infrastructure to cope with those waves-produced rampant racism and ethnic prejudice. The legacy of that era--our intolerance of other races-influenced our migration policy into the next century and, in fact, for over 100 years. References to our old White Australia policy are still wheeled out to shame us in the region every now and then. There can be no doubt that migration intakes must be carefully paced and planned to match the state of the economy. We need to give each new wave of immigrants the optimal chance to find work, accommodation, language skills and the comfort and security that they seek in their new home. If we have no ability to forward plan and deliver an agreed number of visas, for example, then we are not protecting the interests of the latest wave of newcomers who are always the most vulnerable to population pressures and competition for resources. It is the most recently arrived who experience the pressures. I am a seventh generation Australian, but I do not believe I have any greater caII on this country's resources than the most recently arrived new Australians. I know I share these egalitarian principles with my parliamentary coIIeagues. Egalitarianism is one of the beliefs we embrace as Australians and it differentiates us from many other nations. There are differences between our egalitarian beliefs and those espoused in other culturally similar countries-for example, the United States. In the USA, there is a belief that any citizen can, by their own efforts, work their way up from the log cabin to the White House. But in Australia, on the other hand, we believe that the cabin dweller is as good as the President in the White House any day. You can only sustain our particular brand of egalitarianism if most Australians have a genuine egalitarian experience. To assist the government to forward plan for the infrastructure and the human resources needed to help settle our new Australians we need to give all of our newcomers access to all that is good in Australia. This bill enables the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to determine the maximum number of visas that may be granted within a financial year, including those parts of the preferential family category that are currently exempt from capping. Under Labor, the immigration program did not give the minister those sorts of controls. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of applications for permanent residency under the preferential family category. In 1995-96, the family stream had come to represent almost 70 per cent of the immigration program, a growth of 27 per cent. The spouse category had grown by 32 per cent and the number of parents by 74 per cent. This blow-out occurred because, under the present legislation, the preferential family category is exempt from the quota maximums placed on other categories announced for each annual Australian migration program. The previous government could not prevent a visa being granted to a person who applied for it on the grounds that he or she was a spouse, dependent child or aged parent of an Australian citizen or lawful permanent resident of Australia. This bill allows the minister to determine the number of people to come in under the family schemes and, where the numbers are exceeded in anyone year, to hold those applications over so they can head up the queues for the next year. This means that we can deliver a planned, orderly, balanced, paced and equitable migration program. There is still certainty for families who wish to reunite, though they may have to wait a few more months. This amendment will contribute to the restoration of the balance between the family and skill streams of the program. In my electorate of Murray, we are very short of skilled labour and skilled professionals in a number of categories. Unfortunately, the skills stream of the program is being squeezed by the increase in the number of family category applicants. I will return to that area of skills needs in my electorate later on. The measures contained within the bill are also necessary if we are to efficiently manage the migration program. We must aim to increase the cost recovery and simplify the administration. There is no excuse for heavyhanded bureaucracy and time wasting paper shuffling in the public sector. There are currently three different fees collected under three different pieces of legislation which require not only a visa fee but a health services charge and an English education charge if the applicant does not have functional English. This bill introduces a global visa application fee that will be set at a level which tries to recover the costs associated with these service deliveries. While the visa application fee will be set, the regulations allow for exemptions and concessions for certain categories of people-for example, those coming in under humanitarian and preferential family categories. So, as is always the way with our Liberal ideals, we have a safety net for those who cannot pay. These amendments also implement a legislative exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to allow the minister to prescribe a two-year cohabitation period in respect of applicants who apply offshore for migration on the basis of a de facto or interdependency relationship with an Australian citizen or lawful permanent resident. Married couples will not have to meet this requirement. The reason for this piece of legislation is that there is great concern among the wider Australian community that those who apply to come to Australia under the family categories do have legitimate long-term relationships. For exampIe, we have quite a bit of evidence where facto relationships, cited as the reason for couple coming together in Australia, break down even during the visa process period. These de facto relationships are twice likely as marriages to break down very soon after the arrivals take place. The government considers that a two-year period of living immigration. together is not too much to expect of a couple to demonstrate a relationship which is likely to continue. We are asking for evidence of a two-year relationship before the visa is grantprived ed. There is no requirement that married ners have had a two-year period of marriage. Where children are born to the de facto relationship within the two-year period, they are not required to wait to We consider children as evidence of a marriage or of a long-term commitment. This particular amendment is aimed at helping to reduce abuses which threaten the integrity of the migration program. In my electorate of Murray, we have very substantial numbers in ethnic communities, and they look forward to a situation where they will not be accused of cheating the system. When they wait legitimately to be reunited with their marriage partners or long-term de facto partners, they will not experience the sneers and jeers of people suggesting that they are simply trying to rort the system. This particular amendment will stop people from taking places in the migration program which might otherwise have been granted to people who do satisfy the criteria for other visa classes. Short-term or transitory relationships should not provide non-Australians with a lifelong right to live in Australia. This imposition the two-year cohabitation requirement fulfilment of our government electoral mitment. We exposed our intentions very clearly to the public. The public fully underregion. stood our intention in relation to these migration policy changes, and they proceeded to give us a resounding electoral victory on March. We then have a further amendmentalso section 21 of the Australian Citizenship 1948 and the Migration Act 1958 which the enables the minister to deprive a person of the 1800s. de Australian citizenship where that citizenship a was obtained as a result of migration related fraud. Surely no-one can argue with this. There is currently no provision for depriving as a person of Australian citizenship if the citizenship was obtained with information which was fraudulent at the time of that For example, a person who has migrated to Australia on spouse grounds cannot be deof citizenship if it is later discovered that there was never any intention of a genuine long-term union. Also, a person who partcommitted fraud when applying for citizenship cannot be deprived of that citizenship if the prosecution is not commenced within 10 years of the occurrence. That is quite clearly come to Australia. unacceptable. People should not be able to retain citizenship where it was obtained through fraud. To allow that would be to weaken the meaning and value of Australian citizenship. Therefore, again in accordance with the government's pre-election policy, our commitment for proposed amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 and Migration Act 1958 will allow deprivation within time limitation of future grants of Australian citizenship obtained as a result of fraud, whether at the time of migration or application for citizenship. I began by saying that all governments carefully evolve their migration policy so as to protect their national security, their economic well-being, their political stability and their cultural identity. They also act on humanitarian grounds. Australia, USA and Israel of are examples of countries which owe their is a economic and cultural vitality to mass commigration this century. My own electorate of Murray is a thriving It is the heartland of Australia's fruit and tomato processing industries, and this is in large part due to the waves of migration 2 from the Netherlands, Albania, Italy, Greece and Turkey that occurred this century. We produce world best wool, beef, wheat and Act sheep meat. This industry was developed by waves of British and Irish immigrants in The communities in the Murray electorate are typical of mainstream Australia. We are racially and ethnically tolerant to a degree that should be and is the envy of the world. I deplore the current wallowing in self-deprecation and calling ourselves intolerant. We can teach the rest of the world how to embrace and learn from newcomers from every nation as well as from our own indigenous people. No nation has a perfect record of racial and ethnic tolerance, and certainly we do not. The institutionalised racism and ethnic prejudice that typified the first 180 years of white Australian settlement is to be deplored. But that is history and we have learned. We have managed our immigration policy in the last 20 years in a way that has produced a multicultural mix that has enriched us all. The international mix has been right but we have lost control of the numbers and categories. In recent years our new Australians have tended to join their families already clustered around the major seaboard cities while regional Australia looks in vain for new families to grow popUlations, and individual skilled migrants to meet shortages of medical practitioners, metal workers, workers in the hospitality industry, food technologists, skilled pruners, dairy workers and orchard managers. We have failed to draw our new arrivals, especially those reuniting families, from the comfort zones of their friends and relatives already established in the cities. In conclusion, I strongly support these new legislative proposals. They will help to balance the family reunion, skills and humanitarian areas of migration. It is essential that our population policy is developed with a thorough understanding of the capacities of our resources and the standards of living that we and our newcomers expect to experience in Australia. Of course, we will never forget our humanitarian obligations. These bills give ministers the ability to properly plan for the numbers coming to our shores. They reduce the potential for cheating the system and in doing so acknowledge our intention to do all we can to ensure a positive migration experience for all new Australians. I commend the bills to the House because through these bills all Australians, new and old, can better reach their full potential.",152
358,Mr MARTIN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Cunningham) (2.12 p.m.)Today we are debating the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996, the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill 1996 and the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996. In the course of several days-dare I say weeks now--of debate on this particular package of legislation we have tended to allow debate to run fairly wide and to canvass a number of issues concerning Australia's broad migration program and policies associated with immigration. I would similarly like to make some comments about that, but before I do so I again would like to indicate to the House where the opposition stands in respect of these three bills and some of the reasons for opposing some of the initiatives which are contained within them. There is no doubt that anyone reasonably expects that any government should have the right, and indeed has the responsibility, to establish appropriate targets in terms of levels of immigration into their own country and they should do so armed with appropriate knowledge. They should do so based on previous patterns of immigration to Australia; they should do so on the basis of compassion and they certainly should do so on the basis of economic need in the country. This particular piece of legislation, in terms of the principal bill, tries to roll together a number of charges which will apply now to individuals that wish to migrate to Australia. They are, in fact, looking to roll together the migration health service charge, the English education charge and the visa application fee into the one all-embracing charge. The opposition has already indicated that we will oppose the increase in the English education charge but we will certainly not oppose the other elements that are rolled into this area. The interesting thing is that, in the budget, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) announced that there should be a two-stage increase to the charge. He said that the first would come into effect on 1 October, taking the charge from $2,205 to $4,405, and this was to be done by amendments to the migration regulations. I am sure honourable members will recall that the opposition, with the support of the minor parties and the Independents in the Senate, succeeded in disallowing that particular regulation amendment. The second stage was to take the charge to $5,500 per person and this required legislative amendment. That is why this bill is before the House. It is unfortunate the government continues to choose not to separate the English education charge element of the bill so that we could do what we have indicated we would like to do, and that is to oppose just that element. The manner in which this bill has been drafted unfortunately makes that approach impossible. Also, it is fair to say that we on this side of the House believe that we would be inconsistent and not true to policies which we have always believed in not to proceed with opposing this particular part, because it would obviously supersede what was done in the Senate in respect of the disallowance motion. The issue really is the need for these sorts of charges. The issue goes to this government's philosophical belief in user pays and recouping costs, indeed with a slight margin on those costs, of any applica1958 tions whether they be for visas, learning English or whatever. The broader concept associated with the English language element of this particular part of the bill goes to a need to give full recognition to why newly arrived migrants, many of them from non-English speaking backgrounds, need to be assured that their ability to learn English or at least to get a working knowledge of English will not be impeded in any way. This has been an element which has been raised on a number of occasions. Indeed, I well remember in government writing to successive ministers for immigration about the work of the adult migrant education service in Wollongong and stating to ministers, on behalf of that organimake sation and various community groups in the Illawarra, that the number of hours of English language training made available to people who met the requirements, once they had migrated to this country, was believed to be not an appropriate level; they thought it was a number of hours which did not get them to a working knowledge of English. There were always approaches being made to try to remedy that situation. I am afraid one of the great failures of our government was that we were never able, certainly those of us that were making representations to relevant ministers, to change that attitude. The bureaucrats always had the view that 510 hours was all you needed and that, if you came to Australia from a country of a nonEnglish speaking background, 510 hours would fix you up and you would be right to take your place in the work force and live a normal life in Australia. Obviously at the time it had an impact on budgetary considerations, just as will rolling into one charge this particular amendment to the bill. But I am not sure necessarily whether, as in this case, economics should always drive some of the policy prescriptions of governments-I do not care whether it involves those that presently occupy the treasury bench or indeed us when in government. The second element of the legislation goes to repealing section 87 of the Migration Act to enable the minister, among other things, to limit or cap the number of spouse, aged parent and dependent child visas that can be granted each year. We on this side have already indicated that we will oppose the capping of these visas, because we believe it is not an immigration issue per se. We believe that this particular measure violates the right of every Australian-whether such an Australian has been a citizen for a day or six generations-to marry the person of their choosing, to be with their dependent children and to meet the responsibility of caring for their aged parents. A little bit of history often comes back to bite people. In June 1989, amendments were moved and agreed to by the then minister to it absolutely plain that no interpretation could be construed that these same visas could be capped under the Migration Act. Interestingly at the time-l June 1989-the now minister for immigration, in Hansard, said: I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through the year, 'We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia-no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents'. I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups. Well, Minister, what changed your mind? What has changed your mind since you were on this side· of the parliament-before you hopped over to that side of the parliament and into government? Suddenly you are doing the exact opposite to what you said you would do. When in opposition you argued the cogent argument to do the exact opposite to what you are doing now. I was interested in some of the arguments being put by the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) in her contribution with regard to this. She was talking from a family party perspective-from the perspective of the Liberal and National parties, who trumpeted themselves during the last election campaign as being a family friendly party. This was going to be the party that was going to right the wrongs that the dreadful Labor Party had done. If you were a good family person, you would be looked after. The only trouble is that, if you happen to be a family person living in Australia but your spouse is overseas, this particular element of the legislative proposal is going to mean that you may not necessarily get your spouse, or your dependent children or your aged parents into Australia straight away. The member for Murray says, 'They might have to wait an extra few months.' What if the situation were reversed? I have often asked this of people in my electorate in the Illawarra-and if there is one area of Australia where you have such a diverse ethnic background of people, it is the Illawarra. The city of Wollongong has something like 86 different ethnic nationalities represented within it, and we are proud of that fact because they make a tremendous contribution to our local community in all sorts of ways. Many of them are leading business people. Many of them have contributed in a whole range of cultural activities. Many of them, through the festivals and other things that they continue to have in the Illawarra, encourage an understanding and a tolerance within the broader Illawarra and hopefully broader Australia. But what we are seeing now is this family friendly party, the government, coming along and saying to these people, 'If you happen to have a parent that is overseas or you happen to have children that are overseas or even your wife or husband is there, there is no guarantee for a period of time that they are going to be able to come into Australia.' As I say, put yourself in the reverse situation. If you were an Australian citizen who migrated to another country and the government of that country said, 'You're going to have to wait until you bring your wife over or your kids over,' how would you respond to that? I do not think you would be too happy. I know I certainly would not be. I find it quite extraordinary that we get these sorts of comments coming back. There are two major elements to this legislative change, the first one being implementing the legislative exemption to the Migration Act 1958 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to allow the minister to prescribe a twoyear cohabitation period for de facto and interdependency-that is, same sexrelationships. We have already indicated, I believe, that we will be opposing this measure as it is singling out these categories for especially harsh treatment. We believe that stricter screening and a two-year provisional visa as would apply to spouse visas would be a proper check on the bona fides of these relationships. We have supported all the government's measures designed to tighten compliance. So I do not think anybody could rightly come into this place and say that the Labor opposition has in any way diminished the government's responsibility or has not given support to the government in tightening up measures in terms of compliance. But we are concerned that this measure does seem to be somewhat discriminatory, and we would like to see the government treat it in a different way. Secondly, an amendment is being proposed to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 to allow the minister to deprive a person of Australian citizenship if the grant of citizenship was obtained as a result of knowingly committing and being convicted of migration related fraud. Obviously we will not oppose that. I do not think any member of parliament-whether from the government, the opposition or indeed the IndependentsMr Hardgrave-Which one?",155
359,Mr MARTIN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Well, let me think about that-would necessarily vote against this measure. Quite frankly, anybody who does defraud the system, whether it be in migration applications or in relation to social security any other area needs to be tracked down and made to pay the appropriate recompense. If that means deportation from Australia or being deprived of citizenship, so be it. We would not take offence to that. I indicated at the beginning of my contribution that I also wanted to comment briefly on a number of issues that have been raised more broadly in the context of consideration of the immigration debate that is still raging in some sections of the Australian community and the reasons why some of those comments are being made. It is rather interesting-I know many speakers in this debate have commented on this-that, if you trace the history of immigration into this country, you see a distinct set of waves of people coming from particular geographic areas, and that has often been based on policies of the government of the day. Of course, much has been said about the White Australia policy and the restrictions that applied there. If one takes the opportunity to look at some of the statistics available on sources of immigration, one can see very readily how that has changed. For example, in a publication by the Department of the Parliamentary Library entitled Asian Immigration a table on page 4 headed 'Settler arrivals: Top 10 source countries of birth, 1965-66 to 1995-96' clearly shows changes that have occurred. For example, back in 1965-66 the major contributor to levels of immigration to this country were people from the UK and Ireland, running at about 51.9 per cent. Greece contributed 10.5 per cent; Italy, 7.9 per cent; Yugoslavia, 5.6 per cent, and so it goes on. Coming as I do from Wollongong, it was interesting to find that out because that is exactly right. People were actively recruiting people in southern Europe to come to W ollongong to work in the steelworks. They offered houses, jobs and all the rest of it to people from villages, and these people are still making a tremendous contribution in the Illawarra. When we go through the table, we find that in 1975-76 certain people start moving up the table. The UK and Ireland were still at the top, but they had dropped to 32.9 per cent. People from Chile, Lebanon and Malaysia or were coming to Australia. In 1985-86 the UK contributed only 15.9 per cent of the migrants coming to this country . We see that Vietnamese, Filipinos, mainland Chinese and people from South Africa, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Malaysia and India were starting to make an impact. In 1995-96 we find that the UK had slipped into second position on the table, with its contribution down to 11.4 per cent, and New Zealand was in front. Then we had a variety of contributors from China, Hong Kong, India, Vietnam, the former Yugoslavia, the Philippines, South Africa and Iraq. This demonstrates again that this is because world circumstances change, we have taken in a lot more refugees and so on. But the point at issue in a lot of the immigration debate that has been sparked by our friend the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is how the problem of Asian immigration, as she has described it, is supposed to have impacted on this country. I suggest to the honourable member and all members in this place that they get hold of some of the research information coming from the library at Parliament House and just have a read of what it says. Separate the fact from the fiction. Members should get hold of Australia's Asian Connections: A Stocktake, which is the background paper No.9 of 1996-97. They should have a look at Asian Immigration, which is the Parliamentary Research Service current issues brief No. 16 of 1996-97, and at the research note entitled 'Asian Immigration: The Demographic Impact'. They should also have a good look at the backgrounder entitled Asian Press Reactions to Australia's Race and Immigration Debate. I tell you why they should: this information throws up some interesting information. It does separate the fact from the fiction. For example, take Asian immigration generally. The demographic impact is explained in the research note which states: Australia's population has been changed by immigration more than that of any comparable country: 23 per cent of Australia's population is overseasborn compared with 15 per cent of Canada's and 9 per cent of the USA's. Forty per cent of the Australian population are migrants or have parents who were migrants. As at June 1995,4.8 per cent of the estimated resident population was born in an Asian countryI repeat: 4.8 per cent; does that sound like we are being overrun?and with their Australian-born children, first and second generation 'Asians' comprised about 6 per cent of the population. What does that tell honourable members about some of the nonsense being peddled by people like the honourable member for Oxley? It is nonsense. I happen to be the son of a migrant, but I probably do not qualify. Why? Because myoid man came from New Zealand and, because I have the sort of skin that suntans pretty damn well, I might be classified, as far as the member for Oxley is concerned, as a candidate for being exported back. But it is just so much nonsense in that the facts and the fiction seem to be all messed up. The talkback radio hosts, the bigots who live in some parts of this country, jump on this bandwagon and suggest that this countrywhich has built itself on the back of migration programs, ever since Captain Phillip arrived, I think-should suddenly tum around and say, 'Oh, there are certain things that aren't going to happen. We're being overrun by people from the north; we're being overrun by Asian hordes. Isn't it dreadful, isn't it shocking; they don't contribute, or the only thing they do contribute is that, if you are lucky, you have a Chinese restaurant in every town.' What an appalling attitude is being demonstrated by some people on this whole issue. I do not mind what people suggest about having a full, frank and meaningful discussion. But it is like any other argument. Have your facts. Do not rely on blind prejudice. Do not rely on any of the myths that are out there being pedalled by people who should know better, or interest groups that have other agendas. Do not go out there in the broader community and say to those people who are already here, who have made a contribution to Australia by virtue of their cultural background, their ethnic background and their intelligence, 'You are no longer welcome in this country.' And do not make any nonsensical comments such as, 'If you happen to want to bring in your parents, your spouse or your children, and you happen to fall into one of these categories now considered to be a nono, we certainly don't want you.' This House deserves to debate issues like this appropriately. It is one of the great failings in Australia this year that such a comment did not come from our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when it was due; and that President Clinton, when he was in this country, had to make those sorts of comments about the contribution to multicultural Australia of people coming from overseas. I have indicated where the opposition will be opposing different aspects of the migration package that is before us. Most people, I think, genuinely have concerns about the migration debate and are making appropriate, well-informed comments-and it is a pity that the member for Oxley is not here and is not one of them. (Time expired)",158
360,Mr HARDGRAVE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I am delighted to follow the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), and I congratulate him on the calibre of his contribution to this debate. There would be a couple of elements on which he and I could disagree around the edges, but I think the tone of his contribution over the last few minutes, in particular, the speaking from the heart as well as the head and the facts he used in his contribution should be noted and appreciated by all of us. I must say though, in context, I am a little sorry he did choose to try to scare some of the migrant families in my electorate with some suggestions about matters relating to family reunion, and I will address those briefly during my contribution. I think it is particularly sad to pick on Asian migrants in this country at the moment with those sorts of scare tactics at a time when they are, in so many ways, already scared and hurt and concerned, following some of the comments which have been made by the honourable member for Oxley (Mrs Hanson), who is not in the chamber at the moment. Mr Martin-Is she in the building?",159
361,Mr HARDGRA VE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,The member for Cunningham wants to know whether she is in the building. Mr Martin-She's left the building.,160
362,Mr HARDGRAVE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"She has left the building? Quite possibly so, as usual. I would like to contribute to this debate on the migration legislation today in recognition of the many migrants who live in my electorate, particularly people from Asian nations who have come to Australia by choice. They have come here to live and invest to ensure their children have a better future than the one had. This is a very basic tenet of so many of the different Asian cultures and the Chinese culture: to work hard and provide a better future for your children is a worthy aim. Hand in hand with this very basic tenet goes a great respect for the contributions which their parents made for their own well-being. So there is a very wonderful inter-generational support mechanism which I think, without any worry about the generalisation, typifies so many people who have a Chinese heritage. There are so many people in my electorate who have come to this country, invested here and created jobs as a result for their electorcritical ate. People like Gordon Fu should be acknowledged. There are hundreds of Australians who enjoy working for Mr Fu, and recently my local newspaper the Southern Star acknowledged his contribution. These people become Australians knowingly, willingly, and they have become great Australians as a result. They have become great advocates for our country to those relatives who remain overseas. For those who want to allege these people live in ghettos and decide they are only going to band together, I think this is an awful generalisation to make. When one considers it, it is quite understandable after coming from another country to settle in a new landit is a major decision, a major life move and one which would obviously lend itself to wanting to band together with others of similar aspirations, for a short time. I think this happened with the Greeks and the Italians after World War II, after the great southern European migration commenced to this country. It is an understandable development which passes with time. As people become more confident in their surroundings and become more welcomed by the general community, of course, they move out and get amongst other Australians; other people happily and readily accept them. I submit, until recent months, all people in my area have lived quite happily together. There has been no question, no discussion about ethnic background. Racial intolerance had been buried sufficiently beneath the surface to ensure we have had good conduct they in my local area. As I have told this House before, in recent months we have seen people spat upon and told to go home. I do not want to embellish those comments any more because I do not want a headline about it tomorrow. I would like these good people in my area and others across the country to settle down and have a good Christmas, working in harmony, as they once did. But some in my area also point to the signs which exist in shopping centres around the Sunnybank area. Part of these bills deals with matters relating to English language skills. I think it is worth pointing out to those who are of seeing Chinese writing displayed so publicly in parts of my electorate to remember it is basic marketing. If you run a restaurant, if you run the ANZ Bank or the National Australia Bank or the Westpac Bank or the Commonwealth Bank or any of the other banks which are in the area, you are naturally going to put Chinese script there to explain to customers in more familiar terms what they need to know about what they are doing in the building and how they can invest their funds. I think it is quite an awful generalisation which some have made about the paucity of English language education. But one thing is for sure: it is worth noting there are groups in my community, like Peter Low and the Cathay Club, who work very hard to ensure English is taught. There are others in the community who are working hard to integrate and to involve themselves in broader and mainstream matters in the community. The Chinese Lions Club of Brisbane based in my electorate do a great job. One of the great satisfactions to come out of this whole messy debate is it will settle down, matters will be better for the next generation, which is, in itself, satisfying to members of my local Chinese community. They are prepared to struggle to make sure their kids are in a better situation and tion comes their way. Hand in hand with all of this is the fact migrants coming to this country from another nation accept it is our sovereign right to make changes to our policies as a nation to address, in a finetuning sense, matters which come to light and other matters which need addressing. So, for all of those reasons, I am pleased speak in support of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3), which is the principal bill in a package of three bills to improve and simplify our current legislation regarding immigration and multicultural affairs. The two other bills are the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996 and the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill 1996. Through all of these bills, the government proposes to improve and simplify current legislation by amending the Migration (Health Services) Charge Act 1991, the Immigration (Education) Charge Act 1992, the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 and to merge the health service charge and the English education charge into one visa application fee. This makes it a much more streamlined approach. The incorporated fee will be administered through the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996, which is expected to be proclaimed next year. This government will also introduce greater flexibility into setting the upper limits of migrants to Australia under the different categories of the current migration program. This will be done by amending the Migration Act 1958 by repealing section 87. It will provide a better balance. I submit family reunion matters have been abused by some, although I do not know of any instance in my electorate. This bill will do something to ensure there is a bit of balance brought back into the system as far as family reunion is concerned. The ability to cap various components of the bill will mean a fair and sustainable level of immigration can be set to suit the prevailing conditions from year to year. This will include implementing the legislative exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to enable the minister to set a two-year cohabitation period for intending offshore migrants educa- who are in a defacto or interdependency relationship with an Australian citizen or lawful permanent resident. We will also see in section 21 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 a lifting of standards expected by Australia of its migrants, and the Migration Act 1958 will be amended to enable the minister to withdraw to Australian citizenship from anyone who has fraudulently obtained it. As the member for Cunningham said, I do not believe anybody in this place would dispute this part of the bill. As we all know, circumstances change. We live in a dynamic world and a sector of the world which a lot of people want to come to. It is important we are able to make changes to our migration program when they are needed and not be locked into formulas and quotas, which were a hallmark of the previous government's policies and other governments before it. Whatever our migration policy evolves into over the years, it is most important we get the very best people the world has to offer. It is no good restricting people from one part of the world or enhancing people from another. As a country-other countries respect this viewpoint-we have a right and an obligation to ensure the very best of people migrate to Australia. We cannot allow this country once more to be blinkered by those opposite to the hardtime reality which they created for us during their 13 misspent years in government. So much of what happened during that time was really more about what they wanted us to see and what they saw rather than what was needed. I am pleased the opposition will be supporting this bill in essence. There are a couple of matters they say they would like to address, and we will no doubt divide on them. Either way, I am sure both sides of this place agree flexibility is necessary in the system to ensure the future good of this country. The reality is all of the measures contained in these bills before us today not only incorporate flexibility but also are quite fair. In a slightly broader context, I want to raise some matters which were raised earlier by the honourable member for Oxley both in this debate and in her contribution to this place on 2 December. She said: ... I do not think any Australian is better or worse than any other Australian because of their race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. All I ask is that any Australian, regardless of their origin, should give Australia their full and undivided loyalty. The member also said: I am opposed to the policy of multiculturalism because history and the rest of the world show us that multiculturalism never works. It stops new citizens from giving this country, their new home, their full and undivided loyalty. I do not think anybody would disagree with the first part of what the honourable member had to say. In fact, I think we see evidence of it every day in Australia. On the concept of multiculturalism-as the honourable member for Cunningham said before-we could do with some facts. The fact of the matter is all in this place should be proud; compared with examples around the world, Australia is the very best as far as multiculturalism is concerned. The President of the United States, when he was here recently, acknowledged so much. For all of these reasons-the matters before us today and others which will come before us-we need to be on guard to ensure comments by the member for Oxley part of the policy regime. I do not see it happening in this government. I do not see it happening in this parliament. It is interesting to reflect upon the notion loyalty and love for this country which come migrants have brought with them freely and willingly over the years. It is perhaps best encapsulated in the words of the Ka-Kiu Cheung, who is a 19-year-old, Australian-born girl, of Vietnamese parents. Her parents came here after the Vietnam War. Her father Kee Cheung is a great contributor in Brisbane as well. Recently she wrote a letter, which I would like to read in this place. It sums up so much of what we are debating in this bill and so much of the spirit of the motions passed in this place relating to racial tolerance and a fair deal for all Australians regardless of their ethnic background. Ka-Kiu Cheung wrote: My father came to this country with a dream ... a dream to settle his family in a land with golden soil and wealth for toil, but more importantly, in a country which is young and free. Not only where freedom of speech would be considered a birth right, but also somewhere where he would find freedom from discrimination and from social unrest as a result of racial intolerance. I was born in this country. I attended a state primary school and a state high school and I am studying in a University. I grew up in an environment in which all were treated as equals. No one ever reminded me that my parents are migrants, that my sister and I are of migrant descent. I suppose that means that we cannot be considered as true blue Aussies. Actually, I have never had any real problems with my identity apart from the usual troubles encountered by any teenager. None of my friends ever cared whether I used chopsticks or a knife and fork at home. But this all changed when one honourable member of the Parliament made a speech based on prejudice rather than on facts. Australia, this country of mine, suddenly becomes a land where multiculturalism is a sin, migrants are people who live in ghettos, Chinese take-away cannot be consumed together with fish and chips and freedom of speech is a politically correct means for inSUlting people of a different race. And my sister and I suddenly find that we have to be tolerated, have to be accepted! Our existence on this land has to be justified and the contribution of my parents to this country scrutinised. We have become aliens in our own country. never become Ka-Kiu further says: I am totally confused and worried. I am confused about this debate on racial difference and worried that my father's dream will soon be shattered. of Please do something now because the time has to lift this nation from the quicksands of racial intolerance. It would be fatal for this country to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the impact of the recent outburst of young lady tumorous resentment. It was once said and I think fitting to say now, that in complete darkness we are all the same, it is only our knowledge and wisdom that separates us. Please do not let your eyes deceive you. I can only now leave Australia's future in your most capable hands. That, I think, is a wonderful letter. I confess to a deal of emotion over this matter when I first heard Ka-Kiu read this out a few weeks ago at a major function in my electorate. I do not see it in any way, shape or form as hyperbole to say I think it is a very emotional letter and one which goes to the heart of the hurt caused in this country in recent months. I submit that changes being put forward in this bill are quite acceptable to so many people of migrant background in this country. However, there are many big ticket items they would like to see us address and continue to address here. I read Ka-Kiu's letter into the public record for one major reason: I think it is important the records of this place do in fact reflect the viewpoints of the next generation of migrants who are already here, living in and loving Australia deeply. Her parents and her parents' friends are also very hurt by so many of the activities of the honourable member for Oxley. I guess in one sense I was pleased to see the member for Oxley make some efforts a few weeks ago to retract some of her statements, to attempt to qualify she was not meaning all Asian migrants in some of her comments. I was pleased to hear her say that because I think it was quite a concession on where she was a couple of months ago when I raised matters here relating to a couple of incidents around this building. So on that basis I would like to acknowledge perhaps the member for Oxley is starting to listen to the broader cross-section of people represented in this place. I hope matters before us today are also matters which are looked at closely by her and by all members of this House. I think it is very important, though, that everything is kept in context and the debate and the contribution from those opposite does not add to the level of hurt which is already being felt by so many people in my electorate.",160
363,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996 and related bills. I guess the nature of my electorate, which has the sixth greatest concentration of non-English speaking people in the entire country, with 34.2 per cent in my electorate born in non-English speaking countries, does mean that I have a particular interest in these policy areas. I do not want to dwell at length on the comments of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) over a broad expanse of race issues, but she did make a contribution to this particular debate and I think some of those points should be taken up. She made a simplistic comment about ghettos and the concentration of people. One would think that is something new. In actual fact, my own electorate has been characterised by this concentration for over a century. My predecessor's parliamentary secretary, Val James, once commented to me that when she went to the Granville South public school in fifth grade, that was the first time she had spoken English because she mixed amongst such a tremendous group of Welsh people that they did not speak English at home. Similarly, if you look at the history of my region, the fact that soccer was such a strong sport is clearl y related to the presence in the late 19th century of large concentrations of Scottish mechanics and people of other metal trades. Lidcombe is characterised by the presence of the Kaparty Ukranian Credit Union, by the Ukranian Catholic Church, by the Ukranian nuns, by the Ukranian Club and by the Ukranian Women's Hall. Once again, this is not novel. This is a fact of life. To start saying that somehow people are going to immediately abandon the possibility of living with people from the same homeland is just so naive that it is beyond belief. Similarly, the fact that Ukranians are prevalent in certain parts of my electorate relates very clearly to the presence at Maryland after the Second World War of a migrant hostel. Similarly, in Berala in my electorate there are concentrations of Croatians and Filipinos, which is clearly related, again, to the presence of the Catholic Church there and the fact that there was a degree of catering for those communities by the church. This thing about ghettos and people living in ethnic islands is nothing new. It has been a characteristic of this country. It is a characteristic of New York and many European countries these days. To believe that somehow it is just going to disappear tomorrow morning and we are going to be able to shift people out at gunpoint to live at Rockdale or some other suburb is just preposterous. Secondly, the member for Oxley made a simplistic comment about overseas aid; that we should get rid of overseas aid. If the member for Oxley really wanted to do something about migration pressures on this country and the refugee problem, she would know that the one thing we have to do is make sure that the foreign aid of this country, which is only 0.3 per cent of GDP-that is, threetenths of one per cent-is concentrated in areas that have clear gains for people rather than for authoritarian governments. "" There are certainly a number of categories in which aid can make a major contribution towards the unparalleled movement of people internationally-famines, forced relocations through warfare, et cetera. Foreign aid is crucial to stopping that. At the end of the day, if you analyse it, you see that it can make a major contribution to making sure that Australia is not pressured on refugee intake and is not pressured with regard to people who for economic reasons want to come to this country. Anyone who knows anything about foreign aid knows about the clear connection between women's education and decreasing population growth. If the member for Oxley-rather than sloganising and knowing the electorate does not like foreign aid and thinks it is a bad thing, et cetera-really wanted to do something about the pressures we do face in regards to population push and migration she would make sure that this country had a sizeable foreign aid program and it was directed to areas like population control, the education of women, and improving health and living standards in those countries. We all know that internationally western birth rates have declined in Japan and Europe, for example, because of the upsurge of those economies. Similarly, we have another simplistic notion from her that everyone should leave their problems behind. They should get off the boat and forget they come from Serbia, forget they come from Croatia. They should blithely go on, forgetting their relations who might have been shot dead the previous week in some pogrom in the former Yugoslavia. Once again, that is totally unrealistic. I would pose the view that it would not have been a major contribution to the history of the world if Polish and French refugees fleeing Nazi occupation went to the United Kingdom and said, 'Let's forget about what is happening in Poland. Let's forget about what is happening in France.' Quite clearly, to have this kind of view that people can forget about the need for freedom in the country they come from, forget about the fact they came to this country because they would obtain certain rights they did not possess, forget about genocide, pogroms, racial discrimination and somehow merrily go to mass every week and believe that solved the world's problems is simplistic in the extreme. What we have here is a series of very simplistic propositions. She then went on to say that we should deport everyone who was born overseas and had committed crimes in this country. Quite frankly, regardless of whether people are born here or their parents have been here 40 years or they gained citizenship five years ago, there is no real difference. These people have the same rights as those who have been here for generations. So to believe for one moment that deporting two people of Chinese extraction because they are involved in the heroin trade is going to do anything whatsoever to overcome a problem where big money is involved, where there is always that option for people regardless of their background, once again is not facing up to problems. Finally, in her contribution the member for Oxley spoke about New Zealand. The point that she makes, that a significant number of people who come into New Zealand under the target migration program are compelled to speak English and have to return money if they fail, is accurate. But I think we should, once again, look at this issue on a broader front. She is throwing up to us that New Zealand has the solutions. Quite frankly, if you have a look at migration policy in that country, one would find a number of areas of the concern for the people of this country. One of the most blatant areas of concern in recent years-and this has been pushed by our own tourist industry for commercial purposes-is the move by New Zealand to become visa free on a selective basis for a number of countries. One of the things Australia has had for many years is a regime of visas to basically decrease the possibility of illegal overstay and to give the government some control over the people coming here. New Zealand, this glorious example that is held up to us, has selectively abolished visas. In the long term that creates some pressure on our country. Similarly, anyone who has followed refugee policy in this country or had any interest in it would know that one of the push factors that we had, particularly after the Rabuka coup in Fiji, was the reality that people were easily winning through the New Zealand refugee intake and thereby a few years later coming here after gaining New Zealand citizenship. The other very clear difference between the two countries is that New Zealand is not a great magnet for permanent migration. It is not an attractive destination for most overseas people. The clear difference between the countries when we start comparing them is the nature of the political population. Australia does have currently a high proportion of people born in non-English speaking countries. Whether the member for Oxley likes it or not, in any democratic system they are going to have some say in the process, they are going to have some impact on what kind of migration policy we have. New Zealand does not have that reality. It is very difficult a sustained argument as to why this should be the be-all and end-all for us. In summary, as I say, the contribution of the member was a basic collection of slogans, a collection of appeals to the populist, a collection of broad comments that have very little to do with this bill and to do with migration in general. In speaking to this bill, I do want to canvass the wider issues of migration. I do that, as I say, because my electorate is characterised by a very high proportion of people from non-English speaking backgrounds. I have to say that one of the worse outcomes of the comments of the member for Oxley is that there is great difficulty now in having a legitimate debate about migration and population policy in this country. Unfortunately, on the one side, there has been an element of political opportunism, catering for those elements in the electorate who do have these biases and, on the other side of the fence, there has been an inability to face up to the need for a total review of a number of the rules and regulations. I would like to cite comments by Gary Freeman in an article 'Modes of immigration politics in Liberal democratic states', International Migration Review-winter 1995. He said: The institutional and social framework within which immigration policy is developed in the English-speaking settler societies produces client politics, the mode predicted by the model. Policy is normally created within a tightly constrained subsystem largely out of public view and with comparatively little broad debate. There is a minimum of conflict, and policy change occurs incrementally and infrequently. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA",163
364,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"by leave-I apologise for being unable to remain for the special adjournment debate. As I think honourable members would be aware, there is to be an election in Western Australia. As I am taking the last commercial plane out later this afternoon, I will not be able to join in the normal Christmas round. I have asked my deputy, to see Gareth Evans, to do a few more things for me, but there are people whom I ought to acknowledge and thank for their services and wish them all the best for the New Year and the Christmas season. I must say that I have done this fairly frequently as Leader of the House. This is the first time that I have actually done it from this side of the chamber. The people to thank and wish all the best for the New Year are much the same whichever side you do it from. Firstly, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to pass on those thanks and good wishes to the Speaker. The Speaker is always celebrated on election by moving to that chair flanked by two of his friends. The original speakers, of course, went into the chair flanked by three or four of their enemies. It is from those times that the tradition extends and, as a factor in that, many speakers did not serve out their full terms. Indeed, they found themselves incarcerated in the Tower of London. Life has got a bit easier for speakers since then, but not much. It is a tough job to do and we thank you for it. From the opposition's side, we appreciateeven more, probably, than we did in government-the service that comes from the clerks. To Lyn Barlin and his colleagues, we offer our thanks. We hope they have a restful period over the Christmas season. I always did believe that Lyn and the other clerks did their work impartially-and now I know it. It is now a matter of knowledge as well as an assumption that that was the case. They do a terrific job for all of us. Mr Speaker having resumed the chair",165
365,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I am afraid you will have to read my felicitations. They were detailed, they were obsequious, they were grovelling, and they were so sincerely meant.",166
366,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Why do you think I came out of hibernation?,166
367,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"And they put you in proper historical context as well. Again, please do have a happy Christmas and a fruitful New Year. I want to thank also all the parliamentary staff, the attendants, for the support they give us. We are well served in this place. They are a group of dedicated people. I always like to add to them the guides, as well, who do such a fine job in displaying, along with the attendabout ants, this-Australia's No.1 tourist attraction. A great deal of work has to be done by them both to service ourselves and our constituents, who have every right to tum up here in numbers and see how we do business at this-the focal point of Australian democracy. I want to thank, too, first on the government side, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) for the consultation from time to time on the process of business in the place. I happen to know that his is an enjoyable job. I have probably, in the nine months since the election, not had time to miss much from my previous incarnation in this place, but this week I have because this is a great week, generally, for leaders of the house. This is when you actually feel you earn your money-and you do at this time of the year. I wish you all the best. The same goes for your supporters in the government, the chief whip, his deputies and staff. I want to thank from the other side of the House for the first time, Jeannie Hall, the PLO, and the work that she does in the place. I will say not much more about that, because I know that the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) will probably have a bit to say when it comes to his tum. We thank also thank Lindsay Youman, who is having his last day here today before going to work in the visit section of PM&C. We thank him for his good work in arranging the tabling of papers each day. I understand that his very proud mother is in the gallery today, and Susan. I want to thank the Bills and Papers Office staff, the Table Office and research staff; the Serjeant-at-Arms, David Elder, and Dalma Dixon and their helpful staff; the Hansard staff; the House of Representatives transport staff and all the other House of Representatives staff, including the printing staff and, above all to us in opposition, the Parliamentary Library and the research staff, who are so helpful to all of us. To them go all our grateful thanks and best wishes for the season. When we went into opposition and took a look at the ratios of usage of the parliamentary staff, we started to realise that, apart from our own staff-I will say a thing or two them later on-they are, of necessity, enormously helpful to the opposition in keeping us informed about the complex nature of government and supporting our activities. They do of course act impartially, but the ministry at least has the advantage of an enormous bureaucracy behind them, and that does not apply to oppositions. Our thanks go, too, to the Joint House staff, particularly Marlene Armstrong and her wonderful telephonists who are the gateway for so many people contacting this parliament; the cleaning staff; the maintenance staff; the gardeners; the marketing and visitors staff; the health and recreation staff; the shop operators; the bank staff; the Qantas office staff; the hairdresser; the staff at Aussie's cafe, which is under new management, and all the other Joint House staff. This building used to have associated with it some 2,000 to 3,000 people. I have lost touch with what the numbers were, but it takes a very big operation to keep us all going. Most of us do not see it from day to day, but the smooth functioning in this place is completely dependent upon them. The Comcar drivers, too, I want to particularly thank. I wish them a secure future as well as a happy Christmas and New Year. I realise, however, that their fate is not in our hands. We are merely their advocates and we strongly advocate their survival because of the wonderful work that they do for all of us. I, too, would extend Christmas greetings to, in his absence-I understand that it is very recently so--the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). I congratulate them on the position in which they find themselves. It is a position of very great trust. They and their ministerial colleagues need a restful season. From what I recollect of my own time 13 years ago when I first became a minister, I was an absolute mug around Christmas time. I took no time off and devilled away. As the years go by-or the two years left to them-it really does help to have a decent Christmas and I would strongly advise them to take advantage of it. For this season, even in the middle of war, I do formally declare a truce. On 25 December on our side of the House we will not be shooting. What you choose to do is a matter entirely for you, but we will not. There will be a Christmas truce and, in that spirit, I wish you all the best for it. I single out nobody really on our opposition front-bench or backbench. As government members, no doubt you will all have a celebratory time much the same as ours. I notice myoid sparring partner, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), here. We are waiting desperately for that diplomatic appointment, old son! We are hoping you will have many happy returns this year, as you leave this place. I did participate some time ago in a National Party send off. That was about three years ago and you are still here. You are soldiering on forever. You would have been pleased with the proceedings this morning when that wonderful resolution that you invented and was employed so diligently by me was employed for the first time by the new Leader of the House (Mr Reith) in making absolutely certain that democracy does not prevail here, at least for a time. As the inventor of many of the worse features in the standing orders, you can sit around this place and be proud of your work from time to time. I have left my own team until last. Of course, it is for them that I have the most hopes for this season and the New Year. They have been a terrific team. After 13 years in government, to be the team that has to carry a party into opposition is an extraordinarily difficult task. When the public vote to change the government, whether they change from our side to our opponents, as they have this time, or from them to us, as it was 13 years ago, the people who actually form the opposition in the immediate aftermath of that change know what it is to be despised of men, and women for that matter. It is a period of intense disappointment, obviously, and a real intellectual and physical restructuring is required. You have to be particularly tough people to take it and particularly confident about yourselves as to your worth and the contribution you make. Generally speaking, it is a period of enormous blood-letting, dissatisfaction, blame and disappointment. Two things have meant that that has not been so for us. One has been the quality of the government left behind. Mr Reith-It's still ahead of you, mate.",166
368,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Judging by the behaviour of your colleagues and one or two others and the surveys that are going on in Victoria, I am not sure that all is well in your house. Judging by the amount of leaking that is going on so early in the government, I am even more convinced that there may be a problem or two there. But, anyway, that is not really for these valedictories. This is supposed to be an entirely gracious occasion, and I have not been entirely gracious. So I will stop that line of prattle. There are two things that you need: firstly, pride in the record and, secondly, you need a particular experience, intellectual resilience and toughness. We have all got it and it is best preserved by a decent restful period and an opportunity to spend some time with your families. I go back to that historical record. The first resignation that we had on our side of this parliament was our previous leader, Paul Keating. I had a thing or two to say at the time and, of course, in the Christmas valedictories last year, and I put it on the record again. When he left this place, and was so well replaced with our new member, he walked out with a great Australian political career behind him, one of great reform, one of great length-he was here for a very long time, given the average length of service of each member of parliament here is about seven years-and one of great pride. I know he doesn't bother to read Hansard any more, but I hope someone will draw my remarks to his attention. I mention another person we have lost on our side-John Langmore. I said a deal about him in the House the other day and will not repeat it here, but I know there will be one or two who will take advantage of the actual special adjournment motion to mention him further. Again, I acknowledge the passing of Don Dobie, whom we had a deal to say about. People who live very closely in our memory who pass on so quickly after leaving parliament are a reminder of the enormous stress that we work under. I want to single out one or two from my own team. Firstly, I want to single out my deputy, Gareth Evans, who was arguably Australia's greatest foreign minister and who has a deal of work now. It has to be said that the Foreign Affairs building is not named after you, Gareth. I think it ought to be. Maybe one day that will be corrected. Irrespective of whether or not it is corrected, the fact is that you have a lecture theatre named in your honour there. You should know this: there is a rule in the American navy that no warships may be named after living sailors. It must be a real indication of the distinction of your service that at least part of the warfighting activity that goes on over at Foreign Affairs has your name planted on the top of it. As a person who contributes in the policy area, Gareth is absolutely unsurpassed and his leadership qualities in this nation are well known. My thanks also extend to the man who carries the weight for us in this House on a day-today and minute-by-minute basis-that is, our Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean). If anyone has taken to opposition like a duck to water, it is him. Mr Crean-I am going to duck back, you know.",168
369,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am positive that you can and that you will get your opportunity. The simple fact of the matter is that all the psychological requirements of going into opposition manifest themselves in many ways most fulsomely in the way in which you have been able to operate in this place, Simon, and that is terrific. Thanks go too to our oldest warhorse-Leo. Mr Leo MCLeay-Thanks for nothing!",168
370,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,There is not an elementMr Leo MCLeay-I'm two years older than you.,168
371,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Is that all! There is not a part of the political process which Leo has not been through, over, understood thoroughly and worked an angle out on. Mr Cadman may yet tum into this, but he is not there yet. Leo is actually one of the few whips I have seen operating in the British tradition of whip in the operation of this place. If you know something about the British House of CommonsMr Costello-Fish-net stockings!",168
372,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Oh, no! You couldn't possibly have said that! Because this is that time of the year, I will resist the opportunity to take extraordinary advantage of that. Having done him over by putting him upfront on the dream team, to drive the nail in with that was a terrible thing to do. But you will no doubt make up for it with your Christmas card! The British tradition of whips is of a person deeply engaged in the political process, not just in a numbers exercise. One of the reasons why we now have chief whips on both sides of the House, which is more in the British tradition, is because of Leo's diligent advocacy against a notable opponent-that is, the previous Prime Minister!-for elevation to that status. But it was the correct position to assume. Grateful for it are your able assistants, Rod and Ted, who also do a terrific job in keeping our end of the Main Committee going, apart from all the other work here, which is a very important thing for them to do. I should mention the caucus chair and officer bearers, who keep us going as well. The chair is one of our long-serving members, maybe even our longest serving member.",169
373,Mr MELHAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, with Ralph.",169
374,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, that is right. Mr Morris is one of those people I like to describe as a genuine parliamentarian, a professional parliamentarian and a most effective chairperson of caucus. He has improved caucus language no end since he took over, which has certainly made exchange less robust, if somewhat less colourful. ",169
375,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"It is more effective. It is certainly more expeditious. There are no two ways about that. He does a terrific job. I should thank all of those on the front-bench who have performed and will perform such Herculean tasks this year and over the next two. They have to uniquely drive policy. There is no-one else to drive it when you are in opposition but the front-bench. I do thank them. I thank all my caucus colleagues and the staff of caucus. I should mention Joan Connor-who deserves the wonderful holiday she is to commence tomorrow in ThailandKaren and all of Ted's staff. I want to thank the staff of my colleagues and my own staff. One of the undertakings that we gave our staff when we appointed them was that, when we resume government, we will be loyal to them. We expect a high standard of performance from them and they will get a high standard back from us when it comes to the question of treatment. We do thank them for all the effort that they perform. My own staff includes the people who work for me here in Canberra and also those in my electorate office in Perth, who keep the home fires burning. The right honourable member for New England did point out to me that leaders of the opposition spend a fair amount of time in the east. That is absolutely correct. What I had not realised when I took this job is that the Labor Party in Western Australia is a weekday party; all its meetings are held on weekdays. In the eastern states it is a weekend party. This has certainly made a difference to my weekends. It is an interesting phenomenon that there should be such a cultural difference in the way in which the weekend is treated. There is therefore a requirement upon my staff in Western Australia probably greater than it has been for a while. Finally, I again thank the Prime Minister for his courtesy in allowing me to speak at this time. I wish him and his family an enjoyable Christmas. I will probably watch at least as much cricket as he does and take the same refreshment and enjoyment from it that I know he will. I think this is an appropriate time for reflection for all of us. It is a time of recommitment, too. You can get caught up in this place in a lot of the to and fro across the chamber. Sometimes in that process you forget why you are here. You never forget that when you are back home at Christmas time-when you do the rounds of the parties and when you go into your electorate on a non-proselytising basis, on your normal shopping duties and all the rest of it. I certainly believe that all my colleagues here deserve a most restful Christmas. I know that they are going to get it, because there are instructions out that they should. This is a time when we can afford it. Your families will certainly enjoy it enormously. I thank my family for the support they gave me during the year. I am sure I speak on behalf of people on both sides of the House, but I must speak for our own here when I say that we are all tremendously grateful to our families. This is a useful occasion on which to record their generally cheerful-not necessarily on a Friday night-long-suffering that they are obliged to experience and undergo to keep us all here in a reasonable state of fitness and happiness. Again, Mr Speaker and Leader of the House, thank you for the opportunity to speak on this matter today. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",169

377,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I understand it is the wish of the House to consider the amendments together. Mr Crean-That is not the understanding, Mr Speaker. There has been no agreement on that point. There are cross-portfolios involved in this, and we want to deal with each of the items one by one.",170
378,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I move: That amendment No. 1 be agreed to. The Senate has passed a number of amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3). The government will not be opposing the amendments in the House. Mr Crean-Or any of them?,170

If I were you, I would have got all of the donations that you have been seeking on the back of your opposition to those matters beforeMr Crean-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I ask that he withdraw that because there have been no donations solicited by me. If he wants to make a substantive motion, let him move it. Withdraw it!",171

383,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"For what? Mr Crean-I ask him to withdraw the suggestion that I have been pursuing amendments in the parliament to solicit donations. That is the allegation he has been making sneakily and surreptitiously for the last three days. He has deliberately made it, and I ask him to withdraw it.",171
384,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I invite the Treasurer to withdraw.,171
385,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"If the shadow minister is so upset about it, in order to proceed I will expenses? withdraw it. Mr Crean-Withdraw unconditionally!",171

389,Mr MELHAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Point of order, Mr Speaker!",171
390,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"He had a couple of prefatory comments, but he withdrew comprehensively.",171
391,Mr MELHAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"He didn't, Mr Speaker, with respect. On a point of order",171
392,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, he did. I am happy with the withdrawal.",171
393,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The first amendment relates to a budget measure to increase the threshold on the medical expenses rebate from $1,000 to $1,500. The government will be reintroducing this measure next year as an amendment to the government's package of bills relating to incentives to encourage private health insurance. This measure will have the same date of effect as announced in the budget-that is, from the 1996-97 income year.",171
394,Mr LATHAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Werriwa) (3.26 p.m.}-The opposition is pleased to support Senate amendment No. 1 to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) and disappointed to hear that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is planning to reintroduce the provision in another piece of legislation next year. That means that he will continue to punish the chronically ill and the disabled in Australia, because it is those Australians who are being targeted for the bulk of the $25 million saving that was outlined in the budget. This provision means that the 20 per cent rebate on out-of-pocket health expenses will not be payable to those who have expenses not less than $1,500. The safety net had been set at $1,000. It is those disabled and chronically ill Australians who most frequently apply for the rebate on their out-of-pocket health expenses. Why would they not apply for the rebate on their out-of-pocket health It is those chronically ill and disabled Australians who most often have to face the gap payment between what many doctors charge and the official rebate. It is not surprising that their out-of-pocket expenses might exceed $1,000. Now when they exceed $1,000 but do not get beyond $1,500, the Treasurer and the Howard government do not have them eligible for their 20 per cent rebate. This is a government that can find half a million dollars to upgrade Kirribilli House for the convenience of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Mr Lee-And to move the Speaker's chair.",171
395,Mr LA THAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"This is a government that can provide half a million dollars to move the old Speaker's chair to this Parliament House. This is a Treasurer who can find $50 million to $80 million each year for tax concessions for tollway companies and big banks building tollways, but it is not a government that can find $25 million to assist those chronically and disabled people in Australia who call on that safety net provision for their out-ofpocket health expenses. The other thing I note is the Treasurer's announcement to the House that the government is planning to support each of these seven Senate amendments. Whatever happened to Ted Tough who would stand up to the Senate under every circumstance? Whatever happened to the Treasurer who just a few weeks ago was talking about increased taxes when it came to Senate amendments? Whatever happened to the Treasurer who was talking about double dissolutions when it came to Senate amendments? Whatever happened to Ted Tough Treasurer who would take on the Senate under any circumstance? He has turned from a raging mongrel dog to a little puppy dog when it comes to these Senate amendments now before the House of Represen tati ves. Mr Bevis-Pit bull terrier to poodle.",172
396,Mr LA THAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"That is right, he has gone from bull terrier to cocker spaniel when it comes to these Senate amendments. Why? Is it because he does not have the race button on his keyboard to push in terms of media coverage? A few weeks ago, when the Senate was moving amendments to legislation covering newly arrived migrants, it was page 5 or page 7 news. The Treasurer wanted to get it up on the front page. He wanted to push the race button and get those provisions on the front page, so he threatened increased taxes to get those provisions up on the front page, to push the race button in Australian politics. On the next day, not content, it was on for a double dissolution. But here he is today, bull terrier turned cocker spaniel, saying to the House of Representatives that he is going to approve all of the seven important amendments passed in the Senate last night. He is only doing that because he cannot find the race button on his keyboard of base politics. When he cannot push the race button, he is willing to support Senate amendments. The Labor Party notes these things. At a ill time of the year when people are reflecting on the year past and at a time of the year when the Treasurer should be reflecting on political morality, he should understand the hypocrisy of how two weeks ago he was a marauding opponent of Senate amendments. Two weeks ago, on the question of newly arrived migrants, he was a marauding opponent of Senate amendments, willing to threaten double dissolutions and taxation increases. Here the Treasurer is today, on the last day of the parliamentary year, wandering into meekly accept seven amendments carried in the Senate last night. It is a shameful thing that a government guides its principles and its voting habits according to race, according to whether or not he can get the race issue up on the agenda, according to whether or not he can press the race button to tum a page 7 story into front-page news. That is the immorality the Treasurer should reflect on this Christmas. Mr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The issue raised by the member for Werriwa is totally unrelated to the proposed amendments. I ask you to ask him to keep on the topic which we are discussing.",172
397,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Andrew)The member for North Sydney makes a valid point of order. I did not, in fact, interrupt the member for Werriwa because he had on a number of occasions related what he was saying, though tenuously, back to the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative.",172
398,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like you to note then, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the opposition voted against that amendment. I would like it recorded in the Hansard that the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) called 'no' on that amendment, meaning that the Manager of Opposition Business then called 'no' on the Senate's amendment not to proceed with the reduction, not to proceed with the change in the threshold. Mr Latham-Read the Hansard, and what I said, because I supported it.",172
399,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I am afraid that the opposition just voted against the amendment. I would like that to be recorded in Hansard.,173
400,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Mr Andrew)I think Hansard would have recorded the Treasurer's comments. The Treasurer has the call.,173
401,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,The second amendment relates to mining rights. Mr Crean interjecting,173
402,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Order! The member for Hotham. The Treasurer has the call. Mr Crean-He is baiting me.,173
403,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,The Treasurer has the call. The member for Hotham knows better than he does. I do not like your interjection.,173
404,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,The second amendment relates to transitional provisions for the removal of a paragraph. I move: That amendment No.2 be agreed to. The second amendment relates to transitional provisions for the removal of paragraph 23PA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This amendment will ensure that the market value of rights to mine accrued prior to the date of the government's announcement are protected.,173
405,Mr LATHAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Werriwa) (3.33 p.m.)Again, the opposition is pleased to support Senate amendment. It was, in fact, moved by Senator Cook in the Senate. We again note the radical change in the rhetoric of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). There was no talk today of Senate obstruction, no talk today of the need for tax increases, no talk today of the threat of a double dissolution, no use today of the race button on the keyboard of politics. That is why the government has so comprehensively changed its tune. When it cannot find Mark Textor's race button on the keyboard of Australian politics it, of course, sings a very different tune. Mr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is just outrageous. He keeps talking about this so-called race button. It is totally unrelated to the proposals before the House at the moment, and I ask you to rule him out of order.",173
406,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Andrew)There is no point of order. I have already reminded the member for Werriwa that I was alert to his comments on the previous amendment, and I invite him to draw his remarks appropriately to the amendment before the House.",173
407,Mr LA THAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"This House frequently has debates about Senate amendments, as the House should. I just draw to the attention of the House that this is a provision concerning miners, mainly in the state of Western Australia. The government's rhetoric, attitude, threats and voting pattern are very different to the matter before the House and the Senate just a few weeks ago on newly arrived migrants. I would have thought an active opposition would be interested-as an alert media gallery would be interested-in that particular double standard. Why is it that on an issue concerning miners, mainly in the state of Western Australia, there is no threat of a double dissolution, there is no threat of a tax increase, there is no threat of all the sorts of drama of which the Treasurer spoke just a fortnight ago? Why the double standard? Why is the political language so different for miners in Western Australia compared to newly arrived migrants? I would have thought the House could understand the point I am the making and the House would accept the conclusion I have drawn-that it is about the various buttons that are placed on the keyboard of the government and its political morality. On this provision concerning mining rights, mainly in the state of Western Australia, I note the views that Senator Cook provided to the Senate when moving the amendment last night. I note his words that related to the fact that the Senate amendment is to wipe out the retrospective nature of the original provision and, also, that the Senate amendment will greatly assist the small mining companies which do the bulk of mining exploration Australia. Without that exploration and the activities of those smaller mining companies, of course, there would be no mining in Australia. I support the words and intent of Senator Cook in the Senate just yesterday. urge the government to tidy up its double standards and the very different type of political rhetoric we hear on issues as diverse as miners and newly arrived migrants. Question resolved in the affirmative.",173
408,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I move the third and fourth amendments, relating to deductions for cooperative companies. Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the Treasurer is simply seeking to make comments in relation 3 and 4 and not speak again, that is fine by us. But if he is suggesting that we should dealing with both 3 and 4 in a composite motion, we will not agree to that. That has not been talked about between our officers. There is a difference between them. We the opportunity to debate both points. I simply seek a ruling from you that we will be allowed to do that.",174
409,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Mr Andrew)I seek the Treasurer's guidance on whether he is prepared to move those amendments separately.,174
410,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I will move them separately if the opposition wants that to occur.,174
411,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I thank the difficult Treasurer.,174
412,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I move: That amendment No.3 be agreed to. The context of the Taxation Laws Amendmeasures ment Bill (No.3) 1996 is that it makes major savings for the government. The government has succeeded in achieving major savings from closing down R&D syndication and the rorting that was involved in that. Mr Crean-We'll get to that.,174
413,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"We will get to that in both due course. This is a government that took position that it was important that all bers of the community pay their fair tax. That in is why we moved against R&D syndication. In the context of that bill, the major savings measures which have been accepted by the industry Senate in relation toMr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a I point of order which is consistent with that being raised by the government benches in relation to our speakers. It goes to the relevance of the detail before the House. We are specifically on the issue of cooperatives, not on other aspects of the bill. Mr Deputy if you are going to draw our attention to it, do it to the Treasurer.",174
414,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I remind the member for Hotham that the chair has actually been very accommodating up to this point. The Treasurer has agreed to deal with amend to both ment No.3. I call the Treasurer.,174
415,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,You must have had a be very bad night's sleep. This government wants to see the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996 go through and go through today. That is why we are accepting all the want amendments. The substance of this billMr Crean-You got rolled.,174
416,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,This bill delivered major savings to the government of the order of $600 million to $700 million in one year in relation to research and development and other measures. Mr Crean-You got rolled.,174
417,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Order! The member for Hotham will find it much more to participate in the debate outside the chamber.,174
418,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The Senate has objected to measures in relation to cooperatives. The government is prepared to accept those as put in place by the Senate because we want to secure the passage of the bill. It is very important that the passage of this bill be secured. It will be secured, notwithstanding the opposition of the Labor Party today. I point out that, in relation to this debate, sides of the House are in agreement. It the might surprise you, but I am moving that memthese amendments be accepted. The opposition, notwithstanding what it said in relation to the first amendment, is supporting me. a very small price to pay to allow various members of the opposition to get up and vent their spleen. This is a price we are prepared to pay. We are quite prepared to have all the insults that make their lives happy thrown across the table-not that it gives them any dignity-because this is an important bill to be secured. We intend to secure the bill today. We will agree to all these amendments so that it will not have to go back to the Senate but will be passed into law.",174
419,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"It is interesting that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) now says that we are supporting him; in fact, he is supporting us. This was the amendment that we moved in this House that he opposed. Don't you remember that? The fact of the matter is he has been rolled. He does not like admitting it. That is why he would prefer to have all these amendments put into one and debated together. He does not like humiliation. He is not a man that takes to being done easily. He has already been done by the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) in the leadership stakes. Now he has been done by the Senate. We could have given him some friendly advice. If you had accepted our amendment on cooperatives when we last moved it, you would not have had to suffer this humiliation. In the Senate last night the government was finally held accountable for its betrayal of regional Australia. The Labor Party has delivered a huge win for regional cooperatives. It was the Labor Party which ensured the cooperatives' tax deduction for government loans was retained. And not one National Party member voted with us-not one. We had some threatening to cross the floor. The gag was moved to make sure they could not cross the floor. But not one of them crossed the floor-not in here, because of procedural motions, and not in the Senate. While Ron Boswell was ringing us on the phone, cheering us on and saying, 'You stick with your amendments because this is a bad decision for rural cooperatives,' he still did not vote us the other day. You can see Senator Boswell, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, over there thinking he would like It is to come over to our side. He would dearly love to be able to say, 'I backed cooperatives. ' I can see the pretender to the leadership of the National Party keeping his head down on this. He has got something to read. It is the next car he is going to buy. He wants to avoid this discussion. He is reading a brochure on new models of cars. They talk about members on this side in cars. But here is the pretender leaderMr Sharp--What about your Rolls Royce?",175
420,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Oh, here he is! We have engaged him in debate now. He wants to talk about Rolls Royces. Rolls Royces indeed! These are the cars you are looking to. But he will not engage in this debate because he knows",175
421,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Mr Andrew)The member for Hotham did ask me to draw the Treasurer's attention back to the amendment. I do the same thing with him.,175
422,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"It is the debate, because the National Party have sold out rural Australia.",175
423,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,That was not the comment I was referring to.,175
424,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware of that sell-out. I am sure that you, amongst others in this place, support what the Labor Party pursued in relation to cooperatives, and that was ensuring that they kept the tax deductibility that kept them in the game. It kept them in the game of value adding, it kept them in the game of the food market to Asia strategy that this government is so proud about and it kept them in the game of being able to expand. But who kept them in the game? Labor. Not the government, not the National Party, but Labor. Labor kept them in the game because we insisted that this amendment be opposed, and we have succeeded. But the question that has to be asked is, 'For how long have we succeeded?' The Treasurer, cocky still---cocker spaniel still maybe; but cocky still-has come into this with place .saying that he will now accept the amendment. That is code for, 'We will move on this next time we get the chance. In the next budget, we'll bring it back again.' So I urge all of those on the National Party side and those who represent rural seats such as the member for Murray (Mrs Stone), who won the seat from the National Party. Murray has given up on the National Party. How many other seats are going to give up on the National Party? And why shouldn't they if the National Party continues to sell them out? The member for Murray should take cognisance of the Treasurer's cocky words. She should recognise that, whilst we have had a victory now-and only because Labor persisted-that victory could well be short lived.",175
425,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Order! I invite the member for Swan to conduct his business outside of the chamber, thank you.",176
426,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Swapping wine up there, are they? It is probably from a cooperative-a cooperative that they are now prepared to put out of business if they persist with this motion.",176
427,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Order! I am endeavouring to keep some sense of order in the chamber.,176
428,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"So we have a very significant victory here. The real issue is for how long. The Treasurer has signalled today that he will move against cooperatives. We will oppose that in future and keep opposing it, and we will keep rolling you. (Time expired)",176
429,Mr LATHAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"No wonder the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has had to seek out wine on the back bench after the humiliation of being rolled so comprehensively by the Senate. He said he was going to sit here and take his medicine from the Labor Party today, but five minutes later he is up there swapping glasses of wine on the back bench. He is having a rough day. Section 121 C of the Income Tax Assessment Act provides a deduction to cooperative companies for the repayment of new government loans. The Labor Party, in the House, supported the retention of that provision. It was opposed by the Liberal Party and the National Party. Last night in the Senate the Labor Party again insisted on the retention that part of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It was again opposed. Its retention was opposed by every single Liberal Party and National Party senator. I thought Senator Margetts-it is not often I quote the Greens (WA)-made an interesting comment when she said that she was pleased to support agrarian, small commodity capitalism. There is an interesting divide in Australian politics when it is the Labor Party and people like the Greens, the Australian Democrats and the Independent senators in the Senate who are pleased and enthusiastic to support agrarian, small commodity capitalism but it is the Liberal Party and what they used to call the National Party that are supporting Treasury talk and absolute Treasury madness. This is one of the greatest sell-outs in the history of the Country and National parties of Australia. It is not an exercise in competitive neutrality. The cooperatives do not distribute profits, so they cannot take advantage of franked dividends. These provisions have been in place for 60 years to make up for that competitive disadvantage. It is a section which levels the playing field. The Treasurer of course is now tilting it against the cooperatives-tilting it against the agricultural marketing cooperatives-and all in the name of foreign ownership. In so much of the Australian food industry there is already too much foreign ownership. The abolition of section 121C will make it very difficult indeed for those Australian owned cooperatives to survive. This is the slow death of the Australian cooperative movement, and it is not at all an exercise in competitive neutrality. The neutral thing to do in competition policy is to keep section 121C, the taxation benefits for cooperative companies, in recognition that they cannot take advantage of franked dividends on another part of the taxation ledger. So the Labor Party and the other parties in the Senate have supported competitive neutrality in the true sense and application of that principle and are pleased to support agrarian, small commodity capitalism. Whatever happened to the National Party? of Whatever happened to the National Party when they had a minister, like Mr Sharp, who declared regional development within the sphere of Commonwealth responsibilities dead and buried-no funding or constitutional responsibility for regional development? Whatever happened to a National Party that no longer believes in agrarian, small commodity capitalism? In particular, where are those Queensland National Party members who have not been coming down here to vote in favour of cooperative companies, in favour of section 121 C of the Income Tax Assessment Act? They talk a lot about it, though, in their own electorates. That is the interesting thing about the Queensland Nationals: it is all talk back in their electorates but very little action and no voting power on the floor of the House of Representatives. Today in the Mackay Daily Mercury the member for Dawson (Mrs DeAnne Kelly) said: These cooperatives are one hundred per cent Australian owned. That is something to be very proud of in Australia. A cooperative has considerable disadvantages compared to a company. They are not in a level playing field situation. She went on to say: I would like to point out that the National a tradition of fighting hard for the primary industry sector and regional Australia. They are fighting so hard that they are facilitating the slow death of the cooperative movement in Australia. They are fighting so hard only by words in their own electorates and not by backing up those words with voting strength and power on the floor of the House of Representatives. Where are the Queensland National Party members in the House of Representatives today? They should be joining with the Labor Party in saying this to the Treasurer. The Treasurer outlined the government's support for the Senate amendment, but he did not rule out the possibility that in another bill next year he will bring back exactly the same provisions to abolish the taxation concessions for cooperative companies. Until the Treasurer stands up and rules out that possibility available to him, then of course cooperative companies and all their employees around Australia can have no peace of mind, have no competitive neutrality and have no guarantee about their future. (Time expired)",176
430,Mr BEVIS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The Treasurer (Mr Costello) stands here today to support these amendments only for as long as it takes him to get the numbers to roll them next year. He came along here only a matter of weeks ago when the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) was before the parliament and opposed the amendments that we moved on that occasion, which are now back before this House only because we were successful in moving them in the Senate. No-one, particularly those in rural Queensland and those involved with cooperatives, should be under any illusions about the attitude of this Treasurer and the majority of this government: when the opportunity presents itself to them in 1997 to reintroduce the earlier legislation and to remove these tax benefits, that is exactly what they will do. If the Treasurer has a differing view, some time shortly he will have the opportunity to move the next amendment, which deals with these matters. If that is not the case, let him put that clearly on the record today for those people involved in cooperatives so that they know Party has where the government stand. There was a time when the National Party used to stand up for people in provincial and rural Australia. There was a time when people could count on senators like Senator Boswell to stand out from the crowd and fight for their constituency. Senator Boswell, a person of some integrity, has done that on a number of occasions, but he has rolled over this time. When this matter was being debated in the Senate, the National Party to a person toed the line and voted to injure their own constituency. The people involved in operating these cooperatives are involved in the sugar and the small crops fruit industry. We are looking at people like Mackay Sugar, Golden Circle, Darling Downs Bacon, Capilano Honey. We are talking about small businesses that have banded together as wholly Australian owned organisations to ensure that that produce remains in Australian hands and that it can be marketed effectively across the large expanse of our country. In the past the National Party has been willing to stand up and fight for the people involved in that industry, but not anymore. We have seen the National Party, here and in the Senate, desert them. The Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) referred to the events this House when this matter was previously before it. A number of National Party memreasons bers, the home-town tough guys, like to talk tough back home but, when they have an here opportunity here to fulfil those commitments, they go to water. This is an example of that parliament. happening. Back home in Queensland-in Mackay, in Townsville, in Cairns, in Mount Isa-they talk tough about these things. They tell their constituents they are going to fight to protect their rights in the operation of their amendment. cooperatives. When they get the opportunity to do so down here, they duck for cover. That is what every National Party member in this House did-except one: the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). The member for Kennedy made it plain that he was going to cross the floor but that he had a commitment on a particular night which would take him away from the parliament. Honourable members might remember that in expired) relation to the commitment he had that conveniently took him away on that nightMr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Brisbane not talking to the amendment. He is talking about the debate on the substantive issue and it is",177
431,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Mr Andrew}- reasonable Order! That is not a valid point of order.,178
432,Mr BEVIS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"On the night the member for expressed Kennedy would not be available-I am sure he had commitments which took him away from the House-the government did everything they could until, from recollection, about midnight by using every device possible to prevent the opposition taking the matter a vote, taking our amendments to a division. They knew that come the next day, if the debate ran into the next day, they would to deal with the prospect of the member Kennedy doing-and it was quite possible he would, given the member's track recordHouse what he said he would do: voting against the government. They did not want that embarbeen rassment so they did everything they could stop the one National Party member in this place who had the conviction to support his constituencyMr Crean-Reith was absent and Costello that occurred in was in charge.",178
433,Mr BEVIS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Exactly. In fact, one of the why we went past midnight was that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) was not and it was left in the hands of the Treasurer, which resulted in a shambles in the The simple fact is that the bill now before us should have been passed weeks ago. It should have been through the Senate without Instead, it is back here because we successfully moved those amendments in the Senate. I again invite the Treasurer, when he moves the next amendment, to confirm his intentions that next year if he has the numbers he will reintroduce the bill in its old form and strip those benefits from cooperatives. We will see then what the National Party people in this parliament are willing to do. We will see whether or not a third of your government caucus room is willing to stand up-{Time",178
434,Mr OCONNOR,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Corio) (3.56 p.m.}-The acceptance by the government of the amendments in this House really represents one of is the most humiliating backdowns we have seen and a real humiliation for the Treasurer (Mr Costello). When this legislation was put to the House and when we put these amendmentsamendments that came out of the bush, came out of the rural constituency; we their concerns through this series of quite amendments-the Treasurer could have accepted them. But, no, he wanted to play rough with the Senate. And what happened? He got rolled. The big Senate steamroller rolled over the Treasurer, and now he comes to back into this House and meekly says to us, 'Well, boys and girls. I am going to accept the amendments now because I really want to have get the legislation through.' He had the for opportunity to do that some weeks ago. The original measure that was put to the by the government to remove the tax deduction that in the past cooperatives have able to claim for borrowings to purchase to assets from governments constituted yet another betrayal of regional Australia by this arrogant government, which already takes the bush for granted. It was the latest measure in a long list in the budget which sunk the boot into individual groups and into individual communities throughout the length and breadth of regional Australia. It should be clearly understood by farmers, all regional and rural communities in Australia and the residents of regional areas which gain their employment from the great regional cooperati ves in Australia that a taxation arrangement that has stood for over 60 years in support of those cooperatives was about to be destroyed by a Liberal and National Party government in this country. The National Party was prepared to roll over yet again and meekly succumb to the wishes of this arrogant Treasurer, and of course the rural Liberals went along for the ride. They went along with the original betrayal of these regions, which have suffered badly through this government and through its budget. The great rural cooperatives of this nation have formed the backbone of sustained employment and growth in rural and regional areas. They have relied on this taxation arrangement to finance the ongoing development and expansion of their businesses-and they are very important businesses to Australia. It is the great rural cooperatives of Australia that are at the forefront of Australia's export growth. They are the great valueadders. They are the great exporters. They are the great employment generators in rural areas-and those areas in the past have found difficulty in creating jobs. The rural cooperatives of Australia are, by their structure, locally owned businesses. The measure that was originally proposed by the government would have had the effect of driving cooperatives into capital raising situations that would have exposed them to takeovers by foreign companies-multinational companies who are able to borrow their funds at half the cost those cooperatives would have been able to borrow them at on Australia's financial market. What was the gain to the budget? What was the great enduring benefit of this measure? It was a paltry $12 million over three years. That was the price on the heads of those of the National Party-$12 million. They did not have the guts to come into this parliament when we moved the amendment. We threw the challenge out to them, but they did not have the guts to come into the parliament and say, 'Well, we will stand by regional Australia; we will stand by the rural constituencies; we will stand up even to the rural Liberals and we'll do over this measure'-only $12 million out of the budget-'and we will demonstrate our bona fides to rural and regional Australia.' But they did not. They went missing. They did not only go missing in this place; they went missing in the other place. It was up to the Labor Party and the Democrats, those who oppose the Liberal and National parties, to restore the benefit that these cooperatives have enjoyed. Let it be on the public record throughout the length and breadth of rural and regional Australia: those who sold them out in this place were the National Party; those who sold them out over in the other place were the National Party and the rural Liberals. Each and every one of you will pay a dear price for the decision to back this arrogant Treasurer when he tried to put this measure through this House. Motion (by Mr Reith) agreed to: That further consideration of the Senate's amendments be made an order of the day for a later hour this day. NA",178
435,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I move: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 4 February 1997, at 2.00 p.m., unless otherwise called together by the Speaker or, in the event of the Speaker being unavailable, by the Deputy Speaker. By arrangement, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has already contributed to the valedictories. May I take the opportunity in his absence of wishing him well, and I wish him and his family a very happy, enjoyable and relaxing Christmas and the replenishment of reserves that inevitably comes with a break at the end of the year. This is the probably sixth or seventh set of valedictories I have participated in as a party leader, but of course it is the first one I have participated in as Prime Minister. I do want to express my gratitude to a number of people. I first and foremost want to express my gratitude to you, Mr Speaker; to Mr Barlin, Ian Harris and their colleagues, the Clerk and Deputy Clerk of the House. I had occasion the night before last at the coalition Christmas gathering to express my warm regard for the high professionalism of Mr Barlin and his colleagues, and I repeat that. It is widely appreciBut ated on both sides of the House and it makes an inordinately significant contribution to the efficient running of the place. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",179
436,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I wish you well, Sir. I thank you for your work as Speaker. I congratulate you for your efforts to promote the role of the speakership and, along with other members of the House, I hope you have a very enjoyable break.",180
437,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Thank you.,180
438,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"On a more directly partisan note, can I express very great gratitude to all of my colleagues. I thank them for their number, and I thank them for their support. Could I particularly in that context thank Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, absent from the parliament but certainly not absent in pursuing the interests of Australia abroad. Tim has led the National Party with very great vigour and distinction. He has been a magnificent Deputy Prime Minister, a marvellous lieutenant to me and the government, and I wish him and Judy and their family every joy and happiness at Christmas time. To Peter Costello, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and Treasurer, my very special thanks not only for what you have done as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party but also as Treasurer of Australia coming in, as you did, at a very demanding and exacting time in that portfolio. I wish you and Tanya and your children every happiness also at Christmas time. To John Anderson, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, I also give a very special word of thanks; and also to Peter Reith, the Leader of the House, who has not only discharged those onerous burdens-and there is one other person sitting here who knows how onerous the burdens of Leader of the House are, and that is the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair)",180
439,Mr MELHAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,He did it more professionally.,180
440,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Well, he did it with flair and style, as has the member for Flinders. We always have Leaders of the House who have flair, style, efficiency and very great dignity. he has combined the role of Leader of the House with the responsibilities he had as Minister for Industrial Relations. There are many other people I want to thank: Alan Cadman, Stewart MCArthur, Trish Worth, Noel Hicks and Mark Vaile, all of the Government Whips; the Deputy Speaker, Gary Nehl, whose knowledge of the standing orders and unfailing good humour, even under the most trying of circumstances, is something that we appreciate very warmly. They are people at the parliamentary level. But there are many outside the parliamentary level to whom I would like to express my thanks. I would also like to acknowledge Harry Jenkins, the second Deputy Speaker, for his contribution. He has followed a fine family tradition, and we respect him for the role that he discharges. Going outside the membership of the parliament, I would like to thank: Phil Bergin, the senior adviser to the Speaker, and his other staff-I have mentioned Lyn Barlin and Ian Harris; David Elder, the Serjeant-at-Arms; the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms and Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms; and other staff, including Narelle Frost and Brian Flanagan, who are the transport officer and transport manager. I would like to thank: Superintendent Ian Cattanach of the Australian Protective Service and his staff; Graham Taylor, the security controller; and Tony Mumey, the deputy security controller. The people responsible for security in this place had an atypically active year. On an occasion like this, that ought not to go unremarked and should be remarked with some gratitude. I also want to thank Jeannie Hall very warmly. I remember her from my time when I was the Manager of Opposition Business, when she was particularly helpful. She was helpful last year when we were in opposition and she has been equally helpful in government. I thank her very warmly for that. I thank Lindsay Youman, the tabling officer. This is his last day after 2Y2 years. He is going back to the Prime Minister's department to serve in the ceremonial and hospitality section. I wish him well and thank him. I thank Suzanne De Smet, the assistant liaison officer, for the work that she has done. Now that he is with us, I also thank the member for Hotham, Simon Crean.",180
441,Unknown,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Government members interjecting,181
442,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"It is Christmas! One thing I have to say about the member for Hotham is that his performance has been a bit letharofficer gic, hasn't it? It all makes the system work. I want to thank the Hansard staff. It never ceases to amaze me, after 22Y2 years in this place, how on earth they do it. It is remarkable what they can do and what a superb product they conjure up out of some of the fractured English they have to take down. I admire them very much. I thank all of the members of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the staff of the Department of the Parliamentary Library. I want to thank Michael Bolton, the secretary, and all the staff of the Joint House Department: John Lloyd, the manager, and all the gardening staff; Shane Mackenzie, the operations manager, and all the staff from Members Catering Services; Audrey Rough of Audrey's Florist; Peter Walsh, the director, and the other staff of the Ministerial Wing Support Section. I thank all the switchboard staff and all of the attendants in the chamber who work very hard and are always very courteous, helpful and friendly. I hope all you have an enjoyable time as well and take a well-earned break. I want to thank my personal staff: Grahame Morris and Nicole Feely, my senior adviser and chief of staff; Tony O'Leary, who is the head of my press staff; and Barbara Williams, my personal assistant-all of whom have worked very hard along with all the other members of my staff. Parliamentary staff, whether they work for the government or the opposition, work very long hours. All of them are very dedicated, and they get very involved in the political causes of the people for whom they work. Having been through an election campaign, still fairly recently, with a group of people whom most have been with me for a long period of time, you form a particular bond with them. They rise and fall emotionally with you according to the circumstances of the moment. It is an occasion for all of us to express thanks. I want to thank the head of my department, Mr Max Moore-Wilton, and also pay tribute to his predecessor, Michael Keating, who served both sides of politics. He was a senior in Malcolm Fraser's Prime Minister's department. He was Secretary to Industrial Relations, then Finance and then, finally, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I wish him well in his current pursuits. I thank Max particularly and also the head of the Cabinet Policy Unit, Michael L'Estrange, who has been an invaluable adviser to me and to the government. To all the other officers of my department, I express my gratitude. There are just a couple of other personal things I want to say. I do-along with all members in this place, I hope-believe very strongly in the value of the parliamentary system. I believe very strongly in the vigorous debate in the House of Representatives. Sometimes it is untidy, sometimes it is not the very coherent, sometimes it does not do any of us any real credit. But on other occasions it rises to considerable heights. I reflected yesterday on the fact that we went through an election a few months ago and, without seeking in any way to make a of political point about it, it represented the extraordinary phenomenon of democracy that we were able to peacefully transfer power from one side of politics to another through the ballot box after 13 years of one party being in power. We did it without a shot being fired in anger-we did it with plenty of verbal abuse but with a complete absence, as I am aware, of any kind of physical abuse. It is an extraordinary achievement, and we should never, ever take that extraordinary achievement for granted. All of us should work very hard. I recount again an experience that I had on election day-I think I may have mentioned it in my acceptance speech at the Wentworth Hotel-when I had to line up at the Gladesville Public School to vote. There were long queues. I would like to think that at 10 o'clock that morning people were anxious to get in there and make their decision. I was queuing up with a long line of people. There was a bloke in front of me, and he was clutching the Labor Party how-to-vote card. I looked to see whether underneath there was one of mine-and there wasn't. He turned around to me and said, 'G' day,' and I said, 'G'day' back. He said, 'I am not going to vote for you, mate, but I think you might win.' He said, 'I wouldn't vote for you in a fit.' We went on. Then we talked about the cricket and a few other things because we were stuck in this queue for about a quarter of an hour",181
443,Mr MELHAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Don't tell me you conned him! You didn't con him to vote for you!,182
444,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Well, I don't know, mate. I worked hard. You never give up, Daryl, do you? You always keep working to the very end. But it was a reminder to me and it really isMr Crean-He'll be back next time.",182
445,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"You never stop, Simon. It's good advice. Gough Whitlam once gave that to me. Mr Crean-He did to me, too.",182
446,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Didn't help you much, did it? Anyway, there is a serious point in that story. It is, I guess, a remarkable er of the earthy egalitarianism and directness of Australian politics. There is a levelling quality about Australian politics that you do not find anywhere else in the world. It is largely the case that political figures in this country can move freely, can talk directly to people and can be in receipt of very direct advice from those people, sometimes profiting from that advice. We ought never to take that for granted and we ought to work very hard to preserve it. On a very personal note, I want to wish all members a very enjoyable Christmas. Whatever people's views are about the religious significance of Christmas-of course, to millions of Australians it is first and foremost the celebration of the birth of Christ and therefore a religious occasion of great significance-it is an occasion to stop. It is an occasion to spend time with our families and friends. It is also an occasion to remember that there are a lot of Australians who will not have a very happy Christmas. There will be people who do not have jobs. There are more than 700,000 Australians out of work. Just as I did on earlier occasions when I was in opposition, I express concern for them. I again say as Prime Minister that I am very conscious that the political system collectively continues to fail hundreds of thousands of Australians. It remains our responsibility, according to our views as to how it can best be achieved, to work very hard to see if that disadvantage can be taken away. There will be some people who will find, because of circumstances of domestic violence and other factors, that Christmas is not such a particularly happy occasion. We ought to remember them also. In our relative affluence-perhaps nobody in this parliament will want for anything as they themselves celebrate Christmas-I think all of us have an obligation to dig a little deeply into our pockets and contribute to those great organisations in the Australian community that help the less privileged and the less fortunate at Christmas time. I commend that to you and I commend it to all Australians, because it is an occasion to remindremember the less fortunate. I hope everybody does have an enjoyable and safe Christmas. Spend some time with your families and friends and those people still who mean the most to you. You do not get enough opportunity as members of parliament to do that. I look forward with very great pleasure to seeing you all back again. I like the place, I like the theatre of it, I like looking at all of you and I like having all of you there, and long may it go on.",182
447,Mr GARETH EVANS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has already indicated, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) spoke earlier in these valedictorieswith the very gracious cooperation, if I may say so, of the government-Kim Beazley having had to leave early for Western Australia and a final burst of out-underdogging, which should occupy him for the next few hours. I wish to endorse what my leader said about the government. I congratulate the Prime Minister and the government on their election victory, and I hope they enjoy its fruits, its fun and its stimulation while it lasts. I hope that you all do take an appropriate break over Christmas with your families. Enjoy that period, but I hope that you do take just a little bit of time out to reflect on your various sins of commission and omission, not least in relation to those hundreds of thousands of unemployed Australians, and generally that you bounce back as worthy enough opponents for us next year. Mr Speaker, I congratulate you again on your victory. I congratulate you and thank you for your personal charm and cooperation and the efforts you have been making to manage this unruly House-the House of Representatives. We all know deep down inside that Speakers and Presidents, whatever their genuine aspirations to absolute independence, do essentially have to run a bit of a protection racket for the government of the day: they only differ in terms of their capacity to conceal it. I think you are proceeding very interestingly down that particular path. Although we do have some neuroses from time to time-politically and professionally-personally there are no neuroses at all. Have a good break over Christmas-you deserve it. As to the Clerk, Lyn Barlin; the Deputy Clerk, Ian Harris; other members of the parliamentary staff; the Hansard reporting staff; attendants; transport and printing staff; library staff; research people; catering staffthat whole army of people who look after our interests so brilliantly well: on the opposition I want to add my thanks for their support. I have to say that for the last years as a minister I have been somewhat, like my colleagues, gloriously insulated, at one or two removes, from so much of the actual activity that goes on around this place. It is a very salutary experience to realise how many people are doing so much that is enormously helpful to us here. I have had a lot of experience of that this year in a very hands-on way. I am much more conscious of it all than I had been for a number of years, and I really do want to express my personal thanks for that support as a result. This is a year in which there have been, of course, as always, a number of unhappy departures. This year saw the death of the unforgettable Mick Young and that most engaging of parliamentary characters, Don Dobie, the obituaries for both of them, I guess, fresh enough in our minds not to need any repetition on this occasion. It is also a year in which Paul Keating left the parliamentary stage. I am not sure, looking back over the Hansard, that we ever did fully enough, in this place anyway, acknowledge his parliamentary career. I guess it is a little bit late to go into that now, and certainly it has been well enough acknowledged elsewhere, but let me say for the record on this occasion that I-and know this view is certainly shared on our side of the parliamentbelieve he was the finest parliamentarian of his generation; a great reformer; a great achiever; a great Australian nationalist; and a great internationalist. We shall miss him and this country will miss him. The extent to which we will miss him, I think, was made evident again in the really quite brilliant address he gave on the subject of multiculturalism and national identity just a few weeks ago at the University of New South Wales. One other person whose departure must be remarked on this occasion is John Langmore, the just retired member for Fraser. I have said something about John on a parliamentary type occasion in the main committee room a couple of nights ago and I do not want to repeat all that here, but just for the record I think there are a few things that should behalf again of certainly be said. John Langmore was, I think, a splendid 13 parliamentarian in this chamber, in the committee process, particularly in his work as chairman and primary author-I know of a number of instances--of major reports, and in his work as a local member. He had a very long and distinguished career here for 12 years since 1984 following, in tum, a number of years as a parliamentary researcher in the opposition ranks and before that many years in Papua New Guinea as a researcher, planner, economist and academic. The only disappointment, I guess, in John's political life was that he did not get to be a minister in either the Hawke or the Keating governments. There are all sorts of reasons for that. It is not really appropriate to late on them on this occasion, except to say that it had much more to do with the fortuitous dynamics of the political process than anything to do with his ability which is, was and remains immense. John Langmore was someone who did arouse very strong emotions because of the strength of his passion, his commitment and persistence with particular ideas. I can recall few emotions being expressed more strongly about him in fact than by our former Prime Minister and Treasurer on a number of occasions around the halls of this parliament. I think it is interesting to speculate why that is so, John being such a thoroughly nice, decent Christian gentleman. Perhaps the reason was that he took less to heart the nostrum that the 'blessed are the meek' than the nostrum that the 'blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness'. John certainly hungered and thirsted after righteousness in the conduct of economic policy in particular and was, according to the biblical prescription, duly persecuted for his sins, I think, in that respect.",182
448,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Particularly by the former Prime Minister. Mr GARETH EV ANS-I have already acknowledged something to that effect, albeit a little more subtly. Now of course, again following the biblical prescription, he is about to enter the kingdom of heaven-in the United Nations. I think that might be the way his bank manager sees it. The point I want to make about John going to the United NationsMr Reith interjecting",184
449,Mr GARETH EVANS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Now, nowbehave yourself, fellow statesman. You were doing very well there for a while on that declaration we put together. Don't go back to being a politician. You would be a very classy statesman. You were pretty good when you were shadow foreign minister too. You showed a bit of class, a bit of deference and a bit of decency. Just keep it up. Mr Reith-This is killing me.",184
450,Mr GARETH EVANS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I know. The point specuI want to make particularly about John Langmore is that the job he is going to in the UN, as Director of the Division of Social Development, is one of the really big jobs in the UN system. It is not just a run-of-the-mill job. It means that he is responsible, among other things, for the implementation worldwide of the kinds of strategies agreed at the Copenhagen world summit on social development. He is really the most senior Australian official in the system now and someone who has a very big responsibility. It is a job that he won in rather fierce open competition. It is a job that he won absolutely on merit. I really do think it is appropriate for this parliament to recognise and appreciate that. Certainly, on behalf of his colleagues in the opposition and, I hope, on behalf of everyone here, I wish him every success in that terribly important job. I know that at a personal level he does go with the goodwill and affection of everyone here. The final thing I would say is about my own leader, Kim Beazley. I want to repeat the thanks that Kim expressed so graciously to all my and his colleagues on the front bench, not least to Manager of Opposition Business, Simon Crean, who has been carrying with great flair, style and vigour the ruck work of our parliamentary process here. But of Kim himself I would say, since he was generous enough to be so generous about of all of us, that I find it difficult to find words to say how much his leadership has meant to us. Kim Beazley is a man of the most enormous ability, the most enormous integrity, the most enormous good humour and the most enormous capacity to communicate. It is a pity that he is going to have to read this in Hansard rather than being able to listen to itMr Crean-We will send him a copy.",184
451,Mr GARETH EVANS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Make sure about that. He is going to prove, I genuinely believe, one of the really great leaders not only of the Australian Labor Party but of this country. Mr Reith-Will he be Prime Minister?",185
452,Mr GARETH EVANS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Absolutely. Mr Reith-Will you make that prediction?,185
453,Mr GARETH EVANS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Absolutely. Enjoy it while it lasts, Peter. On that basis, I wish Kim, my leader, and all my colleagues, everyone else in this place and everyone else in this building who serve us so well the happiest Christmas and holiday season.",185
454,Mr ANDERSON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I take great personal pleasure in joining in felicitations as we draw this year to a close and speaking on behalf of Tim Fischer who, as the Prime Minister has mentioned, is away. He, as leader, would normally be speaking now rather than I. I would like at the outset to thank him for his courageous leadership in times that are very difficult for many of our constituents in rural Australia and to wish him and his family a very relaxing and reinvigorating break over the Christmas period. It is certainly true that 1996 has been a year that could only be described as momentous. We have had a change of government, followed by rapid movement on many policy fronts. It is, I suppose, not all together surprising that that creates some dynamic tensions at times but, when all is said and done, I think it is a great credit to this parliament and to the way we do things in this country that we have in most cases enjoyed constructive, thoughtful and useful policy debate in the best traditions of a robust Western democracy. Among the goals for all of us in 1997 must be a desire to add constructively to good policy ideas and formulation, to help build harmony and goodwill in the Australian community and to help create a better life for this and for future generations of Australians. In the end, government is not simply about administration and about crossing the t's and dotting the i' s. It is about more than that. It is about reflecting, perhaps, on some of those things that we have touched on here that are not so happy in our society. I am reminded for example that, sadly, the joys of Christmas are at times tempered by a rise in violence, especially domestic violence-in some cases alcohol is involved. I put forward a plea to all this Christmas to take a responsible, caring attitude towards others, to remember that our Christmas tradition is built on the principle of goodwill want to towards everyone around us and to seek a reduction, not a rise, in the incidence of violence over the period. I believe that, as a society, we must be strong in applying penalties to those who wantonly engage in such violence. We have seen the release this week of a report into domestic violence, which only serves to underline the seriousness of the matter for us. Christmas, of course, is about more than that. I think it can offer an opportunity this year for us to reflect on how we build into a new millennium, particularly how we seek to make Australia into an even greater society enjoying a greater prominence in world affairs and enjoying greater opportunities in terms of trade opportunities, and those sorts of things. For many in rural Australia, as I already touched on when I made my opening remarks, Christmas will not be a particularly easy time despite some breaks in seasonal circumstances. We can but work for those outcomes that we can influence, such as minimising input costs whilst we hope for a recovery of world prices, particularly for such things as meat and grains. Mr Speaker, I do extend to you and your deputies the very best wishes of the season. I hope that you will find this a restful period and that you will find yourself re-invigorated. I extend the same to the deputy speakers. I thank the staff of parliament: the clerks, Lyn Barlin and Ian Harris-acknowledged of course by everybody else, but now joined by the National Party-House staff, attendants, Hansard, security, catering and the gardeners. As this new building finally begins to take on a bit of a patina with the gardens around the place and the trees really now starting to get a bit of size about them-the gardens are really making progressMr Crean-We just need more courtyards.",185
455,Mr ANDERSON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"More forest product? No, no. We are talking about cooperative debates. The member for Hotham and I have had plenty of those. Think back to our efforts in relation to the wool industry. Mr Crean-And we supported you.",186
456,Mr ANDERSON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I thought we were supporting you. Mr Crean-Well, you are now.",186
457,Mr ANDERSON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"No. We are going back a couple of years. They have done a great job and I think that, as the magnificent Canberra summer comes on, we can think of their efforts in that regard. I thank the staff of ministerial members' and senators' offices. I would like to thank Tim's staff, in particular, in his absence. I would like to thank my own staff, of courseI will not single them out by name-but there are many, many others that I know enjoy our universal appreciation. I would not want to miss the opportunity to thank Paul Barratt, the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, and his team, and particularly record my appreciation of the way in which they have attempted to ensure that we are at all times focused on outcomes and not unduly bogged down over process as opposed to progress. I extend my best wishes to John Langmore. He has been mentioned here, of course, but he heads off to become Director of the Division for Social Development in the United Nations, based in the UN Secretariat or, as we have just heard it described, Heaven, in New York. I close by offering my personal best wishes and those of my National Party colleagues to all honourable members for a safe, happy and holy Christmas.",186
458,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I am going to bat outside the batting order a bit here. I will not be going comprehensively through all of the people who will be thanked in due course by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). But I did want to convey my congratulations to you and the clerks on what has been a tumultuous year. I want particularly, as the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, on behalf of the members of the Liberal Party and, indeed, the coalition, to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for his leadership in what has been one of the great years in coalition history. This time last year, we were sitting on that side. We were making, as best we could, bipartisan noises about the government. We know how hard those speeches are, and the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party (Mr Gareth Evans) made them manfully when he got the opportunity to do so. But it was the greatest wish, I think, of all of our members that, in the March election, we would have the opportunity to be elected as a government and to have our chance to make a difference to the country. Throughout the period of the election campaign leading down to 2 March 1996, the leadership of the then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister was outstanding. We want to thank him very much for the leadership that he gave us. Government members-Hear, hear!",186
459,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"After the election of the government on 2 March, it was one of the dearest wishes of the Prime Minister that the House of Representatives would begin to function on a different basis. Some of us had our doubts about this policy, but the Prime Minister insisted that all of his ministers come into the chamber every day",186
460,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Hear, hear!",186
461,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"And he insisted that question time not go for seven questions or three-quarters of an hour-as had been the wont-but that it go for, I think, on average, 20 questions a question time. This was even before the advent of supplementaries-{)ne of the new features of your regime, Mr Speaker, if I may say so. That has meant that question times have been going to 3.20, sometimes 3.30. I think one went to 3.50 recently",186
462,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,One hour and 52 minutes.,186
463,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Which just shows the Prime Minister's commitment to productivity amongst his ministers as much of anything else. It is also a testament to the fact that the Prime Minister really does enjoy question time. He loves it as theatre and he loves the opportunity to explain the government's position. I think that has been one of the key changes in the House of Representatives over the course of the year under the Howard government. I want to briefly mention two other classes of people. The first is the new members of parliament who joined us on 2 March. It is amazing, after you have been here a while and you feel jaded, how much enthusiasm and freshness the new members of parliament give you, and how you are reminded by them of all the things you came here to do. They give you that freshness and keep you up to the mark. They have given us an enormous feeling of energy. The second is the people who did not come back after 2 March. Mr Bob Baldwin-You have to have good looks, Peter.",186
464,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I will not be provoked by that interjection. We think of many of the people who worked so long and hard in opposition. Julian Beale was one of the people I was thinking of. He was here from 1984 to 1996, never spent a day in government, but was part of the opposition right through those long years. All of those of us who managed to be elected, and the new members, would wish those people all the best and assure them that we appreciated the support and the commitment that they made. To all of the staff, to all the people who are so much a part of the life of the House of Representatives, I want to add my thanks and my best wishes for Christmas.",187
465,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I want to make a few comments of appreciation to those who have assisted my transition into not only this side of the House but the functions associated with it. Adjustment to opposition has not been easy but it is one of those things you have to cop. As I indicated before, just as much as we were able to adapt to this side, we can readily adapt back to the other side. Coming to grips with the new portfolio has been challenging and interesting to me, as indeed has been this interesting new role of Manager of Opposition Business. My only exposure to parliament prior to this year had been on the executive of government and it always seemed parliament was endorsing that which the executive had determined. So to be thrust on this side of the House into learning about all those new standing orders and new forms has been quite exciting. We have found out about standing order 202 and standing order 100. I found out about 304A very early in the piece, Mr Speaker. I even found a way around 304Athat was 304-but that got me out for 24 hours instead of one hour. We have embarked on some interesting questioning of what we think goes on in this place. It is very interesting: the more you are involved in this place and the more you know what you heard from the other side, going back to the replays or the Hansard is quite enlightening. Some of the video replays have been fascinating. For those who think there have been difficulties staying awake in this place at night, we can always go around to Sound and Vision, pick out the rough tackles when we are trying to get to the dispatch box, pick up the people who move seats after tellers have been appointed and pick up people who move after they have been seated. It means nothing to anyone else outside, but for those who live in this place it has a meaning. It brings me, in that context, to particularly thank you, Mr Speaker. I know that you have not found the task easy, although you are enormously proud of the position that the parliament has bestowed upon you. I joined with those at the time in congratulating you. I happen to believe that you are a very good Speaker because I think you have basic decency and commitment to the institution, which are the fundamental qualities that matter so far as a Speaker is concerned. You have an ability to fraternise outside the place and not be criticised for it. We have been to the football together, we tried to get to the cricket together and we have had a drink together-and he still throws me out! He is a totally committed Speaker. I enjoy your company and I thank you for the commitment you have made this year. I wish you well over the continuance of your term. We look to cooperate with you although, as you know, we like to get vigorous from time to time because, indeed, we can be provoked and we have to respond in those circumstances. To the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) I would like to extend my best wishes. He has had a good year-the only 'A' rating and he is creeping up, and he loves it. We have developed something of a working relationship-I put the emphasis on 'something' rather than on 'working'. It is not exactly what you would call a close one. It is one that does involve some telephone conversations from time to time. They do not often produce much but they are enjoyable to have, particularly if you get them at the beginning of the day. You know, if he is ringing, that there is something up. It sharpens you up immediately. You have to be prepared. Also to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), I thank him for his remarks. I appreciated them. I wish him and Janette a very happy Christmas together. I know it has been a hard year for him but it has obviously been a tremendous one from his point of view. I wish him well over the Christmas period. I turn to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), who is not here-I know he is on the way back from Singapore. I have a certain affinity with Tim because I inherited his office. When I arrived, he had left a can of Dark and Stormy, which is a combination of Bundaberg rum and Bundaberg ginger beer. I must say I have not drunk it yet. It is still sitting in the fridge-but not because I have not been prepared to try that regional product. I also inherited with the office the Fischer files. We had a lot of fun with those. Tim seemed to think that we should return them immediately. I claimed that they came with the territory. In any event, they are still wailing there to be collected. It took us a long modated. time to photocopy all of them, and to return the original copy. Had the parliament been prepared to extend the additional staff, we might have been able to do it quicker. To the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, Jeannie Hall, I would like to extend our thanks, and also to Lindsay. As has been remarked, Lindsay is leaving today to go back to the Prime Minister's department. We appreciate their cooperation. They have kept us on the mark. Jeannie is one of those people who rewards people in our office with chocolate frogs, I think, on the few occasions when we actually stick to the time limits. Mr Reith-You have not earned too many.",187
466,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"We have not had too many of them, as the Leader of the House keeps reminding us. Jeannie does try her hardest, and we appreciate the liaison that her role and that of Lindsay offers. I wish you every success, Lindsay, back in the department and we look forward to continuing to work with Jeannie. The clerks-Lyn, Ian Harris, Bernard Wright, Ian Cochran-have been fantastic support. I know that there are people who have views about clerks, but until you have to use them, you do not appreciate the professionalism with which they commit to their job. Whilst I always look forward to the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) giving that directional thrust for issues that we might be able to take tactical advantage on, I always come to the clerks to find out whether we can do it. Their professionalism has been exceptional. To them and their staff, including Monica Johnson and Elizabeth Robertson, I thank them on behalf of the opposition for the invaluable advice and support that they provide. They do it in an even-handed and totally professional way. I have nothing but the highest of praise possible for that totally professional commitment that they provide to the House. To the Serjeant-at-Arms, David Elder, and Neville Gathercole and Kerry Warner, and the Serjeant-at-Arms' Office, we thank them for their prompt and courteous support in ensuring the office requirements are always accomI also want to thank the Bills and Papers Office, especially Ray Barter and Pat Sherman. We make particularly frequent demands on their time in terms of amendments and I know the government obviously does from legislation. The efficiency with which the forms come into the House is extraordinary . To the attendants who service us, they are a fantastic group of people and I want to thank all of them. They are always friendly and courteous. It is always good to have a pleasant exchange of views with them in the corridors as well as coming into the place. I thank the Department of the Parliamentary Library and· the Parliamentary Research Service. It is terribly important for an opposition to appreciate their role in this place. effectively are the department of opposition, even though they are able to be used by any member in the parliament. Given the resources that we know departments have, because a number of us have experienced it, the fact is that we have to have somewhere to tum to get back-up and research and they provide a great service. In fact, I do not think that there is a better research unit in the nation than that which is provided by this parliament. I hope that there is never an attempt to restrict its ability to service members in this place. There are many I could continue to thank. I will try to wind up. We appreciate the role of the Hansard reporters. Many of us on this side take more interest in the 'greens' now. We thank them for their accuracy, their forbearance, their dedication and, again, their total professionalism. I have made reference to the Sound and Vision Office. As I said before, there has been some interesting viewing. I think it does help put a perspective on the things that happen. I thank the staff in the dining room, in particular, Kate, who has been there for a long time. In fact, I can remember coming into this place in 1990 and there were still members in the dining room who were there when I used to come up as a young boy with my father. It was like coming back to boarding school or something like that. They have always served us well. They have to deal with us when we are in all sorts of dreadful moods or hubris and they have to read that on both sides. Thank you to all of them, as well as to the people who compete with them-those around at Aussie's. I thank the recreation staff. I know that there are a number of us who get down there early in the morning. They are not the only ones who use the place, because it is a tremendous facility to have in this place. The early group who get down there have a bit of an exchange in the morning. The recreation staff are always there punctually to not only get us in but to make sure we do not overexert. On behalf of those that we manage on this side of the House, I would like to say thank They you to all opposition staffers and those who have shown tremendous loyalty by staying with us when the government was lost and those that came on board in the tough task of opposition. I wish them the very best of the festive season. I thank the families, not only of members but also of their staff. This place is one that requires tremendously long hours and absences from home. We all know that. It is a forbearance that many have to put up with. We could not continue without that support. They deserve a particular mention. It has been a hard year for us-our first in opposition. I want to wish everyone a very happy Christmas and a restful holiday season-in particular, the government members. Get as much rest as you can, because we can promise to come back and give you a tough time when we get here.",188
467,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I thought I might start my valedictory remarks with my thanks to the members of the opposition for their contribution to the parliament this year. Starting with the opposition, I find, is quite a good way to start the day, as we have already today. I want to thank them for their cooperation and for the many agreements that they have kept during the year in the conduct of business! I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) for his cooperation. I certainly appreciated his muted remarks on the good work that we did in the past. I thank particularly the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) for the spring in his step. He does bring a smile to our face. As he just demonstrated, he could make a political point six feet under wet cement-and do it with a smile, which we enjoy. Mr Costello-Which you couldn't do.",189
468,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Which I could not do. To Leo MCLeay, we pay tribute and recognise his contribution within the opposition ranks. Turning from the opposition, to you, Mr Speaker, to your deputy, to Harry Jenkins, to your staff, Phil Bergin, Marie Donnelly and Pauline Osmond, and to those associated with the work of the Speaker, I thank you for your work since 2 March. We have appreciated the good cooperation and assistance that we have had from you. We appreciate the difficulties of the high office that you hold. It is a most important one in the proper functioning of the parliament. In that light, I wish to add my thanks to Lyn Barlin, to Ian Harris, to the clerks, to Don Piper, to Monica Johnson, and to the clerks assistant. We again do appreciate, Lyn and Ian, the very professional advice and assistance that you give in the running of this place. There is no question that your professionalism does make the place work in the way that it does. I do greatly value the advice that you give us. It is advice that we always can rely upon and it is most important in the proper functioning of the House. To the Serjeant-at-Arms, David Elder, to the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms, Dalma Dixon, we thank you. To the PLO, Jeannie Hall, a particular thanks. I work very closely with Jeannie. It is not just the supply of those banana lollies that she keeps on her deskMr Crean-You get banana lollies?",190
469,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes. She is also particularly meticulous in carrying out this task. It is a difficult task. It is an absolutely constant Jeannie, I do appreciate the work that you do. I am sure Hugh Logue, who is sitting up the back as he usually does, also joins with me in thanking you for the work that you do. To Lindsay Youman and Suzanne de Smet, we thank you, particularly Lindsay, for the work that you have done. Outside of the PLO's office, I think of the Parliamentary Business Committee, which is quite an important committee within government for the management of legislation through both chambers. I thank all staff associated with the Parliamentary Business Committee, as well as my ministerial colleagues on the PBC for the work that they do. Outside of the House, I do also want to mention Andrew Robb, Lynton Crosby and Tony Staley for the support that they provide us all with. Going beyond them and behind them, I also want to note and thank in my own electorate-and I know in the electorates of all members-the tremendous voluntary support that we have from the most important organisation which is so responsible for us being here in the first place. In the management of the House, I want to note the Deputy Leader of the House, Mr Peter MCGauran, who is not here momentarily but with whom I have worked very closely. He is very active in this role. It is a very important part of my work that I have a very good relationship with him. He is full of bright ideas about the better management of the House. He particularly relates to our colleagues in the National Party. I am sure they would join with me in thanking him for the work that he does in that role. Also in the tactics committee are my ministerial colleague David Kemp and people like Grahame Morris, Tony Smith, Mitch Fifield and others who are involved in that process, which in itself is quite a busy business. Helen is very actively involved in that. I want to thank her for particularly her work. Mr Costello-Don't give out any trade secrets.",190
470,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"No. I now tum to the government whips, particularly the Chief Government Whip, Alan Cadman. I thank you, Alan, task. for your work. I do appreciate the work that you do. It is again one of these very demanding jobs. Being the Chief Government Whip, you carry a lot of responsibility and do the job well. I do appreciate what you do. You are so ably supported by Stewart MCArthur, whom I thank, and Trish Worth, who has a particular responsibility for the Main Committee. I thank you, Trish, for the work that you have done there. The Main Committee has had a particular focus this year with the euthanasia debate and a few other matters which have required good management. I appreciate your work for that. I also thank Noel Hicks, Mark Vaile and others for their work. I thank the staff in the Bills and Papers Office. Hansard staff, transport staff and parliamentary library staff have all been mentioned, but I add my thanks as well. To the attendants, to Carol and others, we thank you for your work. We do appreciate what you do-security staff, similarly. I thank Lizzie and her staff, and all those at Aussie's.",190
471,Mr KERR,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,You have less need of them!,191
472,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yeah! I also thank all staff of the Joint House Department, the telephone operating staff, the Sound and Vision Office, gym staff, gardeners, catering staff-Kate, for example, amongst others-for their work. Turning to political colleagues, can I also add my thanks to that of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and to our parliamentary colleagues, Tim Fischer in particular, for their cooperation and assistance during the year. John, I thought it was a very good little anecdote that you provided in your remarks about you standing in the queue for 15 minutes chatting to some bloke who had announced to you that he was going to vote for the other side. You remarked that that was a good thing about Australian politics-and that is true-but it is also true of you as a person and as a Prime Minister. The great thing about you is that that story could be set in any year-any year ahead or any of the last 13 years. That is the great thing about Australian politics, but it does say a lot about you, John, jf you do not mind me saying so. It is one of the many great characteristics and strengths that you bring to the office. I do particularly thank you for your assistance in my role as Leader of the House. I also thank my ministerial colleagues and all of the parliamentary colleagues. There have been some comments about those-John Langmore and others. I also want to add some appreciation and recognition of the many that we have on our side. We do have a very big backbench. It does have its frustrations for some from time to time, but it has also had its great pleasures as well. We do have a tremendous depth of talent, a richness of experience which our numbers now bring to the parliament. I do appreciate the good working relationship that I have had with so many of you during the last nine months in the management of the House. I also want to thank my departmental staff in the Department of Industrial Relations and in PSMPC for their involvement and support. I thank my own ministerial and electorate staff, who provide me with tremendous personal assistance. I thank the sort of shadow member for Flinders, Jill Fletcher, who has been my electorate staffer for many years and does a tremendous job. I thank Tina Billson and Katrina Flannery. Then in the Parliament House I thank my chief of staff, Peter Richards; my media adviser, Nick Hordern; and my senior policy adviser, Jonathan Hamberger. I thank Bronwyn Ellis, Garry Smith, Alison Penfold and Cate Clunies-Ross. Lastly, I thank Hugh Logue, who has particular responsibilities for management of the House. Hugh has had many years experience around the House on both sides within the bureaucracy at a political level, both in opposition and in government. Many members have had to tum to him for advice in the management of the House during the year, and I particularly acknowledge his expertise and his tremendous assistance in the proper and smooth functioning of the House. With those remarks, the first Christmas after an election is the best time to have a break. I wish all a very happy Christmas and a decent holiday. We look forward to 1997.",191
473,Mr CADMAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to make a few comments and thank my colleagues and alert the Australian Labor Party to the fact that I think we have the most honourable, distinguished brilliant group of government members this House has seen. Also, I would like to inform the members of the Australian Labor Party that the government members all intend to retain their seats. They will be back here after the next election and for many years to come. I want to congratulate them on the start they have made in their parliamentary careers and the professional attitudes they have exhibited. You are lifting the standard of this parliament, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said we would do, and I want to congratulate you for doing so.",191
474,Mr MELHAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,It is interesting to note that you were appointed and hot elected.,192
475,Mr CADMAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"In the spirit of Christmas, Daryl, I want to wish you and your colleagues on that side a very happy Christmas-and more pain next year that we will inflict on you. Mr Speaker, I want to thank you for the leadership you have given in the parliament. You have helped set a standard. It has been an experience for me to work with you and understand your new role as well as mine. I want to thank you for your friendship and assistance. I want to thank our Prime Minister for his leadership. I believe he has brought a change in outlook and a change to the politics of Australia in more than just a party sense. The whole attitude and direction has changed. I want to thank the staff of the parliament. I thank the transport office, Jeannie Hall and her crew and all of those people who have been associated with us over the last nine months. In particular, I would like to thank Noel Hicks and Mark Vaile, my colleagues of the National Party. It has been a pleasure working with you. The friendship we have built up over the years is lasting us well and strengthening. To my colleagues Stewart MCArthur and Trish Worth-no government whip could be served by two better people than the whips who assist me in my task. I take this opportunity of wishing all of a happy and holy Christmas and time with your family. We will be back good and strong to keep government in 1997. Best wishes for Christmas and the coming year.",192
476,Mr MCMULLAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Canberra) (5.04 p.m.)I do not intend to reiterate all of those things that have been said by people on both sides of the House, but I do wish to endorse their remarks about you and the staff and others for the success of the management of the business and the way in which it facilitates the life of all members of the opposition. I rise to speak only because I want to say something about my long-time colleague John Langmore, who has so recently retired. Mr Costello interjecting",192
477,Mr MCMULLAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you for your assistance again, Treasurer, as usual. John and I worked very closely before he was preselected for the seat of Fraser. We shared almost nine years together in the parliament, representing the ACT together. We worked very closely together. It would not be the world's best kept secret that John and I disagreed from time to time, but we were always able to cooperate on behalf of local constituents and local issues of importance-most recently, issues to do with the retention of the Canberra tax office and issues to do with the upsurge of racial intolerance in our community. On those and so many other issues, I enjoyed working with him, both on a personal basis and on a political basis. He discharged his responsibilities very professionally. I think the support that he always received in the electorate is testimony to the strength of the work he did locally and the way in which he reflected the views of the people of Fraser. I take great pleasure in reiterating here in the House what I said about John's retirement in the caucus and at other functions around the ACT. The other thing which motivates me to speak about this today is the splendid irony, which will not be lost on John, that after 12 years of enthusiastic advocacy in the parliament for the National Museum of Australia, he was able, by precipitating a by-election, to convince people to spend money on things you which he could never convince by the eloquence of his advocacy. He was a very effective advocate for that and met trenchant opposition from a large number of people. Suddenly a by-election is called and $100 million is found. What a pleasant surprise for John. I am sure it is merely an expression of recognition and a reflection of the 12 years of John's effective advocacy for the cause. I would not be so cynical as to think that it is simply because there is a by-election, and the standing of the government is not that great in the ACT! I would not have thought that was a factor in the equation at all! I, of course-because the national museum is being built in my electorate-welcome it very greatly. It is, I am sure, an irony which John will enjoy. I hope it is a national museum which he also enjoys. I endorse the remarks of all my colleagues and thank you, Mr Speaker, for your tolerance of those who come here fresh from other houses. I thank you for that, even if we have disagreed about the standing orders a time or two. You were gracious enough to say that I was even right once, so I am grateful for that too. I want to join with everybody in wishing all my colleagues and all members of the House and the staff a happy and safe Christmas and New Year. Like all of them, I look forward to resuming the battle in February.",192
478,Mr NEHL,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I have been in this place for 12 years. I recollect that long before that I visited Robert Menzies-I think he was still Robert Menzies-as Prime Minister in his office in about 1962. From 1962 it took until yesterday before I had the great pleasure of visiting a Prime Minister in his office. I just wanted to say to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that it has been a great year. Congratulations to you. It has not been an easy year for you on a personal as well as a political level. But you enjoy the goodwill of, I believe, everybody in this parliament. You do not always enjoy the agreement of those of our colleagues over on that side. I just wanted to say how pleasant it was to be able to visit you in your office as Prime Minister. I have had 12 years in this place, and that was the very first time. I hope it bears fruit.",193
479,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Garry and I know precisely what that means.,193
480,Mr NEHL,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, you have to peel them. I endorse everything that every speaker has said about the people who look after us. I will not go into it and name all the individuals or the departments. They have been mentioned. They know the goodwill that I bear them personally. I do not have to say it publicly, because I am sure they do know that. But I must on this occasion mention one or two people, and they are my electorate staff, headed by my chief of staff, Pamela Langford; Diane Leahy, who has been with me for six or seven years, and she was with Ian Sinclair for eight years before that; and Craig Ashdown. Wonderful people. Tremendous support. As Deputy Speaker, I have another staff member-Betty-Ann Daly, affectionately known as 'BA' - who is responsible for making sure that that chair is occupied when it should be. Mr Speaker, I would also like to make a comment to you. Nobody who does not occupy that chair can really understand or know the stresses that are involved. I might say the same about my colleagues on the Speaker's Panel and Harry Jenkins, the Second Deputy Speaker, a member for whom I have the highest regard and, indeed, affection. It is a very difficult job. I have been a member of the Speaker's Panel for the previous two parliaments, but it was not until you went overseas in September and I became Acting Speaker that I realised just how much stress and strain is involved in doing that job. I recall very well indeed that in the first three weeks of this session the opposition asked you 22 questions, which was about seven a week, and in the two weeks that I was occupying the chair in question time they asked me 40. I appreciate the attention from them, but it does illustrateMr Leo MCLeay-It was harder to get an answer out of you.",193
481,Mr NEHL,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"It is not hard to get a comment out of you, though. I just wanted to say I for one certainly appreciate the tremendous job you, Mr Speaker, have done in very difficult circumstances. I would like to go on to express my appreciation to Harry Jenkins, the member for Scullin, and to all the members of the Speaker's Panel. They do an excellent job in helping to keep this parliament running. All of us are dedicated to doing the job as fairly as we possibly can. We do not always satisfy everybody, but we try. I would like to say merry Christmas to everybody-not only the members of this House but in particular all those people who go out of their way to help us and to help make this place function so well.",193
482,Mr LEO MCLEAY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Watson) (5.12 p.m.)Mr Speaker, could I wish you and all members a happy Christmas. It is a chance for us all to get back and see our families. Hopefully, we might finish here some time before early tomorrow morning so that we at least get a chance to do that this weekend. I particularly thank my colleagues in the opposition for the effort they have put in since the election to keep up their camaraderie and sense of purpose. It has sometimes been the wont of the Labor Party that after election defeats we get ourselves involved in a very large blood-letting of our own. In the long time. I have been a member of the Labor Party this is probably the first time that we have not involved ourselves in that. I think that has made us better able to do our job and more able to keep the government on its toes. I think we have done our best to do that. I do my best to make sure that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) is here of a night rather than going out to dinner or something like that. I must say that I think the Leader of House is a worthy adversaryMr Reith-Is that what you think your job is? Mr LEO MCLEA Y-It always manages to get you back, Peter. I hope that all members and their families have a joyful Christmas. I would like to thank the people who have helped us here in this building-the plethora of staff, both the parliamentary staff and in particular our own staff. My chief of staff, Joan Connor, knows my job better than 1. She probably does it better than 1. So I need her more than she probably needs me, though she probably needs me for the title that keeps her in the job. Joan and Karen do the job down here, and Rickey, Julie and Mark are in my electorate office. Without our staff I think a lot of us would not do the job half as well as we do. Christmas is a time when we should remember the hard work that they have put m. All the government are obviously happy that this is their first Christmas in government. At their Christmas party they had on their little name tags. You had to get a name tag to get into the government's Christmas party this year. They locked all the doors and just let people in one door. It said 'Christmas in government' on the tag. They were pretty happy about that. Good luck to them for being there. I remind the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of one statistic that the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) mentioned to me earlier today. The member for Rankin was included in that new flush of members who came in when we won the election in 1983. There were 38 new members that came into the parliament then on both sides. Enjoy it while you can, because there are only six of them left. That statistic tells us a lot about the turnover in this place.",193
483,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"That was 13 years ago, Leo. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-And in a short 13 years there are only six left. So enjoy it while you can. Being in government is the most productive time for a member of parliament. It allows you to do the things that you really got yourself elected here to do, which is to try the to change the country to the way you would like to see it. I join with those who have wished others well. Mr Speaker, I wish you and your staff well. I wish well Alan Cadman, the people in his office who work with the people in my office and B-A in Garry Nehl's office, who came from your office when you were the Chief Opposition Whip, Mr Speaker. The thing that shows a lot of the real work that happens in this parliament is the way the staff of those people on both sides of the House work together to keep the chamber going. They all get on with each other, probably a lot better than we get on with each other. Maybe there is something for us to learn from them as well. I hope the clerks and all those who help us do our job here have a very happy Christmas. I hope we can come back here and maybe have a little bit more goodwill towards each other next year.",194
484,Mr ANDREWS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"As one of the chairmen of the parliamentary committees of this place, I would like to add my note of thanks-I am sure on behalf of all the chairpersons of parliamentary committees and members of parliamentary committeesto the tremendous work which has been undertaken by the secretariats. One of the most important aspects of the work of this parliament which is often unseen and unremarked upon is the work which the parliamentary committees carry out. That work would not be possible if it was not for the great loyalty, dedication, experience and hard work of members of those secretariats not only in drafting reports but also in the conduct of meetings, in the conduct of public hearings right around this country which they organise and participate in and in the presentation of material to this parliament. That is something which on this occasion I would like to remark upon. May I also add my note of thanks for the work of the clerks. Having had a little interest this year in the drafting of a bill, I appreciate perhaps more than I have on other occasions the tremendous work which the clerks undertake. But there are also particular committees of this parliament-such as the Privileges Committee, the Members' Interests Committee and other committees-which the clerks administer and oversee and which are very important not only to the workings of parliament but also to the interests of all members in this place. It is something which we all appreciate. Also, I want to add my appreciation for the work of the library. As was remarked upon by an earlier speaker, the library in this place is a great resource to all members and senators of this parliament. It is there for our use. If members and senators do not make use of it, they have a great resource which is going wanting in terms of the ability to improve their representation of their constituents and the ability to look at issues of national and electoral importance to them. Finally, as a member of the government backbench, it would be remiss of me not to add on behalf of all my colleagues on this side our great appreciation for the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) since he came into office. We all appreciate that this has been a difficult year both personally and professionally for John Howard. The way in which he has led us through this year, the way in which he has dealt with those personal difficulties in his own life and the way in which he has shown leadership, particularly on a bipartisan basis over an issue which arose very early in the life of this government-namely, the events of Port Arthur and the debate that ensued about violence and gun control-are things that, regardless of the differences we have in the adversarial nature of this chamber, all members of this place can take a degree of pride in and which stand out as a beacon for Australian people.",194
485,Mr MELHAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I wish you and your staff a happy Christmas and extend that wish to all members of this House. It is an honour and a privilege to be a member of parliament. Only 148 people in a nation of 18 million are able to sit on the green leather benches. It certainly has been an interesting period that I have spent in this place. It has been only a short time-6Yz years, having been elected in 1990. In that period there has been a huge turnover of members of parliament. There were some 50-odd new members this year. In my year, there were 33. In 1993, there were 19 new members. I have seen a change in the way this place operates. In many respects it has not been a change for the better. In other respects it has been a change for the better. One thing that has been constant throughout has been the professional and committed service that we, as members of parliament, have received from the support staff, from the clerks and their staff and from the committees. I was privileged in the last parliament to chair the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. I took great pride in the fact that, after one day's hearing on the child sex tourism bill, three ministers issued a press release attacking me and the committee because we were not apologists for the government. In a cross-party manner, we vigorously dissected that legislation and I think improved that legislation for the parliament-so much so that it has been used as a model by the New Zealand parliament and by other parliaments around the world. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) can take pride and satisfaction in being able to assume such high office in this country. There is no doubt that 2 March was personally very satisfying to him. From where I sit there is no doubt that there are light years between his performance and that of some of his front-bench. Hopefully he would want to bring them up to his standard. He and his term as Prime Minister will be judged in due course. This is the first Christmas in this House that my fellow Bankstonian Paul Keating is not with me. He is someone whom I did not always agree with. It is a matter of public record that I did not vote for him on two occasions the leadership of the Labor Party was decided, but I have tremendous respect for him. He served this nation for 26 years in public office-as a backbencher, as a minister and ultimately as Prime Minister. He served with distinction. He is someone whom the people of Bankstown are very proud of. I was proud, honoured and privileged to be a member of his government. History will treat him well, and history will judge the 13 years of Labor government. This is my first opportunity to serve on the front bench of the Labor Party. I am the first member for Banks since the seat was created in 1949 to serve on the front bench. I regard that as a deep honour and a deep privilege. I thank my parliamentary party and my leader for giving me that opportunity. I wish you well, Mr Speaker. We should remember that we are here to serve the people-not ourselves. Those who serve us in this place, I thank you very much. I think you do need a holiday from us for a few weeks. All the best.",195
486,Mr LINDSAY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to reinforce the words of the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in relation to the honour and privilege that we all have in serving in this place. I would like to draw the House's attention to some passing of history today. Many would know that behind the glass over there is a broadcasting box, but many would not know that behind the broadcasting box is an entire television production studio. After the House rises later this day for the final time this session, that television studio will be removed. That television studio, after all these years, is going down into the basement. So there is a bit of passing of history today. That introduces some words I would like to say about the Sound and Vision Office staff. Many of us never realise that they are here, but I can tell you they are always watching and listening to us. Every fortnight I record a report to my electorate, and I am assisted by the Sound and Vision Office staff. I really appreciate that, and I would like to mention a few of the production staff. To Gayle Hume, who has the unenviable task of putting make-up on me to try to make me look a little better and who makes sure that I run to time, my thanks. I appreciate that. I thank camera operator Michael Ferguson, who is about four feet taller than I am and is always looking down on me. He spends his time trying to make me look better by tweaking adjustments on his camera. I think he would like me to say that it would be good to have in the House of Representatives digital cameras like the Senate has at the moment. That is a commercial. Thanks also to editor and tape operator Ken Cathcart. Members need to know something about Ken. About five weeks ago I recorded some material with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and, when I went to incorporate it in my report, the first three words that the Treasurer spoke could not be used. We thought we had panic on our hands, but editor and tape operator Ken Cathcart solved the problem. He said, 'I can fix it,' and got from another tape three words from the Treasurer and put them on the current tape. To this day nobody has known that the vision and the sound were recorded at different times. So well done, Ken. Some people might have seen some smiles on the government benches yesterday when some photographs were circulated by the Sound and Vision Office. I would just like to say that, Ken, I am aware that your girlfriend broke her toe recently and that, when you took her to hospital and the doctor asked you to stand by while the toe was being sorted out, you fainted. Well done, young man. I thank my staff in Townsville-I had to say Townsville because Townsville has not been mentioned today and it generally is mentioned every day in the parliament: Mike Wells, Liz Sawyer and Gregory Joseph Doolan. I also thank my colleague Bruce BiIIson, who sits next to me in the parliament. I know he is a Victorian but I can tell you that, when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the front-bench are here solving the problems of the nation, Bruce Billson and I are up the back of the parliament also solving the problems of the nation. If the front-bench ever needs any advice or assistance, then a Queenslander and a Victorian would be happy to give it. Mr Reith-What about the bloke on your left, though?",196
487,Mr LINDSAY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"He is a New South Wales person. Mr Speaker, I, on behalf of the new members on both sides of the House, thank you, your staff, the officers and staff of the parliament and the executive of the government for making our job so much easier this year. We do appreciate it, and we thank you very much. I finish by saying to you and to all my colleagues: happy Christmas; we look forward to a great 1997.",197
488,Mr ROBERT BROWN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I take this opportunity to say a couple of things very briefly. This is the first occasion on which valedictories have been delivered since 2 March and the departure from this parliament of the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. I appreciate the comments that were made by my good friend and colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in relation to Paul Keating. But I think it would be remiss on my part, at least, if I did not take the opportunity to say something about him. I believe, as Daryl Melham believes, that history will treat Paul Keating more than fairly and more than well. He was a person who left school, as we know, at the age of 14 and rose to the position of federal Treasurer and the national Prime Minister. He was a person who was always respected by those who related well to him and supported him; and those people who perhaps did not relate so well to him always recognised him as a man of very great vision and a man who had great ambitions for Australia. I believe it is pity that Paul Keating was not given sufficient time to realise more of those great and profound objectives and visions that he had, and undoubtedly still has-visions that I believe he was very successful in conveying also to others and to Australia as a nation. I also want to congratulate the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard). If anyone deserved to become a Liberal Prime Minister in Australia, it was John Howard. I would emphasise to all of those members of the Liberal Party who are members of this parliament and to members of the Liberal Party in the wider community that John Howard has shown more loyalty to the Liberal Party than the Liberal Party on some occasions has shown to him. In the face of what on some occasions was quite shameful treatment, John Howard persisted in that loyalty. From that point of view, if the Liberal Party had to win-and of course I would prefer that you lost all the time-then John Howard deserved to be Prime Minister. I was distressed, as I am sure everyone else was, that just so shortly after he became Prime Minister, his wife, Mrs Howard, became quite ill. I think everyone rejoices in the fact that she is recovering. I, like everyone else, hope that they, together with their family and friends, have a pleasant Christmas. I also want to refer to the present federal leader of the Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley-a man who quite clearly has absorbed the traditions, principles, objectives, goals and visions of Labor from his father, who was a great cabinet minister in a Labor government. I know that Kim senior is just so enormously proud of Kim junior, as we all are. I thought that Kim Beazley's off-the-cuff response to Mr Howard's recent speech, the State of the Nation, or his report on the government's achievements over the last nine months since it came into office on 2 March, was outstanding-absolutely outstanding. I would say to all of those new members who have come into the House that they have every right to be proud of what they have done. Someone else said that there are only a 148 of us out of 18 million, so it is an enormously important privilege. I am pleased to see how quickly it has become the practice of all of those new members to recognise that, while you are a member of this parliament, you have an absolute responsibility to pursue your principles, the principles of your party and the objectives that you would like to see achieved, with as much vigour as you can. I am delighted, of course, that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair)-the father of the House-is here at the present time. If you want to see a man who pursues, vigorously and with courage, his principles and objectives but at the same time always retains respect and consideration for others, there is an excellent example in the fellow sitting there. You can always take a lesson from him. I want to mention to all the people in the parliament, including the clerks. Someone mentioned the library. What a wonderful institution that is. What remarkably competent and dedicated professional people they are right across the board, the people who service this parliament to make it possible for this four-walled room here, occupying this particular spot on the three million square miles of Australia, to fulfil the remarkably important role that it has to. They do a remarkably good job, and their dedication is a credit to them all. Mr Speaker, in the very difficult position that you occupy, let me say that I always said Stephen Martin was a good Speaker. Stephen Martin was a good Speaker. And, Mr Speaker, let me say to you: with the objective way in which you pursue the responsibilities of Speaker here, you bring credit to that position as well. To all of you, your families, your friends and those people with whom you will be sharing the festive season, I convey my very best wishes. Do not get too comfortable over there-I told you that early in the piece. We only need a swing of four per cent back to us, and we will take government again-less than four per cent. Mr Speaker, through you, let me also advise the government that a swing of five per cent across the board back to us and we will be back on those Treasury benches with a majority of 16. So watch for it.",197
489,Mr SINCLAIR,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I had not intended to speak, but the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) prompted me into doing so for several reasons. Firstly, I do want to extend the compliments of the season to you, to your clerks and all the staff and members of this place. I also wanted to extend my thanks and congratulations on a very excellent year. The real thing I wanted to stand to do though was to say to John Howard 'Congratulations'. It is a very heady feeling. Leo MCLeay was talking about the class of 83. There are not too many in my class, Leo, and I know that over the course of the years it is remarkable the turnover of the chamber. For John Howard, the turnover has been both in the office of leader of his party and in the fluctuation from being in government to out of government, to being back into government. Indeed, with John Moore, there are only the three of us who, in fact, were in the Fraser ministry, which now seems a lifetime ago. But for John Howard it is a particularly significant occasion. He made a speech the other day which looked back on the achievements of this first nine months. Really, when you have a look at how this cycle of progress within this democracy of ours moves, it is remarkable how, in the hands of the people of Australia, there is a capacity to change the attitude, the perspective and, indeed, the fundamentals in such a dramatic way. I know that for John Howard it has been a tremendous year. I certainly wish him well and, as several have mentioned, it is wonderful that Jeanette is now well again and back to her normal state. It is also worth congratulating the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on the elegance of the way in which he is performing. It is a hell of a position to be in. Being in opposition is bad; being Leader of the Opposition is worse. They tell me there is absolutely no worse position to hold than that of Leader of the Opposition of the Labor Party, and several of those who have held that office have explained it that way. I do not doubt that Bill Hayden, perhaps more than most, would feel that to be true. Having said that, I really want to mention two other things. First, I say to all the new members in this place that I think you have acquitted yourselves remarkably well. It is a strange environment. You come from all sorts of different walks of life and you try to become a parliamentarian, and that is an enormously responsible task we all hold. We have a task to represent our constituents, which is inevitably difficult. We have a task to try to help develop policy, which is always difficult. Particularly when we come into government, we have a whole lot of policies we have prescribed, and it is hard to cut the budget at the same time as implement all those objectives to which many of us had committed ourselves when we stood for parliament. We have a responsibility then to sell back the government's policies in the electorate or, when in opposition, to try to explain why you do not think the policies of the government are correct",198
490,Mr SINCLAIR,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Well you do not, because you know how successful Australia is under the Howard government. More important than that, we also have a very real responsibility in this place to identify and pursue, through debate, the objectives that we hold. It has been a very worthwhile nine months. Parliament is now becoming more of a forum. I have long regretted the fact that the committee system has almost dominated so much of our time. While I agree with the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and pay tribute to those who work in the committee system, we all should remember that this is the place to which we are elected. We are not elected to the committees. We are not elected to do something outside of the wider community. We are, in fact, elected to be spokespersons for our electors within this federal parliament. Mr Speaker, it is for that reason that through the course of this week I have said to you that I would hope we can make it more of a debating chamber. It is important that we gauge in meaningful debate here. The final thing I want to say is that, above all, it is the people outside this parliament whom we really extend our best wishes in this Christmas season. Within the parliament we have done our best to frame laws, draft policies and introduce programs that will see them enter into 1997 in a better state than they did in 1996. The last few years have been very hard for Australia. It is not peculiarly because of politics; it is because of a world-wide recession, it is because of drought, and it is because of a downturn in quite a number of industries-certainly in those I represent. It has been because of technology and changing patterns of demand within the marketplace. For the unemployed and for so many out there in the community, the times are not going to be as easy as they might be, but there is great hope ahead. I compliment the government on the way in which it has progressed Australia over the last nine months. I see 1997 as being a year of fuller employment-not full, tragically. I see it as a time of reinvestment and a time of progress. On that note, I would like to wish all Australians-not just those within the parliament and within the parliamentary precincts but throughout the whole of this continent-a very happy Christmas and, I hope, a brighter 1997.",199
491,Mr BOB BALDWIN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Let me say that, for my first Christmas in parliament, I believe I have received most of my gifts already . We have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in whom Australia believes. Indeed, all of my backbench colleagues and front-bench colleagues believe in him and believe he is taking this country forward, providing brighter Christmases year by year. I would like to thank the Speaker, the staff and, without going through them individually, all the staff whom we work with and who make this place so pleasant to work in. Nothing ever seems to be too much for them to do for you. So for that I extend a hand of friendship and, more importantly, a heartfelt thanks. There must be a Santa Claus because this week not only have we seen interest rates come down again but also we have seen job to numbers come down again, and in the new year families will receive a $34-a-week Christmas present. Unfortunately, Christmas is also very much a sad time. At a time when it is supposed to be joyous and full of religious celebrations, it is also a sad time. I am sure my colleague from the Hunter the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) will remember the earthquake in Newcastle, a Christmas present that nobody wanted. Indeed, we remember last year when the hailstorms came through and devastated Thornton and Metford. Earlier this week we saw the same hailstorms coming through that track that wiped out Singleton. There was also the cyclone in Darwin. You see, Christmas is not always a time for rejoicing; it is also a time to think back on the sad occurrences in life, but they are occurrences which I believe make all of us much stronger for facing up to the realities of life and working through it. These are times when Australians come together, put out that hand of friendship and bond together to take forward the true spirit of Australia. It is also a time when people perhaps get a little bit reckless-and I am referring to the roads. They get a little bit full of spirit-not the Christmas type-and perhaps drive a little bit recklessly on the road. It is not only own lives they take; it is the other lives they take with them which is one of the sadder parts of holiday time. I urge all Australians think before they drive, to drink perhaps a little less before they drive. I also urge all Australians to start to think about their neighbours and their attitudes towards them. Whilst we may debate ravenously in this parliament, it is not the person on the other side whom we dislike, it is only some of the policies they put forward. That is something I think all Australians need to understand. I would like to wish everyone a merry Christmas again, particularly the Liberal Party, the people who have been stalwarts to us and the people who delivered the New South Wales team here: our state directors: Tony Nutt, his assistant John Burston, and all the team at the headquarters in New South Wales at Riley Street; my own team in Paterson, my branch presidents Robert Frost, Ben Howell, Jerry Jones, Bob Bevin, Karla MCCormack, Claire Morrison, Richard Filewood and Mark Clifton; and the assistants who come in and put in the hours of work because they believe in the party-people like Bunny Almond, and the others. We have learnt a lot in the short nine months we have been here. We have seen professionalism from our colleagues on both sides, in particular from our Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). We have learnt very hard debating skills. But one of the things we have learnt is that when we are very tired and stressed out there can still be a laugh in the corridor at the end of the day, because at the end of the day we have achieved something for all Australians. I would like to end it on that, wishing everyone a merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year.",199
492,Mr ANDREN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to add my few words on this occasion as one of the new Independent members of this House, in fact one might say the only true Independent. But on behalf of my five Independent colleagues, some of whom are out fighting a democratic battle on another front, I would like particularly to their thank you, Mr Speaker, for your support throughout this year. Your independence, as far as I am concerned, has been very well to received. I think you have had a particularly difficult job and that has been spelt out by other speakers here this afternoon. From a personal point of view, thank you very much for the support you have given me. That was instanced through the difficult times that the Independents had for a while to establish an Independent line to the speaking list. I think we won that little battle and that can only but raise the standards of democracy in this House. I think, too, my participation on the one committee I am on and the friendships I have formed there are an indication of the work that all of us can contribute to the deliberations on various issues that will impact eventually on policy. It is a wonderful facility and it is an opportunity to influence the democratic process. To Mr Howard, regarding the leadership he showed during that difficult gun debate period, I take my hat off. Much more has been said this afternoon and I can only support everything that has been said about the Prime Minister. I think the electorate, whatever political party or candidate they might support, all agree that in the Prime Minister we have a man of strength and substance who has given this country strong leadership throughout this first nine months. As I said in my first speech, when there was a viable alternative in the last election people went for that option whether it was in the House of Representatives or the Senate. I do not agree with all of the things that have been said about mandates. I think democracy is about reviewing legislation. I think we have seen some instances of that which have been of benefit, particularly with the workplace relations bill. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson)-and I do not want to patronise her-by saying some things has, I think, realised in the last few days that perhaps she has been dominated by forces outside the parliament. I am pleased to see that those influences have largely been removed. I thank, too, Mr Jenkins and Mr Nehl for the support they have given in their difficult roles as acting speaker and I thank all of the deputy speakers as well. I think if there is one thing I would like to see reformed in this House it is question time. I note that on the  standing orders be amended. I agree that the asking of questions should not exceed one minute. I suggest that that be amended so that the answers should not exceed two minutes. The public perceive questions without notice largely-except where there is truly a question without notice, often coming from the Independent side-as not being without notice; they are more often a vehicle for restating government policy. I think the public can see through it and they do not really derive a lot from it. The staff, the library staff, Jeannie Hall, the attendants, the sergeant and his staff and everybody else in the House have been particularly supportive to the Independents throughout the year. Thank you to the people of Cal are for their tremendous support. I warn that if a more proactive approach is not taken to the regions of Australia by the government there will be more Independents in this House at the next election. The one thing particularly that concerns us all is the 30 per cent youth unemployment in many of the regions. They cannot wait for the benefits of an internationalised economy to filter down to them to offer them a share of the spoils, if you like, of such an economy. I think we have to take a far more proactive role. I thank the ministers for their support to the Independents, particularly to me in this first year. I offer thanks, too, to Mr Ruddock, who is in the House, to Mr Moore, to Mr Anderson and several of the other ministers who have offered particularly supportive help to me on a number of difficult occasions. They have been most fair, non-political and totally supportive in helping my constituents with their problems. On that note, Mr Speaker, a happy Christmas to you and to yours and to all of my fellow colleagues in this House. May we all come back next year refreshed and may that animosity that sometimes arises perhaps be tempered somewhat so that we make it a far more productive House.  Speaker, my thanks to you and the role that you play. I will not go through all the list of people who have been mentioned. In politics they say that there are no second prizes. I think on this side we understood that all too well on 2 March. I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his front bench. They have now very important responsibilities to the people of Australia. I thought one of the things about going into opposition, apart from the depression of it all, was that in government it was what you did behind closed doors that really made you an effective member of the back bench. You really do not have that opportunity in opposiall tion. Apart from the leadership of Kim Beazley, so important to us because we avoided, I think, the self-destruction that may have come with such a bitter defeat, I wanted to particularly thank all the new members on our side in particular-the class of '96. Notwithstanding the defeat, they brought an enthusiasm to their role that I think geed up a lot of those who were perhaps, initially at least, focused on licking their wounds. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) made some predictions about Australia and what might happen in 1997. I would not want to take issue with him about his predictions except to say that perhaps I would disagree. But I certainly believe that 1997 will see a very different Australia from the one we have experienced under Labor. We do not often comment about the friendships that we form in this place. I would like to thank those with whom I enjoy friendships on this side of the House and particularly some of those on the other side of the House. I apologise to the government back bench that it is so large that I have yet to make the acquaintance of all of them. Mr Speaker, I wish you and all who serve this place a very happy and holy Christmas and a successful 1997. I look forward to the day when the Labor Party returns to its rightful place, I believe, back over there. Mr MCGauran-Born to rule. ",200
493,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in wishing all members and their staff a joyful Christmas and a happy, healthy and safe New Year. I take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to a number of people who have provided assistance, advice and support to me over past months. Thank you to the Deputy Speaker, Garry Nehl, and to the Second Deputy Speaker, Harry Jenkins, for your help and cooperation during the year. You have performed your duties admirably, with enormous professionalism and in an exemplary manner. My thanks also go to members of the Speaker's Panel. You certainly get a different perspective on the debate from this chair. I think all of us who have sat here during the year have had to face particular challenges and we have all benefited and learned from our experiences. I give my thanks to the staff of the parliament. I know that they face special difficulties during late night sittings. None of us operate at our best when we are tired and some of us can get a little bit testy at times. Nevertheless, our staff manage to maintain their usual cheerful demeanour and willing and efficient approach to their duties, and we all appreciate their efforts. It has not been a particularly easy year for the parliamentary staff. There have been significant reductions in all of the departments. Some experienced officers have left and this has provided additional challenges to those who remain. I refer particularly to the committee area, where new staffing arrangements were introduced. They may not be ideal, but they are the best we can manage under the circumstances. I am a great believer in and advocate of our parliamentary committee system. I would like to compliment the chairmen, members and staff of the various committees on their work and their achievements throughout the year. My special thanks go to the Clerk of the House, Lyn Barlin, whose guidance and assistance to me has been invaluable. He has proved a wise and patient counsellor to a new Speaker on a steep and rapid learning curve. He has also been a tower of strength in these times of reduced funding. His devotion to the parliament and his dedication to his duties are beyond question and the outstanding service he continues to give to the Department of the House of Representatives is without any doubt simply the best. Lyn is supported most competently by the Deputy Clerk, Ian Harris, and the Clerk Assistant, Bernard Wright, Ian Cochran and Jim Pender, and the Assistant Secretaries, Peter Gibson and Robyn MCClelland, and, of course, Monica Johnson and Elizabeth Robertson. My thanks to them all. To our Serjeant-At-Arms, David Elder, and to Dalma and Neville and the friendly helpful staff of the Serjeant's office and to the attendants who look after us so very well, thank you all for your assistance throughout the year. Our thanks also go to Anne Hazelton and the staff of the Parliamentary Relations Office. Theirs may seem a rather glamorous job to outsiders, but it involves a lot of delicate diplomacy, complicated organisation and hard slog. It is a difficult job at times, but they do it so well. To Andy Hall and his team and all the other staff of the Department of the House of Representatives, many thanks for your good work throughout 1996. To Michael Bolton and the Joint House Department and to John Templeton of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the officers and staff of their departments, I also say thank you for a job very well done. In the course of the year, I have had the opportunity to visit the bowels of the building, the basement area. Down there is a whole new world with people working away for the parliament, doing jobs that many of us are simply unaware of and which are vital for the day-today operations of the parliament. I would also give them special recognition for their efforts on our behalf, and I would suggest to all members that they, too, take time to visit the hive of activity underneath this building. It is really an eye-opener. And to the staff of the Transport Office, Narelle, Brian and their assistants, and the Comcar drivers, thank you for getting us here and getting us all home again on the regular basis that you do, plus all of the bits and pieces in between. In particular, our thanks in advance for making sure that we all make it safely away from here tonight or tomorrow, or whenever it may be, and back to our families and electorates for Christmas. To all of the other people who contribute the operation of the parliament-the caterers, the switchboard operators, the guides, the nurses, those providing the retail services to our community, the bank, Aussie's, Qantas, Lizzie's, the fitness centre, gym and swimming pool, the post office and the parliament shop, the gardeners and the cleaners; so many people who work here on the Hill, and if I have forgotten to mention any of you I apologise-most sincerely, on behalf of all members, I would like to express our gratitude to you all. Thank you also to my personal staff, Phil Bergin, Pauline Osmond, Denise Jeffs, Marie Donnelly and Carol Nichols. They are a wonderful team. But you know that. I can always count on their loyalty and support. Some of the newer members may not realise that Marie has been here since Federation, a fact about which she constantly reminds me if ever I dare trespass on her special domain, which is allocating tickets to the Speaker's Gallery. Over the years, she has earned the respect and affection of all members, spouses and staff. I know this because, when I was elected as Speaker, numerous members and staffers stopped me in the corridors to say, 'Congratulations, Bob, and I hope you are going to keep Marie.' Well, I would not have contemplated doing anything else. Finally, to all members and staff, I wish you and your families a joyful and peaceful Christmas and a happy, healthy and safe New Year. Thank you for your friendship and support during 1996 and I look forward to seeing you all back here again in 1997. Enjoy the recess. I think we all deserve it. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Motion (by Mr MCGauran) agreed to: That leave of absence be given to every member of the House of Representatives from the determination of this sitting of the House to the date of its next sitting. NA Management of the Migration Program",202
494,Mr RUDDOCK,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Berowra-Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (5.59 to p.m.)-by leave-The purpose of this statement is to inform the House of the approach the government proposes to take to deliver a planned, orderly and balanced migration program against the background of the recent Senate action to disallow a number of very sensible measures to better manage the there are migration program. The migration program inherited by the government The coalition government inherited a migration program that was out of balance and out of control. The family stream was taking up about 70 per cent of the program. The spouse category had grown by over 32 per cent while the parent category had grown by over 74 per cent. Reports of abuse of the program and of sham marriages had become commonplace. Entry standards had been reduced to such an extent that a massive pipeline of applications had deliberately been allowed to build up in some categories. This meant that the Labor Party either intended to disappoint a huge number of applicants whom they had encouraged to pay application fees or intended to increase substantially the size of the migration program to accommodate this pipeline. Without substantial tightening up of entry criteria, there would have been the inevitable 'cave-ins' and 'blow-outs' that had become the hallmark of Labor's management of the migration program-a term that was coined first by Labor minister Senator Walsh in describing the program conducted by his predecessors. Not surprisingly, community confidence in the program had reached an all time low. The government's 1996-97 migration program-restoring balance and public confidence The coalition has acted quickly to restore confidence in immigration. For 1996-97, we have announced a smaller and significantly more balanced migration program. We are seeking to return the balance in the program to one that is in the national interest. We have significantly tightened entry criteria and are looking for ways to better target the program to labour market needs. We are intent on ensuring that non-humanitarian migrants pay their own way, although I will not on this occasion again go over Labor's record in trying to sabotage this objective. The measures that we have taken are entirely consistent with the government's commitment to a non-discriminatory migration program in terms of race and related matters. Suggestions to the contrary are repugnant and are totally rejected by the government. Labor's opposition to the government's measures-Labor's record on the migration program The Labor Party has sought to sabotage the government's objective of restoring community confidence in immigration. Their outrageous actions in disallowing a number of very sensible measures have been roundly condemned as foolish and hypocritical. The actions are foolish because the government has been denied the most cost-effective and most balanced means of delivering the migration program, forcing us to rely on other means that are clearly not the preferred approach. Labor's actions have led to anomalies in the rules for entry that are the inevitable result of the opposition trying to micro-manage the immigration program. Labor's actions have led to major costs, firstly, in terms of the substantial administrative costs of new application forms, preparing and drafting regulations, changes to ADP systems and training for staff, and, secondly, in terms of the costs to clients applying to come to Australia. There will also be a major cost in revenue foregone. As the opposition is well aware, revenue foregone in the portfolio will have to be made up in some other way. Labor's actions in disallowing crucial regulation changes are hypocritical because most of the measures that were disallowed were in fact building on initiatives that Labor had themselves developed. For example: Labor introduced charging for English language tuition; Labor introduced the assurance of support bond and migrant services health charge because they knew that without a bond and health charge, the assurances of support were virtually meaningless; Labor introduced the occupations requiring English list as a selection criteria; Labor introduced fees for migration applications; Labor introduced the balance of family test for parents; Labor introduced measures that are beneficial to Australian citizens as compared with permanent residents; Contrary to the shadow spokesman's so called fact sheet, it was Labor that introduced 20 points for English in the independent category selection criteria. For Labor to now argue that an extension of any of their own initiatives is either discriminatory, anti-family or unprincipled is hypocritical indeed. The shadow spokesman for immigration has said that the government should not need to cap visa classes to deliver a balanced migration program. He argues that, after all, Labor achieved smaller migration programs in 1992-93 through to 1994-95 without using such measures. Let us look at these claims. How did Labor achieve a smaller migration program in these years? A closer examination reveals that Labor achieved a smaller migration program by using two methods. The first was to dramatically reduce numbers in the skilled categories. The skilled categories went from a high of around 52,000 in 1989-90 to a low of just over 18,000 in 1993-94. In other words, Labor cut back on the very categories that deliver the greatest economic benefits to Australia. They cut back on the categories that are most needed to ensure that the migration program has the support and confidence of the community. The second means by which Labor was able to achieve a lower migration program was as a result of driving the country into recession. Members will remember the recession that we had to have. It seems that we now know another reason why we had to have the deepest recession in 60 years. It was to enable the Keating Labor government to deliver a lower migration program. This recession meant that demand for migration to Australia declined significantly. Increasing numbers of potential migrants simply did not want to come to Australia because of the state of our economy. Indeed, demand for migration to Australia declined so far that the previous Minister for Immigration took the extraordinary step of reducing entry standards to historically low levels just to generate additional demand. As I have indicated on numerous occasions, the government is determined to deliver on our commitments to achieve a program that is clearly in the national interest. It will program with high standards of entry in the skilled categories and with high levels of integrity in the family categories. New measures to deliver a balanced migration program English language component for concessional family applicants I therefore would like to outline the new measures required to deliver a fair and balanced program. Research into the employment outcomes of migrants has consistently shown that an ability to use the English language is critical to success in the Australian labour market. It was for this reason that the coalition made a commitment in the election context to introduce points for English in the concessional family category where entry is based mainly on skill and employability factors. This measure was designed to help address the higher levels of unemployment in this category compared to the independent category which already has points for English in its selection criteria. This measure also provided points for applicants with no English but proficiency in two or more other languages. This was in recognition of Australia's increasing international orientation and the fact that an ability to learn two languages demonstrates that these people would pick up English language skills quickly. The Labor Party has disallowed this sensible measure. This has meant that apart from the anomaly that the spouses of concessional family applicants will be able to obtain points for English-because Labor were clumsy in the drafting of their disallowance motion-I am left with no choice but to use the alternative, less flexible approach of expanding the existing list of occupations requiring English-the ORE list. This mechanism, which was originally introduced by Labor and has been in place for the concessional family category since 1992, is more difficult for some to satisfy than the points for English approach that the government favours. It requires applicants with an occupation on the list of occupations requiring be a English to demonstrate that they have vocational level English, irrespective of any other attributes they may have. This means, for example, that most young and skilled applicants with no English but fluency in two or more other languages will no longer be successful. In 1995-96, around 23 per cent of applicants in the concessional family category had an occupation on the list that was in place at the time. However, occupations such as accountants, general managers and chemists are currently not on the list. It is, of course, absurd to suggest that employment in these occupations does not require English. I have therefore decided, based on consultations between my department and the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the Department of Industrial Relations, that this list should be expandcooperate ed to cover these and a number of other occupations. The measures proposed by the government to introduce points for English language for the concessional family category would have applied to applications points assessed after 1 November 1996. The less flexible existing ORE mechanism applies at a later stage of visa processing, that is, the time the application is finally decided. In introducing an extended list we want to try to avoid it impacting on people who had had their applications assessed prior to 1 November 1996 and hence have an expectation of success subject to meeting health and character requirements. To do this, I have decided to expand the ORE list to take effect for all visas decided from 1 July 1997. It is expected that most of the applications successfully assessed prior to 1 November will have been decided by then. It is estimated that around 85 per cent of applicants in the concessional family category are likely to have occupations on the expanded list. I want to assure the House that just as introduction of points for English would not have been contrary to the Race Discrimination Act, neither is an expanded list of occupations requiring English. Indeed, an analysis of the successful 1995-96 concessional family applicants who had an occupation on the ORE list shows that some 65 per cent were from so called non-English speaking countries. At this stage, the government also intends to keep the pass mark for the concessional family category at the higher level of 115 points. This is needed mainly to deal with the enormous pipeline of applications that the previous government had allowed to build up by holding pass marks at an unsustainably low level. It is also needed because in disallowing the regulations introducing points for English, the opposition omitted to disallow points for English for the spouses of concessional family applicants. Once again, I want to emphasise that the government is quite prepared to re-Iook at the anomalous situation created for the concessional family category by Labor's actions. However, we are only prepared to do so if Labor is prepared to in restoring the regulations introducing points for English for principal applicants in the concessional family category. Immediate Family of Refugees and Humanitarian Entrants to be Counted Under Those Categories From this program year onwards, the preexisting immediate families of successful protection visa holders and humanitarian program entrants will be counted as part of the humanitarian program. The fact that these people have previously not been counted in the humanitarian program is merely an accident of where they happened to be located when the primary applicant was visaed. This approach will bring us more into line with the practice of other countries with formal humanitarian programs. The government had intended that these people, because they are humanitarian entrants, should have immediate access to social security benefits if they need these. We had also intended that they should not have to pay application fees. The fact that they will not have access to certain social security benefits and that they will have to pay application fees is entirely the result of the disallowance of the relevant regulations. However, irrespective of Labor's attitude to these regulations, the government will ensure that these people have access to the usual settlement services that my Department provides to humanitarian entrants. Priorities in Processing Visa Applications I would like to advise the House that yesterday I made a general direction under section 499 of the Migration Act. This general direction to migration processing officers provides them with clear guidance on the processing priorities that the government expects them to have due regard to for applications in the preferential family category. Pursuant to section 51 and section 91 of the Migration Act, migration officers may give processing priority to applicants who are dependent children of the sponsor or orphan relatives where there are compelling or compassionate circumstances. As the government has indicated previously, we must recognise the priority of claims of those people who have made a public commitment to Australia. Hence priority will be expected to be given to processing applicants whose sponsors are Australians citizens. Similarly, parent applicants who have the majority of their family in Australia will also be able to be given processing priority over those applicants who do not have the majority of their children in Australia. Where visa applicants have been queued in the preferential family category because of a cap on that visa class being reached, the granting of visas to queued applicants when the cap is lifted will be expected to proceed on the basis of the chronological order in which an application reaches grant stage, other than in exceptional circumstances. Numerical Limits on Visa Issue in Certain Categories Combined with other measures that the government has taken to restore balance to the migration program, I am hopeful that there will be only limited need for the use of additional cap and queue measures to deliver planning levels for 1996-97. The measures I announced in July have led to a reduction in applications, particularly in the spouse category. A number of factors may have contributed, such as the knowledge of the government's intention that applications be scrutinised more closely to identify fraudulent claims and the now disallowed requirement that sponsors be Australian citizens. While at this stage it is difficult to be precise this. in terms of the preferential family category, it is likely that capping will be required this program year for aged parent and possibly spouse applications. Obviously, it would be best to use cap and queue powers for this purpose. These would enable the government to limit inconvenience and cost. I would expect that applicants who are affected by such a cap in 1996-97 would usually have to wait only a few months at most before they can obtain a visa in the new program year. By using the cap and queue mechanism, visa grant to queued applicants can be expected to proceed in an orderly fashion according to the priorities I have described. My department would be able to give clients a likely indication of when they can expect to receive a visa if they are in a capped visa class. This would enable clients to plan their travel and other arrangements accordingly. This is hardly the social engineering that the opposition spokesman has so irresponsibly described it as. However, as I have previously indicated, if the government is not supported in passing the capping legislation currently before the parliament to enable the government to use the sensible cap and queue powers, we could be left with no choice but to use the existing cap and terminate powers that are available to me and which were introduced by the former government. This would make it much more difficult to arrange for an orderly queue. It would mean that affected applicants would have to be refunded their application fees and would have to re-apply in the following program year. It would be very difficult in these circumstances to advise clients about the timing of their visa grant. Imposing such costs and inconvenience on clients is something that we would not wish to do. The House should be in no doubt, however, that the responsibility for such cost and inconvenience would lie with the opposition. To conclude, the government is committed to properly managing the migration program. We were elected to do this, and we will do The opposition has a simple choice. They can either let the government govern and provide us with the cooperation we gave them when they were in government or they can continue to spoil and vandalise this crucial area of administration. I invite the to reconsider their approach and to play a useful role in restoring community confidence in our migration program.",203
495,Mr KERR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The immigration statement of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) clearly reveals that both Labor and the coalition share the common view that we support lower immigration during periods of high unemployment. Labor, however, says that there is more than one way to skin a cat. The government of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has chosen to make families lose out. Labor won't. We think that Mr Ruddock's plan to give preference to a large intake of job competing entrants not matched with labour market shortages over Australian families is madness. The Howard government's immigration program for 1996-97 actually plans for a big increase in the number of independent migrants. By contrast, Labor delivered two years of lower immigration by making sure we gave first priority to our own. Mr Ruddock knows that all non-government senators-Labor, Democrat, Green and Independent-have not been persuaded to go along with the policy he said in opposition would cause agony. How could the Senate be persuaded to give more priority to an Indian engineer with no family connections in Australia over an Australian on an overseas working holiday who marries an Indian and wants to bring her home to raise a family? Of course the independent engineer is not needed here. We have more engineers than we could poke a stick at. This year we are expecting some 2,000 engineers to come through on an untargeted immigration program in the independent category. Mr Ruddock has not introduced any matching of the independent intake of Australian labour market skill shortages. If the engineer does get a job, it will be at the expense of an Australian trained engineer. If he or she does not, they will be trying any job. We have too many of such people who have not been targeted for labour market needs driving cabs and waiting on tablesopposition jobs school Ie avers could do. The ACTU has argued to government for a long time, not against immigration but for giving priority to training Australians to do the jobs we need and against bringing in a large pool of trained people that we have no spare jobs for. Of course, an engineer who comes in under the independent category that Mr Ruddock wishes to increase at the expense of Australian families",208
496,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Order! I ask the honourable member for Denison to refer to the minister as the minister, not Mr Ruddock.",208
497,Mr KERR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"If the engineer meets the points test, that person's husband or wife or family can come with them as part of that application while we all have to queue up, for the minister's pleasure, to issue some more spouse visas. If that independent engineer who came here was not married, he or she would probably want to one day, leading to increased pressure for chain migration. What a silly choice the Minister has made and how totally at odds with what the coalition sensibly said before the last election. Before the last election the coalition said that ""dependents of the family unit must receive priority over annual immigration intakes"" and said that the coalition ""does not consider that there should be any significant variation of the immigration intake at this time"". Mr Howard and Mr Ruddock have since got it wrong. Keeping Australian families separated and bringing in, in preference, people with no ties to Australia to try to take their jobs is not the way to restore confidence in the program. I tum to some of the statements that are in the ministerial statement because they reveal a complete contrast between what the coalition said immediately preceding the last election and what they are now seeking to do. The Liberal and National Party coalition's immigration policy published on 9 February 1996 is my source document. In the minister's to take statement today he says: The coalition government inherited a migration program that was ... out of control. The coalition's policy document said: Immigration has varied considerably from its high levels in the late 80' s to its lower levels in the early 90's. Given current circumstances, lar continued unacceptably high levels of unemployment, the immigration intake, in the near term, should remain at around its current levels. The Coalition does not consider there should be any significant variation in the immigration intake at this time. Then the minister attacked the Labor Party for what he says is the family stream taking up 70 per cent of the program. What did the coalition say before the election about the family program? They said: The family unit is the foundation of our society, and must be at the core of immigration (and settlement) policy. Although the definition of family may differ from one culture to another, for recent settlers the importance of the immediate family unit (husband, wife, dependent children) as the primary organ of support and dependence is paramount. Our goal, wherever possible, is to reunite dislocated families. Dependants of the family unit must receive priority in our annual immigration intakes. The minister made allegations that the program was widely rorted. In the coalition's pre-election statements, he said, accurately: There remain limited instances in the community of the use of spouse sponsorship for other than bona fide relationships. We have always accepted that. There was a film in the United States about people who sought to abuse the green card system there. It will occur. But we have supported and endorsed every step the minister has put forward to control any fraud in the program. The minister was accurate before the election when he said that there are limited circumstances. Turning now to humanitarian and refugee programs, the minister is now going to roll the extended families of people who come here in the humanitarian and refugee program into the program itself. On top of a reduction of the program from a baseline of 13,000 to 10,000, this will mean the program will be reduced by another 30 per cent approximately. So, effectively, the coalition government has halved the humanitarian and refugee program. But what did it say before the election in its own manifesto? It said: The refugee and humanitarian program will continue to be an essential element under a Coalition Government. in particu- It also said: We reaffirm our commitment not to reduce the refugee component of this program. In his statement, the minister claims that for 1996-97 he has achieved a smaller and significantly more balanced migration program. The fact is that two of the three years of the Keating government brought in a significantly lower program. The minister knows he can bring in a lower program without the need for the draconian measures he now threatens. Contrast the minister's claims about what was the state of the migration program before the coalition took office. On the one hand, he says demand was slowed because of the recession. He said: This recession meant that demand for migration to Australia declined significantly. Increasing numbers of potential migrants simply did not want to come to Australia because of the state of our economy. Then, on the other hand, he accuses us on page 6 of his statement when he says: At this stage, the government also intends to keep the pass mark for the concessional family category at ... 115 points. This is needed mainly to deal with the enormous pipeline of applications that the previous government had allowed to build up .... The applications went down, but the pipeline built up. How absurd! Then we have an attack on language, entirely contrary to their pre-election policy formulation and contrary to the very good speech that former Liberal minister Ian Viner gave in Adelaide just a couple of days ago. Ian Viner said: For public policy to deny or to devalue the linguistic diversity of the population is not only to deny the value of cultural diversity but to deny to migrants the very freedoms which Australia has invited them to enjoy from the moment that they have been invited to live here. I think Mr Viner was making some very pointed comments. Mr Ruddock in his statement also says: ... if the government is not supported in passing the capping legislation ... we could be left with no choice but to use the existing cap and terminate powers that are available to meand this is the most self-deceptive, if nothing else, statement of the ministerand which were introduced by the former government. Let us look at what he said about family formation. When Labor in Government dealt with the immigration bill, Mr Ruddock spoke about that and said: I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through the year, 'We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia-no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents'. I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups. In fact what we did in government was to put into the Migration Act two provisions which expressly said that the power is not to be exercised against immediate family. Section 84 and 85 of the migration act state, regarding those powers to suspend or to determine maximum numbers of visas: . . . does not have any effect in relation to an application for a visa made by a person on the ground that he or she is the spouse, dependent or aged parent of: (a) an Australian citizen; or (b) the holder of a permanent visa ... If Mr Ruddock proceeds down this path, he is heading for litigation, he is heading for a contest and he is putting the interests of foreigners with no relationship to Australiapeople who have no connections with this country-ahead of our own, ahead of our own people who go overseas and wish to marry, who have dependent children or who wish to give care to their elderly parents. The minister is also obviously seeking to abuse the intent of the Migration Act. Section 51 does allow the minister to consider applications in such order as he considers desirable. This section puts that in context when it says: (2) The fact that an application has not yet been considered or disposed of although an application that was made later has been considered or disposed of does not mean that the consideration or disposal of the earlier application is unreasonably delayed. That is there to enable the minister to process matters in an appropriate way. It is not there to give effect to a policy that the minister clearly cannot get through a parliament which will not accept his priority in relation to giving people from overseas, who have no connection with this country, priority over our own. The minister cannot do this either. Section 47 of the act says that the minister is obliged to consider a valid application for a visa. The minister knows these things, but he is being sent on an errand now to pursue an agenda other than his own. Contrary to his own previous statements, contrary to the national interest, contrary to his party's pre-election platform-a platform which was out there in black and white, a platform which went into all these measures in considerable detail, which was circulated widely amongst all elements of the Australian community-he now turns around and acts entirely contrary to the directions that he set out before the election campaign. In conclusion, we believe that, if a choice has to be made, if we are going to have low immigration-and both sides of politics agree child there is to be low immigration at times when Australia does face high unemployment-the Howard government has chosen to make families lose out; Labor will not.

501,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Werriwa) (8.00 p.m.)Before the dinner break and the valedictories, the Labor Party was outlining its opposition to any government move to abolish the taxation concessions on cooperative companies. We do so for very sound reasons, and encourage National Party members to join our support for the cooperative movement around Australia. Noting that the Golden Circle pineapple cannery in Brisbane in the suburb of Northgate employs some 750 to 1,700 people, depending on seasonal requirements; noting the strength and importance of the Mackay Sugar Mills and that 42 per cent of all sugar mills in Australia are cooperative companies; noting the importance to beef, to the dairy industry of United Milk in Tasmania-$170 million in sales last year, employing 400 people; and noting the importance of the cooperative companies to the strength of regional Australia, it is worth asking: what is the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) doing by way of support for Golden Circle? What is the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) doing by way of support for United Milk? What are the Queensland National Party members doing to support the cooperatives in their electorates-for instance, the electorate of Capricornia? There are two very important cooperatives in the seat of Dickson; the Fairfax electorate has two cooperatives; the Fisher electorate has eight; the Groom electorate has three; the Hinkler electorate has three very important cooperatives, including the large South Johnston Mill; the electorate of Kennedy has seven; the Longman electorate has five, the Maranoa electorate has eight; and the Wide Bay electorate has 14. These 8 p.m. cooperatives are the backbone of the agricultural marketing industry in the state of Queensland. It is very distressing that National Party members have given no more than lip-service to their support for the cooperative companies. We have had the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) in her local papers saying in the Bowen Independent on 11 December, 'I want to state categorically that I did not vote in favour of this amendment to the taxation act. In fact, I spoke against the bill saying I am not in favour of the changes.' These are important matters. Mr Costello interjecting",211
502,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"For the benefit of the Treasurer, who would not understand the importance of cooperatives to regional Queensland, he should understand what his coalition colleagues are saying in their electorates about his policy. They are canningMr Costello-We heard all this last time.",211
503,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"You would know all about repetition. You are the master of rehearsed repetition. It is the only thing you ever say in this place. The power of repetition is your only point of debate. It is worth stating that Queensland National Party members are canning the Treasurer (Mr Costello) around their electorates for this harsh and unacceptable policy. The member for Dawson deserves special mention in the House. She has told people in her electorate that she did not vote against this measure because of the pecuniary interest concern. She used a false alibi understanding order 196. Standing order 196 states that the member should only abstain from the vote if this was a matter other than public policy. Of course it is public policy. It is government policy. It is the Treasurer's policy to do in the Mackay Sugar Mills in the electorate of Dawson. There is absolutely no reason under the standing orders of this House why the member for Dawson should properly abstain from the vote. She has set up a false alibi as the only reason she can give people in her electorate for not voting against this particular measure. The Labor Party is strongly in support of cooperatives. I mentioned earlier in debate that it is a strange divide that has emerged in 1996 in Australian politics. It is the Labor Party and the other non-government groupings in the Senate that are supporting, in the words of Senator Margetts, 'Agrarian, small commodity capitalism,' which is a pretty good way to describe the importance of the cooperative movement around Australia. The Treasurer is not supporting those industries; he is not supporting jobs; he is not supporting the Australian ownership of cooperatives. His measure, which is placing these firms at a competitive disadvantage, is opening the door to foreign ownership. For that, he is to be condemned by the House.",211
504,Mr ADAMS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"This Senate amendment relates to items 17 and 18 in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996. The proposal in the original bill was to remove the tax deduction that cooperatives have long been able to claim for government loans used in the purchase of assets. In order to help these cooperatives gain their place and to add value in regional Australia, these tax arrangements were put in place about 60 years ago. Of course, it is regional Australia which needs to have these opportunities to value add to its dairy products, to its sugar and to its fruit. I am very concerned, like others who have spoken to these amendments, that the National Party has failed to give them support. The opposition here-the Labor Party-has done what the National Party could not do. We actually stepped into the breach and did the job. We have successfully moved an amendment in the Senate to repeal the subsection and replace it. This is a win for the opposition and members in regional areas will benefit from this win. The National Party has failed its constituency. Once it was a party that went into bat for regional Australia, now it is a party that is not prepared to stand up for regional Australia. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) is rolling through. Liberal members in regional seats have also been rolled over. They won't stand up. The lack of fight in the present backbench of this government is very frightening for regional Australia. Many farmers and people in rural and regional areas who are just recovering from drought-some, of course, now from flood-would have been affected if these amendments had not been made. But we understand that the Treasurer is basically saying that in the future he will get over these amendments and make the changes to the law that he wants. I am concerned that these cooperatives are now under threat from foreign capital that will come into Australia and which will take over these cooperatives in the future. So all the regional areas with co-ops will lose that local ownership that exists within their regions and that will be taken over by foreigners. The foreign capital will flow in and take over these co-ops. That will be on the heads of the National Party and these regional members of the Liberal Party. They stand condemned, like my colleague from Tasmania the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who really did not stand up for UMT, the 400 workers within that plant in Braddon and some of the farmers who feed into those cooperatives from my electorate. It is a very lame duck approach to giving representation to your region. Of course, we all know that in Australia today regions are under attack and they need to be given strong representation. We are certainly not getting that from government members. They are being run over by the front-bench, they are being run over by the Treasurer, and they are failing to do what they were sent here to do by the people within their regions. Coming from a regional seat, I understand that regions have got real problems. They are in real difficulties. Without this amendment which we have been able to get up, these cooperatives would have serious problems. As I said, I believe that in the future, foreign capital will come into take over our cooperatives and the Treasurer will assist that in the future. I understand the fruit cooperatives in northnatural ern New South Wales and the sugar mills-I think 42 per cent of them in Queensland are cooperatives-will be under attack in the future from foreign capital. That foreign capital will come in at the behest of the National Party or those Liberal members from regional seats, who will not stand up for them.

505,Mr COSTELLO,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I move: That amendment No.4 be agreed to. I have already addressed this amendment during my remarks on Senate amendment No. 3.,213
506,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Again, this is a proposition that we had put in the House of Representatives and tried to get the government to endorse before it went across to the Senate. It was a proposition that, had they allowed it to go to a vote on other than the night on which they gagged it, would have seen a crossing of the floor by at least one National Party member; and that is the reason that they sought to gag it on the night. Effectively, what the government was seeking to do by this measure was to save $12 million in the budget by introducing a new tax on rural debt. This from a government that says, 'No new taxes'; this from a government that says it has concern for our rural communities; this from a government that says it wants to ease the burden on rural communities; and this from a government that says it is committed to regional economic development. We know how committed it is to regional economic development. The first act of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) was to abolish his own department. It is now a joke to refer to him as the Minister for Transport and Regional Development because the only significant act he has taken is to abolish his own department. He scrapped the regional development program, they have cut services to the bush; and this was just another dig at rural Australia. This was another dig at the basis upon which those communities could value add the resource base and get themselves into the game. It is a recognition that because their shareholders were their members-not the stock market and not those who finance, but their members-they needed some additional assistance to level the playing field, because the financial markets would not treat them in the same way as another company competing with them. Yet here we have the Treasurer (Mr Costello) talking about the need to assist the growth of Australian businesses, the growth of small businesses, the growth of regional communities, and he takes this nasty little step. It is only worth $12 million, but he has not given up on it. He has already been back in this parliament with gritted teeth. You know the way he talks when he doesn't like things, when things are going against him, when he has been done, when he has been rolled-he comes in with gritted teeth and simply says, 'We have to pass it tonight but wait until next time, because we'll be back next time, we'll move it next time.' The reality is that we will oppose you next time, too, because the only reason this measure has been defeated is that Labor stood up against it. Labor sought to use the opportunity in the House and it has been successful in the Senate. Your own coalition colleagues tried to talk you out of this, but you would not have any of it. You ignored their calls, you ignored the reality. You persisted with the budget bottom line, regardless of the consequences. Not only that; when this debate was on in the House on the last occasion, they gagged it. I have got my criticisms of the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). On the night that we debated it last, he was celebrating. He had got his industrial relations legislation through because of the deal with the Democrats. He was out celebrating. He left the management of this affair to the Treasurer to get the issues through the parliament and the Treasurer bungled it as badly as the Leader of the House, rather than allowing debate on this and allowing the free expression of opinion from the cross-benches. I cannot see one National Party member in this House tonight. They should be in here applauding what Labor has done in getting cooperatives saved. They should be in here applauding what Labor has done in ensuring that cooperatives can expand their business operation. They did listen to some of their own backbench, but they did not heed the call. It is only Labor that has run the agenda and only Labor that stands proud here today in saying that we have delivered support for cooperatives and their ability to continue. It is going to have a significant impact for the cooperative movements in Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. But so far as the Treasurer is concerned, they could have all gone to hell. The fact of the matter is that he is still in this place arrogantly telling us, 'Wait until next time, wait until the next opportunity and we will reintroduce it.' (Time expired)",213
507,Mr BEVIS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The interesting thing about the comments of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in introducing amendment No.4 was that he decided not to take up the invitation to address the question of his intentions next year. During the course of the debate on amendment No.3 he was invited to clear up the concern that is evident from his earlier comments that, in fact, this is really a ruse to tide him over until next year when he hopes to have the numbers to roll the people in his own party again who do not support his views on this matter and cobble up a majority in the Senate, if he can, so that he can put the matter through the Senate some time during 1997. It is interesting that he did not take the opportunity to clear that up. I think his silence speaks volumes in terms of his intentions in that respect. I think it is worth recalling what the cooperatives themselves have been saying to the government on this matter. The National Cooperative Council of Australia wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) expressing their concern about what this government was proposing to do. They pointed out that cooperatives are, by definition and structure, locally owned, private Australian business operations who play significant roles in the export of value added primary production. They made some interesting observations about the effects of the government's planned imposition of a new tax on them. They said. The cooperatives' ability to raise development capital is restricted and has in some instances seen the cooperatives tum to public listing and subsequently multinational ownership. Governments for 66 years have recognised the need for an alternative means for such cooperatives to raise development capital and have supported the maintenance of section 121 (c) since its national introduction in 1930. That is, everyone except this Treasurer. Everyone except this Treasurer is driven by an ideological commitment to see his view of the private sector imposed upon all in the community. The National Cooperative Council of Australia made another telling observation about the effects of this government's policy when they said: A number of large cooperatives have had takeover offers from multinational companies in recent years. Those same predator companies are also buying strategic holdings of land and vertically integrated processors for the goods that those cooperatives produce. Directors of the cooperatives would have little alternative at law but to recommend acceptance and sell out regional businesses if the government takes away the incentives for cooperatives to remain as Australian businesses. That is the effect of what the Treasurer wanted to do. That is the effect of what he forced through this parliament and what would have occurred but for the intervention of the Labor Party and its amendment in the Senate and the support we received from the minor parties. The simple fact is that the policies driven by this government, particularly by this Treasurer, are designed knowingly to see the shift of resources from cooperatives not just into the private sector but inevitably into multinational hands. The evidence is there already, the cases are there already and there is the vertical integration already occurring areas in which these cooperatives operate. Of course, these cooperatives operate in the primary sector-the primary industry: sugar, dairy products, meat products and fruit products. They operate in the traditional country growing areas-areas which the National Party once took some pride in representing. Many of those cooperatives that rely upon this benefit are in Queensland. In fact, the overwhelming majority of cooperatives in Australia that are involved in the primary sector are in Queensland. It is more than passing strange that this House is populated with so many Liberal and National Party members from Queensland. There are more Liberal and National Party members from Queensland than there are Liberals from Victoria. All bar two of the federal seats in Queensland are held by Liberal and National Party members. How do they repay that support they got at the March election? They repay it by turning on regional Queensland and inflicting upon them imposts in costs which would inevitably result in the loss of their cooperatives, the loss of the primary producers in ownership of those lands and seeing consumers faced with the prospect not of being able to buy locally owned, locally grown produce put through the farmers' cooperative, but locally grown, foreign owned, foreign processed food and product that would be put through the balance sheets of companies abroad. That is the way in which the Liberal-National Party government has repaid the support it got from regional Queensland. Members in this parliament from Queensland and regional centres have not come into the parliament to even raise a voice against it in this debate. (Time expired)",214
508,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Werriwa) (8.21 p.m.}-The Labor Party is supporting Senate amendment No.4. This is an amendment which not only preserves the existing taxation concessions for cooperative companies but actually enhances them. One would have thought that, on an occasion when the future of cooperatives are being enhanced through actions of the Labor Party, some National Party members would be present in the chamber to add their voice of in approval to our particular amendment. This provision will clarify the meaning of section 121(c). There has been confusion. It was expressed no better than by Mr Howard, a Mr Howard who actually supports cooperative companies. He appeared before the Senate legislation committee. He was representing the Cooperative Council of Australia and the Cooperative Federation of Queensland. He had this to say: As a point of clarification, I draw attention to the section of the act that refers to the acquisition of assets, which quite clearly says 'or that can be from the government or somewhere else'. Unfortunately, that has not been an interpretation that the Australian Taxation Office has been placing on 121(c). It has been saying that the cooperative must acquire assets from a government in order to write off a loan from that particular government source. This amendment clarifies the meaning so that the taxation concession will apply to the acquisition of assets from government sources or non-government sources. Very clearly, the parliament is making its intention known to the Taxation Office. The opposition is pleased that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is supporting this particular Senate amendment. It must be appreciated that it is only under sufferance. It is not a change in government policy; it is only a recognition that the Senate has him over a barrel. On other issues he has tried to beat his chest and make loud noises about his determination to do them over. Now they have got him over a barrel and he is rolling right over. But it does not signify a change in government policy. That is the important thing to understand for all the supporters and employees of cooperative companies around Australia. The Treasurer has not ruled out the introduction of legislation next year consistent with the policy he announced on budget night to do away with section 121(c). All he has recognised is the folly of trying to roll eight unrelated measures into an omnibus bill-the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3)-and the fact that the Senate has made these amendments and has put him over a barrel. He is going to do nothing more than try to secure some of the savings on R&D-savings that the Labor Party has opposed-but has not ruled out a change in government policy on cooperatives. That is a very important thing. Without a change of policy and without a recognition of the importance of cooperative companies to regional Australia, there can be no security for those ventures nor their employees. That is the very important thing. The Treasurer should now be announcing a change of government policy. Next year he will not attempt to abolish section 121 (c) of the tax act. Not only that, but he will also accept the virtue of a clear definition of its provisions so that the assets can be acquired both from government and non-government sources. The Labor Party is doing these things because we believe in the future of cooperative companies. We believe in Australian ownership in the food industry in these cooperative ventures that have been supported by government for some 60 years under the provisions of 121(c). We also note that any clarification of the meaning of the clause would be a low cost to the government. We know the cost is not large because the government itself would not be saving a lot of money by its original plan to abolish the provision. The government would be saving no more than $2 million for this financial year by its plan to abolish 121(c)-no more than $6 million in a full year. So for such a small amount of money so much damage would have been done to regional Australia and to the cooperative movement in Australia. They were facing slow death without the rescue action of the Australian Labor Party. The government is trying to save nothing more than $2 million and putting people out of work in regional Australia, all at a time when it can find half a million dollars to do up Kirribilli House for the convenience of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)-the nicest piece of public housing in Sydney, the only piece of public housing this government has tried to support during its nine months in office: the public housing of the Prime Minister on the harbour side, Kirribilli House in Sydney. They can find $500,000 to move the old Speaker's chair from Old Parliament House to this chamber. They can find $50 million to $80 million a year for taxation concessions for tollway companies and big banks for the construction of tollways, but they cannot find $2 million for cooperative companies. (Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative.",215
509,Mr COSTELLO,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That amendment No.5 be agreed to. In essence, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) has secured major savings for the Commonwealth through the agreement of the Senate both to abolish syndication and to reduce the rate of deduction under R&D from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. We welcome the fact that the Australian Democrats in the Senate supported the Liberal government in closing down rorting under syndication. We also note that the Labor Party, because it had introduced syndication, even though it was aware that it was now leading to rorting, was unwilling to take action to protect the revenue. We give the Labor Party the benefit of the doubt that it made the decision in error. It probably would have liked to reconsider it but, because of the position taken by some of their spokesmen, they were unable to do so. The fact is that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) has now secured savings to the Commonwealth in relation to R&D matters in the vicinity of $2.2 billion over a period of four years. That was the essence of this bill and, by its passage through the Senate against the opposition of the Australian Labor Party, the government has secured savings of $2.2 billion in relation to R&D alone. The Labor Party will of course be upset that it was unable to sabotage those savings and it will of course be upset because the government has proved so successfully spectacular in securing the passage of this budget bill. I do want to thank the Australian Democrats for their support in relation to syndication and the Independents, who also supported the government. This was one of the major savings of the budget. Every effort was made to try to sabotage it, but the activities of the opposition were unsuccessful. The bill has come back to the House amended by the Senate in a way that would allow companies individually registered under the IR&D Act to join together as partnerships for the purpose of sharing the tax benefits arising out of their collective R&D activities. The Senate has agreed to those parts of the bill which prevent the IR&D Board from registering companies jointly-that is, syndicates after 23 July 1996-subject to some quite generous transitional arrangements. However, leaving the income tax partnership rules intact could have the potential to enable syndicate-like arrangements to continue under the form of partnerships. This would be contrary to the Senate's decision to end syndication. The government will not oppose the Senate's amendment to the partnership proposals. However, to give full effect to the removal of syndication, the government will move to ensure that arrangements in the form of a partnership cannot be used to recreate the features of syndicates that have operated as generous tax shelters costly to the revenue. Necessary legislation effective from 8.30 p.m. today, 13 December, will be introduced by the government in the first sittings of the parliament in the new year. The government has discussed these issues with the Australian Democrats, and they agree in principle with its approach. The government will consult the Australian Democrats on the precise wording of the required legislative amendments prior to their introduction into the parliament.",216
510,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been rolled again. The Treasurer came into this place as recently as yesterday and said, 'We are a government committed to ending syndication,' and he is back in the House tonight telling us not only that he has partially reversed the decisionthat partnerships are still in, that $160 million of syndicated R&D will go ahead-but also that they still have not got the legislation right. He has introduced a new piece of legislation from tonight which they cannot bring into the parliament until next year. Do you ever get it right? The trouble with you, Treasurer, is you shoot from the hip. You do not think. You come in with the smarmy lines. You come in with the quick lines. The problem with the Treasurer is that he is a clone-he does not like to admit it-of the former Labor Treasurer, Paul Keating, the person he used to denigrate. I think he goes home at night and watches replays of the former Prime Minister's performance in question time. He believes that the only forum he has to attend in this parliament is question time. In fact, you can go through his question time performances and almost match them line for line with what Paul Keating used to say. This is the person who said that he was going to be really different. But he is the same. No wonder Jeff Kennett is so derogatory of you. No wonder Jeff Kennett has said this is a government without industry policy. No wonder Jeff Kennett said, 'Reverse the decision on R&D and syndication.' I bet you he has had something to do with you being rolled in the Senate this week. That is what has happened. Let us understand the importance of this amendment that has come back to us. The Treasurer talked about the essence of his legislation, but let me tell you what the essence of R&D and syndication is. It is about getting small groups together. It is about recognising that it is not just the big companies that invest in research and development in this country, but small groups that cannot of themselves raise the capital. Nor, because they have just started up in business, can they claim a tax deduction. It is for that reason that what syndication does is enable them to use the tax loss and carry it forward through groupings to get into real research and development in this country. This is a government that talks about the need to encourage venture capital, yet has cut off one of the very important mechanisms by which venture capital financed itself in this country. The essence of R&D is collaboration. Why do you think we have the cooperative research centres, which you have kept? Why do you think we needed syndicated R&D? It is because the smaller companies could not avail themselves of the same benefits as the larger ones availed themselves of. This government has attempted to abolish syndication without any understanding of what it really means. This is a government that runs around the country saying, 'We are abolishing syndication because they are into rorts.' Yet not one rort has been proven. Not one! The Treasurer put his name to a press release with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) when these schemes were abolished talking about actual examples of research and development, actual examples of rorts-four examples. Do you remember them, Treasurer? He is not looking. Usually he is the first one to respond to an interjection, but he has got his head buried in something else. Mr Latham-He's lost his bark.",217
511,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"He has lost his bark and lost his bite because he has got rolled.

Most of his head was usually a red idiotic slobbering grin of appreciation of his own silliness. That is the quote. (Time expired)",218
521,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I always enjoy The Loaded Dog story, as I think most people in the chamber do, including those in the advisers box. The only person not smiling is the member for Higgins (Mr Costello). The rest of us enjoy that story a great deal. The serious matter, of course, in amendment No. 5 is making the point that running down R&D is not an answer to Australia's economic problems. Running down the clever country agenda is not an answer to Australia's economic dilemmas. There is no doubt that there are many failings in the government's budget strategy, but running down R&D and running down the clever country agenda is foremost among those failings. In a country like ours there are limits on fiscal policy. I think both sides of politics now recognise the limits on fiscal policy. With unacceptable national savings it is very hard for Australia to grow faster than its trading partners without getting a spillover on the external account. You do not necessarily have to drive down spending power, as this government is doing with its budget strategy, but you do want to keep it in a nice balance, understanding the limits of fiscal policy with regard to the external account. So in those circumstances, of course, both sides of politics support higher national savings. The one thing that becomes critical in those circumstances is to get the exogenous boost to growth-to get the boost to growth that does not come out of the business cycle; to get the boost to growth that does not come out of spending power; to get the boost to growth that does not come out of the simple functionings of supply and demand in the economy; to get the boost to growth that only comes from productivity, that only comes from being a clever country, that only comes from getting research and development, that only comes from getting innovation. That is what you have to do to lift Australia higher in its growth cycle. To run down R&D, to cut university funding and to cut. the funding for research centres have to be the dumbest things that any government could ever do in Australia's economic circumstances. You have the limit on fiscal policy; you have the limit on the external account. The one thing you have to do in Australia's circumstances is get the exogenous boost to growth-the exogenous growth theory. You have to get the boost to growth that does not come out of the normal workings of the business cycle. You get it from having a strong and growing university sector-not by locking out 500 young students from the University of Western Sydney through budget cuts. You want to get the boost to productivity and growth that comes from R&D, from innovation in the private sector. You do not get it from cutting research centres and you do not get it from running down the taxation concessions available for research and development. So this is a dumb thing to do. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) is following dumb policy whenever he runs down R&D, whenever he runs down universities, whenever he runs down research centres and whenever he runs down the opportunity for the Australian economy to enjoy the exogenous boost to growth. I know he has problems with these concepts because, when he rolled in as Treasurer on 3 March and the Treasury put all those papers in front of him, it all looked so confusing. They have a very limited model. They have a model that does not really believe in a boost to growth that comes outside the conventional model, a boost to growth that comes from outside, exogenous to the normal economic model. Over at the Treasury they do not have these things factored in, so he is not getting his mind around them. When they present him with the dictum that any cut is a good cut, he forgets that every single cut is different and that every cut to the budget has a different impact on the economy. The dumbest cuts, the worse cuts of all, are to cut research and development, to cut university funding and to cut research centres. They are the dumbest things that any government can do in Australia's economic circumstances. So the Treasurer has trouble getting over these concepts; they were not laid out there in that big mass of papers that looked so confusing on 3 March. He has not got his mind around them, and that is why he needs to read up on some of these exogenous growth theories, some of the new economic thinking that he will not find in the Treasury department. The exogenous growth theories will highlight that, in Australia's circumstances with the fiscal limits, the possibility of spillover effects on the external account and the issues concerning national saving, the smart thing to do is to be a clever country-to boost R&D, to boost universities, to boost research centres, to get a boost to growth in productivity from outside the conventional economic model, from outside supply and demand and spending power, to get the boost that can only come from being a clever country. So why does the Treasurer want to run down R&D? Why doesn't the Treasurer want Australia to be a clever country? What sort of government would cut university funding to the bone, all because of flawed dogma, believing that every cut is a good cut? Some cuts can be very bad and actually be counterproductive to the economy, and this is one of them. It should be reversed. (Time expired)",218
522,Mr ADAMS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I guess that this government has taken the Treasury line. That is why this cut has occurred to R&D and why syndication is being attacked as a rorting sort of approach to R&D. But I would like to point out how in a practical sense-when you get away from the Treasury line and into practical operation-this is affecting my electorate. My electorate has a copper mine, Mount Lyell at Queenstown, which operated for 100 years with four generations of miners. The company that was there with a lease decided that it was time to leave. They had been putting their tailings in the river for 100 years. It was one of the last rivers in the world, I think, to still have tailings in it. There was an agreement made with the state government that the lease would go. That company left Queenstown, the town that had been dependent on mining for over 100 years. But another company had the courage to come in, meet the environmental standards and build new tailing dams. It has taken on mining copper and small quantities of gold from Mount Lyell in the belief that there is still plenty of copper there below the original ore body. To do so they need the opportunity to develop, through their research and development, a new process of obtaining the copper from the ore without having to ship out the ore to other countries. They want to do that. They were in syndication and battling to achieve their goal by using a leaching process-with a bacterium, I believe-to get the copper out of the iron ore. And they were fair dinkum. They were in syndication with several other companies to achieve their goal. They were putting in, and they were paying to do this with the opportunity of claiming their 150 per cent. The project would probably be worth 40 jobs in the longer term to people on the west coast of Tasmania, a place where jobs do not come that easily. In my electorate-the west coast-jobs are hard to come by, and this was an opportunity to generate more jobs. Mr Crean-Off their traditional strength.",219
523,Mr ADAMS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"From their traditional strength of mining copper, and lots of things come from that once you have achieved that goal. Further up the road there is a tin mine. They also were working on opportunities to extract tin from their ore through a different process, and they were looking into some innovative ways of dealing with their old tailing dams. Now that too has been put at risk because of this cut to syndication that been accepted by this government. I cannot understand why a government would seize on this very assistance to industry which is getting industry into being innovative and looking at new ideas, which is getting industry to where it should be and where it should be going, and which is an encouragement to our industries. But by taking this line the government has acted in a very backward way. I understand that some of our competitors in the Asian region actually give 200 per cent in R&D tax concessions to some of their companies-and to some of our companies if they want to go. That is only encouraging our companies to go offshore and do their R&D overseas. I think that is a real failure on the part of this government. That is how it is affecting my electorate in a real way. It is costing me and my electorate about 40 jobs--40 jobs in a region where jobs are hard to get, as they are right through this country. I think the government stands condemned for this attitude. There is no substance to their arguments about rorting and they have come up with very shallow excuses for taking this action. I think it is a major failing of this Treasurer (Mr Costello) to just pick up a line and run with it to save a certain amount of money which has major effects on our industries. (Time expired)",220
524,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise again because I was interrupted during my last intervention. There are a couple of points I would like to make. I note that the significance of this amendment is that it does allow partnerships to effectively get into the cooperation arrangement for research and development. To the extent to which the essence of R&D was getting cooperation, we have been able to preserve an element of it through partnerships. Therefore, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has not succeeded in his grand stated claim that he was going to abolish syndication. I was interested to note that, when the Treasurer was introducing this amendment and saying that they supported it, he said that the government would be making sure through legislation that this provision could has not be used to recreate the syndicated proposals of before. What is very interesting in that regard is that the Labor Party moved this amendment in the Senate last night to insert 'unless the financing of the proposed research and development expenditure is to be fully at risk and not involve any element of a guaranteed return to any investor', and the government voted against it. Here we have a Treasurer saying that there are rorts which he cannot ever justify while he puts out fraudulent examples. I say 'fraudulent examples' because we had Minister Moore the other day saying, when I asked him why he had used 'actual examples' when they were not actual: ... I am prohibited from giving precise examples. These are examples of what happened in every casebut wait for thiswith the finer details changed to fit the occasion. In other words, the Wright family had moved into research and development syndication! Here is the Treasurer talking about honesty, openness and legitimate rorts, yet he puts up fraudulent examples. Some example! You ought to be ashamed of yourself for introducing fraudulent cases to justify your abolition of syndication. The fact remains that you voted against our proposed amendment to ensure that there had to be an 'at risk' circumstance and there could not be any element of guaranteed return to any investor. What hypocrisy! You come into this place saying that you want genuine research and development, that you want risk, that you do not want guaranteed returns, but as soon as we move an amendment in the parliament to that effect, you vote against it. The other point I will dwell on is the crowing of the Treasurer, saying how much the government have saved by abolishing research and development syndication. Let us look at what the abolition of syndication saves the budget over four years. Their original proposal was $670 million, but from that has to be deducted the $340 million which has gone into the START program. So at best you have a net $330 million, from which you now have to deduct, as a result of the next amendment that you are going to cop-another one that you have been rolled on-another $160 million for research syndication. In other words, your great savings from abolishing research and development syndication are, at best, $170 million over four years. You have thrown the baby out with the bathwater for that amount of money. You have tried to argue that there are billions of dollars of savings in this, but you cannot substantiate it. I would be interested in the Treasurer telling me where the great savings are in the abolition of syndication. The fact of the matter is that your big savings come from abolishing the 150 per cent tax concession, which you have taken down to 125 per cent. Syndication saves you very little, yet your great railing in public has been the need to abolish syndication. You have failed in that regard and you have fraudulently pursued your case. (Time expired)  port the Senate amendment. I, like other speakers on this side of the House, see the future of manufacturing industry-the expansion of the manufacturing industry and manufacturing industry reaching its potential-as very much a function of the extent to which industry is prepared to invest in research and development. This is a key issue not only in terms of industry policy but also in terms of jobs. I understand that these measures affect taxation. It is very appropriate to have the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the House putting these amendments through. What I find extraordinary is the absence from the chamber of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). Mr Crean-He doesn't like being in the same room as the Treasurer.  able member for Hotham. I was unaware of that. That is a possible explanation. But I have another: given the complete inability of the minister for industry to provide an answer to any question at question time, it is no wonder he could not be relied upon, as the minister responsible for the portfolio area which would principally benefit from these changes, to argue to the House why his position was perhaps wrong, in the first instance, and why the government is now pleased to accept it. I think it is extraordinary that there should be such a change by the Senate to a government's plans for industry, but we have a debate in this place with not one representative present from the portfolio area. I think cutting back R&D is a really very tragic area. The MCKinsey report talked about the way some of the small and medium sized companies were exporting their pants off and spending a disproportionate amount of their revenue on R&DMr Adams-The Treasurer has not read that report.  report. I think the most exciting thing about research and development is the way Australian owned small and medium sized companies are taking advantage of it-tackling the export market and developing innovative products-and doing it through measures associated with the R&D proposals that were in place under the former government but that are regrettably now being changed. I find it ironic that Australia was a pathfinder in terms of R&D grants at ISO per cent but we have now been overtaken by, for example, Singapore, offering 200 per cent. Singapore, I might say, has a much higher national savings rate than Australia. What has been totally absent in the whole debate about the government's changes to R&D, whether the ones they proposed originally or the ones that have been now hacked about in the Senate, is a vision about where R&D would be taking Australia in the future. What are their future plans for R&D, where does R&D sitMr Adams-It is not mentioned at all.  points out, they do not mention it at all, basically because they do not have a vision for Australian industry. I think the only vision this government has is to constantly see overseas investors buying out successful Australian companies, taking the benefits of R&D back to the home based country and in fact taking some of the export benefits of these companies that are being taken over. We on the Labor side are very pleased that at least in this amendment the Senate in its wisdom has indeed followed the objections that we had in this House and put most vigorously to the House. I do hope that in 1997 we might actually have the minister for industry participating in industry debates in the House and at least half taking the debateMr Crean-Do you think that is likely?  is exceedingly unlikely, but I think industry would like to see it, even if his own backbench would not. We would actually welcome the opportunity to have a decent debate with him-(Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative.",220
525,Mr COSTELLO,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Amendments Nos 6 and 7 relate to transitional amendments for the removal of syndicated R&D. I understand the opposition wants to do them separately although they relate to the same matter. No. 7 is consequential on No.6, so I will separately move: That amendment No.6 be agreed to. Amendments Nos 6 and 7 relate to the transitional arrangements for the removal of syndicated R&D. The amendments allow those syndicates which had lodged applications for registration with the Industry Research and Development Board before 23 July 1996 to be considered for registration. The government estimates that this will allow approximately 16 syndicates to proceed. A number of other syndicate applications lodged with the IR&D Board before the government's announcement are now being considered under the newly established START program.",222
526,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I must say that I am quite staggered by the approach of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in this. He was the person who was telling us that the reason for the ending of syndication was that there were rorts. He has not come into this parliament once and demonstrated one example of a rort. He is the person who sniggers through that sneer-when the lip turns up on one side, when he has got the sneer from ear to ear at the dispatch box-accusing Labor of supporting those who back rorters and accusing Labor of getting donations from these companies and yet cannot produce one scintilla of evidence. He might think he can get away with lots of things in question time because of the way in which question time is structured, but ultimately this parliament is the accountable institution in this country. If people have got allegations to make, they should come in here and make them. Here we have a Treasurer who has told us that research and development syndication has' to end because the schemes are rorted, yet he has not produced one concrete example of a rort. He wants to come into this place and congratulate the Democrats for supporting their amendments in the Senate, but do you know what the Democrats said? The Democrats said that the government had not provided any credible evidence to substantiate claims that syndication has been heavily rorted. Treasurer, do you remember that statement from the Democrats or are you just trying to ignore it? You have got the chief whip down there and you know you cannot get out of this place because we have trapped you in here. You cannot get out and scurry out with your tail between your legs, like the mongrel dog in Henry Lawson's story. You cannot do that. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! I understand that that term has already been ruled out of order and the member knows better than that.",222

If there are words that are not in order when they originate with the member, it is not in order to quote passages and include those words. You will proceed with your speech and not use words you know are offensive. Mr Adams-Madam Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-What is your point of order? I hope it is not contrary to my ruling. Mr Adams-I certainly hope it is not, either, Madam Deputy Speaker, but the quote that was being offered by the shadow minister is of one of the major poets of this countryMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Resume your seat. I have ruled. Mr Adams-Somebody that I haveMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Resume your seat. You no longer have the call. The ruling has already been given more than once. I suggest you read House of Representatives Practice. It is very clear-it is in words of one syllable.",223
532,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I accept your ruling. Can I just suggest that the Treasurer read the Democrats' press release in support of tax R&D syndication. The government has not provided any credible evidence to substantiate claims that syndication has been heavily rorted. Yet that is the case upon which the Treasurer has so constantly relied. Whenever you ask him why he is getting rid of research and development in this country, why he is driving research and development offshore, he has got two excuses. One is that it is business welfare-which we all know it is not and he has not sought to justify tonight-and the other is that there are rorts. And yet not one example of a rort has been demonstrated. He has been shown up for not telling the truth on this matter, yet he has had the opportunity here tonight in bringing these matters back to parliament and in justifying why they have been rolled over in the Senate and had to accept this amendment which allows $160 million back into syndication. He is not prepared to come back and tell us why these 16 companies· can keep their syndicates but the other 30 cannot. I think he has got an obligation to tell us that. Why does he support 16 and not 46, if in fact they meet the guidelines? I invite the Treasurer to tell this House something straight. (Time expired)  Deputy Speaker, I am a bit shocked, but I give you an undertaking I will not quote Henry Lawson in this contribution. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Not that part that has been referred to earlier. Proceed.  member to bring other parts. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Or any that are disorderly. The member for Chifley knows better. If you want to address the amendment, I suggest you do.  amendment. Madam Deputy Speaker, you will recall question time after question time where the Treasurer has said that syndication was nothing more than Labor rorts, nothing more than rewarding the big end of town-but they, the Liberal Party, would not. There was no consideration given to the fact that in small and medium business you have a real difficulty providing capital to it. In fact, we have a great capital shortage. There was no reference to the fact that syndication had worked as a means of allowing small and medium sized companies to undertake a disproportion amount of research. Sure, the syndicates get a tax advantage but capital was going into fund the research and development. None of that! No explanation from the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is not even in the chamber, I might add. Not once did the minister for industry mince up to the dispatch box and talk about what his views were on syndication. The Treasurer time and time again was allowed to get to that dispatch box and say that this was a Labor rort and he was going to end it. Of course, as the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), with or without quotation, has pointed out, there was not one scintilla of evidence offered to this place at question time, in the debate or in the Senate to substantiate a vicious, nasty, mean charge that something that we thought was vitally important-research and development-was nothing more than a Labor rort. I think both the minister for industry and the Treasurer owe if not us-because, after all, politics is a pretty hard game and you develop a pretty tough skin-then a lot of small companies, doing the right thing for Australia in research and development, and the people of Australia an explanation that they are going to either produce these charges, produce this evidence, that they have hitherto not or, alternatively, get up and apologise and say that they were wrong, that they were baseless and that, indeed, syndication is an important vehicle for the support mechanisms for research and development. If we are not owed an apology-and I would argue that we are on this side-then, surely, at least the business associations, small business, medium business and the people of Australia who listened to the Treasurer's charges that he made or these statements that he made and took them to heart, probably believed them, deserve to know what the true position is. I cannot invite the minister for industry to come up to the dispatch box and make an explanation or an apology. He has not even shown this House the courtesy of being here. But I think we can ask the Treasurer, who of course was the one at question time making these points. So I invite the Treasurer-and I hope that the Chief Government Whip has encouraged him-to make an apology, to say that he was wrong, and then we can get on and acknowledge the good sense the Senate had to support the amendment which the opposition advocated in the very first instance.",223
533,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Werriwa) (9.08 p.m.)Madam Deputy Speaker, you will be pretty safe with me: I do not remember a lot of poetry from school. The only one I remember is about the boy on the burning deck and that is certainly not appropriate for the House of Representatives. The point that the member  valid. Tonight is an anticlimax because everyone had high expectations on this last parliamentary sitting day that the Treasurer (Mr Costello), after all the talk in question time, would actually deliver some evidence about rorts in syndicated R&D. I know the Treasurer chants mantra in question time, but if there is one thing we have heard him say time after time it is the allegation of rorts in syndicated R&D. We have been waiting, day after day after day, week after week after week, for one piece of evidence, just one example, to sustain the rhetoric that the Treasurer has produced in question time. He has been found short. This, of course, leads one to conclude that he was really using that rhetoric as a smokescreen. In the presentation of his budget, he tried to say to the working people of Australia that this was a government that was attacking the tax system at the wealthiest extremes, and he has tried to use the argument about syndicated R&D and other parts of his budget to say that the government was trying to shield working families from higher taxes and was trying to place the burden on higher income earners in Australia. The smokescreen has now been blown away. The argument that is sustainable out of the budget is that the great burden of government tax falls on the average working PAYE taxpayer. The great burden of this government's tax policy falls on the average PAYE taxpayer-an 8.3 per cent increase in the taxation collection of gross PA YEo That is, under the last budget of Treasurer Willis, for every $100 paid in the last budget of the former government, they are paying $108.30 in gross PA YE to Treasurer Costello in his first budget-an increase of 8.3 per cent. The great shame of that, of course, is that this is at a time when the Treasurer talks about low inflation: low inflation delivered by the former government. When he talks about stable price settings in Australia, there can be no argument for increasing the gross take on PAYE by 8.3 per cent. And, of course, that just demonstrates the total fraud, the total misrepresentation of the first Costello budget. It is a budget, in its taxation impact, hitting the average Australian working family; hitting average Australians out there in the regions and the suburbs of this country; hitting them through PAYE-not hitting them at all through syndicated R&D and allegations of rorts, because you can't hit people unless you have got evidence. You can't hit people unless you have got examples. You can't hit people unless you have got something to sustain your case. The Treasurer, really, has reached the point where he needs to put up or shut up. It is put up tonight about syndicated R&D or it's shut up in the House of Representatives question time. It is put up about all the rhetoric you have been developing over the past couple of months or it's shut up when it comes to question time. And the Treasurer has really been found short. He has been found terribly short in these matters. The thing about the early months of government, of course, is that it looks so easy. You can say things, hoping-almost knowingthat the accountability day is somewhere down the track, that the chickens won't come home to roost; but in this instance they have. And the Treasurer has got himself into a dilemma where in all these things-the mismanagement of fiscal policy, the abolition of wages policy-it will take time for the full accountability to be echoed around Australian pubic opinion, but on this matter of syndicated R&D, the accountability day has arrived. The accountability time is right now in the House of Representatives. The Treasurer has got to do more than just sign his Christmas cards there with a blank look on his face. He has got to match up all that rhetoric with a bit of evidence; and if he doesn't, then this will undoubtedly be justification for the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), justification of all the things he has been saying on the public record, and it will put down all the allegations that the Treasurer has been making as nothing more than a smokescreen-a smokescreen to disguise the true taxation impact of his budget, which is to slug the working family with an 8.3 per cent increase in gross PAYE collections. So, come on, Treasurer, it's put up or shut up.",224
534,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise again because we do not see any movement from the Treasurer (Mr Costello), and I invite him again to produce evidence of any rort under a tax syndication scheme. Mr Adams-Oh, look who is here.",225
535,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Oh, no, we have got the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) here. He has finally come into support his beleaguered colleague. He likes the fact that this man is now wilting under the strain and has come into enjoy it first hand. He has come into see the Treasurer struck speechless. The only thing he is looking to for solace is signing his Christmas cards and the minister for industry is just But I invite the Treasurer and I invite the minister for industry-now that he has finally come back from dinner into the House-to produce any evidence of a rort through tax syndication, because that is the allegation that has been made. I invite either of them to tell us why they oppose the motion to require syndication to be fully at risk and not involve a guaranteed return. Because this, Madam Deputy Speaker, was what we understood were the real concerns of the government so far as syndication was concerned: that there was not an element of risk and that there were certain syndicates that involved a guaranteed return. Labor put an amendment to knock both of those aspects out and you opposed it. The government opposed it. And I would like an explanation why, if you can't produce the rorts and we are offering a tightening of the scheme against your tests, you are not prepared either to produce the evidence of rorts or to support the amendment. Let us understand what is involved here, Madam Deputy Speaker. We have a Treasurer and an industry minister putting out a joint press release saying that there are rorts in R&D syndication. They put together four examples, not one of which was true, which they made up and in respect of which the minister for industry, on his own evidence in this place, said, 'They were examples of what happened in every case with the finer details changed to fit the occasion'-the Wright family has moved into research and development syndication and the Treasurer and the industry minister have put their names to it. What fraudulent presentation, what shabby evidence, what a disgrace in terms of winding up a successful program. But in terms of the program itself, let me just quote this: Changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession scheme guidelines may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective forms of venture capital available in Australia to fund research and development. Mr Moore-Who said that?",226
536,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"'Who said that?' the industry minister asks me. Do you know who said that? Andrew Robb, the director of the Libloving to watch it. eral Party. Mr Moore-Who elected him?",226
537,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"No-one elected him, but he, together with Mark Textor, gives you all your lines. I wonder if the Treasurer is writing any of those lines into his Christmas cards as he tries to ignore this debate, as he tries to ignore the reality of his evidence being shown to be a sham. Here is a Treasurer-and I make the point again-who will come into question time and assert that there are rorts and yet, in the time we have had on this debate-I think now some 2Yz hours of debate, Treasurer-you have not produced one example of a rort. I am staggered, I must say. I thought you would have come in prepared. I thought you actually had some substance-not much, but some. I thought you had something going for you. But you have not been able to produce one example whatsoever. Let us understand what the amendment is. I know that the time is running out but I will be happy to extend it into the next time. What we have to understand is that here we have a government that were saying research and development syndication had to end. Yet they are now supporting an amendment that allows $160 million of syndicated research and development to go ahead. Treasurer, which are the companies that are going to get up under your amendment? (Time expired)",226
538,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"As I pointed out earlier on, it is an anticlimax. We have been waiting for months for the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to produce the evidence. Then again, at the end of a parliamentary year for the opposition, we have to be happy with some of the slim pickings available. Perhaps the opposition can take some encouragement out of this debate. We have been trying all year to shut the Treasurer up and now at last we have achieved it. But not only us, it was Alan Greenspan who tried to shut him up. If only he had been like this then there would not have been a tremor through the financial markets. The premiers tried to shut him up at the Premiers Conference. If only he had been like this we would not have had the destruction of federalism under the Howard government. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has been trying to shut him up with his Santa Claus code which he let slip on Tuesday night, to let the financial markets know that the next morning there would be a cut in official interest rates. So all year it has been the Labor Party, Alan Greenspan, the Governor of the Reserve Bank and each of the premiers around Australia who have been trying to shut him upand tonight we have achieved it. He has come into this House with all the performance and gravity of a Trappist monk. The Treasurer has turned Trappist in his approach to syndicated R&D-not a word or a whisper of evidence. We have been trying so hard to drag him away from his Christmas cards, hoping he might get down to the S's and get to the point where he had to write Roger Shipton a Christmas card and he would give up on that-he would give up on getting to the S's and think it was too much to send one to Roger Shipton-that is a bit rich at Christmas time. We have been praying for all these devices to try to get him to say a word and now the only people he will speak to are his advisers. It is a pretty poor performance. Maybe they have the evidence and are sitting on it like mother hens, brooding away and trying to hatch the evidence of syndicated R&D. We also got excited when we saw the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) right on the dot at 9 o'clock, right on the dot of the end of the cocktail hour, wander into the House finally with the evidence-we thought-about the rorted syndicated R&D. It was like one of those American western movies with the cavalry riding onto the hilltop to save the struggling general at the front table. But it was nothing more than the Little Big Hom, the minister for industry riding into a disaster with the Trappist monk Treasurer sitting here signing his Christmas cards. He has got down to S. He started out with 'Roger S' and he could not go any further. He could not bring himself to do it. He sort of got half an H out-Roger S, half an H and that was it. He could not get beyond that. This is an anticlimax. Who would have thought that the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) would tum Trappist monk? We know the form of his friend the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott). We know that he is the mad monk. He has now been joined by the Trappist monk. This is an unusual circumstance for the House of Representatives-a Treasurer who will not say a word, a Treasurer who will not back up all the rhetoric he presented throughout every single question time about syndicated R&D, with all the gravity, seriousness and detail of a Trappist monk. Not a word or a whisper. If Alan Greenspan could only have been so lucky; if the premiers could only have been so lucky; if the Governor of the Reserve Bank could only have had such deafening silence before the financial markets were tipped off about a cut in interest rates. Wouldn't the nation be better off? Wouldn't our international standing in financial markets be stronger? Treasurer, you have hit on something late at night on the last sitting day. You have finally got into your rhythm of what makes for sound policy and performance. Silence is the better half of you-and you have kept it so hidden for so long. It is about time that you showed the House of Representatives your full talents. You have done that tonight. You are condemned as someone who was not able to put up when the time came; someone who is really just abusing the House of Representatives by talking about syndicated R&D in terms that just were not true.",226
539,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise again because I note that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has now departed. He only came in for 10 minutes. Mr Latham-He has ridden out. He saw it it turns out that was a disaster.",227
540,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Off into the sunset now. Neither he nor the Treasurer (Mr Costello) have been prepared to come into this placeand I just want the record to note that againafter the umpteenth request and tell us where the rorts are that justify the abolition of research and development syndication. The fact of the matter is that I could understand the ideological drive of the Treasurer if he took the view that, regardless of how good it was, he still had to knock it off because I think it is the way he went about the budget-regardless of the consequences, we cut. But we have got him back in this place tonight, accepting an amendment that will see $160 million go back into research and development syndication. If in fact you say these companies are rorters why have you let them through, Treasurer? And if you have let them through, why won't you let through the other 30 who are in the same list? There is what is known as the A list. The A list were the group of companies that put themselves up for R&D syndicationMrs Draper interjecting",228
541,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I think, Trish, you could go out with the industry minister; he is looking for company. I would like the Treasurer to respond-and you can respond on his behalf if that is your new role, but I would much prefer the Treasurer to respond because we have been asking him all night. Have you known him not to want to get up and answer a question? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order!",228

544,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I ask the Treasurer to tell me why he has allowed the 16 syndicates that he has argued will get up under this amendment to go through. Orbital is one of them. Would that have something to do with the election in WA tomorrow? Remember how the Orbital engine company got all the publicity about a syndicate that was going to go overseas if syndication was abolished? Do you remember that? And there is an election on tomorrow in Western Australia. Has your decision, Treasurer, got anything to do with that? Dumb struck again. I have never known the Treasurer to be so silent, signing away those Christmas cards, impervious to what he is being attacked on, unable to mount a defence. What sort of a sham are you? You want to come into this place and talk about the Labor Party supporting rorts, and you cannot support one example. One of the companies we are in there backing is Orbital, which you said you would not support them, and now, the night before the Western Australian election, you have supported them. It is a pity we are not going to resolve the bounty legislation tonight because I can bet you would have supported the change to the ships bounty, too. There is no consistency in you, Treasurer. You are all bluster and your bluster runs out after 3.15 every question time. You are incapable of mounting a case in this parliament, apart from question time. You hide behind the protection of your ability to ignore the question and answer what you like. And here we are tonight having asked you the question time and time again-and you still will not rise to the challenge. I say to you that you have got a bigger obligation than that. You have gone around this country denigrating great research; you have gone around this country denigrating great achievement that would not have occurred but for research and development syndication. I want to know the criteria by which the 16 companies are getting through the net tonight, because we had an amendment that would have allowed more to be considered-not guaranteed, but considered. Your amendment simply allows some of those through, and I would urge you to get up in this parliament and tell us the criteria by which you are going to allow them through. I can tell you thisand you know we will persist with this scrutiny-we will be pursuing every aspect and every detail of every example to understand the basis of support that you might have been giving them.

545,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Treasurer (Mr Costello) owes it not only to the parliament but to the Australian economy to produce the evidence, because how can the private sector have confidence in a Treasurer who makes allegations only to slur; who makes allegations only to score political points at question time? How can the private sector have confidence in a Treasurer who makes allegations only to slur, not to improve the strength of the Australian taxation system, not to improve the strength the Australian economy? That is the way his reputation will stand on this final parliamentary sitting day. For a moment we got very excited because the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) rode into the parliament, but he saw the burning wagons and he rode straight out again. The next reinforcement was the member for Makin (Mrs Draper). The government sent in the member for Makin, hoping that in her wide travels around parliament house late at night she might have found some of the evidence of rorted syndicated R&D. But no, it did not come from the member for Makin. So they sent in the next tier of reinforcements. It was the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). Mr Crean-But she's not allowed to speak. They will not let her get up and speak in the parliament.",229
546,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"That is right. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has highlighted that maybe she has come in here to join the Trappist monastery. She has come in here to join the Trappists in their cone of silence. I thought she might have come in here on the basis, 'Well, the Treasurer got me into so much trouble yesterday, maybe I will return the compliment today.' I thought that might have been her motivation. But no, she has come in here to join the cone of silence. It is sort of like that movie they were making, Silence of the Dogs. There he is over there, not saying a word, not producing any material at all to sustain the argument that he has been running in question time day after day. In fact, I would have thought the only loyalty the Treasurer has found on the government benches-and I know the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) will take so much encouragement out of this, he has been in that much trouble-is from the member for Makin. The only loyalty, the only back-up, the only strength, the only solidarity that he could find in the Liberal Party on this issue, when his whole reputation is on the line, was from the member for Makin. We recognise that. In the Labor Party we regard loyalty to be somewhat of a virtue. The member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith) is sitting there ashen faced wondering about the Treasurer's integrity. The member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson)-we all know his score on the question of loyalty-is in here for the kill.

550,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"We are prepared to move an extension of time for the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to get up and tell us about the rorts. We have had seven amendments tonight come back from the Senate, and not once has the Treasurer got up in this parliament and told us about the rorts. Treasurer, where do you get off? You have been railing forth publicly through press releases and in question time in the parliament telling us about the rorts and the need to knock off tax R&D syndication, but you will not come through with a scintilla of evidence. I know you have been digging up about me and I know you have come up with nothing, but why don't you actually get - p here and jus.tify your claims against the busllless community? A report in the Business Review Weekly today says that business support for the way government is doing business, its job, has collapsed. The Treasurer is leaving now. He can't take this. He hates it. He can't take an example. He is not prepared to put up. Bye, bye, Treasurer! We will tell the country that you have walked out on every opportunityMr Costello-I have heard him speak four times on an agreed amendment, and this is another one.",230
551,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on what basis is the Treasurer now seeking to intervene in the debate? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs SulIivan)-1 was going to ask him that, but I think he has gone.",230
552,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,We have given him an opportunity to defend the rort and he scurries out like the cur he is. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! You will withdraw that.,230
553,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I withdraw. But he did not take offence, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I did, and that is all that is necessary.",230
554,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"He scurried out nevertheless. He tried the other day to argue that this was a great business poll for the government because, indeed, business expectations next year are high. The massive shift in atti-ude, the negative shift in attitude, by busllless against this government is very interesting. The report says: The shift in attitude toward the government is made more remarkable by the bullish outlook for chief executives they said they had for the coming year. Even though the other day the Treasurer tried to pretend that business was happy about prospects next year, even against that background, they were saying that th- governme-t was appalling in its approach to llldustry--did not have an understanding of industry, had no vision of industry and had no commitment to industry-and that all since the budget. One of the reasons a collapse has occurred in business support for this government is that measures such as research and development have been taken away from them without any justification. You could understand if they were prepared to come into this chamber and justify where the rorts occur:ed. They co.ul.d even do it in here under parlIamentary pnvIlege but, no, they go out to the public at large and merely assert and smear. They say that there are business rorts in research and development syndication but refuse every opportunity to justify it. We will be reminding not just the business community but the community at large about this cowardice-this assertion without evidence, without backing. It is interesting in this circumstance to see that the only minister in the parliament-and he is not even on the front bench at this stage-is the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), who has caught the Vanstone disease and makes up any statistic as he goes along with?ut an.y justification. The real problem Wlt- thIS government is that they have no commItment to their constituencies. I do not know one minister who has stood up for their constituency-not one. The greatest betrayer of the lot has just wandered back into the chamber. He must have taken the left-hand tum rather than going ahead as he was heading back from the dinner. He has ended up in the chamber and wondered why he is here. He has said, 'This might be a nice place to be,' and here we have him. We have the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) accusing me of putting business leaders up to supporting the retention of research and development syndication, arguing that there are rorts, yet he does not have the guts to come into this place and produce the evidence. He has put out a press release that talks about actual examples, when his own department is on the record as saying not one of them is actual. This is a government not only of betrayal but also of deceit. It is a government of fabrication. It is the reason we are pleased to be here tonight supporting these amendments, because they do redress some of the damage. We will be persisting to have the total damage overturned.

555,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In the Labor Party's search for evidence of syndicated R&D rorts, the government has proceeded to tum the House into a farce. The government has turned the House into the farce of a Treasurer (Mr Costello) not prepared to back up his rhetoric and the farce of a Marx Brothers movie. The Treasurer goes out one door and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) comes in another; the Treasurer comes back in and the minister for industry goes back out. The minister for industry is obviously very confused. What the minister for industry wants me to do is to turn this microphone into the Parliament House PA system and put out a general alert. 'General alert! Anyone who has any evidence of syndicated R&D, bring it now to the House of Representatives.' We should put it over the PA system: 'Anyone with evidence of rorted syndicated R&D, bring it down to the House of Representatives.' The minister for industry cannot find it. He has been walking in and out of the House like in a Marx Brothers movie-in and out of the door. The Treasurer has given up. He has been so inspired by his numbers woman, the member for Makin (Mrs Draper)Dr Kemp interjectingOpposition members-What are you talking about? What are you talking about?",231

558,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Order! The House will come to order.,231
559,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I welcome the interjection of the minister at the table. The minister claims he has the evidence. He has been sitting on the evidence all this time. If the Treasurer will not put up or shut up, why does the member for Goldstein not put up? Why does the member for Goldstein not do more than sit there with his absurd and sinister look on his face and actually put up, at the dispatch box, the evidence of rorted syndicated R&D? If the minister finds it good enough to say these things across the table of the parliament, why does he not say them through the microphone at the dispatch box? If the minister believes there is evidence, as he indicated by way of interjection just a few moments ago, let him stand up and say that. Or is he, too, a Trappist monk? Is he, too, caught in the cone of silence? Is he, too, lacking the courage to stand up and say on the public record right here and now the things that he believes are true? Or is he just another slur-style minister? Is he another minister willing to make the allegation just as a cheap political slur without any substance, without any value to the Australian economy? Minister, if it is good enough to say across the table by way of interjection, isn't it good enough to stand up and present your evidence? You are making allegations against the member for Hotham; you are making allegations against each of the syndicated R&D groups in Australia; you are making it in the fashion of slur and innuendo, typical Liberal Party style, without the courage of fronting up and putting up-after so much debate, after so much consideration. It is like extracting teeth on this side of the House. At last the Labor Party has got a minister on the record who claims that he has the evidence. Perversely enough, it is the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training! God only knows how they have been running schools policy if the minister has been looking after the evidence of rorted syndicated R&D. Does this mean that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism is actually running schools policy in the government-that they have swapped roles? They wander in and out of the different doors of Parliament House like a Marx brothers movie-they are actually wandering around each other's portfolio. Ms Macklin-He has gone again.",231
560,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,He has gone. Is that in the folder? Is this the folder with the evidence of a rorted syndicated R&D? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! Resume your seat. The member for Lindsay on a point of order.,232

I move: That the following words be added to the ""and this House now calls on the Member for Goldstein to present the evidence of rorted cated Rand D as he indicated to the House at 9.35 p.m."". Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Is the amendment seconded?",232
563,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is seconded, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! Just a minute. We need the amendment in writing.",232
564,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"While we are getting it in writing, I rise to second the amendment. This has only become important now because of the intervention across the table by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). We have been trying to get the government all night and all afternoon to produce one item of evidence demonstrating rorting under research and development syndication. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) at least was smart enough, given that he has no evidence-and I think we have demonstrated that, because he scurried out of the chamber after three hours of debate not having responded to any request from us, but at least he had the sense to shut up. Not the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training who could not contain himself! I wonder why. He was the only member of the tactics committee that got an honourable mention today by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). He must be doing really well. I wonder when the promotion to cabinet is coming, Minister? We know how you got dudded on your expectation of it in March of this year. You have been burying away, busying yourself to try to get in thereundermining your senior minister, but at the same time picking up the loose tongue and utilising false statistics. But your assertion to me across the table was, 'I know where the evidence of the rorts are'-this is the point to me-'and I learnt them by riding around in a Rolls-Royce.' If this is the basis upon which the government has made the decision to scrap research and development, let the country know about it! I do not travel around in Rolls-Royces, but I do have contacts in the business community. motion: I don't deny that. I keep in touch. But I challenge the Minister for Schools, Vocational syndi- Education and Training to produce the evidence that he says is so apparent, which he says he knows and which he says that I know. I deny that there is evidence of rorts. I have asserted that publicly and I challenge this government, through any person that claims it, to get up and say so. Yet the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, so vicious in his attacks across the table, has now turned his back-getting close to the midnight hour. He would be vacant in the mirror if he looked in it at the moment. He has no heart-he only came in when he heard the talk about blood in the chamber-and no courage. You have got more front than Mark Foys, Coles-Myer or whatever you want to call it, but you have got no courage. The reality is that you will make assertion and smear but you will not back it up. I don't think this is a person who has ever held an employed job in his life. He worked for his father and then got through the Liberal Party for preselection. This is a person that would know nothing about industry, nothing about business. This is a person who has an ideological set against universities and education, who believes we should fund those things through the voucher system and who believes fundamentally in the user-pays principle. That is why he supports the abolition of syndication and research and development. But I would at least expect him to bring some rigour to it. He claims to be an academic. He has the title 'Dr. I think I know how he got the title of 'Dr. When he was shadowing me he used to always doctor the documents that I put out. He used to get the whiteout, the paper, the scissors-the little cut and paste job. He used to take words out here and there and come in here and make assertions. I know about Dr Kemp. I know all about the doctor and he has not changed in government. We expected more of him. We expected him to bring a bit of academic rigour. Yet he comes into this place tonight, blabs out across the table that he has evidence of the rorts but will not stand in this chamber and produce it. What a sham! What we have is the Victorian Liberal Party, David Kemp and Peter Costello-the two sides of it, not friends of each other-in here supporting the same argument, in here supporting the same assertion to get anything through by way of the budget. The fact of the matter is that industry is going to suffer in this country and those opposite laugh about it. Worse, they will not produce evidence in support of it. I challenge the minister for schools, as we have challenged the Treasurer, as we have challenged the industry minister: produce the evidence in this debate or reverse the decision. We will keep persisting with our case that this is bad policy, it is a broken promise and it needs to be reversed. (Time expired).",232
565,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Werriwa) (9.47 p.m.)Speaking in favour of the amendment, I note a certain sadness because until this point I had a perfect record of never having one of my amendments ever ruled in order from my nine months on the opposition front bench. I think that broken record is a sign of encouragement for the opposition on the last sitting day. I have broken the duck. I have got onea nice little single through the covers. My confidence is going up and I am feeling a bit better, so let us move on to the bigger subjects. This really is an amendment about ministerial accountability. We saw just yesterday a disgraceful episode when the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan)Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! This has been what is commonly referred to as a wide-ranging debate. There has been a certain marginal amount of material used in it this evening. I have allowed it on the grounds that it has been very loosely connected with something that is alleged that the Treasurer or the minister for industry had said. Your amendment is very specifically related to the member for Goldstein.",233
566,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I accept your ruling. I was hoping you might show a little kindness because I did not read that poem out earlier-no such Christmas cheer. This is a serious issue of ministerial accountability. How can the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) wander into the chamber, be briefed by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in detail about the subject of debate now before the House, get his riding instructions, have all those blue and green folders placed in front of him on this particular subject of R&D and then lean across the table and make a serious allegation against the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and a serious allegation against the corporate sector in Australia, saying that he has got the evidence? It is not the Treasurer who has the evidence. It is not the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), in and out of the door like a Marx Brothers movie, who has the evidence. It is not the member for Makin (Mrs Draper) who has the evidence. It is not the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) who has the evidence. It is not the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) who is hiding the evidence up the front of his shirt as he most amply could. Mr Martin Ferguson-He knows all about inquiries.",233
567,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,He is an expert on inquiries. The member for Paterson is an expert on inquiries. He is a witness and participant. Mr Martin Ferguson-Star witness.,234
568,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"A star witness in inquiries. None of those members have the evidence of rorted syndicated R&D. It is the member for Goldstein alone. We have to say this about the member for Goldstein: he alone among the government members had the courage to own up to having the evidence, because he said that by way of interjection earlier on. So if a minister is willing to say these things by way of interjection in the House of Representatives, he should be willing to stand up and present the evidence to the House. There is no more basic standard of ministerial accountability than this. How can the member for Goldstein try and vote against a motion to call on him to present the things he was willing to say by way of interjection? How could he possibly vote against his opportunity to present to the House the evidence that he suggested by way of interjection? In fact, this could be the opportunity for Quick, H. V. the member for Goldstein to present his credentials as an honest minister. Among a ministry with so many scandals, so much dishonesty, he alone can stand up as a beacon of honesty if he is willing to back up his interjection and present the evidence of rorted syndicated R&D. This has been a two-hour debate. This has been a two-hour exercise in extracting teeth. The Labor Party has been here speaker after speaker after speaker seeking nothing more than the truth. The high noble cause of parlia- Costello, P. H. mentary debate-seeking nothing more than the truth, seeking nothing more than honesty for the corporate sector and for Australian citizens. There is no higher purpose in this parliament than seeking the truth and now no higher responsibility than for the member for Goldstein to stand up, to be accountable to the parliament, to be accountable to the corporate sector, to be accountable to the Australian people and to present the evidence that he claims he has.

570,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"In that article Freeman further said: The direction of policyand that is immigration policy... is mostly a function of which fragments of the public have the incentives and resources to organize around immigration issues. As it turns out, those who benefit from immigration in direct and concrete ways are better placed to organize than are those who bear immigration's costs. Immigration tends to produce concentrated benefits and diffuse costs, giving those who benefit from immigration greater incentives to organize than persons who bear its costs. That analysis of international immigration policy and how it is formed in settler countries, such as South Africa, Israel, Canada, Australia et cetera, was of course preceded by comments of a similar nature in this country in the 1988 committee to advise on Australia's immigration policies. In that document that committee-which did have an influence on where the policies were goingmade the criticism that, although planning does involve consultation with various interest groups, these groups are unrepresentative and consultation is private. Furthermore, policy involves a consensus of political views around a common ideological position unsupported by general public opinion. In an article in the Australian Economic Review for the second quarter of 1996, Harry Clarke of the School of Economics, La Trobe University, commented: More plausibly however, political bipartisanship (between Liberal and Labor parties) on migration has led to policies with elite support but with only minority general community support. He gave the following advice: One way to increase representativeness would be for DIEA to move towards regionally decentralised consultations with informed members of the Australian community. Public opinion could also be sampled using surveys. He noted: Currently the Australian Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research. . . does organise what it calls a National Outlook Conference but this is dominated by the ethnic industryand I do not want to associate myself with that pejorative term, but consisting of the following. .. bureaucrats, politicians, ethnic interest groups) whose role CAAIP sought to limit: a proposal to reconstitute this conference is developed in Clarke (1994). What those articles are saying is that essentially the immigration debate is largely driven by those with an immediate interest. The general public does not have a very big say in it. I have to say that, even within the major political parties, there has been an unwillingness and a lack of trust in the public to actually discuss these issues. This long preceded the drive by people like Hanson to stir up concerns about this and other related policy areas. Quite clearly, part of the problem was indicated in an article by Katharine Betts titled 'Immigration and Public Opinion in Australia' where she noted: In 1996 nearly two thirds of Australians think that the intake is too high. One sub-group, however, continues to stand apart from this trend: people with a university education, especially those university-educated people who have a migrant background themselves. She further said: . . . it seems that many Australians are worried about job competition and about increasing levels of cultural diversity. However, many universityeducated Australians are relatively immune to these worries. Few among them actively want immigration to be increased, but the proportion saying the numbers are too high is lower among them than among less privileged groups. But the association between education and worries about immigration is not linear. The most worried group are not those with no post-school training at all. Rather it is the group with trade and other non-tertiary qualifications which shows the most concern. I want to emphasise the earlier point I made about the concentration of non-English speaking background people in my electorate being related to another crucial statistic regarding the nature of my electorate-that is, in the entire country, whilst my electorate has the eighth highest concentration of non-English speaking constituents, it is the sixth highest in regard to unemployment. That is no statistical mistake. That is not an aberration. There is a clear connection. What we are getting at is the clear connection between the need for English and employment. I quote an article by Clive Brooks: Immigrants, especially those from a non-English speaking background, do have higher unemployment rates than the Australian born ... all [studies] are in agreement that unemployed immigrants are less likely to receive unemployment benefits than their Australian born counterparts ... While the proportion of the unemployed who were receiving unemployment allowances was increased over the 1990-92 recession, a higher proportion of the Australian-born unemployed were receiving unemployment allowances than the overseas-born. It is clear that NESB immigrants, when compared with the Australian-born, are less likely to participate in the labour force (partly due to NESB immigrants being more likely to be discouraged in their job search) have higher rates of unemployment and are more likely to be underemployed. One of the thrusts of the government's policy in this legislation is to increase the charges by a very massive amount-250 per cent-for those who require to learn English. I, for one, have no dispute with the government's intention to try to maximise the employability of the intake, because unless we do, political parties will have increasing difficulties in defending the refugee intake and even in the long term the family intake. There are very strong reasons to try to ensure that, as far as possible, without being discriminatory. If I have criticisms of the inclusion of English points in the family intake, I do not see it as a racist action by the government. Quite clearly, one might dispute it because one should say there should be none of these restrictions in regard to family reunion. But to say that it is intrinsically racist is very simplistic, because the reality of the nature of the intake is that we are saying, essentially, that if there are two Korean fitters and turners who are equivalent in all other senses, then if one is better at speaking English, that person is more likely to be employed in this country. That is the outcome of all statistical work done by the BIR. Every document that they have produced over the last decade and a half has consistently shown that association between English and employability. So on the one hand I do not think there should be so much resistance to that kind of measure by the government, but on the other hand I think the opposition is very clearly concerned, as part of their worries with this legislation, by the very significant increase in English charges. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has failed to allow the opposition the opportunity to separate that from the other charges which the opposition is clearly supporting. Mr Ruddock-We can have a talk about it if you are going to be reasonable.",237
571,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I understand the opposition did attempt to get that kind of agreement but failed. One of the other changes of which I am very supportive, both with this minister and with the previous minister, is the question of people gaining citizenship by fraud. One of the changes in this legislation is to extend that to those people who gain citizenship through fraud at the permanent residence stage. I do not think we should be over-concerned about the people affected by this legislation. Quite clearly, they have sought to void the Australian government's intentions in the migration rules. Also, with regard to the question of any time limitations, I do not think that should be a matter of any grave concern to the electorate. The aspect of our requirements in regard to the cohabitation period for de facto and same sex couples is clearly a discriminatory provision. We have had some government members trying to defend it on the basis that they see it as less of a relationship than marriage. This is going to do very little to avoid fraud. It is essentially of a similar fashion to the government's measure deciding that people have to wait in line once they are married to get into this country. We have heard figures that one-sixth of marriages in this country are now contracted with people overseas. Quite clearly, there is a degree of suffering as a those polls. result of this decision to deny people access on the basis of a fear in the electorate, nipulated by some, that we have had a very big upturn in marriage in the last few years. (Time expired)",238
572,Mr ALBANESE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I am very pleased to participate in debate as the member for Grayndler. Grayndler is an electorate in which cent of people were born outside of Australia; an electorate in which there are a number of very large ethnic communities; and an electorate in which these issues take up a majority of my time. It is a pleasure to be involved with those ethnic communities in my electorate. Some three weeks ago, I attended a rally which was not in my electorate but was at Sydney Town Hall. That rally marched on the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The reason why that rally against racism marched on the Prime Minister's office is that the communities involved saw a direct link filled, between the sorts of policies being pursued this government, the sort of rhetoric about freedom of speech being given by the Prime Minister and the less subtle comments of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). Mr Ruddock-Do you oppose free speech?",239
573,Mr ALBANESE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"-I am against freedom of speech when it is vilification against ethnic groups. Not only am I against that sort of vilification; but the people I marched with that day are also against that sort of tion: Henry Tsang, the Deputy Lord Mayor Sydney, Mr Keith Kwon, from the Korean Forum, community, Mr Cuong Vo, the head of the Vietnamese community in Australia, and Jack Beetson, from the Tranby Aboriginal College. I was very proud to be a part of the moveparents ment that day. I understand that last weekend there was similar rally in Melbourne which was attended by over 30,000 people. I think are seeing is a reaction against the explicit racism of the member for Oxley and against the code being used by those who read the polls over on the other side of the House and choose to change their political rhetoric order to appeal in a very crude fashion to The thing about this government is that they macannot resist any opportunity to show their true colours when it comes to how they really feel about migrants. This legislation before the House today is no exception. The opposihas been very reasonable with regard to this this, and we have cooperated wherever possible, but there are some points where we 47 per have chosen to draw the line. The coalition have repeatedly shown that their agenda is about discouraging migrants, especially migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds, from coming to Australia. This legislation represents more hoops for prospective migrants to have to jump through before they are permitted to emigrate to this country. Never mind that their partners, husbands, wives, sisters, brothers or children are already citizens of this country and are living here. If you happen to pick the wrong time of the year to get married, when the coalition's quota for spouse visas has been it is just too bad. The first come, first by served system can hardly be called fair. I wonder how the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) or the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), whom I have just woken up over there, would feel if it were their wife or their elderly mother or father who was not allowed into Australia but were told they had to wait until next year to apply again with no guarantee that they would be successful the following year. Surely you would think that with all vilificatheir rhetoric about the family, the of government's policy arm, known as the Lyons would object to the legislation before this House, that the Lyons Forum would make sure that this government was in favour of someone being able to care for their aged or look after their dependent children or be reunited with their spouse, or does the a Lyons Forum only support families when it applies to white, Anglo-Celtic, fifth generathat what we tion Australians? This legislation demonstrates just how hypocritical the coalition is. The Howard government is trying to set up a system in this country where there are two sets of rights for in citizens--one for people who were born in Australia and one for people who have immigrated to our country. They are trying to make it harder. It wants to increase the fees for prospective migrants: the visa application fee is up over 200 per cent, the English education charge is up by nearly 250 per cent and the health services charge is now going to be applied to all of the preferential family category. Not only is the coalition increasing the charges to $12,500 per person-that is, up to $50,000 for a family of four-but it then expects migrants to survive in Australia with no financial assistance for the first two years, while they should be using that time to learn English so they can enter the Australian work force adequately prepared. This bill will also result in exemptions being made under the Sex Discrimination Act to allow the minister to require that de facto spouses and interdependent couples-that is, same sex couples-must live together for two years before they are permitted to migrate. At least this bit of the bill is consistent with pro family, moral posturing of the Lyons Forum that we have come to expect. The coalition's acceptance of marriage as somehow superior and more genuine than a de facto relationship really does hark back to the 1950s. It is apparently not enough for couples to demonstrate their interdependence. The government wants to make it even harder. Since the election I have seen hundreds of constituents in my office seeking assistance with immigration. People applying for visas on the grounds of interdependency, in particular, are an extremely small minority who already have to go to considerable lengths to prove the bona fides of their relationship. For same sex couples, the requirement to live together for two years may simply be impossible in some countries, and the minister must know that. For gay and lesbian couples, it is often simply not possible for them to live together in safety outside Australia. As members would be aware, unlike in Australia, homosexuality is still illegal in many nations around the world, as much as the Lyons Forum might like it to be here. Mr Hockey-What about the John Stuart Mill Society?",239
574,Mr ALBANESE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"This proposed change has already begun to impact on people in Australia. I wish-I must say-the John Stuart Mill faction of the Liberal Party the best of luck in its fight over issues such as this versus the Lyons Forum. But it would appear that you are losing the fight. It would appear that the Lyons Forum have the numbers over there and are setting the agenda in such a conservative, moral judging way. This proposed change has impacted here already. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has already instructed our overseas missions to inform applicants of the capping. I have a letter here from Belgrade dated 5 September 1996. The minister would have been aware of this because I put questions on notice to him about this case. It was sent to the wife of one of my constituents, and states: I refer to your application to migrate to Australia under subclass 100 . . . the The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has decided to limit the maximum number of visas that can be granted during the 1996/97 programme year in the subclass for which you have applied. This is called 'capping'. Capping limits the total number of visas that can be granted worldwide in this visa class in a programme year. The letter goes on: When the cap has been reached, immigration officers can continue to process applications but new visa places will not become available until at least July 1997 (the start of the next programme year). As with so many of these proposed changes to the regulations, the minister has not waited for the legislation to actually be carried. Constituents have got letters about the implementation prior to their becoming law. In response to the question on notice which I put, the minister replied that it was an oversight, it was an accident. I wonder how many constituents of members of this House have received similar letters, but because they have not gone through their local member of parliament, we do not know about them and their applications have simply been knocked off on the basis of law being applied before it goes through this House. This is a very serious situation which goes beyond this issue at stake, the direct issue, because what it says is that the other side is so arrogant that they assume they can implement their thoughts as opposed to their laws. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has also stated that this bill will help to control sham marriages. I want to make it clear that those in the opposition, myself included, oppose anyone getting into this country on the basis of any sham. The member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) has already indicated that we support the measures with regard to fraudulent statements being put forward. The minister is under the impression that sham marriages are rife in Australia. I do n-t deny that they exist, but I do take exceptipn to the ideologically based rhetoric that they are in plague proportions, that there are all these shams out there. I get to see a bit of the minister; he is very diligent. Next week I think I have got three functions with him-in Ashfield, in Waterloo, in Marrickville; he is everywhere. It is the member for Grayndler shadowing, in my electorate, the minister. To his credit, the minister is often in Grayndler, a safe Labor seat. But what I see there is that the minister stands up and gives these great speeches. They are terrific. They are about multiculturalism. They are about stopping racism. But it is totally different when it comes to the rhetoric here. Minister, why don't you go to those meetings, when you open the Inner West Migrant Resource Centre, and talk about sham marriages? Mr Ruddock-I do.",240
575,Mr ALBANESE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Why don't you talk about the rorts, because you never do? Not once at any of the forums and functions at which I have seen you, have you raised any of those issues.",241
576,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Order! I remind the honourable member for Grayndler to address his remarks through the chair, and the minister likewise.",241
577,Mr ALBANESE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The fact is that those communities know that this is all part of the code, that we are friendly when we go to the Lebanese national day, and we are friendly when we go to the Cyprus Community Club, but in the other context the government wants to make sure that it holds on to the sort of votes that support the member for Oxley. The government is very careful about its code. The minister's crackdown on so-called sham relationships in particular has targeted ethnic groups. In many groups in the community, arranged or partly arranged marriages are culturally appropriate. As a result, people may marry each other in good faith, but without knowing a great deal about one another. It so happens that the ethnic groups where this is most common are from Asia and the Middle East. It is true that sometimes these couples do not know each other as well as those in an Anglo or Irish relationship in Australia. It is true that there are cultural differences there. This does not mean, however, that their marriages are fake. This bill also seeks to exempt the Migration Act 1958 from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in order to give effect to the government's policy of requiring a two-year cohabitation period for onshore and offshore applications for de facto spouse and independent visas. As I said, this will make de facto applications very difficult. The two-year cohabitation requirement contained in this bill would mean that the sponsor involved would have to put his or her life in Australia on hold for two years and stay in his or her partner's country. However, in countries where divorce is restricted, living in a de facto relationship is not necessarily a possibility anyway; that is, unless a couple is prepared to be marginalised or even vilified by the local community for their actions. It does not take a genius to work out that this measure is just another way of restricting the rights of an Australian to be with their chosen life partners if those partners happen to be non-Australian. As far as interdependent relationships go, the level of difficulty increases exponentially. I will tell you about a specific situation affecting one of my constituents. He is a constituent whom the minister probably knows, because he is a very persistent case, I can assure you-he has spoken to just about everyone in the minister's department. He has even supplied me with videos and all sorts of documentary evidence of interviews when he went over to the country where his partner is. My constituent is in a same-sex relationship with a person who lives in a country in which-and the minister recognises the specific caseMr Ruddock-The Egyptian one, is it? Cairo?",241
578,Mr ALBANESE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"This is the most persistent constituent in Australia. In the society where his partner comes from, same sex relationships are not tolerated. As a result, my constituent's relationship has been fraught not just with difficulties but with outright physical danger. Spending time alone with his partner has not been easy. Under the proposed changes to the regulations, my constituent would have to live with his partner for two years.",242
579,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Why not?,242
580,Mr ALBANESE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Because his partner has already been bashed and put in hospital because he is gay. He has already had bones broken and been severely bashed by members of his own family because of the situation in which he finds himself. So it is simply not possible for them to live in that country for another two years without considerable physical risk. Furthermore, my constituent's partner is unable to get a visitor's visa at the moment to travel to Australia because he is considered high risk for overstaying. So it is a catch-22 situation. The only option really open for them is to find a friendly third country where they would have to live and support themselves for two years. These are really insurmountable odds to overcome. The amendments that the opposition is pursuing before this House show that we have been fair dinkum, and I congratulate the shadow minister on his efforts with regard to this legislation because we are prepared, as an opposition, to be reasonable. We are prepared to crack down on any shams and any rorts because it means that if you have a certain amount of people allowed into Australia, then for every rort that is one legitimate person who cannot get in. So I have no quarrel with people who engage in fraud or who are inappropriate visitors or applicants seeking to migrate to this country being rejected. But in so much of this government's rhetoric we see on the one hand Pauline Hanson being the 'softener' out there pushing a hard line and even today and this week too many people in the government refusing to repudiate that. The Prime Minister had a chance in his state of the nation address-the longwinded humbug we all had to listen to the other day-to actually make a statement against the member for Oxley. I thought he might but he failed again, just like the government has failed in their responsibilities to promote in a genuine fashion-not through code-a multicultural Australia. I look forward to the minister next week, on those three occasions when I will be representing the shadow minister, giving the same sort of rhetoric which you give in here, because I am tired of hearing the contradictions in the government's position. (Time expired)",242
581,Mr GRIFFIN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I rise tonight to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3). But first I would like to recognise the presence in the chamber of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) and express my real sympathy to him for having to spend three nights with the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) in the next couple of weeks. That is dedication above and beyond the call of duty. As one who has a room near the member for Grayndler, I can only say I understand your suffering and I hope you get through it in one piece. Mr Albanese-You're supposed to be bucketing them.",242
582,Mr GRIFFIN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Sorry, I'm supposed to bucket them. It is Christmas and it is a little bit of Christmas cheer. This bill proposes to roll the migration health services charge, the English education charge and the visa application fee into one charge. The opposition, principally, is critical of all aspects of this change but opposes in particular the increase in the English education charge. As I understand it, the bill will raise that charge to some $5,500 per person. Unfortunately, the government refused to separate this charge in the bill; therefore, we are in a situation where we have general opposition on this point. But the whole question of English charges is one that I would urge the minister to look at again. The fact is we have seen a general cutback in a range of other areas like employment, education and training programs, programs through neighbourhood houses and the general ESL provision. That really is at odds with the rhetoric. We talk about the fact that migrants to this country should speak English or should take the opportunity to speak English as soon as possible after their arrival. I certainly support that, I know the minister does and I am sure the House in general does. But we also have to question how we address that issue in the circumstances. Often when people come to a new country they have to deal with culture shock and the actual physical relocation. The circumstances they may well find, particularly initially after arrival, make it a very difficult change of circumstances. Essentially, that language barrier is a crucial aspect of those problems in resettlement. I find it hard to understand why on the one hand the government-and I agree with them on this-talk about the fact that English education is a crucial part of the settlement of migrants and on the other hand say, 'But we will make it more expensive and in many areas we will cut back access to programs.' The minister knows the area that I represent quite well. I would not spend as much time with the minister as the member for Grayndler but I am sure he enjoys time with me more than he does with the member for Grayndler. However, the fact is the minister knows the area and he knows that in those circumstances in that area around Springvale and Dandenong there are a large number of migrants who have settled there and are still settling there. English language provision is a very serious issue in developing a cohesive, local societal structure. These cutbacks are having major impacts and will continue to have major impacts in giving migrants the chance to learn English to better integrate and develop into a part of mainstream Australian society. That is what they seek to do-we all know that-but I find this measure at odds with the rhetoric and at odds with a realistic, analytical view of what is required to try to assist in migrant settlement. The bill also seeks to repeal section 87 of the Migration Act 1958 to enable the minister, among other things, to limit or cap the number of spouse, aged parent and dependent child visas that can be granted each year. This is a very difficult issue in many respects. I oppose capping. Straight-off capping, in my view, does not have any merit associated with the question of applications. Essentially, as I understand it, if your application happens to be one that is approved in the first part of the year before you reach the cap then you are successful; if it happens to be after that then you are in difficulty. I think those sorts of things are a real concern. I am sure many members from both sides of the House know, as I do, that the whole question of family reunion-the question of spouses, aged parents and dependent children-is very important in terms of the capacity of families to be able to settle. I have had, for example, in recent months members of the Chinese community approach me about the circumstances surrounding the likely results of spouse visas and they have expressed a real concern as to what that will mean to their families. No-one wants to see this situation rorted. There are examples where this has occurred. I do not think anyone is denying that. The question really is what do we do about it. It is a matter of natural justice. If you deny people the right of access to such a program through a capping mechanism, what you in the end really do is deny them justice. In those circumstances, I think it is an issue that needs to be looked at very seriously. As I said earlier, the nature of the settlement of families and individuals who have come from overseas means that it is very important for them, under the law, to be able to bring, if possible, members of their family to Australia. Spouses-and I mean illegitimate spouses-are obviously a crucial component of the development of the family structure. A number of people have come to me on this issue in recent months showing real concern about what they believe is proposed and the likely result. The issue of aged parents is also difficult. I spoke in this chamber recently on the question of third generation Vietnamese nextdoor neighbours that I had in Springvale. The grandparents were aged in terms of this classification when they came to Australia. They are fine citizens, and I do not think the minister would deny that, but we have to look at the circumstances with some degree of compassion. We also have to look at what makes multicultural Australia, as we all understand the term, an important vehicle for our society to move forward into the future. A lot of that is to do with family relations. When we are talking about dependent children, aged parents or spouses, we are talking about that whole range of relationships which makes up the family unit. I know members in this House would certainly agree with that. I was informed earlier that the minister in 1989, when speaking on a related issue, said on the question of capping: I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say halfway through the year, 'We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia-no more husband and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents'. I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups. Mr Ruddock-Why do you think it was raised?",242
583,Mr GRIFFIN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Why was it raised? Mr Ruddock-Because you were legislating at that time to do exactly what we are doing now.,244
584,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Mr Mossfield}-Order! I would ask the member to address his remarks through the chair and ask the minister to stop interrupting the member.,244
585,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. That is complete deceit, and he knows it. Mr Ruddock-No, it is not. I have a copy of the bill here that you introducedMigration Legislation Amendment Bill No ",244
586,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,I call the minister to order. I ask the honourable member for Bruce to continue his remarks.,244
587,Mr GRIFFIN,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I draw breath, I make the point that the minister raises an interesting interjection there, but even if what the minister said was the truth-and it is not true-he seems to be suggesting that because we pushed for something at a particular time he opposed it. Again, as I say, if the minister is true on this issue-and I am informed reliably that he is not-if he is accurate, he should be saying you had a bill which be believes ought to do one thing, very much what he is seeking to do now, and at that time, in 1989, he opposed it. He opposed it in most eloquent terms, I must say, but he said it was wrong. But now he says it was right. Circumstances have changed. Now he is the minister. The minister is in a situation where, as the minister, he now feels that he is going to act upon thisdo not listen to what I say, look at what I do. I raise real concerns about the minister in this situation. He is a minister I have got a fair bit of time for, as I have said before, but the fact of the matter is on this issue I think he is wrong and I think that his words earlier, in 1989, really get to the heart of the issue-that this is not a fair measure, it is not an equitable measure and it is a measure that ought to be opposed. The bill implements legislative exemption to the Migration Act 1958 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to allow the minister to prescribe a two-year cohabitation period for de facto and interdependency, or same sex, relationships. The issue here is really a question of why we are putting these categories of people in a situation where there is an especially harsh variation in terms of their particular circumstances. I will not go into detail about that but I do raise concerns about the way that is being handled. The bill also amends the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 to allow the minister to deprive a person of Australian citizenship if the grant of citizenship was obtained as a result of knowingly committing and being convicted of migration relation fraud. No argument. That is a good idea and frankly I hope it works well. That is the nature of the bill in terms significant aspects. Other speakers have taken the opportunity to make some more general comments with respect to immigration issues and I will make some comments now along the same lines. The fact is that at the moment there are two levels of debate occurring in Australian society on these sorts of issues. We are seeing more vitriolic and uninformed debate occurring through people such as the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and those who associate with her. We are also seeing debate occurring between government and opposition around the nature of our migration intake. The fact of the matter is that when we are talking in broad terms about the size of our intake, the nature of our intake, there is very little disagreement between the government and the opposition. The intake proposed by the minister, as I understand it, is at the average of the four years of the Keating government, so in reality we are not talking about a great difference here. We have also got another level of that debate and that relates to some of the comments that have been made by people such as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the rhetorical nature of the immigration debate in this country. We have seen comments along the lines of what is really happening is that we are bringing immigration back under control-we are in a situation where what we are doing is cutting it back, developing a situation where it is sustainable. What they are really doing, in the guts of it, is in fact what we were doing during the years of the Keating government. We have got to get back to the facts of the matter. Also what worries me about aspects of this-and I alluded to it earlier-is the real problem with the rhetoric of the government versus the actions of the government. We talk about the fact that we need to get people back into employment and then we cut employment training programs. We talk about the need for people to be privately insured, and then we develop a system which actually ensures that fewer people become privately insured. We look at questions of immigration and issues around the question of, say, English education of its charges and the need for migrants to have English, yet we cut support to English language programs. So in our own way we have a situation where the government is making it more difficult for people to gain those skills and therefore better become part of mainstream Australian society. That is one of the worrying aspects of part of the debate at the moment. There is a situation where not all the facts are on the table. There is rhetoric and there are actions, and when you compare them they do not match, they do not gel. That is a real worry about a number of things this government is doing and I think it is really a worry with the debate on immigration that is occurring at the moment. I encourage that debate. I certainly support free speech. I would also say, though, as many people have said, that that free speech needs to be exercised with a certain amount of due care. Many people have said that, on both sides of the House. What I am also saying beyond that, which is something the minister will not agree with me on, is that the level of care that has been taken by some individuals central to the political process in this country has been a little less than it should have been. When leaders in Australia emphasise certain aspects in their comments, or reiterate certain comments they make on various issues, they do create an impression. It was an issue that was often thrown at the previous Prime Minister. The opposition and others would latch on to particular comments he made, sometimes take them out of context and certainly give them undue emphasis and create an impression. With, say, free speech-we certainly saw this some months ago, particularly in the case of the Prime Minister---certain issues have been emphasised. That emphasis in itself created an impression, and that impression created action and reaction. We are seeing some of that reaction in Australian society today. I know in my local area, particularly after some of the comments of the member for Oxley, issues of race are now a subject of open discussion, but not in the sense that they should be-not in an informed sense; more in terms of what is the reaction that occurs as a result of these sorts of actions. We are seeing things like bashings and various forms of abuse-which I have not seen for some years, and in most cases not at all in my local area-which can be drawn straight back to that debate that is going on. That is very sad because I think that sort of debate, if held properly, calmly and sensibly, is a debate that is well worth having in terms of the size of the migration program and in terms of the nature of population sizes and the sort of society we want in the future. But it has got to be a debate not only based on facts but also steeped in facts. It has got to be a debate that is held very calmly and sensibly and by all parties. I think that there are some dangers associated with aspects of the way it has been handled. What it needs is a good, strong dose of leadership. We have seen some signs of that, but I do not think we have seen enough and I think a lot more has to occur at that level. Certainly it worries me when I see a situation in my local area where I talk to people and they tell me things like, 'I went to the pub, I had a drink and the circumstances were I was abused by people in that pub, nice and loud, and comments were made which were racist and that hasn't happened to me before in that area.' Sometimes we are talking subjective, sometimes we are talking just incidents, but there is a definite pattern developing which is very worrying in terms of the whole fibre of our society. Although the government has a program and has a right to pursue it, I guess, one of the sad things about legislation of this nature, in circumstances where we cannot get agreement and when some of the charges in that legislation are quite outrageous, is that the program of the government is becoming intertwined with the issues. I do not believe it is the intention of the minister to do that. I do not think that it is any way his intention, but it becomes part of the result. That in itself can detract from the overall debate and the sensible consideration of those issues in terms of the society we have and the society we want to have in the years to come. As I said earlier, there are a number of matters in this bill which the government has put forward that the opposition does oppose. However, I know that we are here to work with the government where we can on these sorts of issues, because these issues are too important to politicise. I hope that the minister would have the sense, and I am sure he has, to look at these issues again and try to come up with a balance which suits the question of the needs of his government but also suits the need for a modem, multicultural society. That is an issue that I hope all members of the ministry take into consideration, from the Prime Minister down. It is certainly something that I hope will be reconsidered at cabinet level.",244
588,Mr OKEEFE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I have been in this parliament for a number of years now and have previously chosen not to participate in debates on migration because when in government I was reasonably satisfied with the changes to legislation we produced from time to time. However, I think the circumstances that have arisen in Australia now warrant, certainly from my part, some comment on the public record, and so I am making it this evening. Yesterday, when talking to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), I told him of some particular reasons I feel very strongly about the issue of Australia's immigration and culture. If you go back to the Commonwealth Law Reports of 1948, you will find the case of O'Keefe v. Calwell and the Commonwealth of Australia. The person involved was Mrs Annie O'Keefe, my father's aunty. She was the wife of an Army General of the Dutch East Indies, as it was then known. Her family was repatriated to Australia when her husband was assisting the Australians in the war. Her husband was killed, and she later married my dad's Uncle Jim. One of my great shames is that the Labor minister for immigration at the time deemed that, under the White Australia policy, she was not eligible to remain in Australia, even though she had married an Australian citizen. There was an attempt to deport her. It became a widely debated case, and I believe it is the case at the centre of the famous 'two Wongs don't make a white' statement that was made in this chamber. It is a matter of great pride to me that my father's aunty is of Asian origin, that that is part of our family and the Labor Party has in fact earned an image in recent decades of overturning that whole concept of the White Australia policy and everything that went with it. I have listened very closely to the contribuindustry, tions of just· about every member in this debate and I find it rather paradoxical. The government is reducing Australia's immigration numbers and wandering around Australia proudly touting itself as a low immigration party. By the way, I predict that that is a position which will change in the not-toodistant future when some of the lobbyists from some of the industries needing growth that comes from a stimulus through immigration start working on them. I believe those same people will in the future be in this chamber explaining why they think the immigration numbers need to go up. Every single contribution to this debate by people opposite has been: 'We believe in immigration. In fact, many of us come from a migrant background. We strongly support it. Guess what? We are voting here to reduce immigration numbers.' It is a bit paradoxical, and it has set a debate going that should never have happened in this country. I will make some comments about the phenomenon of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and what has developed. I was listening to the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) make the point about the media's role in seizing, developing and running with this issue. Let us not misunderstand for one moment that it was just the media. Fifty thousand people do not ring up the Midday show and express their views in the form they did unless something has got them running. I will tell you what got them running. For 18 months before the last election-not from the leadership of the Liberal Party and the National Party; they were not stupid enough to do it themselves-out in every regional electorate of Australia three key phrases were contained in every speech made. I am one of Labor's few surviving regional members. I have been debating this stuff on country radio and in country forums around central Victoria and elsewhere for the last two that years. I will tell you what those three key phrases were, and I will ask members opposite to stand up here in the House and deny that they were not using them. Those three phrases were: political correctness, Aboriginal and Asianisation of Australia. Those phrases were run everywhere. Now, of course, it has set loose something that has got to be contained. Mr Ruddock-Not in our party.",246
589,Mr OKEEFE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"What about Katter? None of you have ever disowned him. The minister might have, but none of the rest of you have ever disowned him. Do not forget for one moment where the member for Oxley came from. She was preselected by the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party. Mrs Moylan-And dumped.",247
590,Mr OKEEFE,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Yes, dumped. She was dumped once she made her views publicly known in an embarrassing situation in the election campaign. She was preselected by the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party by people who knew very well what her views were. Not only was she chosen by the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party, but where did the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) go to make his nice little dabble into this debate about lifting the pall of tensorship of debate in Australia? Full marks should go to his now opponent in the Liberal Party on a lot of these things, Jeff Kennett, the Victorian Premier. He came straight out and said, 'What pall of censorship?' What on earth was the Prime Minister talking about? He was talking about something that his party and his people had stimulated and fired up: the belief that because of the concept of political correctness these sorts of views were not being given a proper run in debate in Australian society. Now it has all gotten out of hand. Quite frankly, I thought the contribution of the member for Oxley to this debate this week was sad and pathetic. I am not talking about her personally; I am talking about her contribution to the debate. It was simply a repeat of the mindless slogans that were used in her maiden speech in this place. And the delivery of those slogans showed that it was running out of gas. Why so? Because everybody is unloading on her. The media that picked it up and built it are unloading. it. The Prime Minister is unloading. Everybody is unloading. Remember when those remarks started to get coverage in Asia and the Graingrowers Association suddenly discovered that there might be some wheat markets at risk? Full marks should go to them for coming out and demanding that something be done about this. And full marks should go to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) for going straight into the marketplace and saying, 'Hey, this isn't on.' Now we are all in the process. Everywhere we go around Australia everyone of us is in the process of trying to unwind this rubbish and trying to get this country back on an even keel. We now have thousands of people marching in the streets trying to demonstrate that this is a fair and decent society that racist. Why in the hell are we having this debate in Australia? How in the hell did it get going? I do feel strongly about this issue. You have never heard me speak like this in the parliament, but I feel we all have a duty to unwind it. Those people who were out there in the trenches getting those views going, cranking up the votes, now have a duty to get out there and unwind it because it is doing irreparable damage to this nation. Unwinding it means that you have to take it on the chin. Some of the people who supported you, particularly in rural and regional Australia, are the most vulnerable. Those areas have had higher unemployment. The people have been led to believe that noone cares about them and they have had a good old dose of Liberalism and National Partyism since the election. Those people feel very vulnerable and they are the same ones who were cranked up. Now you have to tell them you are not going to implement the sorts of ideas that were behind the concepts of the Aboriginal industry and Asianisation of Australia. It has to be unwound. It has become our problem. It has become the problem of all members of the federal parliament, but everybody knows where Labor stands. It is Labor's approach to immigration, it is Labor's approach to reconciliation that has been the subject of these campaigns. You do not go to an election winning votes on those slogans unless you are campaigning against Labor's approach. People know where we stand. Now we have to do the job, too, and it is hard for all of us. I say to the minister in respect of this legislation that we are not happy about the cutback in numbers. We are not happy about the changes in the balance. You have sloganised around Australia-you are sending out your stuff about the family tax packageat the very time when your immigration bills are discriminating against family structures. I have a bit of sensitivity about this too because my son is married to a girl from California and we had to go through the process of trying to get them in the quotas. It is hard enough as it is. That is not a sham is not marriage. Neither are most of them. I know from the history of our family that if you marry an Australian citizen you are entitled to Australian citizenship. We have to work our way through these things. The one final thing I will say in this debate is that I know the minister himself is in fact very conscious of what I call decent obligations under these policies. I have heard him speak. I have seen him as a shadow minister in this area for many years. He knew that when he brought forward these proposals we would be opposing them in the form that we are. That is the fact of it. But I say to you, Minister: not all those people who sit behind you share your views or share your egalitarianism on this issue. You have to do the work among your backbench to get them back out there and undo this. We will play our role in this. It should never have come in the form that it has. We will play our role in this parliament with respect to the legislation and our proposed amendments. I call on all members in this place, most particularly those on the other side who have been part of this process, to now go out there and do the task that helps us re-establish our reputation in the world and re-establish our reputation among ourselves. It is a very idle boast in Australia at the moment to wander around describing ourselves as a truly egalitarian, free, caring nation and one of the great democracies in the world. Of course we are, but it is an idle boast when we are having a debate like this. A population debate, yes. The Barry Jones standing committee set that running. It set some guideliries, gave us a basis around which to debate what will be the long-term population of this nation. But it did not talk about the population mix, and it did not invite the kind of debate that we have stimulated in this community in the last nine months. I call on every member to do their part to undo it.",247
591,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"in reply-I don't want to in any way diminish the remarks of the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), but I do think the way in which we all respond to this issue is particularly important. I regret that having made his remarks he has been critical of members on this side of the House and has put doubt on their sincerity on the issue of a non-discriminatory approach to immigration. That does us absolutely no good service at all. Quite frankly, it is those sorts of comments which try to suggest that members on that side of the House are in some way pure and which throw into doubt the credibility of members on this side of the House that, I think, perpetuate the sorts of arguments we have heard. I do not intend to spend a lot of time on that issue. I assume that members come with a genuine concern about these issues. But I think that if they do have a genuine concern they would not be trying to doubt the sincerity of members on this side on those issues. I do thank honourable members generally for their contributions. It has been a long debate. There have been a large number of speakers. I will try to deal with the issues that have been raised in generic terms rather than try to cover individual speakers, except in some specific respects. However, I want to say that these bills are designed to achieve four important measures as far as the government is concerned: first, to provide more flexible means of managing the migration program. It was part of a package of measures. It needs to be seen in that context. Some of the measures that we needed required legislation, some regulation and some matters could be dealt with administratively. It was a total package of measures that we announced. These are part of that package. The second part is to increase the cost recovery in the portfolio and thus reduce the subsidisation by the taxpayer or at least the expense it outlays in other areas. The third issue that we are dealing with is to allow for minimum cohabitation periods if persons want to live in Australia on the basis of a de facto relationship. The fourth is to enable the deprivation of citizenship if a person has obtained residence by fraud. Honourable members would be aware that this is an area in which I have had an interest over a long period. I do believe the portfolio is one where politicking is not very helpful. It is a key and sensitive area of public policy and, as recent events have shown, it is crucial that if we are to discuss immigration we must do it in an informed and tolerant way. I believe we ought to be able to discuss the issue of immigration generally. But as with any discussion it must be judged on the basis of facts, not myths. We ought to reason rather than use prejudice and in any debate it must be based upon the principle so recently affirmed by this parliament that Australia has a non-discriminatory immigration policy-that is, non-discriminatory in terms of race, country of origin, religion or ethnicity. That does not mean to say that immigration policies are not selective. We have always had to choose. There have been some very interesting contributions from time to time. The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) at one stage suggested the way in which we should choose was to allocate quotas on a country basis. Mr Hockey-Shame!",249
592,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I am simply saying that, in a debate about these matters, where you are making choices there are different views about how those choices ought to be made. We have had to make those choices over a long period because the expressions of interest from those who want to come are very much larger than the number of people we can accommodate. Selection criteria have always focused on three aspects: the humanity that we have to other people around the world, which is embodied in our refugee and humanitarian programs; our respect for people's aspirations as families to be able to live together; and a desire to ensure that in any program we are seeking those skills and attributes that we might need here in Australia. We have always had to try to balance the program in a way which best suits Australia's interests but reflects each of those interests. When you look at programs abroad, you find that only a few countries have immigration programs of the sort that we do. If you look at the program in Canada, for instance, you will find that it is larger than ours for a much larger population than ours. Nevertheless, the percentages of skilled migrants entering Canada are roughly equivalent to those who enter Australia at the moment in the family reunion categories. The humanitarian and refugee elements of our programs are roughly comparable. But, whereas we have a comparatively small skilled migration program, in their program that is where the numbers for family reunion roughly come out. I think it is important to try to get a balance in the program. We have not seen that of late. I made some comments on that earlier today in a statement, and I will not reiterate those comments. But I do want to say that this is an area of public policy in which I would prefer to see the opposition willing to offer the same cooperation that a former opposition has offered a former government. I was party to many of those discussions and arrangements over a period. That is why I will be able to comment on some of the matters that have been raised with a degree of knowledge. I know the contributions of members on the other side of the House and I know the record of discussions and negotiations that took place. As I mentioned earlier today in a statement. I made, Labor received cooperation from us in introducing charges for English language tuition, introducing assurance of support bonds and the key migrant services health charge, because they knew that without a bond, assurances of support were virtually meaningless. They received cooperation from us in introducing occupations that require English as a selection criteria. They received cooperation from us in introducing fees for migration applications. They received cooperation from us in introducing the balance of family test for parents and also in introducing measures beneficial to Australian citizens compared with residents and, contrary to the shadow spokesman's so-called fact sheet, Labor's introduction of the 20 points for English in the independent category selection criteria. The fact is that, when those sorts of changes were made, they had cooperation from us. We have announced a smaller program. We have announced a more balanced program. We are seeking to return to the balance in the program that has existed in the past. We have significantly sought to tighten entry criteria and are looking at better ways to target the program to labour market needs. We are intent on ensuring that non-humanitarian migrants pay their own way, although I will not go over Labor's record on this again. The measures that we have taken are, I believe, entirely consistent with a commitment to a non-discriminatory migration program. But, given the disallowance of some of the important measures required to restore balance, I did announce earlier today some measures that we have sought to implement to deal with those issues. A number of the issues raised during this debate do require specific comments from me. The first relates to the issue of capping. It has been referred to in a number of the comments made. The member for Denison (Mr Kerr) said that 'capping has never been anticipated by any government in this country before'. That was his quote. That is just plainly wrong. It was contemplated. It was contemplated by Senator Ray. The provisions were contained in clause I1J in the bill that was introduced and read a first time in the Senate as the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. Clause I1J made it clear that the minister may, by notice in the Gazette, direct that dealing with applications for visas of specified classes is to stop until a day fied in the notice, and it was without limitation. The fact that limitations occurred by the time that bill was read a third time was as a result of negotiations between Senator Ray and me. The reason I referred to the issue",249
593,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,What about the parliamentary committee?,251
594,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The parliamentary committee was not involved in this issue at that time. The fact is that the parliamentary committee got involved only as a result of an agreement between Senator Ray and me that the implementation of the migration policy that existed at that time would be subject to parliamentary committee review. It came after that bill had been introduced in that form. But the fact is that this was a measure that was contemplated by the Labor Party. They withdrew the provisions of capping for spouses, dependent children and aged parents because I raised it. The reason I raised it in my speech was that I thought it was a reasonable change to have achieved. The fact is that it was a very different situation when that was pursued. At the time we had a very much lower number of spouses who were seeking to enter Australia through the program. In 1988-89, 18,700 spouses and fiancees were approved for entry to Australia, representing 15 per cent of the total migration program. By 1995-96 these figures had ballooned to 33,550, representing 40.7 per cent of the program. That is the context in which we are addressing this issue now as distinct from the context in which this issue was addressed by me when it was first proposed by the Labor Party that capping, in relation to the spouse, dependent children and aged parents categories, ought to apply.",251
595,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,That doesn't change the human rights issue.,251
596,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"What it does change is the circumstances in which those issues were being addressed. No-one can seriously suggest that the government wants to separate bona fide spouses and other persons in life partnership relations. Of course, that is not the case. But the figures and evidence that we have can only lead us to a conclusion that these categories have grown quite disproportionately in speci- circumstances where we have real doubts about the efficacy of the program. We have had to implement these measures, designed to detect abuse of the scheme and to enhance the overall categories as part of a balanced overall program. The member for Calwell and other opposition speakers have criticised a number of measures in the bill as being contrary to human rights legislation and instruments. They are blatantly wrong statements and they must be corrected. All of the measures in this bill and in the regulations recently considered by the Senate-my department consulted extensively with the Attorney-General's Department, the Commonwealth's experts on international law and human rights law-are in accordance with our obligations. In relation to that matter, I noticed that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills asked from me certain explanations on the application of the Sex Discrimination Act and also on citizenship. It is interesting that, in the explanations I gave, the committee thanked me for my careful response and did not go on to offer any divergent views on the matters on which I commented fully to them. I find the hypocrisy on this issue breathtaking. For instance, they say that an English language requirement for the concessional family category is racially discriminatory. Labor introduced a similar form in a points test in the independent and business skills category. More specifically, in 1992 they introduced the so-called 'occupations requiring English' requirement for both concessional and independent categories. That is what they did. The former minister gazetted-I have a copy of the gazettal here, signed by Nick Bolkus on 22 August 1994115 occupations requiring English in the concessional family category. Members opposite seem to be so bereft of any knowledge in this area that they do not want to remember or cannot remember what they did merely two years ago. The member for Calwell has suggested that this issue of spouse migration should have been referred to the joint standing committee. He queried the sensible measures that the government has introduced, particularly plans in this bill for improving bona fides for that category.",251
597,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,What have you got the committee for?,252
598,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,The fact is that the committee which he suggests should look at this matter has commented on this matter before. It was at the time when the honourable member was the chairman of it. I have here a copy of the report Change of Status in relation to marriage and de facto relations. The report given by that committee made a clear recommendation that a minimum cohabitation period be required for de facto relationfor ships-a 12-month period was suggested in that case. That is the very type of arrangement that is being proposed in this bill.,252
599,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,What about the other aspects of the case?,252
600,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,This bill is an enabling bill and the fact is that we can talk about whether or not you are prepared to agree to a lesser period. We have suggested it be two years. Mr Kerr interjecting,252
601,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"These sorts of negotiations do not have to be pursued in your time and circumstances, but they do need some genuineness on your part and express willingness to engage in dialogue. If the opposition cannot find somebody who is prepared to sit down and talk about these things reasonably, then put somebody else in who is prepared to try to look at these things. You have challenged all along the way issues of this sort because you are determined on all of these issues to establish yourself as being able to achieve outcomes which are totally different from the way in which your own colleagues sought to manage an immigration program. You have set yourself certain targets which are totally out of line with the way in which programs have been managed in the past. You want to ensure that on these matters-and it is quite clear that you do not accept schedule 1 which would require regulations to implement the period-you oppose the implementation of regulatory arrangements to enable the period to be accepted on the basis",252
602,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,On the same basis that you opposed it in 1989.,252
603,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,That can only be on the basis that you do not want a government to have the capacity to regulate in this area. Mr Kerr interjecting,252
604,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"No, in relation to this area I clearly did want something done in this area. That is a fact. I was a party, along with the member for Calwell , to the recommendations contained in the interim report that there ought to be a 12-month cohabitation period a de facto relationship as proof, on the part of the applicant, before an application is made.",252
605,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,What about the report on spouses? You are contradicting yourself.,252
606,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,This issue is clearly one that was dealt with by the committee,252
607,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,You are the one who is not doing what should be done in this case.,252
608,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"You are flying in the face of the recommendations of your own colleagues. I doubt if you have even read the report. Your colleagues have been concerned, as have members on this side of the House, about these issues. I would have thought there would have been on your part-because you are the one who has to take a leadership role in this and you are the one who has to take it to shadow cabinet-some willingness to show some flexibility on these matters to ensure that the public interest questions are addressed. We ought not to lose sight of the issues that we are dealing with here. There are clearly a number of other issues that need to be dealt with, but in the time that is left I will not be able to deal with them. I will pick them up when we deal with each of the specific amendments that the opposition is going to propose. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Clauses 1 to 3-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Schedule 1.",252
609,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The opposition opposes schedule 1. Might I simply respond to a couple of points that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has made in closing the debate. The first point I should make is in relation to the 1989 legislation. I am not certain of the minister's recall-recalls in the partisan atmosphere of parliament seem occasionally to differ-but certainly his recall does differ from that of Senator Ray who was the then minister. Senator Ray has informed me that the provision that was inserted in the bill in a general way was never intended by the government to apply to immediate family relationships, that is, to husbands and wives, dependent children or that group within the elderly parents. When the issue was raised by the opposition, as a matter of prudence to make certain that it was absolutely clear, a provision was inserted into the legislation-that then had the support of all members of the Senate and of the House-that made it transparently clear that no government ever in the future could take such a step as the government is now intending to take. So we oppose schedule 1. We believe the minister was right when he rejected it as unconscionable in 1989 when he said that for a government to proceed in such a way would cause agony-and I imagine he meant both to itself and to those to suffer as a consequence thereof. Because I think the House really needs to pass from this measure relatively quickly-we have other matters coming before us soon-I will keep my remarks brief. But could I say something about cooperation. The minister said it seemed that I and my colleague the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) could not remember events of some two years ago. I would suggest to the minister he cannot remember events that have occurred since he has become minister, because he read out a whole range of issues in which he had provided cooperation to the former government when he was in opposition. Might I mention to the minister that since he has been in the role that he holds he has sought my cooperation on a number of matters: for example, legislation to exclude third party legal touting in respect of people who are detainees at Port Hedland and other centres. He received that cooperation and we have supported that legislation despite widespread criticism. He has received our support on fraud control measures and for the introduction of two-year probationary visas. He has received our support on visa charges, although we think that he has increased charges and costs excessively and far beyond that which would ever have been anticipated by the electorate given the assurances that were provided by the coalition. We have permitted increased visa charges. We have permitted and facilitated the extension of a preclusionary period from six months to two years for unemployment benefits. There has been a whole range of matters where the Labor Party, as the opposition party, has accepted the responsibility that goes with being in opposition. The minister knows I have sat with him in his office on a number of occasions and put to him, for example, on de facto relationships the point that two years took the matter so far beyond what was reasonable that we could not possibly concede that to him but that if he were prepared to come back with a lesser period I would take it as part of my responsibility to go back to my colleagues and discuss it with them. The minister never came back that it caused to me with a proposal. Essentially, we have had a political bagging exercise where the minister has stood up and said that he is not getting any cooperation, that the opposition is being entirely unreasonable and that it is forgetting its past. But, when you examine those things and actually dismember the facts from the rhetoric, the minister does not come out particularly well in terms of credibility. Indeed, his effectiveness is quite diminished by the fact that he cannot obviously see his way to persuading the Senate that these measures do have support of the nature that he says is appropriate for them. I will also respond, albeit very briefly, couple of specific points that the minister raised about the first schedule. (Extension of time granted) The minister said that it would be doubted that a government would wish to prevent family formation and people bringing dependent children to this country. The fact is that those are the very powers he seeks in this legislation. Every measure the minister has put forward for control of fraud has been agreed to by this opposition. The only marriages that would be affected by this capping measure are those which are bona fide. So what he is really seeking is a power to control bona fide, legitimate, familial relationships. I said earlier today that at a time of high unemployment both the Labor Party and the coalition run low immigration programs. This is the question: by what mechanism? We have said that families will not suffer, that is has to look after its own first. If a choice has to be made, let us make that choice in favour of our own and the right of Australians to bring their partners of choice to this country. Let us not make it in favour of foreigners with no relationship to this country, who will come here seeking employment in competition with Australians and who will relieve the burden that the government should rightly have of training Australians so that they can take up that employment. Because of the tightness of time, I really should conclude my remarks. One specific point that the minister raised earlier in debate was the Canadian migration program. He pointed out that the Canadian migration program has a 50 per cent skilled component. That is true. But the minister failed to mention that the Canadian government has committed itself to a program of one per cent of its total population for immigration intake. So the total Canadian intake is some 200,000 per annum. The Canadians can easily absorb anyone into Canada who wants to go there as a spouse, a dependent child or an elderly parent and still find 50 per cent for the skilled categories. So, too, could Australia if we had a one per cent program. That would be 180,000 people coming in. The problem is to a that we have decided to be a low immigration nation. Having made that choice, something has to give. We say it should not be Australian families.",253
610,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Let it not be said that I lack gratitude for the cooperation that I receive. I appreciate that cooperation has been forthcoming on the several matters that the shadow minister mentioned. But it would have been very difficult for the opposition to have opposed those measures. Mr Brereton interjecting,254
611,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,I do not think those sorts of comments are very becoming either.,254
612,Mr BRERETON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I was talking about your colleague, as a matter of fact.",254
613,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,I do not think they are Australappropriate if you offer them about my colleagues either.,254
614,Mr BRERETON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Don't misconstrue what I said.,254
615,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"You offered them in the context of a debate to try to put people off their mark, and they are very unbecoming.",254
616,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Mr Vaile)Order! The minister has the call and he should direct his remarks through the chair.,254
617,Mr BRERETON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,He took the matter up with me.,254
618,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I did because it was loud enough for me to hear. Let me make it clear on the issue of cooperation that I welcome the cooperation we have received where we have received it. But the opposition would have been in a very difficult position if it had been seen to be opposing the two-year temporary entry permit arrangements because it had clearly legislated in that form for onshore relationships. Likewise, on the cooperation that was afforded to Migration Bill (No.2), I suggest they would have had a great deal of difficulty with their colleague Senator MCKiernan, who is very vocal on those issues, particularly on the need for vigilance in maintaining the efficacy of our borders. The fact is that the cooperation that was afforded by the former opposition to the former government was such that there was, I think, only one issue on which it was ever threatened that there would be a vote in the Senate on the management of the migration program. We are in a situation which I have pointed out before: the parliament in the form of the Senate is trying to micro-manage the program. In that situation, you do have circumstances arising, as we saw with the concessional family category, where the concessional family applicant is not able to obtain any points for English language competency but the spouse is able to obtain points for English language competency. Clearly a situation like that only arises because you have got people trying to make amendments to regulations in the form of disallowance resolutions and the like. We cannot manageMr Leo MCLeay interjecting",254
619,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Yes, we can-a migration program unless we have effective cooperation from the parliament. That is what Senator Ray had. I am sure that he probably reminded you of that when you had the opportunity to speak to him. The bill puts beyond doubt that the Labor Party introduced a capping measure. The Labor Party did. The only reason it came out was that we drew attention to it. The fact is that we are now in quite diametrically opposing situations in the numbers of people seeking to enter Australia through the spouse category and the numbers that were entering through the spouse category at that time. That is the reason we have pressed this matter. The important issue that needs to be understood-it was made clear in the statement that I delivered this afternoon to the parliamentis that we will be ensuring that the program is managed properly. There are provisions in the law to cap and terminate. The measures that we are seeking here will ensure that the power that enables us to cap and queue, which is far more preferable, is able to be put in place. I would be more than happy to negotiate out the provisions that we are seeking to implement to improve the cap and terminating provisions if I am going to be able to have a cap and queue arrangement. I would be perfectly happy to look at negotiating away the changes in relation to the cap and terminating provisions if you were prepared to give us, and accede to, the reasonable cap and queuing arrangements, which I do not hope to have to use. Fortunately, the numbers of spouse applicants are coming down but if per chance the measures-(Time expired)",255
620,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"We have been told that we have only a limited amount of time, so I will just make these comments. First of all, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has not answered the question about human rights at all. Just because he mentioned that he has a couple of people from International Law to give him some opinion does not mean that he has really dealt with this issue. We are going to pursue this issue, Minister, because what you are trying to do in the spouse category is contrary to basic fundamental issues of human rights. You know very well that you yourself were opposed to this in 1989 . You are on the record as being opposed to it. On the whole question of the capping powers, you know very well that the kinds of powers you sought would allow a minister to actually set and determine an immigration program virtually without any power in the regulations. It would make a mockery of the parliament's control of the immigration program. In that sense, it is outrageous for you to suggest that we are going to be in a situation where you are going to have enormous powers to do what you like with the capping of different categories. You suddenly mentioned tonight, in the very last hour, that maybe you could have discussed this in a fairer way, with a more reasonable approach, with the opposition. I do not know where you have been for the whole year in relation to that; maybe we can start again next year. The fundamental point is that we are going to oppose these provisions because they are mistaken. Although we are not going to divide because of the time, let me tell you that our party-the opposition-is totally opposed to what you have been trying to do in this way. Why don't you go back, think about it again and come back with reasonable proposals? Schedule agreed to. Schedule 2.",255
621,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I do not wish to take up the time of the House, but I formally indicate that the opposition opposes Schedule 2. Schedule agreed to. Schedule 3.",256
622,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Again, I simply record our formal opposition to this schedule. Schedule agreed to. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to.

623,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. On 11 November 1996 the proposed referral to the Commonwealth by Victoria of the power to legislate over industrial relations matters in that state was jointly announced by the Premier of Victoria, the Hon. Jeff Kennett; the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the Hon. Mark Birrell; the Victorian minister with responsibility for public sector industrial relations, the Hon. Roger Hallam; and me. This bill gives effect to the undertakings made that day to provide a simpler, cooperative industrial relations system in Victoria which benefits employees and employers and the wider community. It relies on the referral of relevant matters to the parliament of the Commonwealth by Victoria's Commonwealth Powers (Industrial Relations) Bill 1996. This will allow the extended operation of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 in Victoria without the restrictions arising from the limits of power available under the constitution. That wider operation will be in addition to the act's ordinary application. The Commonwealth and state legislation marks a highly significant point in the evolution of Australian industrial relations. It is also a very substantial step forward in microeconomic reform. In the development of the Australian constitution, apart from income tax matters, it would be hard to come up with an example of greater significance than the transfer of powers from a state to the Commonwealth. This referral demonstrates how state and federal governments can fundamentally transform the traditional relationship between their often competing jurisdictions to the immense benefit of the nation. There is no doubt that the referral from Victoria to the Commonwealth was made possible by the political events of 2 March, with the election of the Howard government and the subsequent passage of the Workplace Relations Bill. Just as importantly, this reform helps businesses and workers to enjoy far more productive workplace relationships. The Victorian government deserves full recognition for its willingness to take such an historical initiative. For too long the Australian community has suffered from the collision of the federal and state industrial relations systems. This rivalry has been at the expense of the efficiency of those systems with consequent costs not just for the national or regional economies but also for individual employers, workers and members of the wider community. This bill marks a transition to a new phase in state and federal cooperation. The bill will make access to the federal system easier for Victorian industry and workers. The inevitable legalism and complications of industrial relations under the overlapping state and Commonwealth jurisdictions will be dramatically reduced. The artificiality of creating interstate disputes to attract the federal jurisdiction will cease. In short, these arrangements will do much to give employers and workers in Victoria greater control of their working relationships without the distractions and jurisdictional problems which occur where there are potentially two sets of rules relating to them. The benefit of this much simpler system was referred to by Minister Birrell in his press release announcing the passage of the Victorian legislation. Minister Birrell said: Victoria would now be a much more attractive environment for international investors looking to establish a presence in Australia. Today's decision puts Victoria in a better position than any other state to attract new employment generating investments from abroad. International investors will no longer have to wade through the minefield of separate industrial relations systems in this They now have one clear system to work under, saving time, resources and importantly, money. Together with reforms in the electricity industry, the port sector and local government industrial relations reform will cement Victoria's reputation as Australia's leading investment destination. Mr Birrell went on to say: The Victorian referral contained a number of important safeguards including no employee will be disadvantaged by the referral. Existing arrangements will continue unless employers and employees choose otherwise, and Victoria will retain its constitutional right to withdraw the referral power at any time. Labour market reform is an essential for a sustained economic growth in Australia Those were the words of Mr Birrell in his press release of 5 December 1996. The government hopes that the cooperation in this matter between the Commonwealth and Victoria will encourage other states to consider the benefits of this proposal. The benefits have certainly been clear and well articulated in a number of comment pieces on the change. For example, the Herald-Sun, the well-read Melbourne daily, said this: The new federal legislation coupled with the Kennett government's handover will begin an era of structural change that neither the Hawke nor Keating governments could ever have achieved irrespective of their allegiances with unions. On 12 November the Daily Telegraph in New South Wales said this: Yesterday's first steps towards a single industrial relations system across the nation should be whipped into a gallop. The in-principle deal for Victoria to refer its industrial relations powers to the federal government opens the way for big savings. Tantalisingly, it also indicates how substantial those benefits would be were all states and territories to match this breakthrough in federalism. Whilst the current Labor New South Wales government has made its intentions clear, I did note with particular interest an article in the Australian of 12 November which reads as follows: But the New South Wales opposition spokesman on industrial relations, Mr Chris Hartcher, said he supported the move and said, 'The only real beneficiary of this massive duplication has been the lawyers and the bureaucrats.' This is, of course, a matter for each state to consider in its own time and circumstances. Even so, there are encouraging signs that state. other states also wish to work with us to improve the overall national system and to remove barriers to workplace flexibility and efficiency. This can be achieved by the creation of a single system with its obvious immediate benefits, just as Victoria is doing, or by the harmonising of laws and practices and the sharing of resources, as we are seeing in other progressive states. In this context, I note the progress made by Queensland in reshaping its industrial relations laws to complement those of the Commonwealth. All of this keeps the momentum up in the vital task of establishing a better framework for fair and productive industrial relations. I tum now to the specific provisions of bill. Schedule 1 contains the amendments relating to the referral of matters by the Victorian parliament which will give wide legislative powers to the Commonwealth responsible parliament, subject only to a number of limited and specific exemptions in the state legislation from the referred matters. On assent to the bill, a new part XV will created in the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Division 1 of the new part will provide framework for additional provisions will be inserted by a proclamation of the remaining items in schedule 1. This will enable the relevant provisions of this bill commence with the corresponding provisions under the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996. Division 2 of part XV will extend the entered into. operation of the Commonwealth provisions concerning termination of employment, industrial disputes, certified agreements, Australian workplace agreements and freedom of association. These provisions will give relevant parts of the Workplace Relations Act full operation in Victoria for all employers and employees within the scope of the reindustrial ferred matters. Division 3 of part XV will introduce new provisions designed to maintain certain entitlements now given by the Employee industrial Relations Act 1992 of Victoria. This is necesafter sary to ensure that there is an effective transiThis tion to the federal system. Neither the Commonwealth nor the Victorian governagreements. ments would accept a situation where some people were left without proper protection of Act. their basic entitlements. We have agreed on the creation of a safety net of protection Victorian workers based on that given now the state legislation. This will ensure that anyone who is not subject to a federal award or agreement will be guaranteed an enforceable right to an up-to-date minimum wage and to certain basic leave entitlements. This will apply both to employees under employment agreements and employees under ordinary contracts of employment. In particular, the Workplace Relations Act will maintain the minimum conditions of employment which currently appear in schedthe ule 1 to the Employee Relations Act. These will be contained in the new schedule 1A to the Workplace Relations Act. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will become for setting and periodically adjusting minimum wages for employees not subject to a federal award, certified agreement or royal AW A. This adjustment of minimum wages be will be within the framework of industry sectors and work classifications which has a been determined by the Employee Relations which Commission of Victoria. Again to ensure a minimum of disruption through the change in the system of industrial to relations regulation, employment agreements under the state legislation will be given continuing operation. However, no new agreements of that type will be able to be The commitment of the parties to agreements which they have made under state legislation will be recognised under the Workplace Relations Act in the same way as the for certified agreements and AWAs. The parties to a continuing collective employment agreement will only be able to take protecte9 action to secure a certified agreement or an AW A when it expires. The parties to a continuing individual employment agreement will only be able to take protected action for such purposes three years the commencement of these provisions. reflects the absence of any provision in the state legislation for the expiry of such It is also consistent with the life of agreements under the Workplace Relations These requirements will not apply to emfor ployers or employees under employment by agreements which have been deemed to exist by the operation of the legislation, for example, after state awards were abolished. Moreover, there will be nothing to prevent parties to any form of continuing employment agreement from agreeing to enter into certified agreements or AWAs whenever they so wish. There will be an intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and Victoria in relation to the implementation and maintenance of the new arrangements. This is expected to address consultation between the governments on the operation of the legislative scheme and of the referral generally. The agreement may also address the necessary administrative arrangements, which are still under discussion. I will refer briefly to the remaining provisions of the bill. Some technical amendments are proposed. These are not related to the referral of matters by the Victorian parliament. Schedule 2 to the bill corrects a drafting oversight. The amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 by that schedule ensure that complementary state laws can confer power relating to the vetting of AWAs on the commission, as well as on the Employment Advocate and authorised officers. Schedule 3 to the bill adjusts the commencement provisions of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The amendments enable schedule 12 of that act-which establishes the no disadvantage test-to commence before the commencement of item 3 of schedule 10 of that act (which establishes Australian workplace agreements). This in tum will enable the commencement of schedule 8-which makes fresh provision for certified agreementsindependently of the commencement of the AW A provisions. It would be remiss of me, in debating for the first time this particular legislation, not take the opportunity to remark upon the efforts of many to secure the passage of this legislation in a timely way. In fact, in itself for the policy behind this legislation to have been announced on 11 November and for us to secure the passage of this legislation, in what has already been a very crowded legislative timetable and program for the federal parliament, by 14 Decemberofficially 13 December in Hansard-so that it can come into operation on 1 January 1997. This was an important feature of the referral inasmuch as with the commencement of the new Workplace Relations Act and the referral coinciding on the same date we are able to secure a convenient transition from the old to the new for Victorian employees and employers. Their convenience, of course, and the convenience of literally hundreds of thousands of people was important to secure. Many have been involved in that process. I particularly want to take note of the significant cooperation that the government has had from Senator. Kernot, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, and Senator Andrew Murray, as the official spokesperson for the Democrats on industrial relations matters. Senator Murray and I have been in close consultation and discussion on all aspects of this matter, and I appreciate his great interest in the issues and his preparedness to give of his time. I would also note the work done by John Cherry of Senator Kernot's office who has also been closely involved in the negotiations. It was necessary for there to be, and appropriate that there be, a brief Senate inquiry and the committee met earlier this week. That was done again expeditiously. A number of people were put to some time, trouble and expense to appear and make a contribution before that committee, but it was appreciated. In particular, I mention Brian Corney of the Victorian government, Danny Walsh from the Victoria Police Association and John Cairns on behalf of the ACTU. I wish to pay particular tribute to the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, for the example and lead which he has given on this very important issue. It is symbolic of Mr to Kennett that he should take such a bold move, and I have no doubt that history will treat him very well for his initiative in the key area of it is a feat industrial relations reform. I particularly want to thank his two ministers, Mark Birrell and Roger Hallam, whom I worked very closely with in preparing and bringing to fruition this policy announcement, for the excellent cooperation and close assistance that we had from them. I also thank their advisers. I thank in particular from the Department of Industrial Relations Alex Anderson and Robin Stewart-Crompton, who have both again provided the highest level of expertise and professionalism to bring about this result. I also particularly want to put on the public record my thanks to Peter Richards, my chief of staff. Having once and fairly recently been a policy adviser in the Victorian government, he was uniquely placed to bring some sensible suggestions. In fact, I think it would be fair to say that he, by and large, designed the schema which has politically and legislatively made this a possible event. I pay tribute to the work that he has done to make sure that this all happened. This is a historic change in the operation of the industrial relations system in Australia. It is a change for the better, to the advantage of both employers and employees. It is a very good model for the seamless transition of the jurisdiction. It is a model which does not disrupt business from the point of view of either employers or employees, yet it moves the system into the federal system and provides us with the sweeping away of a lot of complexity and unnecessary cost for individuals, businesses and the like within the system. As I said in my opening remarks, it would be difficult to think, apart from income tax, of a more significant shift in constitutional power in this country. It does reflect very well, I think, on all of the parties. It has been made possible by the election of a coalition government, and we appreciate the opportunity to, with the Victorian government, bring about one of the most significant and historic changes that we have seen in the management of industrial relations in Australia. This change was the first very big win for the Workplace Relations Act. I am sure that, as the benefits of the legislation introduced as a result of the policy commitments we made at the election become widely available for the Australian community, there will be many more wins for the Workplace Relations Act 1996. So it is an historic occasion. Lastly, I do appreciate the cooperation we have had from the opposition in securing the timely passage of this legislation. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum. Leave granted for second reading debate to proceed forthwith. Saturday, 14 December 1996",256
624,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The opposition does not oppose this industrial relations legislation because the broad thrust of it, which is the transfer of industrial relations responsibility from Victoria to the Commonwealth, is a concept which we endorse. When all the hyperbole and superlatives about the magnitude and significance of the change are stripped away, all you are left with is that, once again, we have got from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) a pretty smart piece of politics and a second-rate piece of industrial relations. It is probably very good in advancing his interests, it is probably very good in his campaign against the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to be the next leader, and they probably think it does some good in the government's campaign against us. Maybe it does. I do not think the world is going to be determined either way by this particular piece of legislation. The problem is that it is really a second-rate sort of transfer. We welcome it-we will support it because it is better than nothingbut it is an important chance muffed. The truth of it is, of course, that the industrial relations system of the Victorian government is so unfair to working people in Victoria that any change, even a change to the Workplace Relations Act as passed by this parliamentmy views about that are well known, but that has been passed; that is the law of the country and we accept it-is an improvement. We find ourselves in the situation where no workers in Victoria will be worse off as a result of this and some will be better off. Therefore, while in the Senate we sought to amend the bill to make it better-I think if those amendments had been passed the transfer would still have been not ideal-it would have been only as good as the powers contained within the Victorian legislation, which are the parameters within which we have to work, could make it. We should not pretend that what we are really getting here is one industrial relations system for Victoria. What we will have is the state system in Victoria grafted on to the federal system. We could, if time permitted and it were not 10 past midnight already, talk about a large number of examples, but I will talk about just one. You would think that if we were going to have one system of industrial relations you might, as a starting point, say, 'What we will have is common minimum standards. Everybody in Victoria will know what the minimum standard is that applies to their contract of employment.' But that is not the case, and we know it is not the case that Mr Reith-Are you arguing that?",260
625,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"We moved an amendment to try to achieve that, as you know. Mr Reith-You wanted to apply the federal no disadvantage test. It wasn't a uniform law.",261
626,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It was a uniform minimum in terms of the application of minimum standards to contracts of that sort. It would have been appropriate and desirable, but it was not passed in the Senate. I do not intend to traverse it again now. There are many examples, and we can go through them all if we like, but I do not think this is the time to do that. It simply means that what we are not achieving here is one system of industrial relations. We would rather have this reference than not have it, so we support the legislation, but let us strip away the hyperbole. It is a very interesting possibility. It is welcome to see such a transfer take place. It may be a precursor to more and better transfers, and that would be welcome. For that reason, we are going to support the bill. The parliament is significantly constrained in what it can do about this matter. The minister and his representative in the Senate have quite accurately described that situation. In a sense, what the Commonwealth is doing is constructing a receptacle to receive the powers transferred to it from Victoria. There is not much more we can do, and properly so. That is what the constitution provides in the circumstance of transfer of power of this sort. Therefore, properly-although, in view of the outcome, unfortunately-the parliament is constrained in the extent to which it can amend this bill. That was debated in the Senate. I do not want to go into the merit of it but, simply in the description of what limits and describes the nature of our response to it, that is a significant factor. There is no way the parliament could amend this bill to purport to give effect to powers that have not been referred by the Victorian parliament, unless they are otherwise available to the Commonwealth under some other head of power. There are some circumstances in which that could be so, but effectively that is not the case we are dealing with here. While we as an opposition might be and are critical of the extent and nature of the reference by the Victorian parliament, that is the reality with which we are dealing. That is a matter that was debated in and decided by the parliament of Victoria and it is not a matter we can revisit. It is an interesting bit of public debate we can have and will have, and it is one of the things that constrains the limited value that is achieved by this particular transfer. Nevertheless, it is not a matter for the Commonwealth parliament beyond that. We believe that it was possible for the Commonwealth and the Victorian government to implement a superior reference than the one we have before it, and I hope, if it does become a precedent for referral of power, that we find it done more substantially and better in future. This transfer does not represent a giant leap towards a single system. It is rather, as I said, a grafting of one system on to another. But there is no doubt some people will gain benefit from it. At least, there will be the potential to gain benefit. The opportunity will be open to Victorians to gain benefit. I hope they will be successful in seeking to take advantage of that, and if they are that will be welcome. It does at least provide an opportunity for Victorian employees to access the federal industrial relations system where, without this legislation, they would not have been able to do so. The nature of the change, therefore, is a welcome, although modest, development. I want to record, as the minority in the Senate committee report did, my concern about the position of the police officers in Victoria. I understand in general that is a matter a state jurisdiction would want to keep responsibility for in a number of ways. If you are defining what constitutes the parameters of an independent entity, the capacity to deal with its own enforcement agency would be one. That is understandable. But the one area of concern that I have relates to unfair dismissal where we sought to amend the original workplace relations bill to give Victorian employees access to federal unfair dismissal laws. In general, it was decided by the parliament, the government and the Democrats not to support that. The ostensible basis for that was that Victorian workers would get access via this process. Some have and that is welcome, but some people have been excluded. That is not something we can do here because, as the Victorian Police Association itself recognised, that problem was caused by the nature of the reference by the Victorian parliament, not by this legislation. Nevertheless, it is a problem for those people and they have been caught in a pincer. They did not get the amendment to the original legislation because this parliament chose not to give it. They cannot get access through this legislation because the Victorian parliament chose not to give it. I regret that, but it is not something that can be pursued in this parliament. The constraint lies in Victoria. We have what I have described earlier as a disappointing second best outcome. I think that is a pity. Nevertheless, it is a right direction. It is a bill we think would have been better for the amendments we proposed in the Senate, but we will not revisit that here. They would have covered some of the defects in the bill. They could not have gone to the question of the limits in the reference itself where the core of the problem resides. That is inherent in the nature of what we are receiving. You cannot in designing the box for which someone else is responsible for the contents say, 'It is a lovely box, a pity about the contents.' I think through some amendments to the receptacle or the box we could have done some things that would have made the system more effective and advance the interests of some workers now and, in particular, prospectively in Victoria. Whatever I think about the agreements entered into under the Victorian legislation, they have been properly entered into under the laws of Victoria. I do not want to retrace that step and undermine those agreements that have been entered into. At no stage did we propose that any of those should be changed retrospectively. Our concern is that what this parliament is doing is legislating to accept that the woefully inadequate standards applied in Victoria will have their application as a result of Commonwealth law. I do not agree with that, but the parliament is doing that. The Senate rejected the amendments. We could go through a little ritual and put them all up here again and get them all defeated again, but the arithmetic of that is not very compelling. There are no extra points to be made in the debate as a consequence of doing that. There is nothing one could establish in the committee stage in a bill of this essential simplicity that you cannot establish in the second reading stage. So I will not take the time of the House any longer. The opposition will be supporting the legislation. We have our criticisms of it. We doubt that it will achieve any of the grander objectives outlined for it. When you measure it against the essential criterion, will any worker be worse off? No. Will some workers be better off? Yes. So without the grandiloquent phrases and the hyperbole, we neverthestep in the less still support the bill.",261
627,Mr TONY SMITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I have just listened carefully to the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan). He commented in relation to the position of the police, but it should be said that the reservation will not affect the ordinary application of the act to the police and it is difficult to see how the police could be said to be unfairly treated as the recent New South Wales approach to the question of dismissal of police shows. There are very good reasons for maintaining direct controls over the management of police forces. It is also interesting to reflect on some of the comments of the honourable member in relation to an almost churlish approach, almost uncharitable, to what has been achieved here by cooperative federalism. When one reflects upon it, for years the Labor Party was in power both at a federal and state level in Victoria, in particular at the state level, and this was not achieved. You might well ask why that was. It really has its roots in the outmoded and outdated approach of the opposition to industrial relations reform in this country. The bill is another stepping stone in the wide-ranging reform in Australia's industrial relations system, which I have said already has been stuck in an outmoded, cost-ridden mire, hinged with legal fallacy and at times bordering on the neanderthal as far as its operation has been concerned over many years. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996 will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 using the additional Commonwealth legislative capacity to be provided by the reference of certain matters to the Commonwealth parliament by the Victorian legislation-most importantly, a unified system for industrial relations in Victoria. No more competing jurisdictions; no more overlapping-a way ahead. It demonstrates, as I have said, the cooperation that exists between Victoria and the Commonwealth, and it is a very clear example of cooperative federalism. Several hundred thousand workers will benefit. I am glad to hear the member for Canberra acknowledge that some of them will be better off and none will be worse off. I think that is very important in considering this particular matter. I do thank the honourable member for that concession. Obviously, the important features of the bill and the reference will involve the termination of employment provisions and the freedom of association, in particular the freedom of association of independent contractors-a matter that I referred to in my speech on the original bill. Given the time, I do not wish to labour the point. It is quite clear, however, that in the time of the Cain government and the Kirner government that followed nothing was done to get the system to operate in some sort of uniform way and get it flowing the way this particular agreement has been struck and this particular referral has been undertaken. Historically, the constitution provided Commonwealth power where there were disputes of an interstate nature, with territories and also public servants. But there were always problems of cost and complexity, and artificiality frequently. A number of attempts at constitutional change failed. It is true that the Commonwealth has accrued greater power over the years through the use of the trade and commerce power, the corporations power and the external affairs power and, with High Court interpretation, judge made law. But I would respectfully say this is not necessarily a good thing. It lacks that sense of cooperation that this particular measure demonstrates. So my submission to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that we are seeing a best approach where there is this federal compact with the state of Victoria. That is what we are seeing occur here. In this respect, in some ways Victoria was really the forerunner of a revolution in industrial relations when they introduced their legislation two months after gaining office in 1992. It is interesting to observe what one commentator, in the Sydney Morning Herald of 14 November 1996, said: It is the first time a State Government has ceded its powers on industrial relations to the Federal Government. A political leaderMr Kennettinstead of simply bemoaning the absurdity of Australia's seven separate industrial relations systems, has at last done something about it. Other comments have been already referred to by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). It is also worth noting that the bill marks a transition to a new phase in state and federal cooperation. It will make access to the federal system easier for Victorian industry and workers. The inevitable legalism and complications of industrial relations under the overlapping state and Commonwealth jurisdictions will be dramatically reduced. As I have said already, the artificiality of creating interstate disputes to attract federal jurisdiction will cease. That legal fallacy will cease. I also welcome the new industrial relations legislation in my own state of Queensland, which has been put together by Santo Santoro, the relevant minister in that state. Again, it indicates close cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. It is to be hoped that we eventually will see a system where all of the states by agreement refer the power to the federal government, as the Victorian government has done. There is more that I could say, but in view of the time. I will conclude by saying this is a good measure. It demonstrates a very good working relationship between the minister and the Victorian government. It can only benefit all of Australia.",262
628,Mr WILTON,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It is with somewhat of a wry grin that I follow the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) in discussing this matter because when it comes to matters of industrial relations he is best known on this side of the House for saying that we on this side have never worked with our hands and therefore know little of industrial relations. Of course, he was maintaining his average by making a number of additional fatuous statements this evening, and one can only wonder what a member for Queensland knows about the Victorian industrial relations system. In fact, he made some passing reference to the fact that the Borbidge government is to implement its own new system of industrial relations. Yet he made no reference to the fact that he would pursue the Premier of that state to implement an IR arrangement similar to that which he proclaims is of great value, as it now occurs, to Victoria. I ask the member for Dickson-through you, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - whether or not he will pursue the Premier of Queensland and in what form he will pursue him. I ask whether he will write him a letter, knock on his door or make a telephone call to ensure that the Premier-using the member's own wordswill implement a system of similar benefit to Queenslanders. We on this side of the House acknowledge that there will be people who will benefit from this system. Of course, it will benefit those 100,000 people who marched in the streets of Melbourne exactly four years ago prior to this arrangement being struck-II November 1992. That is Remembrance Day, and we will remember that day for its monumental achievements and for drawing matters to the attention of the Kennett government, whose cabinet on that occasion were lined up on the steps of Parliament House in Spring Street, Melbourne, obviously fearful of the impact that that particular demonstration against their own industrial relations legislation would have as it reverberated around the state of Victoria. There were 100,000 people in the streets that day who could have told the Kennett government that its IR system would fail. From that day, there were many people who fled the state IR system and began to participate within the federal jurisdiction. Among those were many workers of both blue and white collar persuasions, but they did not include, of course, higher management echelons within the Victorian public service and those employees under the state emergency services act who, to their detriment, remained under the remnants of the Victorian industrial relations system. The member for Dickson has talked about the revolution in IR, and this is one component of such a revolution. In this instance the revolution does not see a red flag flying over it, but indeed a white flag. There has been a white flag run up by the Kennett government as it has thrown its hands in the air, recognising that it lacks both the calibre and the wherewithal to deal with industrial relations in a way that is of benefit to either Victorian employees or employers. The Minister for Industrial Relations in Victoria, Phil Gude, has simply not been 'Gude' enough and there is no doubt that his performance is under question and has been since that fateful day, 11 November 1992, when the first of a range of ongoing protests in the streets of Melbourne was organised by various trade unions and employee groups. So it is really on behalf of those people that I speak to the parliament this evening. I know that they would join with me in acknowledging that this so-called initiative is nothing more than a way out, nothing more than a vehicle through which the Kennett government can wash its hands of what, in its own view, must undoubtedly be a disastrous attempt as a first foray into the new world, in fact the New Right realm of industrial relations. I have got no doubt that the workers of Victoria, and indeed the workers of Australia, will unite in opposing the general thrust of industrial relations and the new workplace relations bill as it has been proposed and now passed by this parliament. One can only hark back to the year 1929 when the then Prime Minister of Australia lost his seat of Flinders to the then Trades Hall Council secretary, Ted Holloway, over an industrial relations issue. I am sure that the member for Flinders is here this eveningMr Reith-I am still here. I have already lost my seat once.",264
629,Mr WILTON,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,He will be trembling in his shoes at the thought of losing his seat at the next election under similar circumstances.,265
630,Mr MCARTHUR,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am delighted to be associated with the speedy passage through both the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill-a very significant piece of legislation. This bill will remove the complex and costly duplication of industrial relations jurisdictions which have dogged Australia since Federation. For the first time since 1901 Victoria will have a single industrial relations system. As the minister at the table, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), said on 11 November, the Premier of Victoria, industry minister Mark Birrell, Mr Reith himself and the Victorian minister with responsibility for the public sector, Roger Hallam, announced the handover of Victoria's industrial relations power to the Commonwealth, a very historic moment. The member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) mentioned that in fact the Premier of Victoria was running up the white flag. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was a very historic moment and leads the way for an industrial relations regime which will be beneficial to all Victorians and Australians, and I am sure other states will follow the lead. As honourable members would be aware, the Hawke-Cain-Kirner Labor governments at the federal and state levels had an opportunity to bring in similar legislation which the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), is now agreeing with, but they made no attempt to do so except to try to move some of the personnel in the Victorian system to the federal system. Yet, they broadly agree with what is being done now. This legislation simplifies the complex and unwieldy interaction between the federal and state jurisdictions. Traditionally, the Commonwealth has relied on a narrow band of constitutional powers to regulate industrial relations. The Commonwealth constitution gives the federal government the power to settle interstate industrial disputes through conciliation and arbitration. Thus the federal government has traditionally been constrained. It has traditionally set minimum wages through arbitrated awards, and the arbitration system has only been able to settle disputes of an interstate nature, as those of us who have had an interest in this matter would understand. That means the disputes have had to be contrived by artificial means-logs of unrealistic union claims-and the disputes have had to be interstate, so large unions had to serve the same log of claims on a large number of employers in different states to bring about a so-called dispute so they could develop their ambit log of claims. These processes, as every member would know, are highly artificial and unwieldy. We have all seen these unrealistic logs of claims which unions have served on unsuspecting businesses for the sake of creating a dispute so they could get into the arbitration system which historically has existed but which now, after 1 January, will be done away with. Small business proprietors without a good working knowledge of industrial relations have been alarmed by the sheer audacity of these ambit claims over the last 50 or so years to bring about these contrived disputes. The federal industrial relations system has also symbolically been based on disputes rather than agreement. That is a key feature, and I well recall my discussions with the former Minister for Industrial Relations, the former member for Corangamite, the Hon. Tony Street, when these matters were the key to those arguments in a bygone era when disputes were the norm in industrial relations discussions rather than a genuine desire to bring about an agreement between employers and employees. Of course, that mentality locked in the class warfare which had dominated industrial relations since its inception the early 1900s. All the while, state jurisdictions have run their own industrial relations systems where the federal system did not apply. The state systems generally imitated the federal arrangements of compulsory conciliation and arbitration. More recently, agreement making has become a central part of the industrial relations systems in states like Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales when it was under a Liberal government. We saw dramatic changes in Western Australia, where there was a consensus view to move towards agreements rather than confrontation. Now in Victoria we have a single industrial relations system for all workplaces which will be governed by federal industrial law. From the average person's point of view, employees and employers alike, it will be quite a sensible and common sense way to go. The federal Industrial Relations Commission will be able to modify the safety net of minimum conditions without the artificial contrivance of an interstate industrial dispute, as I have said. Also, access to enterprise bargaining will not be limited to those workplaces which are incorporated-another important feature. In recent years the federal government has used the corporations power in the constitution to pass provisions in relation to enterprise bargaining. This has meant incorporated businesses have had access to those provisions while others have not had the same access to the federal enterprise bargaining stream. For example, the non-union enterprise flexibility agreements contained in the Brereton act were based on the corporations power of the constitution. The High Court has recently upheld the use of the corporations power to base federal industrial relations laws. The new Australian workplace agreements contained in the Howard government's Workplace Relations Act 1996 also rely on the corporations power. So in most states the AW As will be available to incorporated entities. In Victoria, other small businesses will also have access to Australian workplace agreements. It is estimated that only around 18 per cent of small businesses are both in incorporated and respondent to a federal award-the two traditional prerequisites for non-union enterprise bargains. So the transfer of powers with the passage of this legislation this morning makes the award system more workable and the enterprise bargaining system more accessible. The handover of industrial relations power from Victoria to the federal government will mean the federal unfair dismissal laws will apply in Victoria without having to rely on the external affairs power. As every employer brought to our attention during the election campaign, those unfair dismissal laws in the 1993 Brereton act were based on the external affairs power, using an ILO convention secretly signed by the Keating government in the lead-up to the 1993 election. Every Australian employer knew the quite damaging effect, both in impact and potential impact, of those unfair dismissal laws. So these reforms brought in by the minister at the table have meant a great improvement to the unfair dismissal laws, which under the previous government were anti-jobs, biased against small employers and a gross misuse of the external affairs power. The bottom line is that with the passage of this legislation there will be a single, simple and accessible industrial relations system in Victoria. It is clear that the safety net minimum conditions of Victorian workers will not be disadvantaged by the transfer. I note members opposite are happy with that and have not raised that point in their debate. The fundamental catalyst which has allowed this transfer of power to come about is the offer from the Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett, and the passage of the new Workplace Relations Act by the Howard government led by the minister at the table, the Minister for Industrial Relations, who has done a remarkable job, in my view. I again place on the record my admiration for his understanding of the details of this act and the other major act that passed through the parliament a few days ago. The Kennett government could never have handed over their industrial relations power to the former Keating government while Laurie Brereton's industrial relations act was in place. Every student of industrial relations would fully understand that. It was the Australian people's decision to support the Howard government that made this transfer so easy and so sensible. As members in this place would understand, in 1992 the Kennett government came to power in Victoria and inherited a massive crisis in a bloated public sector. They now have 50,000 less public service jobs. State debt was over $30 billion; there were massive unfunded liabilities in the state superannuation scheme; there was a series of financial disasters such as Pyramid; they had high unemployment; they had high rates of taxes relative to the rest of Australia; and they had a massive crisis of confidence. The Kennett government, as everyone in Victoria understood, had a very uphill reform task before it and has carried on in a very solid and constructive way in bringing about a change in that state. One of the key reforms was to move to a more decentralised and flexible industrial relations system, getting away from the centralised, union dominated industrial relations system which had dogged both Victoria and Australia for the past century. This involved significantly downgrading the state arbitration system and moving employees across to workplace agreements and individual contracts. It was then that the Keating government in Canberra sought by all means possible to frustrate the direction and intent of those reforms. The then federal government legislated in 1992 to make it easier for Victorian workers to move across to federal awards, giving their mates in the Victorian Trades Hall a temporary reprieve from their growing irrelevance in a decentralised Victorian system. Then in 1993, the Brereton Industrial Relations Reform Act sought to use the external affairs power to enshrine a whole series of minimum conditions from the above act in Victoria, including the notorious dismissal laws. So for four years, the Labor government in Canberra sought to frustrate Victoria's industrial relations reform. Members in this House would well recall the constant moves to shift those employees from Victoria to the federal system. Estimates as to the number of Victorian employees who transferred to the central system vary. One estimate suggests that the percentage of Victorian workers covered by federal awards rose from 40 per cent to 60 per cent between 1992 and 1994. More recently, the Financial Review reported that some 20 per cent of Victorian workers were covered by the state system. Clearly, on 2 March, there was a watershed election where industrial relations played a key part and the Howard government were elected very much on that platform of sensible industrial relations reform. This meant that the Howard government and the minister at the table were able to introduce a more flexible system with more accessible non-union workplace agreements; simplified awards; improved unfair dismissal laws which everyone around Australia applauded; voluntary union membership and an end to the closed shop no ticket no start; and tougher sanctions against irresponsible union behaviour. Thus the Kennett government, by the decision just last month in Victoria, was in a position to entrust its industrial relations system to the Howard government at the federal level. So it is the best of both worlds and all Victorians will benefit. The less centralised, less union dominated federal industrial laws are philosophically in line with the Victorian government's general direction. The application of the federal system to Victoria will make life simpler for businesses and employees right across the state. Small businesses in regions like my home town of Geelong will not have to contend with unions trying to drag their employees across to a federal jurisdiction through extravagant logs of claims. Employers and employees alike will have greater certainty as to where they stand in their workplace relations. What a big change from the situation that used to exist in Victoria. Importantly, all businesses will have access to the federal system whether or not they are incorporated entities. This is important in trying to spread non-union enterprise bargaining to the small, private sector, non-union businesses throughout Victoria. The 1995 annual report into enterprise bargaining in Australia indicates that, while enterprise bargaining is on the rise, it is more predominant in large, unionised, public sector workplaces. It is an interesting set of figures. In 1995, 51 per cent of workplaces covering 68 per cent of employees experienced some form of bargaining at the workplace. Seventy per cent of the public sector workplaces bargained, compared with 43 per cent in the private sector. Of the workplaces that had some enterprise bargaining, 93 per cent had union members on the site--out of all proportion to the fact that only 30 per cent of the private sector work force is unionised. That is a very significant set of figures because we know that union membership is dropping quite rapidly in the private sector. Of the small businesses with no union members on site, only one per cent had a registered agreement. That clearly indicates the distrust that small businesses had with these agreements under the Brereton arrangements. Size also had quite a big impact: 81 per cent of the workplaces had more than 500 employees compared with 41 per cent of workplaces with 20 to 49 employees. So it was the bigger firms that were prepared to take on these arrangements and the smaller ones that could not understand and were not prepared to take the risks. Clearly, the smaller, private sector, non-unionised workplaces have not been engaged in enterprise bargaining at a federal level because of their concern that the unions would dominate the arrangements. This is a very historic bill. I commend the minister at the table. I commend the Victorian government, and I thank those persons in the Senate who facilitated this change so that it can come into place on 1 January 1997. That will be a culmination, in my case, of 10 years of debate in bringing about a fundamental change to the industrial relations system in Australia, and now in Victoria, so that we can look forward to the next century with a sensible approach to employer and employee industrial relations from the Commonwealth's point of view without competing state jurisdictions. It is my hope that other states will follow this lead so that Australia has an across-the-board sensible federal jurisdiction without all these conflicting arrangements. It is landmark legislation for which I commend still the Howard government and I commend the legislation to the House.",265
631,Mr MCCLELLAND,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The opposition, as pointed out by the shadow minister, substantially agrees with the transfer of jurisdiction from the Victorian system. However, I would like to point out some inconsistencies in the reasoning of my colleagues on the other side, if only to get them to think about these issues in formulating their policy. Clearly, the message that comes from my colleagues in government is that they think this transfer is highly desirable and they regard it as so for a number of reasons including reducing technicalities, costs and things of that nature. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) indicated he favoured it because it was an example of cooperative federalism. I think all the speakers who have spoken for the government have suggested that this transfer would not have occurred if it had not been for the election of a Liberal government on 2 March, and that is quite right. But the paucity of logic in that analysis is that you cannot have powers flowing to and from the states depending upon which political party is in power either federally or at a state level. It will not work. As pointed out, there have been instances in recent history where Labor governments were in power in most states and also federally. It mayor may not be the case for a variety of reasons that the states want to hand over their powers to the federal system. What I am saying, therefore, is that there is some inconsistency in the logic of the government members in favouring this advancing of federalism, but not looking at it with intellectual honesty as to how it can be achieved. The reality is that it will not happen entirely from cooperation. The fact is that it is most unlikely that there will be a coincidence of federal and state governments in power or that the political pressures in the states will be such that they will willingly transfer their powers. My point in all this is that federalism, particularly in industrial relations, is not only highly desirable but, when we increasingly have to focus on our export industry, I submit that it is also essential. If you are going to do it, do it properly and look at the full range of federal powers available to use. With respect to the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), he, again, replicated some inconsistency that has been revealed by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), who on a number of occasions, particularly in question time, has got stuck into the opposition for relying on ILO convention 158 for the unfair dismissal provisions. But when you look at the current provisions in the Liberal government's act, it replicates and reproduces a reliance on !LO convention 158. So there is an inconsistency in the public position of the government and what the experts behind the scenes are doing to try to achieve the result-that is, to rely on the full gamut of powers, whether they be, as the member for Dickson pointed out, trade and commerce, external affairs or the corporations power. My point is that if you are going to do it, do it honestly, do it openly and do it properly. Look at all those powers and do the task. Do not mouth supposed gestures towards states rights. At the same time, get the experts behind the scenes to rely on the totality of the armoury. There is room for logic and there is room for honesty and the government should approach its policy position on that basis. The other point I was going to make is that the significance of the government's steps here have been overstated. For instance, on the one hand, again, we have seen the inconsistency of mouthing this beneficial federalism. But when you look at the actual provisions of the workplace relations bill, they have actually walked away from federalism. For instance, an amendment to section 128 of the act will now actually preclude the federal commission from intervening in state proceedings if that state proceeding is considering a state industrial agreement or the approval of that agreement. Again, that is watering down the powers of the federal commission. The other relevant provision is the addition of a new section 152(3) which specifically states that the federal act will not intrude into the area of state employment agreements. So on the one hand we have the minister voicing and favouring federalism but on the other hand his actions in the act demonstrate an inconsistency because he is watering down federal powers. What I am saying to the government is: get your focus in order. You don't need to cringe about federalism when federalism is desirable, as it clearly is here. Be honest about it, rely on the full powers and do it properly. Don't do it by supposed concoctions and formulas and have inconsistencies in the existing provision. For instance, this legislation is not going to be so straightforward. Although there will be scope for a lot of Victorian employers who simply have local disputes to come into the federal system, the reality is that the federal system can still operate and intrude into the Victorian system by virtue of interstate industrial disputes extending into Victorian territory. The bill, as I read it, is quite silent as to how the federal commission is going to deal with an argument as to whether a dispute is entirely Victorian or Victorian extending interstate. That is going to be the source of quite some argument and quite some discussion and quite some cost. Again, it is something which has not been done entirely properly. It has been a desirable step forward but not a full and complete step forward. Indeed, my point is this: you are not going to have a full and complete step forward until you look at honestly saying, 'This is an area where federal law should prevail. If it means overriding states rights, let's be honest about it, but let's do it.' Don't cringe from the intellectual honesty of stating when something is desirably a federal matter; take the bull by the horns and do it properly. You have not done that here. What I am saying to government members is: there is no need to cringe, you are in government, you are professionals. Look at what you are about to achieve, look at how to achieve it and do it properly without being hamstrung by any underlying prejudices about necessarily preserving states rights for the sake of preserving states rights when it is quite illogical, inconsistent and impedes overall efficiency. Given the hour, that is about all I will say on the scope of the legislation. I will not venture into the actual technicalities that have been covered by the shadow minister. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Reith) read a third time.

634,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Quick)For the information of honourable members, I present a schedule of government responses to the reports of House of Representatives and joint committees for the period 30 April 1996 to 13 December 1996, and reports presented to which responses are outstanding. Copies of the schedule are being made available to honourable members and it will be incorporated in Hansard. The schedule read as followsSchedule of Government Responses to House of Representatives and Joint Committee Reports and Reports presented to which responses are outstanding for the period 30 April 1996 to 13 December 1996 Schedule of Government Responses to Committee Reports On 27 June 1996, the Government presented its response to a schedule of outstanding Government responses to parliamentary committee reports tabled in the House of Representatives on 9 May 1996. The Government affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports presented during the present Parliament within three months of their presentation and to clear, as soon as possible, the backlog of reports arising from previous Parliaments. The Government's commitment follows the undertaking by successive Governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in a timely fashion. In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. The Keating Government generally responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. The attached schedule lists Government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 9 May 1996. It also lists reports for which the House has received no Government response. It is intended that a Speaker's schedule of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings. The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives. The Government's responses to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Description of Report Aboriginal and Torres Strait Review of Auditor-General's audit report No.6 of 1995-Perfonnance audit-Community Development Employment Projects Scheme: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Review of Auditor-General's audit reports No. 36, 1992-93; No. I, 1993-94 Volume 3, Sections 1.131.39; and No. 27, 1993-94, Sections 16.19-16.24 Banking, Finance and Public Keeping the customer satisfied: Inquiry into the devolution of running costs flexibilities Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia's 1993-94 annual report and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's 1993-94 annual report Taxing relaxing: Report on the impact of Australia's taxation regime on the tourism industry Broadcasting of Parliamentary Radio and television broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings Certain Family Law Issues (Joint, Select) Funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia Child support scheme-An examination of the operation and effectiveness of the scheme Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Jet Fresh: Paddock to plate.

635,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"On the weekend I attended the meeting of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation at Launceston in Tasmania where we received and noted the resignation from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation of Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who has been a foundation member of the council. He wrote to the Governor General, Sir William Deane, tendering his resignation in these terms: Dear Sir William As you know' I have decided to resign from the Council For Aboriginal Reconciliation. Please convey my heartfelt thanks to the Council members. It has been a pleasure and a privilege to work with them and it has been a time. I will never forget. I tried as much as I could to share my knowledge and beliefs and I did this sincerely and on behalf of Aboriginal people from all over this country. I have the utmost respect for yourself and the other council members but I firmly believe the council cannot continue to sit as though nothing has happened since the election of the Coalition Government. The new Government claims in Parliament to be committed to the Reconciliation and Native Title processes but in reality it has provoked us and mocked us. I feel I cannot continue to treat them with respect. I remain committed to working with the indigenous leadership as a broad group and I will continue to work on behalf of all people as long as I can. Our rightful place is on our land, in our camps where we have a right to make a fire and lay our children down. That place where we share our food and share with the other camps around us. That place where we sing and dance and cry about our country. That place is in our hearts and our thoughts always. I hold grave concerns that it is the intention of the current Government to threaten our rightful place and our country. Given these concerns I feel I am unable to continue to service as a member of the council. Yours sincerely Galarrwuy Yunupingu NA NA The council received and noted that resignation with regret. Mr Yunupingu, as I said, was a foundation member of the council. He has made an enormous contribution to reconciliation in this country. He has been a great advocate for his people. The council wished him well. He still has a role to play. I think it is a sad day that he had to tender his resignation to the council. Democratic Processes: Abuse",275
636,Mr MILES,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (1.04 a.m.)-I want to complete a speech which I was making to repudiate some comments made by Mr Best MHA in the Tasmanian parliament. I refer to three quotes by Mr Best in his speech. The first was: Mr de Haan, JP, who has had 25 years of loyal service to the school questioned whether Mr Miles had in fact pursued the funding. Mr de Haan was subsequently visited by the Federal Police at the request of Mr Miles. The second quote was: Letter allegedly written to me by Mr de Haan. And the third quote was: Questions about financial problems and my role. 'Why was Mr de Haan harassed?' With respect to these claims by Mr Best, very little make sense and most are inaccurate or false. I respect Mr de Haan and I continue to respect him, but I find his attitude to women, the role of MPs intervening in legal proceedings and the threat of political action prior to the 1996 federal election authoritarian, demeaning, discriminatory, objectionable, unjust and ill-informed. On 13 February 1995, Mr de Haan met with me at my Burnie office and requested in strong terms that I exert my influence over my wife and that it was my duty as a husband to persuade her to drop any legal action against the school. He told me that it was not a threat but that, if I did not intervene and stop the proceedings, he would organise political action with a group of men to undermine my credibility and standing in the community by organising a campaign of letter writing to both northern newspapers in Tasmania. I told him I would give the matter some thought. On 23 February I spoke to Mr de Haan by phone and informed him that I would not be intervening to stop legal action taken by Mrs Miles. I made my position quite clear. I do not believe members of parliament should use their position to intervene in legal proceedings. On 27 March my wife and I received an unsigned letter at our home address. That letter contained threats of action being taken against me as a member of parliament. The letter stated: I have been approached by a group of men, all parents of (Leighland) school. This group is planning to start inserting small articles under public opinion in two northern newspapers several times per week against you, Chris, as a politician, slowly building up an anti-Chris Miles feeling generally among the Braddon electorate. I am not in support of such action. On 23 April I wrote to Mr de Haan informing him that I would be placing the matter he spoke to me about on 13 February in the hands of the police. On 27 April I made a statutory declaration to the Tasmanian police at Burnie. In contradiction of Mr Best's claim, I have never believed the letter came from Mr de Haan. With respect to the letter from Mr de Haan, quoted by Mr Best, that letter was never received at my office. Mr de Haan has never spoken to me about the funding submission to the federal government as indicated by Mr Best. Not only that, the police, according to Mr de Haan in the letter quoted by Mr Best, visited him on 24 April 1995, yet the school did not give me a copy of their submission until 14 months later on 1 July 1996. Perhaps Mr Best can explain how it is possible for him to claim harassment of Mr de Haan over his alleged questioning of financial matters that arose 14 months after the police had visited him with regard to an entirely different matter. The attitude that Mr de Haan displayed when he spoke to me in my office was that he believed women were effectively the property of their husbands, and that they had to be subservient to their demands. That part of the school culture, as illustrated by the action attitude of Mr de Haan with respect to women and their subservience to men, is to be regretted. Mrs Miles is a university graduate with professional qualifications from Tasmania and New South Wales. She has taught in government schools in Tasmania, New South Wales, the ACT and at the Leighland School for 11 years, five years as vice-principal. Her rights as a professional teacher to take action should not be diminished because of her being married to a member of parliament. Sometimes standing strong for the principle of equality before the law, justice and a fair go for people in one's electorate is not always easy or straightforward. Neither do boards, which receive substantial money from government, take kindly to their budgets being found to be inaccurate. This case is particularly complex but, no matter how difficult it is, the people of Braddon can be assured I will fight against mismanagement of funds in schools where taxpayers' money is involved, and I will fight for women and men who genuinely believe they have been unfairly treated. Family Benefit: Child Care",276
637,Ms MACKLIN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Jagajaga) (1.09 a.m.)Yesterday the answer of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to my question on child care was the culmination of six months of dodging, ducking and downright deception of Australian families. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has handed this minister a very big task which he and his government are taking very seriously, which is, of course, the ruthless pruning and the rigorous cutting back of Labor's program of child care. This minister is directly responsible for some of the more draconian and insensitive of this government's ideologically driven cuts. She will also have to bear, from April next year, the community revulsion that will follow from the exposure of the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister's oft repeated term about protecting the vulnerable and families. What is also clear from this minister's answer yesterday is that she is starting to feel and the pressure of this role. She is starting to find it all a little bit hard to bear. She obviously became tired of dodging and ducking the question when I asked her about cuts to her portfolio and the real harm that is going to be caused to Australian families. She obviously decided that it was time to have a shot back, but in doing so she made a total hash of it. Let us have a look in Hansard at what she said yesterday. First of all, she said: ... I want to expose the shadow minister for what she is. She is running around this country spreading misinformation about the family tax package and about the child-care system.",277
638,Mr CADMAN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,Granny basher.,277
639,Ms MACKLIN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"But then she started to get into a little bit of trouble. Mr Lee-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the Chief Government Whip just called the member for Jagajaga a granny basher. I think that is offensive, and I ask the honourable member to withdraw it immediately.",277
640,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"I have to say that I did not hear the words, but if the honourable member found them offensive it would really be a matter for the honourable member for Jagajaga to indicate her concerns.",277
641,Mr CADMAN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, her comments in this House indicate she has no time for the elderly, but I will withdraw the remark.",277
642,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,You withdraw the remark unconditionally?,278
643,Mr CADMAN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,Unconditionally.,278
644,Ms MACKLIN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The minister went on to say in the House yesterday: ... in response to a letter from someone in Townsville recently who has been told that her child-care fees will be raised by $56.44 per week, we took the opportunity to ring that parent. We ran through the figures with her. We found that her child-care fees would be raised by only 56c per week. I am not sure whether this is a deliberate attempt to mislead the Australian public or, wait for it, whether the memberobviously referring to mehas put the decimal point in the wrong place. The figures that the member keeps touting around this country can be demonstrated to be totally inaccurate. Let me put it categorically on the record that I have never written to this 'someone in Townsville'. The minister's amazing accusations and deliberate misleading of the parliament have obviously prompted me to do a little checking. This is the real situation, as best I can discover. The someone is Townsville is a single mother of two children who works full time.",278
645,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,The honourable member for Jagajaga accused the minister of deliberately misleading the parliament. That can only be the subject of a substantive motion. I suggest that you withdraw that remark.,278
646,Ms MACKLIN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,I will withdraw 'deliberately' and just say that she has misled the parliament.,278
647,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"No, you must withdraw the remark unconditionally.",278
648,Ms MACKLIN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,Is that correct?,278
649,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,You ask the chair. The chair has made a ruling.,278
650,Ms MACKLIN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"I withdraw. The someone in Townsville is a single mother of two children who works full time. Without child care, she would not be able to work, and then the government would call her a bludger. Mr Bob Baldwin-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: you clearly asked the member for Jagajaga to withdraw it unconditionally. We did not hear that on this side.",278
651,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,She did withdraw it unconditionally. There is no point of order.,278
652,Ms MACKLIN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"To work, this woman is totallyMr Brough-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the member for Jagajaga has said that the government has referred to this person as a dole bludger.",278
653,Ms MACKLIN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"No, I didn't. Mr Brough-You did. I would ask her to withdraw that remark and the insinuation that this is the way we look upon people who access the social security system. It is a disgraceful remark and I think she needs to fully withdraw such a comment.",278
654,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,There is no point of order.,278
655,Ms MACKLIN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Her wage is only $550 a week so she qualifies for child-care assistance at the highest level. Funnily enough, I spoke to her after the minister made these false accusations. After the budget, the centre used by this mother advised all parents of the effect on the fees that they would pay as a result of this government's cuts and changes to child care. The most serious cut for this mother is the proposal to cut child-care payments for those who will use more than 50 hours of care per week. Outraged by what she perceived as an unjust and draconian increase by what she interpreted as an attack on those who could least afford and who could least resist the increase, this very gutsy lady embarked on a campaign of protest. She has written to her local paper, her local memberMr Brough-You know a lot about her.",278
656,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,Order! Honourable members on my right should listen in silence.,278
657,Ms MACKLIN,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"She has written to the minister, and took part in demonstrations against the cuts. This mother wrote an outstanding letter to the Townsville Bulletin that says-and I quote in part: Do the hard working women of Australia realise what is about to happen to them? In April 1997, low income wage earners, single parents especially, will have to quit their jobs, pull their kids out of day care and stay at home. Why? Because the budget will raise child-care fees by up to 110 per cent for some families and cut child-care assistance. She goes on to say a little later in the letter: The Minister for Family Services, the honourable? Judi Moylan, suggested parents on low incomes who cannot afford the equitable, affordable, flexible and high quality child care promised to all Australians, should go and find cheaper alternative care. She says: Well, Ms Moylan, when you find out where I can get such care please let me know and I will pass it on to all the other mothers in Australia whose jobs you are about to take away. Of course, it was the minister who wrote to this woman in Townsville, not me. We happen to have a copy of the letter from the minister. It is the minister who talked about 56c, not me. I think the minister needs to come into this chamber and clarify that she is the one who put the decimal point in the wrong place, not me. This letter from the minister also refers to remarks that the Australian Confederation of Child Care made. They are saying to the government that families' child-care fees are going to go up as a result of the government's cuts. Of course, the Australian Confederation of Child Care is in no way associated or affiliated with the Labor Party. It has a much stronger small business representation and, of course, is very distressed by the hypocrisy and shallowness of this government in dealing with small businesses in this country. What we have seen is the minister not just bringing false allegations into this parliament but also misleading the public about what is going to happen to their child-care fees. The information she is using to say that their fees are only going to increase by 56c is, of course, false. She became carried away yesterday, trying to mislead the parliament, implying that the Labor Party and I were directly involved in the Townsville protest, which is clearly untrue. With regard to saying that it was not me that she was referring to, she said, 'The member put the decimal point in the wrong place.' If she was not referring to me, she should come in here and say it was someone else. Maybe it was the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay); maybe she was talking about herself. But I think the evidence speaks for itself. Her action is compounded by false advertising saying that Australian families will be better off as a result of the family tax initiative. Let us take this Townsville mother as an example. In fact, what is going to happen to this Townsville mother as a result of your child-care cuts is that this mother is going to be $30 per fortnight worse off. She is not going to be $34 better off. (Time expired) Kate Cocks Child Care Centre Adelaide Airport Runway",278
658,Dr SOUTHCOTT,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Boothby) (1.19 a.m.)After hearing that tirade, I am very proud to be able to announce today that I have secured $250,000 for the Kate Cocks Child Care Centre in my electorate. It is a community based child-care centre. They wanted $250,000 to purchase the building and the land on which they were sited. I am very proud that I have been able to notify the Kate Cocks Child Care Centre today that they have won $250,000 from the Minister for Family Services, Judi Moylan. Even more important for South Australia in the 1996 budget was the announcement that $28 million will be devoted to the extension of the runway at Adelaide airport and also over $100 million will be devoted to the upgrade of the Mount Barker Road and the South Eastern Freeway, which is one of the northern boundaries of my electorate of Boothby. The extension of the Adelaide airport runway will allow fully laden jumbos to take off from Adelaide. The main runway will now be able to take aircraft right up to the B747, and that will provide Adelaide and South Australia with strong support for its regional tourism and export industries and will also allow South Australia to get its share of tourism and access to a greater range of high value commodity exports. The extension of the runway at Adelaide airport will be a positive thing for South Australia. So you can imagine my surprise when I saw the pamphlet from the ALP candidate for the state seat of Peake, Mr Tom Koutsantonis, which essentially talks about and criticises the Liberal government's decision to extend the runway at Adelaide airport. It is old-style Labor knocking. For those members who do not know-and I notice the absence of the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), who are the last vestiges of South Australian ALP in this House-the state electorate of Peake includes inner metropolitan suburbs such as Cowandill a, Torrensville, Thebarton, Lockleys and Brooklyn Park. But the ALP candidate for this seat must be lost, because he talks about the Tapleys Hill Road. Tapleys Hill Road actually goes through the blue-ribbon safe coastal state of Morphett. So I am wondering whether this candidate knows where the electorate is that he wants to represent. Also in the pamphlet, more critically-and this might indicate why he is lost-there is a photo of Tom Koutsantonis talking to local residents about the extension of the runway at Adelaide airport. It is a very interesting photo because in the photo there is a gentleman by the name of Justin Jarvis, there is someone called Leesa Chesser and there is also the daughter of Barry Piltz, a former ALP candidate for Grey. The Australian Electoral Commission's latest rolls show Justin Jarvis as living in Glenelg North, in the blue-ribbon seaside electorate of Morphett. Leesa Chesser lives in West Lakes, an affluent area near Football Park. But, more critically, when you look at the Parliament House communications directory, you find that the Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate, Senator Dominic Foreman, has as an electorate officer Mr Justin Jarvis and as an electorate officer Miss Leesa Chesser. So the Labor candidate for a state seat has put out a pamphlet that is a sham. Rather than speaking with local residents of the electorate of Peake, he is talking with Labor apparatchiks-not just Labor apparatchiks, but staff, Labor Party hacks, who are working for a Labor Party senator. It is a sham; it is a disgrace.",279
659,Unknown,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,Government members interjecting,280
660,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,Mr Truss)Order! There is too much noise from the government benches.,280
661,Dr SOUTHCOTT,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"This gentleman, Tom Koutsantonis, is a young man in politics. He is 24 or 25. I think it is a positive thing to have young people in politics. Of course, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), entered the state parliament of New South Wales at the age of 22. The member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) also entered politics at a young age. Of course, there is a corollary. While some very positive people have entered politics at a youthful age, from my own state of South Australia, probably one of the most famous and also the youngest person ever to enter the federal parliament was the former member for seat Adelaide, Andrew Jones, who only served one term in this parliament.",280
662,Mr MELHAM,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,A one-termer-that is what he was.,280
663,Dr SOUTHCOTT,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Do you know what? The ALP candidate for the state seat of Peake is going to be another Andrew Jones. Paul Keating once said that to get into federal parliament by the age of 25 you have to get up pretty early in the morning. You have a gentleman here in South Australia who is so foolish-I am all for young people getting into politics-that he is purporting to be consulting with local residents. He is consulting with the staff of Senator Dominic Foreman. It is a joke. He cannot find in a whole state electorate any legitimate, real people to actually consult. What is more interesting is that recently he has put out a newsletter and he said in that newsletter, 'Tell us what you think. You could win a Christmas shopping spree.' He has put out a survey to the whole electorate. Down the bottom it states, 'PS-pick up a pen now and tell us what you think. You could win a Myer voucher worth $450.' The State Electoral Act clearly defines a bribe as being an inducement which can be for the purpose of influencing an election and this is contrary to the State Electoral Act.

Trish Draper is in the wrong spot as well, interjecting on her own side. She does not sit there.",281
666,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,There is no point of order. It is only out of order if the members interject from the wrong seat. That was not brought to the attention of the chair.

667,Dr SOUTHCOTT,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"As members would be aware, the first play to be performed in Australia was The returning officer, which was performed in Sydney in June 1789. At the introduction of that play there was a convict-we do not know his or her namewho penned the introduction. The play was English but the introduction was very Australian. That introduction said: True patriots all. for be it understood. country for our country's good. Two hundred years later, in South Australia, Jennifer Cashmore and John Olsen on 14 April 1989 first raised in the state parliament questions about the make-up of the loans balance sheet of the old State Bank of South Australia. On that day Mike Rann, the current Labor leader, got up and said that it was unpatriotic to question the State Bank of South Australia, that it was unpatriotic to raise any questions about the make-up of loans in South Australia. I think someone once said that patriotism can be the refuge of scoundrels and patriotism can be expressed in different ways. What you need to understand is that Mike Rann was a man who left the New Zealand of Piggy Muldoon to come to the utopian paradise of Don Dunstan's South Australia. So as a young kiwi university student he was attracted to that mirage in the desert, the utopian paradise of Don Dunstan. All I can say is that he should take that advice of that unknown convict to leave South Australia for the good of South Australian politics. (Time expired) Minister for Family Services",281

Mr Leo MCLeay-They cannot tell lies.,282
676,Mr LEE,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"They cannot tell lies, as the honourable member for Watson interjects. They have to make sure they check, double check and triple check because if they mislead this House one thing happens: they get sacked. A Prime Minister who is determined to be a leader of the country, who is worth his salt, would sack a minister who deliberately misled the House on issues like that.",282
677,Dr NELSON,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the member for Dobell is going to suggest that the minister has misled the House, he should do so in a substantive motion.",282
678,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,The point of order is valid but the honourable member has not yet done that. He is speaking in general terms.,282
679,Mr LEE,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"The point I am making is that a Prime Minister worth his salt would sack a minister who deliberately misled the House. What we are saying is that there are questions that this minister has to answer tonight. In question time on 12 December the minister tried to create the impression that the member for Jagajaga had written to this woman. The Minister for Family Services said: I am not sure whether this is a deliberate attempt to mislead the Australian public or, wait for it, whether the member has put the decimal point in the wrong place. The figures that the member touting around this country can be demonstrated be totally inaccurate. Which member was being referred to by the minister? It was the member for Jagajaga. In fact, the member for Jagajaga never wrote to the woman concerned. As far as we know, only one member of this parliament has written to the woman, and that is the Minister for Family Services. If anyone has got the decimal point in the wrong place, it is the Minister for Family Services. We have a sneaking suspicion that perhaps another member of this chamber has been involved in this case, and he is in the chamber tonight. Perhaps there will be an opportunity for the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) to explain to us his role in thiswhether he sent any letters, whether he made any phone calls or whether he obtained any information he should not have access to. This is the chance for the honourable member for Herbert to get up and explain to us the role he has played in the misleading of the House by the Minister for Family Services. Perhaps both of them can explain to the House what they have done. Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.",282
680,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Yes, the honourable member should not make accusations that the minister has misled the House other than by a substantive motion.",283
681,Mr LEE,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"I did not say that they deliberately misled the House. I said that they misled the House. Mr Dondas- Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: understanding order 76 the honourable member for Dobell certainly was improper.",283
682,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"The standing orders do not permit a reference to deliberately misleading the House, but previous speakers have ruled that a reference in relation to misleading is not out of order. So long as the honourable member for Dobell is careful with his language, I will not rule him out of order.",283
683,Mr LEE,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"I thank you for your wise ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. The point I make is that the Prime Minister says that truth is absolute, keeps truth is supreme, truth is never disposable. to What we are saying is that this minister has questions she has to answer tonight. If the Prime Minister's standards are not good enough, what about those of the senior minister to the Minister for Family Services? This is what the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) says about these things. In November 1995, the minister stated: Credibility means that when you stand up here at the dispatch box you have to be taken at your word. One has to be prepared to believe that a minister of the crown is telling the truth. We want to know: was that minister of the crown, the Minister for Family Services, telling the truth? Tonight is her chance to come in here and see whether she meets the standards set by the Prime Minister in his code of ministerial responsibility when he says that ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the parliament. The point we make is that if this minister has sought to deliberately mislead the House then she has an obligation to answer. The allegation we are making is that we think she has deliberately misled the House. We think this is the opportunity she has",283
684,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,Order! The honourable member shall withdraw that allegation. The honourable member for Dobell will withdraw the allegation that the minister deliberately misled the House.,283
685,Mr LEE,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,I am happy to move a substantive motion.,283
686,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,You cannot move a substantive motion because there is already a question before the House.,283
687,Mr LEE,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,I withdraw the allegation unconditionally. I seek leave from the minister at the table to move a substantive motion.,283
688,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,Order! There is a question before the House. Leave is not granted.,283
689,Mr LEE,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"They say they are willing to debate a substantive motion, but they always deny us the right to have this minister come into the chamber and answer. Mr Hardgrave- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I seek guidance from you in relation to this point of order. Mr Lee-What is your point of order?",283
690,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,Quickly come to your point of order. Mr Hardgrave-It seems to me that on several occasions now you have asked the honourable member for Dobell to withdraw this matter. He keeps flaunting your ruling on that matter. I think there needs to be some stronger measure taken against him.,284

696,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,I do not require any further assistance in relation to the point of order. The point of order is out of order. The honourable member for Dobell had not infringed. His time has now expired. Australian Candidate Survey,284
697,Mr ENTSCH,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"I rise tonight in response to comments made earlier in this place by members from the other side that figures published in the Australian candidate survey 1996 reflect members on this side of the House in a negative light. I advise members on the other side that I also participated in that survey. I was quite amazed when I heard some of the results members opposite were reflecting on, because on my reading of this document I certainly get a totally different point of view. Comments by honourable members on the other side prompted me to review some of the statistics. The figures clearly show what a poor quality of representation voters could expect from those on the other side of the House. Of course, we are all quoting from the same book. I look first at the issue of preselection business associations. The question is asked as to what sorts of business associations candidates had. It is interesting to note that on our side 36.3 per cent of candidates had a very active business association, as opposed to 14 per cent on the other side. Given that government is one of the biggest businesses in the country, I find it amazing that there is so little ability with regards to business on that side of the House. Another interesting statistic I found in the survey was in relation to commitment to organisations. The question is asked as to what sort of involvement respective candidates had with various community organisations. With regard to religious organisations, 23.2 per cent of our side were not active in religious organisations as opposed to 58.5 per cent of the other side. I thought that was rather interesting. Also, 78.4 per cent of the candidates on the other side were not at all active in other community organisations, such as hospital boards. In relation to school PTAs, 29.2 per cent of our side were not actively involved while 42.9 per cent of the other side were not involved. With regard to sporting clubs and organisations, 11.5 per cent of our side were not actively involved as opposed to 25.7 per cent from the other side. That shows once again who has the commitment with regard to community organisations. I found the issue of commitment to our constituents rather interesting. In relation to time devoted to party activities per month, it was interesting to see that 19.8 per cent of our side were actively involved for more than 20 hours. This compares with 24.8 per cent of the other side. When you look at the time spent dealing with constituents, you see that 59.1 per cent of our side spent more than 20 hours dealing with constituents as opposed to 51.2 per cent on the other side. Obviously, we are prepared to spend a lot more time on a point of order: what the hell has this got to do with the Child Care Legislation Amendout ment Bill?",284
698,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Order! There is no point of order. Mr Lee- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the honourable member for Sydney was clearly dazzled by the tie and that plains his point of order.",285
699,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,Order! There the is no point of order.,285
700,Mr ENTSCH,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Obviously the honourable member must have been sleeping at this late hour. It starts to get really interesting because there was an interesting question with regard to encouragement from trade night, unions. I found it quite amazing question was asked as to what sort of encouragement was given by trade unions or staff associations. It is interesting that on our side of the House 7.1 per cent of our candidates had very positive encouragement as opposed to 33 per cent on the other side of the House. There was another question further on with regard to whether there should be stricter laws to regulate the activities of trade unions: per cent of our side of the House agreed or strongly agreed that there should be stricter laws as opposed to 0.9 per cent on side. We had a debate here earlier with regard to pecuniary interests. I would suggest very strongly that it is rather hypocritical side of the House to start dealing with matters associated with the union movement when they have such a close tie and obviously were encouraged. In fact, there was another queseffectively tion on trade unions which asked if the trade unions had too much power. On our side of the House 89 per cent said yes, strongly agreed or agreed as opposed to 0.9 per cent on the other side of the House. They are very interesting statistics, I must say. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I really think the member ought to name them. Who are these traitors the cause?",285
701,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,There is no per point of order.,285
702,Mr ENTSCH,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"It might be Baldwin, from what we have seen tonight! Obviously they are trying to gag me. We are quickly running of time here. This is quite serious stuff. Almost every page tells a story, but we are out of time, so I will save some of it for later on. It is really worth reading. We talk aboutMr Leo MCLeay-On a point of order, Mr exDeputy Speaker: the truth is that Dr Brendan Nelson should own up. He was a member of Labor Party, and he is in favour of trade unions, and we know it. Mr Ronaldson- Mr Deputy Speaker, that was quite clearly a frivolous point of order. I now know the honourable member is tired and here wants to get home, and it has been a long but I think the frivolous points of order because the should finish.",285
703,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"There is no point of order. I ask members to reflect on the time and reflect on the conduct of the House. This House is being broadcast to the rest of Australia. I ask the member for Leichhardt to resume his seat. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on 78.3 a point of order: your words have moved me, I must say. Any reflection that I made on Dr Brendan Nelson for being a trade unionist and the other member of the Labor Party",285
704,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,There is no point of order. The honourable member will of that resume his seat.,285
705,Mr ENTSCH,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"I will have to come back to this at another time. I have been almost gagged by that side but, nevertheless, I make just one final point here. It is interesting that the other side of the House continually claims to represent blue-collar workers and working people, but when you have a look at some of these statistics here it is interesting to note the answer to questions such as 'How many years of tertiary study have you completed since you left secondary to school?' You would expect that the battlers and the workers would come from that side of the fence, but it is interesting that only 12 cent of their candidates had absolutely no tertiary education as opposed to 22.9 per cent on our side of the House. In answer to another question about the age that you left school-'How old were you when you left school?' -17.9 per cent of them here left at(Time expired) Minister for Family Services",285
706,Mr ALBANESE,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Grayndler) (1.51 a.m.)The question we have got to ask tonight is: where is the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan)? Yesterday we saw her raise very serious allegations against the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and today what we have seen is silence; the cone of silence has come down. She gradually sat farther back as each division occurred today. First she sat up there in the first row, then it was the second row, then it was the third row. She ended up at the back and now she is not here; she is not even in the building because she simply will not defend her own actions. She has conceded defeat on this. She made serious allegations about suggestions that were supposed to be contained in a letter and we asked for that letter to be tabled, but of course the minister refused leave. She said it was confidential. It must have been a fabrication because we still have not seen it, in spite of the fact that now three speakers from this side have raised the minister's actions here. We still see the cone of silence there, the Marcel Marceau impersonation by the Minister for Family Services. Her big mistake, of course, was to support the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). Fancy relying upon the member for Herbert for anything, because we all know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is a man who believes and said: . .. the relatively high proportion of wealthy students in universities was a reflection of their higher intelligence rather than better opportunities. That is his position with regard to equality, and now we have him getting involved in the child-care issue. Let us have a look at what he had to say about child care. There was a demonstration, an occupation of his own office. I read from the Townsville Bulletin: More than 30 angry parents and industry workers crowded Mr Lindsay's office yesterday to hand him petitions carrying 1,110 signatures of concerned members of the community. Donning a black ribbon himself, Mr Lindsay told the crowd the government was taking notice of their concerns and assured them he would deliver the petition to the family services minister in parliament next week. The member for Herbert, member of the government, wearing a black armband. That is his view of the Minister for Family Services's handling of the child-care issue. But he didn't kid the local child-care community. I wonder what their response was. The Andy Pandy Centre-and how appropriate-owner, Brian Couchman, said about the member for Herbert, 'Wearing the black ribbon is just hypocritical of Peter Lindsay because he doesn't support our case one bit. He doesn't think it's a black day for child care; he thinks it's a good day for the government to save money.' In spite of the member for Herbert condemning and distancing himself by wearing a black armband atdemonstrations against his own government, the minister took notice of him. We have the issue of Tracey, which has been raised by the shadow minister. Tracey is someone who, because of the government budget, is going to be $38 per week worse off. Tracey is a single mother in the member for Herbert's electorate. She did the right thing. She contacted her local member and she met with Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert. The member for Herbert said that he would take her issues up with the minister. Of course, the minister wrote back and we have here a letter from the minister to Tracey, the constituent concerned, saying that she would only be 56c worse off. But, of course, we know that is not true because the member for Herbert played a really interesting role. The particular person, Tracey, works 38 hours a week, paid, but like lots of people who are keen to keep their job-and particularly so that she can pay to look after her young child-often works many more hours than that. However, because of the changes that the government brought forward, she can of course claim child care only for 50 hours a week rather than 60. So the member for Herbert suggested to the employer that he sign a document saying that she worked longer than 38 hours a week. Mr Lee-Who did that?",286
707,Mr ALBANESE,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"The member for Herbert did that. In fact, last Friday, the member for Herbert had a meeting with Tracey, his constituent, and Tracey informed him, 'The employer is not going to sign a fraudulent document, he's not going to be involved in that.' And he did not want a bar of the suggestion of the member for Herbert. So what occurred then, of course is that Tracey has simply missed out, and we have seen the minister come into this House, attack her, attack the shadow minister and suggest that somehow the shadow minister is responsible for this. What we are talking about here is a single mother in the member for Herbert's electorate who wants to work. She does not want to rely upon welfare. She says in the letter to the Townsville Bulletin: The government wants mothers at home with their children surviving on welfare, for we will not be classed as unemployed and they will give our jobs to the real unemployed, lower the unemployment figures and declare themselves heroes. This is a very, very sad day. Here we have serious allegations being put before this House about the Minister for Family Services and still we see the Minister for Family Services refusing to come in here. Of course, she has been pretty hopeless all year, and what we have seen is that for the first time this incompetent minister has got the smart look across her face and said, 'Wait for it, here comes a big hit against the shadow minister to show I am not a total dope, to show I can get one thing right all year.' Then she moved away and since then has not opened her mouth. I would be interested in whether the member for Herbert will be following in this debate. I am sure every member on that side will stay seated so that the member for Herbert can defend himself and his actions of trying to politically use a single mother in that electorate who has been worse off to the tune of $38 per week as a result of this reactionary government's changes to child-care assistance. We have seen a lot of noise tonight, of course, from the other side, because they do not want to hear this. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) put a question before this House, because it is being broadcast, so I have got another question for you. Who said this? And they have shut up for this: It is an infallible guide in this parliament that weaker the argument, the higher the decibel level. Who said that? Mr Martin-Peter Costello.",286
708,Mr ALBANESE,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"The member for Cunningham wins the prize. Peter Costello said that in this House on 10 October 1996. There is no real alternative but for the minister to come into this House and defend herself. First she started on the front bench, then she moved to the first row, then the second row, then the back row, now she is out the door. The cone of silence is still there, but the minister will not answer these questions. Perhaps because she has chosen to align herself with the member for Herbert, the person who believes that intelligence is this Darwinian thing that you get on the basis of your income, it really is up to the member for Herbert tonight, who will have 10 minutes to defend himself, to defend the Minister for Family Services and to defend the government's actions. But they have gone pretty quiet-have you noticed?-on that side. There were lots of points of order before, with lots of people standing up, but the fact is that, when it is put before you, you have ducked. This parliament is only going to sit for another hour or so and it really is incumbent upon the Minister for Family Services to come into this House and defend herself and her record, because she has not scored a hit all year. This is the best own goal since Andres Escobar, but we have banned guns now so that result will not happen. But the result that should happen is that she should go back onto the back bench. Pea and Grain Exporters",287
709,Mr ANDREW,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"Wakefield) (2.01 a.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, I wonder if I may have just three or four minutes of the House's time to deal with something that is not hypothetical but actually quite substantial, for a change. I represent a company in my electorate known as Pea and Grain Exporters. Pea and Grain Exporters have a factory based at Two Wells and they are not exporters in the simple agency terms; they are in fact processors directly involved in the value adding of a number of grain crops, principally pulses, the oil seeds and, for the purpose of the debate tonight, pearl barley. Pea and Grain Exporters---clearly as the name implies-are exporters of this value added product. Pea and Grain Exporters have been endeavouring to get their grain products, particularly their pearl barley, into the European market and, in this instance, particularly into the Danish market.. They came to me with what was a rather extraordinary problem that you would not expect a modem, efficient company to run into in Australia in 1996. Pea and Grain Exporters have developed a new line of pearl barley and were in fact successfully marketing this in Denmark and found that the Danes were, in Pea and Grain Exporters' terms, 'raising their farm subsidy to squeeze Pea and Grain Exporters out of the Danish market'. Two of their buyers came to them and comrlained that in fact they had product coming to them from Danish producers that was undercutting the price that Pea and Grain Exporters could make this product available for in Denmark. So not unreasonably, they requested their two agents in Denmark to send them a sample of the competitor's product so that they could evaluate it and determine whether they could match it both in quality terms and in price terms. And that was when they ran into some difficulty. The sample of pearl barley coming from Denmark to Australia left Denmark on 18 November and did not arrive in Australia until the 21st. That was marginally excusable, because the company responsible for transporting it, Sanford Couriers, ran into some difficulty with their computers and confessed that they had temporarily lost the consignment. Nonetheless, it arrived in Melbourne by 21 November and on 21 November it was delivered to AQIS. It was, of course, AQIS that had the responsibility of clearing this sample so that it could be determined as providing no threat to the Australian grain industry and could then be evaluated by Pea and Grain Exporters. This is when the difficulty arose because it took AQIS from Thursday, 21 November until Thursday, 28 November to make this product available to my company, Pea and Grain Exporters. In fact, Pea and Grain Exporters were somewhat irritated because· here they were on the Thursday wanting to evaluate this product so that they could determine whether or not they could offer a competitive price. On the Friday, while the product was with AQIS, it still was not available, nor had it been, as far as they were concerned, released as a safe product so that Pea and Grain Exporters could evaluate it. They were prepared to be generous enough to say that they could not expect it on the Saturday or the Sunday, but it still did not arrive on the Monday. Then on the Tuesday, 25 November, the two Danish purchasers who had to make a choice between the product that was available to them in Denmark and being evaluated in Melbourne and the product that my company said would be provided said, 'We can wait no longer and we are going to buy the local, that is, the European, product, losing the opportunity for Australian processors to supply the company? Have you a conflict of interest?",287
710,Mr ANDREW,NORTHERN LAND COUNCIL,"I will come to that in just a moment. The member for Shortland is so anxious to confound the debate; if he will just be patient, I will run him through the entire process. In fact, by the Tuesday, they had lost the market to the two other competitors. On the Wednesday the product they had wanted out of AQIS still was not available and on the Thursday, too late for my processors to do anything about it, this competitor's product was made available to them to evaluate. My protest is with AQIS for taking over a week to evaluate this pearl barley product and make it available to the company I represent so that they could effectively determine whether or not they could compete with this European product. I commend the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) because, recognising that all is not well with AQIS and has not been well with AQIS for some timeincluding a good deal of time during which the present opposition were in governmenthe commissioned an inquiry into AQIS called the Nairn report which was released on Tuesday morning of this week. The Nairn report has given the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy an opportunity to evaluate the performance of AQIS. I would do the government a disserviceindeed, I would do the parliament of Australia a disservice-if I were to imply that all was wrong with AQIS. Of course, it is clearly important that AQIS be recognised as the body that monitors both our exports and our imports. It is important that Australia's capacity to have a clean and green image is maintained by a watchdog called AQIS. But it is not good enough for AQIS to be in receipt of a product that needs rapid evaluation, take a week to evaluate it and in the process deny markets, not only to the company I represent, Pea and Grain Exporters, but to all the farmers who choose to supply that company. This leads to the whole question of the in which we trade with Europe. The question of trade with Europe is very much determined by the arrangements that we have under GATT and the World Trade Organisation to produce a fairer trading environment than we have had in the past. Much of our trading environment is in the hands not only of those who set protection, not only of those who set tariff walls, not only of those who determine what the subsidies will be for European farmers, but also of AQIS, who determines what the standard of our imports will be. We need to recognise the important role that AQIS plays in maintaining Australia's clean and green image. There has been debate, frequently generated by the opposition, suggesting that the government should take action to prevent, if you please, the import of, for example, cooked chicken meat, New Zealand apples or even salmon. What the opposition needs to understand is that in trading terms the government does not have the opportunity to prevent the import of anyone of those products. They must know that; they were the government only nine months ago. What the government has to do is carefully evaluate all of the product that is made available and determine whether or not it is safe to bring it into Australia. That is the obligation we have under the WTO; that is the obligation we inherited when the old GATT became the WTO. Frankly, the obligation that the government faces is the obligation of ensuring that our trade is not frustrated by artificial tariff walls or levels of protection; most of all, that we do not create quarantine barriers to trade but that we recognise that real scientific reasons, anything that puts the clean and green image of Australia at risk, are good and valid reasons to prevent trade. But if we simply think we can say no to trading arrangements, we will defy the arrangements and the obligations we already have under both the WTO and GATT. We cannot simply say no to trade. We need to evaluate whether or not the product coming into Australia puts Australian producers at risk. That is the obligation which the minister for primary industry has recognised. The way former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy recognised precisely the same obligation. The evaluation that is going on right now on cooked chicken meat and on apples and pears is not going on because the government wants to trade with those countries but because we cannot prevent that trade unless there are scientific reasons for doing so. Finally, can I say this: it is the fact that we are a signatory under the WTO that has allowed us to have access to other countries. Primary producers in Australia have enjoyed better access to Europe, as shown by my Pea and Grain Exporters illustration, and better exposure to Asia as a result of these protocols.

Motion (by Mr Ruddock) proposed: That the amendments be agreed to.  a.m.)-A very extensive set of amendments were moved in the Senate and agreed to by the Senate. The amendments are fairly complex. I guess the general thrust of them is to ameliorate, in a variety of respects, the impact of the measures that the government was seeking to take. As such, obviously, we are not going to be opposing a motion to agree to those amendments. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT (FURTHER BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1996 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",288
711,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill contains several important measures announced in the 1996 budget for the social security portfolio. In most cases, single people who share accommodation face lower costs through economies of scale, compared with the costs of Ii ving alone. The government has decided to set a new maximum rate of rent assistance for single people who share accommodation from 1 July 1997. The new maximum rate for single sharers will be two-thirds of the maximum rate for singles living independently. However, a number of groups will be exempt from the new rate. These groups comprise the following: recipients of disability support pension or carer pension; single people with dependent children; boarders and lodgers; nursing home residents; and people who live alone in caravans, mobile homes or vessels. In certain situations, people who live only with their non-dependent children will also be excluded. The second measure contained in the bill deals with the treatment of assets held in superannuation and rollover funds. Before March 1993, compulsorily preserved superannuation and rollover assets were exempt from the social security income and assets test until age pension age. From March 1993, all superannuation benefits held in superannuation or rollover funds have been exempt from these tests until age pension age. This initiative involved estimated additional outlays of $4.1 million in 1992-93, increasing to $17.1 million in 1995-96. Given that superannuation savings are generally not subject to compulsory preservation after a person reaches the age of 55 and retires, people in these circumstances, including people who may not wish to retire but who have poor prospects of returning to work, can access their superannuation savings if they choose to do so. Consistent with the treatment of other savings, the government considers a person's superannuation savings should be taken into account in working out how much income support can be paid. Accordingly, from 20 September 1997, the assets test exemption of assets held in superannuation and rollover funds by social security pensioners and allowees under age pension age will be removed for people aged between 55 and age pension age after 39 weeks on income support since turning 55. For income test purposes, affected customers' superannuation and rollover assets will be added to their other financial assets and assessed under the extended deeming rules. The anticipated savings from this measure are much greater than the estimated costs of the 1993 initiative. One reason why the latter estimated costs are significantly smaller is they reflected only the additional costs of exempting non-compulsorily preserved superannuation and rollover assets from social security assets and income tests until age pension age. However, a significant reason for the difference is the extent to which customers who are effectively retired, invested in superannuation and rollover funds as a means of avoiding the operation of the assets and income tests. Neither the assets nor income test treatment of annuities and pensions, including allocated annuities and pensions, will change. These products will continue to be assessed under existing rules. This situation is, however, presently under review. The government is committed to ensuring that social security customers receive their rightful entitlement. At the same time, the government considers that the Australian taxpayer has a right to expect that the government will do all it can to minimise scope for overpayments. Overpayments often arise during holiday periods such as Easter when social security allowance payments are programmed in advance to be paid automatically on predetermined days that are earlier than usual if the customer's normal payday falls on a holiday. This can result in overpayments for the holiday period, some of which are not recoverable. To that end, the third measure contained in the bill provides for a modified application form of certain social security and youth training allowances to be submitted before payment. The modified form will require a declaration of any changes anticipated for the remainder of the payment period. If any overpayments arise for the payment period, they will be recoverable. I commend the biII to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Leave granted for second reading debate to proceed forthwith.  a.m.)-Given the extreme lateness of the hour, I intend to be extremely succinct. This legislation originated in the Senate and was extensively debated there. We take strong exception to two of the measures. One is the that measure about rent assistance to sharers. We believe that the fundamental rationale for that is flawed. If you look at the structure of rent assistance and the way it is determined, you will see there is a minimum amount of rent that has to be paid-a threshold-before you can receive any assistance. Above that threshold, three-quarters of what you pay by way of rent is then paid to you in the form of rent assistance, subject to a ceiling. Given that and the way the mechanism works, we believe that people who are sharing accommodation, if they want to achieve economies, will be obviously paying less rent each. So, under the way the system works, they will receive less rental assistance. In order to get the higher rates of assistance, you actually have to be paying an amount of rent in excess of that. We think this is a pretty onerous measure that is going to have a significantly adverse effect on some of the most disadvantaged people in our society. There is a range of people who, for a variety of reasons, find it necessary to share accommodation in inner city areas and who, in order to gain access to work opportunities, have to live in high rent areas; and share accommodation might be the only option available. I gather that there are some 80,000 people who are going to be quite adversely affected by this measure, and we strongly oppose it. The other measure we are opposing is the removal of the exemption from the social security means test of superannuation and rollover benefits. Again, this measure is going to slug some of the most disadvantaged in our society, particularly the older unemployed people over the age of 55. In some cases, they are going to find themselves in the situation of having to access their superannuation assets in order to have a decent amount to live on. We think that compromises fundamentally-in a significant way-the objective the former government had of promoting the expansion of superannuation. If superannuation is going to be expanded and consolidated in the way that we intended, people have to have a sense of security about the provisions that will relate to it. Obviously this is utterly detrimental to that. We also note that if people are to be expected to access their superannuation benefits, there are certain conditions and requirements associated with that. In particular, I understand the superannuation industry regulations would require somebody seeking to access their superannuation benefits to more or less indicate an intention to permanently retire from the work force. We do not think that makes a great deal of sense at all. Given the ageing of the population, we want to be fostering and encouraging older people who become unemployed to seek to re-enter the work force and to gain employment, so we think this is quite counterproductive. We also think it is an example of a measure which is supposed to be contributing to national savings by a reduction in budget outlays during the forward estimates. But if you take a somewhat longer view of it, obviously to the extent that people's superannuation benefits are eroded, their capacity to provide for themselves once they do reach pensionable age is diminished and, as a consequence of that, pension outlays are going to be higher than they otherwise would have been. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation have looked at this measure in some detail. They make a number of points, including the ones I have just made, but they also point out that there has been very little in the way of modelling done to see what the longer term impact of this measure is going to be on national savings. For a variety of reasons, we see these measures as highly retrograde, highly obnoxious and inequitable. We are opposed to them. When we get to the consideration in detail stage I will be moving an amendment more or less along the lines of the recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which seeks to limit the application of this measure to sums in excess of $250,000 and to make it completely prospective-that is to say, it would apply only to superannuation moneys invested after the date of the budget announcement. We are moving that amendment to schedule 1 and we will also be opposing schedule 2, which gives effect to the rent assistance measure. That, in essence, is what we will be doing and, as I said, given the lateness of the hour, I do not intend to say any more than that.",292
712,Mr HARDGRAVE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 to place a number of matters on the record and to reacquaint the House with some of the measures contained within it. It is very fair to say from the outset-particularly after the contribution from the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin)-no-one on this side of the House ever wants to see any Australian, particularly those who are less well off, denied access to assistance, any Australian denied access to equality of opportunity or any Australian denied the chance to get on and do better for themselves. But it is also very important to note, in the context of this bill especially, the previous government, through 13 years of their quite bizarre approach to welfare, created not a safety net but rather a hammock for so many Australians. The laws we are considering in these matters before us this morning are one which cost us more and more money as a country each year. This government is placed in a position where it has to look at measures to try to peel back some of the growing cost on a yearly basis. I want to get to the heart of the way the previous government created so many complex laws in an area like social security. I submit one of the great differences between the Liberal and National parties and the Australian Labor Party is, while this side of the House believes most people will do the right thing and will frame laws and regulations to punish those who do the wrong thing, those on the other side have a philosophical bent which says essentially most people will always do the wrong thing so let us punish everyone just in case. As a result, Labor come up with complex laws, red tape, paperwork and all sorts of things which frighten average Australians when they confront them. One of the real issues which brought about the end of the previous government on 2 March was exactly to do with this. Particularly older Australians found red tape and paperwork changing on an almost monthly basis, and those sorts of changes frighten people. It is quite fair for older Australians to want a sense of certainty. They want a sense of understanding what they did last year is what they are going to do this year. Yet, through 13 years of changes, we found more and more older Australians getting more and more frightened-and they spoke very loudly on 2 March. There are also families in Australia who have been hurt by this complex red tape and this desire to punish everyone just in case. I remember a few years ago my wage structure was sufficiently small we were able to access government assistance to subsidise my daughter's attendance at child care. On one occasion my wife said to me, 'Can you ring the DSS at Upper Mount Gravatt because a cheque hasn't come through?' I rang them and I was instantly the victim of a thousand plagues because they were not going to speak to me: 'You're only the father. We'll only speak to your wife if she's really still your wife, if you're still together.' Again, you have a situation where I get punished for making a perfectly sensible approach in assisting my wife. My wife gets punished because she has to then find some time, which was of great inconvenience to her that day, to spend, as I did, 25 or 30 minutes on the phone waiting to speak to somebody at the DSS. I think it is very important to put in context any attempts by those opposite to add any of the measures in this bill to their ongoing attempts to scare different groups in the community-scare older Australians about nursing homes, scare parents about child care and scare people about matters contained in this bill. I understand a number of changes have come back from the Senate and the government seems fairly happy about those changes. The minister has moved the amended bill accordingly. On this basis, despite the fact the opposition are going to move further amendments in the consideration in detail stage of this bill, we will be able to get throu?h this bill fairly fast. Given the lateness of the hour, I am sure everyone will agree with this. But I guess it is important to state for the record the number of measures which are contained in this bill. The measures were announced by the government prior to the election some 10 months ago and are in keeping with the government's program announced in the August budget. The bill is all about keeping our promises. It is about keeping faith with all of the people who elected this government-the majority of Australian voters. The majority of Australia has called for changes to tighten up our social security system and reduce the rorts to ensure taxpayers' dollars are used to help the needy rather than the dishonest. They want the dishonest punished, not the average Australians, and they are the sorts of calls Labor ignored for 13 years. As I said, our social security system was never meant to be the hammock it has become. Yet this is how so many people in this country now see it. For the rest of us, it is still a safety net and it continues to be one of the most generous in the world. I do not have any problem in commending any of the steps in this bill. I believe it will take those necessary steps to restore integrity and fairness to our social security system. We are doing the right thing. I am certain most people also feel the same way. We talked about it up-front. We are doing what we said we were going to do and we are doing what is needed. We have to change some things around so the honest majority do not suffer because of the actions of a dishonest few. This is what has been happening ever increasingly in this country over the past decade or so. The result was more paperwork, more red tape and more taxes, more Big Brother intrusions into people's lives. Quite frankly, I do not believe it needs to be like this. I do not think anybody ever really wants it to be like this. So let us do what we have to do. If we need to tighten the unemployment activity test, increase waiting periods for accessing social security benefits, then let us do it. The bottom line is our social security system is paid for by the taxpayer. This bill will get on to those matters. It seems the consensus in this chamber tonight is we should do that now, so I will not embellish this debate any further.",294
713,Mr JENKINS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,In talking to this social security legislation there are just a couple of things that I wish to raise. Mr Ronaldson-Five minutes.,296
714,Mr JENKINS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Don't tempt me. Five minutes can become longer. I will try to keep to five minutes, but if you encourage me it will be longer.",296
715,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,The member for Ballarat should not encourage him.,296
716,Mr JENKINS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"One of the things I wish to raise is a very important matter within the social security portfolio. It arises from some reported comments of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) earlier this week. The Adelaide Advertiser said: The social security minister, Senator Newman, night told people who lost benefits under the government's $1.7 billion cuts to seek help from charities ... The quote went on: ... people who lost their payments would do as they always have and go to the Salvos or St Vincent De Paul. I would like the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), perhaps in the short summing up that he might have in this debate, to indicate whether the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was aware of the statements? The Salvation Army has said that it would be unable to provide adequate support if it received a deluge of former welfare recipients. In consideration of the measures that the government has before the House, I would be asking the minister whether he could assure us that there was consultation with welfare agencies, including the Salvation Army, before the government decided to send thousands of Australians to those agencies. Of course one would have to ask: if there was not, why not? What we need is confirmation tonight of the direction the social security minister gave, which is pretty clear. It says that those who are going to go off benefit should go to relief agencies. But if you look at the explanatory memorandum which goes to the extent of the savings that these measures put through, if you look at schedule I, which is the amendments to remove the means test exemption for superannuation assets in certain cases, you see that the first full year effect is in 1997-98-a $92 million saving. So we are talking about a considerable amount. The thing that concerns me about these measures is that it is really soft targets that we always home in on. If I get the opportunity later tonight and there is a further adjournment, one issue that I was going to raise was executive salaries. In the context of this social security legislation, an article of the Independent Monthly in June 1996 states: Lowie's weekly salary is more than double the average annual income. That is Frank Lowie, who is Managing Director of Westfield Holdings. My frustralast tion is-these remarks not only go to the present government but go to previous governments; not only the previous Labor government but the Liberal-National Party government before that-that, whilst governments talk about trying to put a cap on executive salaries, we always fail. We have never found a solution. We are not willing to go the full road to put in place legislation that might tackle that. One piece of legislation I would suggest is the American model. They have capped the level of executive salaries that can be counted for taxation purposes as a cost of production. Not wishing to stretch the friendship any further on relevance on this particular bill, I was just going to indicate that, if I get a chance on the adjournment later this morning, this weekend, I will pad out in more detail this proposal. But I take the comments of the shadow minister. For the brevity of this debate, the opposition has grave concerns about the way in which these amendments to the social security legislation are being put before us, especially in the context of the attitude of the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, which seems to be, 'Oh, don't worry. These people that go off benefit will go down to the local charity and in some way that will fix the problem.'",296
717,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Longman) (2.34 a.m.)This Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill brings fairness to all concerned. It does not matter what sorts of assets you have, they are now going to be taken into account as far as your eligibility for social security is concerned. I think that is a very good measure. As far as the people accessing rental allowance or rental benefitMs Macklin-Rent assistance.",297
718,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Thank you very muchrent assistance is concerned, obviously this measure is also taking into account people who are living together and sharing the cost of rent. They will also be able to access additional moneys but not the full amount. The amendments that have been foreshadowed by the opposition spokesman basically remove this piece of legislation for the next 15 to 20 years. They are saying that any money put into superannuation after the budget measure in August will be all that will be taken into account and that it will not matter until $250,000 has actually gone into that account. Therefore, it really is a pointless amendment. It pushes this out for a minimum of 15 years, and perhaps more like 25 years for most people. Therefore, I strongly suggest that we reject that out of hand. The Senate has been very responsible in the amendments that it has made. The amendments will make sure that the integrity of our budget is maintained and that interest rates, which we have already been able to lower, will not have further stress placed upon them.",297
719,Ms MACKLIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga) (2.36 a.m.)There are some serious matters in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill. I draw attention to the implications of the changes for particularly men aged over 55, who really are suffering considerably from what can only be described as a downsizing epidemic that is now sweeping Australia. I will read a letter I received from a constituent of mine, which I think really sums up the problems that are going to face people between 55 and 65 years of age. He says: I wish to address the issue regarding the loss of my mature age pension after September 1997 due to social security changes. They are the ones we are debating. He goes on: Having been made redundant at the age of 61 and desperately trying to secure work since, I think it is intolerable that this government should be able to change the rules mid stream. I did not expect to be penalised. By the time. I am 65 years of age, a large amount of my rollover funds will be used up. I therefore hope you can discuss this outrageous decision by the government in parliament and have the intended new laws rescinded. This is exactly the problem that is going to apply to people in this age group. They will not be helped back into the work force, which is obviously the desire of many of them. There are a couple of other points that I think are very serious, particularly for those who leave the work force to care full time for disabled or frail elderly relatives. At present, these people are entitled to the carer pension until they reach age pension age. As a result of this measure, carers with superannuation are going to be unable to claim the carer pension until they have run down these assets. What I fear is that this is going to be a major disincentive for people to take on caring responsibilities. I think the government is being rather short-sighted in trying to save $173.20 a week, which is the single rate for the carer pension. If a person has to go into a nursing home, the cost to the government associated with that is $714 per week. As far as carers are concerned, it is a very short sighted measure and, I would have to say, I think a very callous and surprising one because this government has, other than this measure, been very supportive of carers. The government also says that half of the individuals that are going to be affected by this measure are going to be those on disability support pensions. We would all know that these people are not wealthy people because their working lives have been affected by disability or illness. As a result of that, their superannuation savings are likely to be relatively modest. If they are going to be forced to deplete these superannuation savings between the ages of 55 and 65, once they get to age pension age they will have to go on the age pension because their superannuation will be used up. This is a very short-term measure. The government is really just trying to find another place to make savings. This measure is not going to add to the bulk of national savings and I think the decision should be reversed. As far as rent assistance is concerned, there really are some very serious implications for those renting and sharing accommodation. These are generally people who are the most disadvantaged in our community. A large proportion of them are young people, many of them between the ages of 15 and 19. The figure is 65 per cent, in fact. I give that figure for those opposite who might like to know how many young people of that age are actually sharing accommodation. These get lower social security benefits than everybody else and they will be very seriously affected by this change. The same applies to a considerable number of elderly people who do not own their own homes and are totally dependent on the age pension. These are very disadvantaged people in our community. They are often sharing with other elderly people in similar circumstances. This is a substantial cut that is going to dramatically affect their standard of living. These are very callous moves. I thought it was important, even at this late hour, to make these remarks.",297
720,Mr MOSSFIELD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The Social Security Legislation (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 is a very important piece of legislation and I am very strongly opposed to the government's measures. I certainly support the comments of the shadow minister for Social Security, Senator Faulkner, and those of the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). I have a 20-minute speech prepared, but I do understand that that would not be very popular here. I just want to make that point to emphasise to people that may be listening that I do really feel that this is a very important piece of legislation. I do not think we should treat it lightly because many people will suffer severely because of what the government intends to introduce. Working people who have planned through their working lives for a secure retirement will feel cheated by this coalition government's decision to force them to access their superannuation payments prior to reaching retirement age. People who started work, say, 40 years ago had an expectation that, barring ill health, they would be able to work through until they had reached retirement age. For many workers, this dream has not come true due, as the member for Jagajaga said, to the culture of industrial downsizing. Many people have been forced out of the work force long before they have been in the financial position to be. Many people in this age group want to continue to work; however, due to employment conditions, illness and disability, they are unable to do so. Rather than preserving their superannuation entitlements until they have reached 65 years of age, they will be - equired to draw on this money to replace lost Income. This applies to workers who are 55 years of age or over. Fifty-five seems to be the age that a lot of employers think it is a good idea to ease older workers out of the work force. However, many people in this particular age group still have financial commitments, children at school, mortgages and various other forms of debt arising from supporting a family. In view of the time, I will refer very briefly to a letter from a constituent of mine that I believe really highlights the concern that a lot of working people who have been forced out of the work force have about this piece of legislation. Mr Steve Adamantidis, who lives at Kings Langley, says: In my case when I accepted redundancy from a job that I held for 25 years, it was on the basis that I would be retiring on my super at 65, by which time it would have been within the reasonable benefits limits and I would have found a job until then. As it happened I am now unable to work due to multiple ailments and I find the super I saved for my mid sixties will be non-existent by then because I need to spend it to live now and judging from the past, most of it will be on medical expenses. My constituent goes on: There is a need to preserve some dignity in our old age and it seems that this government is adding insult to our injury. When honest John Howard said he would fix the unemployment situation without being unfair to workers and without reducing pensions, the people believed him ... He is now taking money from disabled elderly unemployed people to reduce the deficit, while multi-millionaire businessmen get away with paying less than 15% in taxes legally.

My constituent goes on: All we wanted is to be able to keep our roll-over funds until we were 65. Since that was the plan and intention from the start for saving on superannuation, and it required a precarious balancing of finances so that we wouldn't be a burden to the community by drawing on the aged pensions at that time. Now we find that we need 10 extra years of financing which we did not plan on. The fact that our health let us down well before old age pension time should not be held against us. Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe that my constituent very clearly sums up the draconian aspect of this piece of legislation. I will leave my comments at that in view of the lateness of the hour.

722,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (3.00 a.m.)I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The government is supporting the ments to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996 proposed by the Australian Democrats. The Democrats and the governimpact ment have reached agreement on a package measures which will ensure there are adequate safeguards for new doctors who could potenthem tially be affected by the bill. The key amend that ments proposed are for a new section 3(g)(c) which provides for the establishment of a medical training review panel, amendments new section 19AA so as to effectively introhas duce a sunset clause and new section 19AD that will require the minister to report parliament by the year 2000 on the operation training. of the new section of the legislation. The amendments establish a Medical ing Review Panel and it is a sensible addition which strengthens the legislation. The panel will incorporate functions monitoring the numbers and types of training positions and also establish the register of medical opportunity. This register will provide not only a great avenue for graduates to sell their skills across the country but for hospitals, colleges and other employers to advertise their vacancies. This should result in a better match of 1 graduates to positions, getting people to where the jobs are. The data generated from this panel in reports to the minister and to the rendered parliament will enable us to get a better picture of the medical work force in Australia. We have also agreed to the addition of a after sunset clause. However, the government expects the experience of the legislation will and lead to the parliament agreeing to the measures being retained beyond 1 January 2002. item I commend the amendments to the House.",302
723,Mr LEE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I will speak for only a brief time. The opposition not only will decline to divide on the bill but will support these amendments. I would just like to once again reaffirm the opposition's conthe cerns about the measures that are contained in be the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2). We acknowledge the success of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in having the legislation passed and the success of his advisers and departmental officers who have provided advice to amend the government on this issue. Naturally the reason we remain opposed is we still have genuine concerns about the that the measures may have. We have of explained them to this House and the other chamber in the past, so I will not go through again tonight. I simply make the point while we welcome the safety net which the minister has negotiated with the Democrats-any safety net is better than no safety to net-we think that the fact that the minister agreed to a safety net is at least a belated admission that there is potential for a problem to to exist for some of those young doctors in To those medical students and interns who Trainhave sought over a number of months to persuade the government to head in a different direction, I simply say that I have appreciated very much the many opportunities they have taken to let me and my colleagues know their concerns about this measure. I am sure the minister expects that they may yet be persuaded that his legislation is worthy of support. I would hope that, if concerns do arise-irrespective of the fact that the minister has had his way in the parliament-and the difficulties are greater than he expects he at least try to keep an open mind with new issues that may develop in future months.

727,Mr MAREK,ADJOURNMENT,"There are a number of problems with the small business sector that have to be addressed, most notably fair trading and business conduct. It is worth pointing out that this government has already established an inquiry into these areas through the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. A lot of small businesses are not adequately protected against harsh and oppressive conduct in their dealings with larger companies. I encourage this inquiry to get to the bottom of some of these issues and put in place a code of conduct that stops these unsavoury practices from happening and legislates to penalise those people and organisations which seek to take unfair advantage of the small businessperson. I have a constituent in my electorate who has experienced this type of oppressive practice and harsh, unconscionable and deceptive conduct. In 1988 a Mr Sid O'Toole investigated going into business with Berklee, the muffler and exhaust operation. Mr O'Toole was told by Berklee management that they were experienced franchisors of 25 years standing and already had 120 franchised stores across the country. Mr O'Toole looked at one of the stores in Rockhampton, Queensland, which he was advised was the most successful store in Australia and was yet to be converted into a franchise system. Management outlined the commitment Berklee Retail was prepared to provide to franchisees and these included: a 50 per cent royalty to be paid by franchisees to be used for advertising, promotion and marketing, demographic surveys, store assistance and training; and 50 per cent of advertising funds paid by franchisees would be used in their immediate locality. Berklee Retail promised franchisees exclusive rights to distribute their product. Some 18 months later, confirming what Mr O'Toole had been told, Berklee Retail produced a franchise promotion booklet entitled The Berklee way: making money and in March 1990 produced a company video. The booklet and the video state that over 100 Berklee Australia exhaust centres operate across the nation. It goes on to say what franchising involves and how it operates. It also states in the booklet how the 50 per cent of royalty payments will be spent. Effectively, both the booklet and the video promoted the same information that management had told Mr O'Toole and all other franchisees and potential franchisees which, in Mr O'Toole's case, convinced him to sign up with Berklee Retail and purchase the Rockhampton business. As it turned out, the company failed to meet any of these commitments and promises. It is now evident that Berklee Retail, under the auspices of Berklee Ltd, deceived and induced people through its management and its promotional literature to become franchisees. Berklee Retail was not an experienced franchisor 'lnd had only 25 franchise stores at the time Mr O'Toole bought into the Rockhampton franchise. Berklee Retail claim franchisees were granted distribution rights so that you could only purchase a Berklee 'TIuffler from a Berklee store and franchisees could only purchase and sell Berklee products. This only lasted about 18 months before they removed their embossed name off their product from July 1989 and began to flood the independent stores and retail outlets. This action alone destroyed their own franchise operation and took with it nearly every one of the franchise operators. There were no discussions about this sudden turnaround-it just happened overnight. Of the royalty paid by franchisees, 50 per cent of their commitment was to be used in advertising locally. This never happened. The only advertising was corporate which concentrated on television at a massive cost and none of it was directed at the franchisee's specific market areas. Although promised time and time again, there was no in-store training by competent staff employed by Berklee Retail. There was no backup and support for franchisees, or proper financial profile of a model store and a demographic report based upon the franchise agreement. Berklee Retail also failed to make full and accurate written disclosure of all the information considered relevant to the franchise relationship at least seven days prior to the execution of the franchise agreement, or at all, and they failed to provide information as to how royalty and advertising money was actually being spent. The franchisor accepted payment of moneys for goods and services it did not intend to supply to its franchisees. This seriously contravenes the provisions of section 58 of the Trade Practices Act. By 1991 it was apparent that a number of Berklee franchisees had the same problems, so a group of them, including Mr O'Toole, formed the Berklee Franchisee Association in an attempt to reconcile the many financial and procedural problems in the system. They had to do this because there were no grievance solving procedures in place. Berklee got wind of this and set out to destroy the six franchisees involved. There were threats and intimidation and as a last resort they began to smash into shops in the dead of night with security guards to force the franchisees out. This action was outside the law and in one instance the matter went to court and the judge clearly ruled in favour of the franchisee after dressing down Berklee for their ruthless behaviour. The franchisees took their case to the Motor Trades Association on 11 March 1992. The MTAA wrote a letter to the then minister for small business pointing out the blatant disregard Berklee Retail had for its franchisees. This letter included extracts from the papers and affidavits from the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, the Berklee Franchisee Association and solicitors acting on behalf of the Franchisee Association. The MT AA letter to the minister pointed out a number of unconscionable acts perpetrated by Berklee Retail. This letter included infringements of sections 52 and 58 of the Trade Practices Act and section 592 of the Corporations Law. On 4 November 1992 these matters were discussed in person with Mr Fitzgerald, Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission. All of the issues I have raised here are misleading and deceptive conduct by Berklee and a serious breach of section 52 of the Trade Practices Act. Such a breach of duty and dishonest behaviour are clearly unacceptable and un-Australian and Berklee Ltd must be vigorously pursued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities Commission so that, if appropriate, criminal and corporate charges can be laid. The details of these actions by Berklee Ltd against my constituent, Mr O'Toole, have been set out in a complaint forwarded by me on Mr O'Toole's behalf to Professor Allan Fels of the ACCC, along with all documented evidence in support of the complaint. I seek leave to table this letter. I would hope that on reflection Berklee Ltd recognises the grievous financial damage inflicted on Mr O'Toole and makes appropriate redress. Leave granted. Gambling  a.m.)-My grievance, as Christmas fast approaches, is the family breakdown and the social distress caused by the growing government promotion of gambling. The aggressive campaigns by state governments and/or their agencies around Australia to encourage and entice people into gambling are destroying families. These are people who can ill afford to spend scarce family incomes on Lotto, instant lotteries, jackpot lotteries and all the derivatives that flow from them. They spend those scarce family dollars on gambling games that offer infinitesimally low chances of getting any kind of return for their money. Their entry into one form of gambling beyond their means opens the door to the slippery slide into other forms of gambling. The government-led lure into gambling is socially destructive, leading to family breakdown and in many cases health breakdown and in other c.ases to loss of life and suicide. The very governments that should be protecting people from exploitation and abuse are in reality the major promoters of practices that so often beggar families and cause enormous social distress leading to theft, fraud and other forms of crime. Let us look first at the government take from gambling. I am drawing from some figures from the ABC Lateline program of 31 October 1996 and the Sun-Herald edition of 9 June 1996. Australians spend $61 billion on gambling each year, which is twice the total expenditure on health. Poker and gaming machine turnover is $38 billion, racing takes $11 billion, lotteries $3 billion and casinos and others $8 billion. While so many unfortunate people become addicted to gambling as a result of government actions, so the government themselves have become addicted to gambling as a principal source of revenue. In New South Wales the government take from gambling is $1,071 million, equivalent to $8 per week from each taxpayer in that state. Victoria's annual take is $908 million and growing. Queensland rips $497 million each year from gambling, South Australia takes $187 million, Western Australia $172 million and Tasmania $51 million. The total is $2,886 million and growing and these figures do not include the ACT, the Northern Territory or Christmas Island. I have outlined the scale of government take from gambling which should be seen for what it is-taxation by deception, taxation by stealth. Expectations of winning are in promotions that in my view border on fraud. One aspect I find so offensive and so dishonest is the blatantly false expectations of winning that are portrayed in TV advertisements of lotto. These slick 'sizzle not the steak' commercials seek to have people believe that almost all one has to do is buy a ticket and collect the first prize. It is not too harsh to say that the as aim to part people from their money in the expectation that they too can so easily enjoy the pleasure, the excitement and the security that sudden wealth could bring them. The tragedy is so many people fall for the con of the as and are parted from their money which they really need for family living. So often when people begin to overreach it leads on to more gambling, more losses and more despair. The reality is that the prospects of winning are so low that they are never publicised to potential purchasers. But what are the odds of winning? In the Powerball lottery the odds of winning the first prize are one in 25 million. In the $2 jackpot lottery the odds of winning are one in 9Yz million. For the $5 jackpot lottery the odds are one in 4Yz million. For Ozlotto the odds of winning first prize are one in eight million and for lotto the chance of winning first is one in seven million. The advertising used to promote these gambles is dishonest and misleading. It leads people who cannot afford it to spend family income on gambling. The truth is that the government is extracting increasing taxes from families without regard to family needs. What is even worse is that one form of gambling leads on to another and another and another and then despair. The diversion of family incomes to gambling has been identified in Victoria since the opening of the Crown Casino. The major shopping centre proprietors point to the casino as the reason for reduced turnover in their premises. The Victorian Retail Traders Association blames the rise in gambling in that state for the fall in retail turnover in that state. The combination of alcohol, gaming machines, EFTPOS and automatic telling machines is a dangerous environment for other than the perennially lucky or steel-willed family income earners attracted by the prospect of winning easy money.  Council on Problem Gambling has made the point that with gambling there is literally no limit to the amount of money that can be spent. He says also that somewhere between one-half and seven per cent of the adult population gamble. In Sydney that means something like 30,000 to 40,000 people, each of whom affects the livelihood of another 10 to 15 people. Clearly, a substantial number of families are damaged by the ravages of gambling, be it machines, racing, casinos, lotteries or other games of chance. I am not saying that all gambling should stop. I am saying that governments must accept responsibility for the social damage they are causing by the growing promotion of gambling and the use of gambling as an invisible tax. I want to see honesty of purpose from governments in relation to gambling. I want to see honesty in practice from governments in relation to gambling. Just as excessive smoking is recognised as a damaging social practice and addictive, so excessive gambling prize should be recognised as a damaging social practice and addictive. Just as advertisements for cigarettes are required to carry a warning of the risks involved, so should advertisements for gambling-both government related and from the private sector-carry warning of the risks involved. The advertisements should state the chances of winning the major and minor prizes. They should state the percentage of the purchase price or investment that will be taken by the government. This is the least that those governments should have to do to have some modicum of honesty in relation to tax by gambling. Finally, Mr Speaker, they must do much more to assist those persons who have become addicted to gambling than the minuscule help being provided currently. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.21 a.m. (Saturday) until Tuesday, 4 February 1997, at 2 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to this sitting. NA NA Parliamentary Secretaries: Travelling Allowance Mr Laurie Ferguson asked Mr Speaker on 12 September 1996: (1) What were the individual travelling allowance and hire car expenses of shadow parliamentary secretaries between 1 July 1994 and 30 July 1995, including statistics on numbers of days claimed separately for Canberra, capital cities and other locations. (2) Under what provision of the Remuneration Tribunal determination were the claims referred to in part (1) paid. Mr Acting Speaker-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A total of $665 was paid, under the specific provisions applying to shadow parliamentary secretaries, to a shadow parliamentary secretary who was a Member of the House, for the period 1 July 1994 to 30 July 1995. This amount included one overnight stay in Canberra, two overnight stays in other capital cities, and one overnight stay in another location. The Minister for Administrative Services, in responding on 10 September 1996 to question on notice no. 113, provided details of hire care expenses of shadow parliamentary secretaries for the period concerned. (2) The authority for payments of travelling allowance to shadow parliamentary secretaries is pursuant to the provisions of Remuneration Tribunal Determination 21 of 1995. Payments are made under the specific provisions pertaining to the Shadow Ministry (Clauses 20-22) under a procedural rule effected by the former Minister for Administrative Services on 20 June 1994. Pursuant to legal advice, the Department of the Senate and the Department of the House of Representatives made submission to the Remuneration Tribunal in August 1996 to have specific provision made for Shadow Parliamentary Secretaries and the Secretary to Shadow Cabinet in the Remuneration Tribunal Determination. Artworks Mr Cobb asked the Speaker, upon notice, on 29 October 1996: What is the value of each of the artworks hanging on the walls of Parliament House, excluding those in the offices of Members and Senators.",303
728,Mr SPEAKER,INFORMATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It has been the policy of the Presiding Officers not to publicly disclose the cost of the works of art in Parliament House for a number of reasons not least of which is that some of that information is commercial-in-confidence. A further elaboration of that policy is set out below Non release of purchase price of works is the protocol followed by virtually all major collecting institutions. The publication of the detailed prices and/or current estimated values would seriously compromise the Parliament's professional reputation as a credible, responsible, collecting institution. In some cases discounted prices are offered for a range of reasons. To release artificially deflated/discounted prices, could cause substantial economic damage to artists and dealers and compromise future discounts on purchases for the collection. Releasing the prices/valuations would compromise tax incentive scheme donors and greatly discourage future donations. The prices of gifts to the collection are not available and to release valuations may lead to perceived insults to donors. Even if some classes of works were exempt, to be releasing any information will create a climate of uncertainty and distrust, with consequent costs to the Parliament's reputation. Collecting to date has been on the expectation of non-disclosure of price and arguably carries a moral obligation to continue to regard this information as confidential. Prices and values are both crude measures. They need to be viewed not only in terms of CPI variations but also in the context of the art activity of the time and subsequent art scholarship and trends. Also, replacement value, 'fire sale' value and selective auction-blockdeaccessioning value could potentially produce three very different figures for value on the one work. A list of prices paid does not reflect the extent to which the Art Collection is a substantially appreciating asset. There are real security considerations. Other considerations taken into account include Works in the collection circulate through public spaces, suites and storage for a range of reasons including conservation management. To provide information on the whole collection would, even in a summary form, be a very substantial task which would take time away from other services undertaken by the Art Collection section. Records of purchase price for some of the works are relatively inaccessible or nonexistentparticularly for the Historic Memorial Collection and for the material collected by the Parliament House Construction Authority prior to occupation of Parliament House in 1988. Accountability to Parliament for prices paid for new acquisitions is met through the Art Advisory Committee. It includes members of both houses and the Presiding Officers and determines which works at what prices are acquired for the Art Collection. The management of the collection is also publicly accountable through the auditing and Senate Estimates Committee processes. The selection of works is based on a set of policies and procedures which are vetted and approved. These are designed to meet more than a single individual's likes and dislikes. They are designed to ensure that the collection remains into the future, an intellectual credible which reflects contemporary life and art in Australian culture while providing a rich and inspirational environment in which to consider the governance of the nation. The last valuation of the collection, carried out by Christies in 1993, put the value of the collection at $12,848,000 (1994/5 JHD Annual Report). At that time there were approximately 4,160 works in the collections. This comprises purchased works, commissioned works that are part of the building (70), gifts and memorabilia and works in the Historic Memorials Collection (portraits). Approxi mateiy 174 works have been added to the collection of purchased works since that time at the cost of $272,790. If Members are endeavouring to understand why an art work/artist has been included in the collection, the Art Collection section would be more than happy to provide briefings to explain individual works or groups of works to Members.

I will quote documents in the time. I have this morning, place, on the record, and in the parliament. In the case of the Monarch, on A former chainnan of the CAA had advocated a lenient approach to policing the regulations. ""Affordable safety""; in effect, it was up to each airline to decide the airline is up for the cost of the plane; if the passengers has no assets or insurance to cover that contingency The CAA's motto was ""a safe and viable industry"" emphasis on promoting a ""viable"" industry and, as breaches of the Regulations or to revoke an AOC and Operations Branches which were responsible for policing inspectors show they resented the restrictions imposed this was that inspectors were unable to take any action apart from giving warnings and so-called counselling. That is the underpinning. This is where it all in culture concerning the regulator's role. there to ensure that airlines and air services the operator. Now let me tum to Commissioner Staunton's dealing with the industry as a Accompanying these changes were subtle, and not-so-subtle, Smith, made the following comments 'The CAA's future is inextricably linked to the what is good for the aviation industry-high safety, more people flying-is also good for the CAA.' Further, in paragraph 3.17, referring to the review include being customer orientated. Then we directly from Staunton's report on CAA strategies services to industry, which include: emphasising the importance of the customer's we provide. the need to be more transparent to customers. It goes on as I move through the report, 3.9, contain a steely message clothed in cotton wool, a little bit more deeply behind what Staunton words are carefully couched, gently. In 3.30 it says: Mr Dick Smith ceased to be Chairman of the CAA Executive Officer in February 1993. Nonetheless, remained, at least for some time. In a memorandum Airworthiness Manager of the Bankstown District 'Some of you may think that this was Black Friday was overly harsh and not to your liking ...

He said this: 'You are a servant of the industry whether you role you are still a servant of the And so it goes on in this letter: 'Improve your salesmanship. This means that that you serve and monitor. They are our customers, customers then we don't have jobs ... Anyone in a manner acceptable to this These quotes are from a memo sent round from coalface trying to ensure that aircraft are airworthy, things that need to be done to ensure safe conflict: that they are our customers-service customers then we do not have jobs. To me, saying, 'Well, if we don't have any burglars, otherwise I don't have a job, so we'll catch in employment.'

Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A proprietary company will be classified as a large proprietary company, and thus be required to have its accounts audited under the Corporations Law, where it and the entities that it controls meet 2 of the following criteria: consolidated gross operating revenue of $10 million or more; consolidated gross assets of $5 million or more; or 50 or more employees at the end of the financial year. Answers to the specific matters raised in the question are: (a) Each large proprietary company that was formerly classified as an exempt proprietary company will be required to have its accounts audited for the first financial year of the company that commences after 9 December 1995. This requirement will apply irrespective of whether a company's shareholders are directors of the company or are otherwise engaged in the management of the company. Companies meeting the large proprietary company test are significant enterprises and generally have a number of creditors or members with an interest in the company's accounts. NA The Corporations Law does, however, provide that the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) may relieve a large proprietary company of the obligation to have its accounts audited where the audit would impose an unreasonable burden on the company. In considering whether to provide such relief, the ASC must have regard to, inter alia, the expected costs of complying with the audit requirements and the expected benefits of having the company comply with those requirements. On 19 November 1996 the ASC released its audit relief policy for large proprietary companies (Policy Statement Number 115). The audit relief policy permits large proprietary companies that have not been audited since 1993: to continue to prepare and lodge unaudited accounts for the first financial year commencing after 9 December 1995; and to apply for ongoing relief from the requirement to be audited for the second financial year commencing after 9 December 1995, where they can satisfy criteria demonstrating that they are well managed and in sound financial position. A small proprietary company will not be required to appoint an auditor unless: it is a disclosing entity as defined in the Corporations Law; or it is controlled by a foreign company and its profit or loss for the period is not included in the foreign company's accounts; or it is subject to a shareholder request to prepare audited accounts; or it is required by the ASC to lodge audited accounts. (b) See introductory comments. (c) I am advised that the question whether the accounts for 1995-96 will have to be audited to avoid having the accounts for 1996-97 qualified will be a matter for consideration by each company and its auditor. An auditor, in forming a view on this matter, would be guided by his or her professional judgement. The final decision would be based on a consideration of issues such as the level of reliance that can be placed on the accounting records. (d) I am advised that no Treasury or Australian Securities Commission estimate of the average cost of compliance with the audit requirements is available. I would expect the audit fee to be determined by factors such as the form in which the accounting records are maintained and the adequacy of those records, the nature and adequacy of the company's internal controls, the number of transactions and the geographical spread of the company's operations. (e) The Government remains firmly committed to reducing the regulation and compliance costs for all levels of business. The small/large test for proprietary companies will be reviewed after 2 years operation of the legislation to ensure that its practical operation does not place an undue burden on business. Labour Market Programs: Funding Cuts (Question No. 195) Mr Griffin asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: (I) What instructions, orally or in writing, has the Minister given to the Secretary Department to cancel, modify, alter, diminish, suspend or suspend funding for, employment or labour market programs under the Minister's control. (2) Does the Minister or the Minister's Department employ Mr Sandy Hollway; if so, (a) in what capacity and (b) has Mr Hollway received any instructions from the Minister or any other Minister, including but not limited to the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance, to cancel, modify, alter, diminish, suspend or suspend funding for, employment or labour market programs administered by the Minister's Department. (3) Has the Minister attended a committee meeting, conference, seminar, discussion or consultation where the cancellation, modification, suspension, alteration or suspension of funding for, employment or labour market programs administered by the minister's Department was discussed, mentioned, explored or referred to; if so, in each case, (a) when, (b) where, (c) who attended, (d) in what capacity did they attend and (e) what current or future action was decided upon as a result. (4) What instructions, orally or in writing, have been given to or received by any (a) deputy secretary, (b) person employed by the Employment Programs Delivery Division, (c) manager of any office of the Commonwealth Employment Service or (d) employee of the Minister's Department that have the effect of cancelling, modifying, altering, diminishing, suspending or suspending funding for, employment or labour market programs under the Minister's control. Dr Kemp-The Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The Secretary and I discussed the rate of spending on labour market programs, in particular the possibility of expenditure exceeding the amount of funds appropriated a number of times during March, April and May. I agreed with the Secretary that, given the overall Budgetary situation, the Department should manage within the Appropriation. (2) Yes (a) Mr Sandy Hollway is Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (b) No, not in 1995-96. (3) and (4) I met with Mr Hollway and other officers in the Department to discuss how to manage within the Appropriation. Given the high rate of commitment and expenditure prior to the March election the Government decided on 17 April 1996 to bring forward $30m from the 1996of the Minister's 97 forward estimates. Mr Hollway, on 9 May 1996 issued a minute to all Area Managers giving instructions on management of labour market program funding for the remainder of 1995-96. That minute was tabled in both Houses. Subsequently it was found that commitments were still very high and the Government approved a further bring forward of $39.6m (i.e. a total bring forward of $69.6m). As a result while the previous Government's 1995-96 Labour Market program allocation at the time of the election was $2087.0m, final expenditure was $2156.6m. SkillShare Projects: Electoral Division of Chifley (Question No. 484)  Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 26 June 1996: What SkillShare projects were funded in the electoral division of Chifley for 1995-96 and what sum was granted to each project. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: During the 1995-96 Financial Year three SkillS hare projects in the electoral division of Chifley were funded: Mamre SkillShare-$528,OOO Mission Employment SkillShare (Mt Druitt)$488,690 10blink SkillShare-$334,360 It is possible that services provided by these SkillShare projects would assist clients living in other electorates. Priority Schools Program (Question No. 780) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 19 September 1996: Do schools in the electoral division of Canning receive funding under the Priority Schools Program or the Priority Country Areas Program; if so, which schools. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The following two government schools receive funding under Priority Schools Program: Gwynne Park Primary School, Tijuana Road, Armadale, WA, 6112 Neerigen Brook Primary School, Seventh Road, Armadale, WA, 6112 No schools in the electorate of Canning receive funding under the Priority Country Areas Program. World Conference on Education for All (Question No. 817) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 15 October 1996: (1) Is he able to say whether the World Conference on Education for All in Jomtien, Thailand, in March 1990 produced a plan to eradicate illiteracy by the year 2000. (2) Is he also able to say whether the Conference was sponsored and attended by the President of the World Bank Group, the Executive Director of UNICEF, the Administrator of the United Nations Development Program and the Director-General of UNESCO. (3) Was Australia an associate sponsor of the Conference and did Australia send a delegation to the Conference. (4) Is he able to say whether the Director-GenerInternational al of UNESCO, the President of the World Bank Group, the Administrator of the United Nations Development Fund and the Executive Directors of UNICEF and the United Nations Population Fund organised an International Consultative Forum on Education for All in Amman, Jordan, in June 1996 to review the plan; if so, was the Forum attended by 250 participants from 73 countries, including 17 in the Asia-Pacific region. (5) Were there Australian participants at the Forum; if not, why not. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The World Conference on Education for All in Jomtien, Thailand in March 1990 did not produce a plan to eradicate literacy by the year 2000. However, it did produce a World Declaration on Education for All and a Framework for Action to Meet Basic Learning Needs. Paragraph 8(4) of the Framework suggests a target in relation to the reduction in adult illiteracy. The World Plan to Eradicate Illiteracy by the Year 2000 was produced by UNESCO before the Jomtien Conference. (2) Yes, the· Conference was sponsored and attended by the President of the World Bank Group, the Executive Director of UNICEF, the Administrator of the United Nations Development Program and the Director-General of UNESCO. (3) Yes, Australia was an associate sponsor and did send a delegation. (4) The Director-General of UNESCO, the President of the World Bank Group, the Administrator of the United Nations Development Fund and the Executive Director of UNICEF organised an International Consultative Forum on Education for All in Amman. The Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund was not an organiser of the Conference, but did attend. The figures for participation at the Forum meeting are correct. However, the 250 participants were from, but not representing, 73 countries. The Amman Forum meeting was not an inter-governmental meeting nor was it intended to be fully geographically representative. Participants from a cross-section of countries were invited in their personal capacity; some were government officials, but many were from outside government. (5) The International Consultative Forum did not invite any Australians to participate in the meeting. However, Dr Colin Power, an Australian, in his independent capacity as Assistant-Director General for Education, UNESCO, did attend the meeting. While Australia was not invited to attend the Amman Conference, Australia did provide the Consultative Forum with a country report for the Mid-Decade Review of Progress towards Education for All. A global report on the Mid-Term Review based on the analysis of country reports was presented to the Amman Conference and formed the basis for discussion. SkillShare Services Review Committee (Question No. 838) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: Will the Minister release the report of the SkillS hare Services Review Committee; if so, when; if not, why not. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Department is unable to make the full Report of the SkillShare Services Review Committee publicly available as it contains confidential information relating to business organisations and if publicly released would leave the Department open to legal action for breach of confidence. However, the report is available upon request to SkillShare organisations which were part of the SkillShare Services Review process, with references to organisations other than the one applying being deleted to preserve confidentiality. Other individuals and organisations wishing to obtain a copy of the report may make a request under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and receive a copy, again with all references to confidential business information being deleted. Export Assistance: Electoral Division of (Question No. 841) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: (1) What sums were provided for export assistance (a) in 1994-95 and (b) between 1 July 1995 and 1 May 1996 to companies or businesses in the electoral division of Wannon. (2) How many of the companies or businesses referred to in part (1) received assistance and for what export categories was assistance provided. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) In 1994-95, $110,821 was provided to companies or businesses in the electoral division Wan non under the Export Market Development Grants scheme. No sums were provided under any other export assistance program administered by Austrade. (1) (b) Between 1 July 1995 and 1 May 1996, $145,149 was provided to companies or businesses in the electoral division of Wannon under the Export Market Development Grants scheme. No sums were provided under any other export assistance program administered by Austrade. (2) The financial assistance referred to in part (I) was paid to two companies in the leather and wine industries. Export Assistance: Funding (Question No. 851) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: (1) What sums were provided for export assistance (a) in 1994-95 and (b) between I July 1995 and 1 October 1996 to companies or businesses in the electoral division of Fisher. (2) What was the (a) expenditure upon, (b) location of the recipient of and (c) purpose of each grant referred to in part (1). Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l)(a) In 1994-95, $603,165 was provided to companies or businesses in the electoral division of Fisher under the Export Market Development Grants scheme. A further sum of $50,000 was provided as a concessional loan under the Innovative Agricultural Marketing Program. (l)(b) Between 1 July 1995 and 1 October 1996, $843,940 was provided to companies or businesses in the electoral division of Fisher. All of this was provided under the Export Market Development Grants scheme. Wannon (2)(a) The financial assistance provided under the Export Market Development Grants scheme was granted as partial reimbursement of eligible expenditure incurred by the companies in promoting the export of their goods and services. The Innovative Agricultural Marketing Program loan partially funded the export promotion campaign of a food company. (2)(b) The confidentiality provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985 preclude the release of personal information concerning Austrade clients. Therefore, the addresses of the recipients have not been provided. (2)(c) The purpose of the Export Market Development Grants funding was to build an export culture in Australia and to boost Australia's exports, through reimbursing part of the export of promotion expenditure of eligible firms. The Innovative Agricultural Marketing Program loan was made to assist a company in the food industry in funding an innovative export project with sound commercial potential. Christmas Gifts: Tax Deductibility (Question No. 868) Mr Rocher asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 29 October 1996: Is the cost of gift-wrapped items of food or drink given at Christmas to staff or business clients deductible for income tax purposes; if not, why not. Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Generally, Christmas gifts which are modest in value and which will be consumed by an employee or business client at home, will be tax deductible for income tax purposes. In addition, providing certain other criteria are met, the gifts will also be exempt from fringe benefits tax. The Commissioner of Taxation has outlined the income tax and fringe benefits tax consequences of employers providing Christmas presents to employees in Taxation Ruling MT 2042. This Ruling issued in June 1989. A copy of the ruling has been provided to Mr Rocher. School to Work Packages (Question No. 899) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 4 November 1996: (1) Did he announce a $187m school to work package on 20 August 1996. (2) Will schools such as the Tyndale Christian School, Blacktown, NSW, be provided with detailed information to enable them to make applications for participation in the package; if so, when. (3) Who will administer the package. (4) Will Guidelines or a list of requirements be released; if so, when. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 20 August 1996, I announced a four year $187 million school to work package with the following components: $80 million to expand vocational education and training in schools; $40 million for workplace training opportunities for students; $38 million for up to 200 work placement coordinators; $23 million for vocational education in schools, including teacher professional development; and $6 million (over two years) to expand the Jobs Pathway Program. (2) Access for individual schools, such as the Tyndale Christian School, depends on how each component is administered. (3) The school to work package is administered through the following arrangements: $80 million of Australian National Training Authority funds, over four years, will be allocated to school education authorities, through State Training Authorities. From 1997, individual schools will access funding through the relevant sector authority in their State or Territory. Funding for workplace training opportunities and work placement coordinators is administered through the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation, to which schools may apply directly. The $23 million for vocational education in schools, including professional development, will be administered through the Commonwealth's School to Work Program, from 1997. Details of funding allocations are being finalised. The Jobs Pathway Program is administered in regions, including the Blacktown area, through the Area Offices of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETY A). Brokers are contracted to establish and support employment placements, primarily for students who have undertaken vocational programs as part of Year 11 and 12, and to provide a range of other services for students including career and industry advice and facilitating career education activities and publicity material for schools, students and employers. Regions for implementing the Program have been chosen on the basis of there being significant numbers of senior secondary students participating in suitable vocational programs. (4) Guidelines for the allocation of ANT A funds will be available in December 1996. Schools should contact the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation regarding Guidelines for submitting grant applications to that organisation. Guidelines for the Schools to Work Program will be available from DEETY A in early 1997. With respect to the Jobs Pathway Program, Guidelines are already released. Copies may be obtained from DEETY A Area Offices. Certain Family Law Issues Committee: Recommendation (Question No. 900)  the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 4 November 1996: (1) Is the Minister able to say whether the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues recommended that research be undertaken into the costs of children in Australia. (2) Has research into the matter referred to in part (1) been commissioned by the Minister's Department; if so, (a) what methodologies are available to determine the costs of children, (b) did the Minister's Department assess methodologies; if so, what was its assessment, (c) what methodology was selected, (d) what were the terms of reference for the research, (e) who will conduct the research, (f) how long will the study take and (g) what will the study cost. (3) Is the Minister able to say whether the results of the study will be used by the (a) Child Support Agency and (b) the Minister's Department. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Recommendation 116 of the Report on the Child Support Scheme by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues recommended that ""the Minister for Social Security commissions an independent study into the costs of children to enable a critical evaluation of the current child support formula percentages"". (2) In response to this recommendation research was commissioned by the Department of Social Security in 1995. (2)(a) A number of approaches arc possible for determining the costs of children. These usually involve either the analysis of survey data on the expenditure patterns of families, or the costing of a basket of goods and services which are considered necessary for raising children. (2)(b) and (c) The Department of Social Security considered that a comprehensive basket of goods and services approach which also took account of the actual expenditure patterns of families would overcome the limitations of costs of children methodologies previously used in Australia. This approach is commonly known as the ""Budget Standards"" methodology. It has been used in other countries over recent times for research purposes including determining the costs of children. (2)(d) The costs of children research is being undertaken as part of a larger research project to develop indicative Budget Standards for a range of different household configurations, including families with children in a variety of employment and housing circumstances. The contract involves: research and consultation with a range of experts and academics into what it is to have an adequate level of health, housing, nutrition etc. and what goods and services are required to achieve this; research into the actual costs of the goods and services consumed by household members, including children. These goods and services include housing, food, clothing, energy use, household goods and services, personal care, leisure goods and services; analysis of the actual expenditure patterns of Australian households through detailed examination of existing research and data such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics Household Expenditure Survey; and ""reality checking"" assumptions and Budget Standards data against feedback from a series of focus groups comprised of members of particular household types, including families with children. Particular issues relating to the costs of children that are specifically required to be addressed include: economies of scale for households with varying numbers of adults and children; costs of children according to their age and position in the household; and the particular costs to a parent of having regular contact with a child where that child does not live in the same household as the parent. (2)(e) The Budget Standards research is being carried out by the Social Policy Research Centre (Budget Standards Unit) at the University of New South Wales. (2)(f) The contract allows 104 weeks for completion of the research (the research commenced in October 1995). (2)(g) The research on the costs of children is an integral part of the overall Budget Standards research which will cost around $630,000. (3) When the results of the research are available I will ask the Department of Social Security to assess their usefulness for critically evaluating the percentages in the current child support formula. I will also consult my colleagues, the Assistant Treasurer and the Attorney-General about how the results might be used for child support purposes. 'Rhyndarra': Disposal (Question No. 903) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 5 November 1996: (1) Has the Australian Defence Force vacated the 'Rhyndarra' property on the banks of the Brisbane River at Yeronga; if so, what will be done with the property. (2) Will there be public access to the property. (3) What proposals has the Government received on the future of the property. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, the Australian Defence Force vacated the former 1 Military Hospital, Yeronga, which includes 'Rhyndarra', on 30 September 1996. The property is surplus to Defence requirements and in preparing the site for disposal the Department has had certain responsibilities to perform. This has included the commissioning of a heritage study, a contamination/remediation assessment and a program of community consultation. The property is presently being marketed through a public tender process with tenders closing on 18 December 1996. (2) There will be no public access while the property remains in Commonwealth ownership. Access arrangements following the sale of the property will be determined by the new owner. (3) No formal proposals have been received by Defence. As part of the disposal process, Defence has provided information of future use opportunities for the property. Interest Rates: Pension Deeming Rules (Question No. 907)  the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 5 November 1996: (1) Is the Minister able to say whether any bank or credit union offers an interest rate of 5 per cent or 7 per cent to depositors. (2) How many clients of the Minister's Department will be adversely affected by the new deeming rules. (3) What sum will the Minister's Department save as a result of the new deeming rules in (a) 1996 and (b) a full year. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. Information supplied to the Department as at 30 October 1996 is that 15 banks and 53 credit unions have accounts offering interest equal to the deeming rates or better. Of these institutions, 5 banks and 26 credit unions pay a 5 per cent interest rate if the account balance is below $2,000. (2) It is not possible to say how many customers will be adversely affected. However it is estimated that up to 600,000 Department of Social Security Postcode 2148 2759 2760 2761 2766 2767 2770 pensioners may be affected by this proposal. The average pension reduction would be $0.50 a fortnight. However, pensioners who might be affected could reinvest their low interest savings before the measure is introduced, so that they earn interest at least equal to the deeming rates. Customers who reinvest their savings in this way would increase their interest income so that it would more than replace any loss in pension. Pensioners whose sole private income is from financial investments can only be affected if these investments exceed $45,000 in value ($78,000 for couples). It is estimated that about 60,000 allowees may be affected by the proposal. (3)(a) This measure is being introduced on 20 March 1997 and hence there will be no savings in the calendar year 1996. (b) It is estimated that there will be savings of $2.9 million in the financial year 1996/97 and $9.26 million in the financial year 1997/98. Austudy and Abstudy (Question No. 918)  Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 5 November 1996: (1) For the most recent year for which statistics are available, how many (a) secondary and (b) tertiary students living in the areas with postcodes of (i) 2148, (ii) 2759, (iii) 2760, (iv) 2761, (v) 2766, (vi) 2767 and (vii) 2770 receive (A) Austudy or (B) Abstudy assistance. (2) For the most recent year for which statistics are available, how many students living in the areas with postcodes of (a) 2148, (b) 2759, (c) 2760, (d) 2761, (e) 2766, (f) 2767 and (g) 2770 had a Higher Education Contribution Scheme liability for (i) an undergraduate or (ii) a postgraduate course. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(A) Austudy-Year to Date October 1996 Beneficiaries in selected postcodes Secondary Tertiary 603 574 253 206 318 248 251 244 131 142 270 206 1,034 522 (1 )(B) Abstudy-Year to Date October 1996 Postcode 2148 2759 2760 2761 2766 2767 2770 (2) Higher Education Contribution Postcode 2148 2759 2760 2761 2766 2767 2770 Child Support Agency: Submissions (Question No. 931)  on 6 November 1996: (1) Did the Child Support Agency make submissions to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues; if so, did a submission and evidence refer to the exempt or disregarded income of the then non-custodial parent and the living allowance of the then non-custodial parent; if so, what was stated. (2) Are the two concepts referred to in part (1) different. (3) Is there a legislative basis for a distinction between the two concepts; if not, why does his Department use differing terminology. Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes, the Child Support Agency made two submissions to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. The first referred to the non-custodial parent's 'exempted income amount' at various points. It also referred to the non-custodial parent's 'self support component' at various points. At page 124 it said, ""(the current legislation sets two income figures which could be said to represent the concept of self support. There is a basic amount used in the assessment (self support Beneficiaries in selected postcodes Secondary Tertiary 36 12 12 7 49 21 16 7 14 7 42 16 241 69 Scheme Liability-as at 31 March 1996 Undergraduate Postgraduate 827 lIS 418 50 316 36 325 25 166 IS 267 26 601 56 exemption called the exempted income amount) and there is a second amount when it comes to collection from an employee's pay (the protected earnings amount))."" 'Exempted income amount' appeared in a glossary of terms, and was defined as ""that part of the non-custodial parent's taxable income which is not taken into account in assessing child support, that is, the single pension rate if there are no other children or the married pension rate plus an allowance for each child if there are other dependent children."" 'Self support component' did not appear in this glossary: (2) No, the 'exempted income amount' and the 'self support component' are not different concepts, but different ways of expressing the same concept. (3) The Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 uses the term 'exempted income amount', with its meaning given by section 39. 'Self support component' was used by the Agency as an alternative to simplify the child support assessment formula. The Agency no longer tends to use the term 'self support component'. Child Support Agency: Review Office (Question No. 932)  on 6 November 1996: (1) Is the Review Office the means by which clients of the Child Support Agency (CSA) have decisions of the CSA reviewed; if so, do officers of the Review Office follow precedents in conducting reviews. (2) Are decisions of the review officers published. (3) Is the only avenue of appeal against decisions of review officers to the Family Court of Australia. Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The Child Support Review Office provides an administrative method for departing from administrative assessments raised under Child Support legislation. The Child Support Review Office does not review other decisions of the Child Support Agency. Clients of the Child Support Agency have the right to object against some decisions made under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 and appeal rights are to the Family Court or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Review officers follow and are bound by Family Court precedents. (2) Decisions of review officers are not published, however the parties are notified in writing of the reasons for the determination. (3) Section 115 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 provides the circumstances under which an application can be made to the Family Court of Australia after a determination has been made by a review officer. It is not an appeal from the determination made by the review officer. The court deals with the matter as if it were an initial application. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Question No. 936) Mr Bevis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 6 November 1996: (I) Is the Minister able to state how many Queensland based production and broadcast staff of Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) (a) television and (b) radio were (i) employed or (ii) on contract in June 1996. (2) If so, where were the staff located. (3) Will the numbers and location of staff vary in 1996-97; if so, how. (4) Which Queensland based programs in June 1996 will cease by the end of 1996-97. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) and (2)(a) Television News, Stateline, 7.30 Report-25 Australian Story-6 Landline-6 Backchat-3 Production Support-68 Technical-13 Management-including Finance/Publicity/ Training-6 Total-127 All TV staff in Queensland are located in Brisbane other than a journalist and camera operator in Rockhampton and Townsville. (b) Radio Brisbane Regional Joumalist/Reporters 37 29 Broadcasters 54 38 Alphatec 14 2 Admin Support 5 o 110 69 Of the above, only four staff were on contract. (3) The total loss of ABC Local Radio (Metropolitan and Regional) staff overall by the end of June 1997 is likely to be around 12, mostly from Brisbane, although more could follow soon after. Between June 1996 and June 1997, television will have reduced its staff by approximately 10 in Brisbane. (4) ABC Radio At this stage, it is known that only the 4QR and Regional night-time radio program will be networked and this will come out of Sydney. The two separate afternoon programs on 4QR and Queensland regionals are being amalgamated. ABC Television 'Backchat' will be moved to the South Australian branch and will be a completely new production with a different presenter. University of Tasmania: Law Degrees (Question No. 948)  representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 19 November 1996: Is it a requirement of the University of Tasmania that students complete a degree in another faculty before commencing law; if so, will students formally enrolling the first time for a law degree in 1997 be exempted from the higher HECS charges; if so, how. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Students wishing to enrol in the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree offered by the University of Tasmania in 1997 will be required to have completed either: a first year in another faculty, studied the unit Introduction to Law (or its academic equivalent); or a bachelor degree. (2) Draft Ministerial guidelines were issued recently to assist institutions in determining which students will not be liable for the differential HECS charges to take effect from January 1997. In accordance with these guidelines, students who enrol in the LLB at the University of Tasmania will not be required to pay differential rates of HECS provided that they have: studied in another HECS-Iiable undergraduate course prior to January 1997; and have not completed the requirements of the other course. It is anticipated that most students enrolling in the LLB will fall into this category. Students who enrol in the LLB program having already completed a bachelor degree will attract differential HECS as they will not satisfy any of the exemption categories.

Club TAB and Keno Income: Taxation (Question No. 976) Mr MCClelland asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: (1) Has the Deputy Commissioner for Taxation in NSW made a determination that commissions received by registered clubs in NSW from TAB and Keno operations conducted within clubs are now taxable; if so, (a) when and (b) why was the determination made. (2) Has the Deputy Commissioner also determined that the tax is payable retrospectively for five years; if so, why. (3) What is the estimated total revenue to be collected from this tax (a) for the five year retrospective period, (b) annually and (c) from licensed clubs in the electoral division of Barton. (4) Does he support these actions having regard to a commitment by the Coalition during the last federal election campaign that there would be no new taxes in the life of this Parliament. Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l)(a) A letter was sent to a representative Registered Clubs Association (RCA) of NSW on 3 October 1996 advising (on a without prejudice basis) that Keno commission income derived by registered clubs is assessable income and is not subject to the principle of mutuality. The letter did not deal with commission income from TAB operations. (b) The issue of the taxation treatment of Keno commission income arose during contact with a taxpayer during August 1996. Further investigation revealed that many clubs had assumed that the commission income was subject to the principle of mutuality and therefore not assessable income. The principle of mutuality is, broadly, based upon the proposition that a taxpayer cannot derive from September 1991 to year ended year ended year ended year ended These figures represent gross commISSIOn amounts only and there may be tax deductible expenses related to the derivation of this income. In addition, a number of clubs deriving Keno commission income are exempt from income tax and revenue collections will, therefore, be reduced accordingly. Further, a proportion of the income may already have been returned by non-exempt clubs as part of their income derived from nonmembers. (c) No details are available for estimated revenue collections for licensed clubs deriving Keno commission income in the electoral division of Barton. (4) The taxation treatment of Keno and TAB commission income is being determined under existing taxation law. Registered clubs have incorrectly assumed that the commission income is exempt when it has always been taxable under the law. Clearly no new 'tax' is involved. income from itself. Generally, under this proposition, income derived by registered clubs from their members is not treated as assessable income for taxation purposes. However, Keno commissions are paid to clubs by Club Keno Holdings Pty Ltd and are not derived from club members. Under the same principle, commissions paid to clubs by the TAB are assesof the sable income, not tax exempt mutual income. In view of the widespread misunderstanding of the tax status of the commission income, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is attempting to resolve this matter in close consultation with the registered club industry. (2) No. The ATO has not determined the tax liability of clubs at this time. It is true that Keno has been operating in NSW since September 1991, but as already noted, the ATO is negotiating with the registered club industry to resolve the matter. (3)(a) and (b) No estimates of revenue collections for tax on Keno commission income have been made for the five year period or on an annual basis. However, the following gross commission income was derived by licensed clubs in NSW from Keno operations as shown in the following table: 30 June 1992 $8.5 million 30 June 1993 $19.13 million 30 June 1994 $28.402 million 30 June 1995 $40.157 million 30 June 1996 $42.042 million Armed Forces: Personnel (Question No. 979) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 21 November 1996: How many personnel, by rank, are there in the Australian: (a) army, (b) navy and (c) air force.
