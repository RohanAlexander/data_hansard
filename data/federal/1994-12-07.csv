1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1994-95 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1994-95 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1994-95 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 December, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the bill be now read a second time.",11
2,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"You would never have thought, from observing the performance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in question time on Monday, that there were any problems in this country at all. Mr Rocher-You mean the deficit dalek?",11
3,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"The deficit dalek. You would have thought, from the way he filibustered his way through and carried on, that everything was rosy. Yet we are about to hear from the Reserve Bank, I assume following its meeting this morning, that there will be a further increase in interest rates in this try.",11
4,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,Certain to be.,11
5,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"There is a very good chance of that. That will be the third interest rate rise we have had in recent times. We have already had an increase of 1% per cent, and I wonder what we can expect to see as a result of today's Reserve Bank meeting. There are a lot of concerns in this country about the economy and one would think, from watching the government's performance, that everything was rosy. I remind the government that increases in interest rates affect average families. They affect the mums and dads. They affect not only rich people, but all people. If we are to have a further increase in interest rates-say one per cent-how much a month does that add to the average mortgage payment?",11
6,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,About 35 bucks.,11
7,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"The honourable member for Mitchell says it is about $35; perhaps it is even more than that. The point is that this is an expense for average people. The government is looking at ways to reduce its deficit. We are yet to see how it is going to go about doing that. It could take a responsible course, one that we have been advocating: it could look carefully at reducing government expenditure. Ido not pretend that that is easy. We do not believe that that is an easy proposition at all. There are lots of calls on government expenditure; nevertheless, reducing government expenditure is a responsible way forward to attack the budget deficit. This government is clearly a tax and spend government. Therefore,· the option least attractive to it will be to look critically at government revenue. Having avoided that, despite the calls for a deficit reduction strategy by the Governor of the Reserve Bank on a number of occasions, the government is now about to take the much easier option of increasing taxes. As we pointed out to the Prime Minister in question time on Monday, that is in the context of promises prior to the last election to not increase taxes. No matter how the Prime Minister might want to get around that and argue about the semantics of that, it was very counclear to us-I think it was very clear to everyone in Australia-that, prior to the last election, the Prime Minister was saying that there would be no increases in taxes. The Prime Minister's whole election strategy was based on criticism of our proposal to bring in what ultimately would have been a much fairer, more efficient and more equitable tax system. The government's whole election strategy was an attack on us. The government went to the extreme of bringing legislation into this parliament which was aimed at convincing the Australian people that its strategy was to match our proposal to reduce income tax. So we had the famous l-aw tax cuts. Despite what the Prime Minister said in question time on Monday, the government has reneged on that promise. It has repealed that legislation. The second stage of those income tax reductions is now not to be delivered until some time in 1998, which is a long way down the track. There is no doubt at all in my mind that the tax cuts will disappear completely off the agenda long before that. Rather than have further decreases in income tax, we will see increases in taxes and charges. The opposition is now totally aware, and the Australian people should be aware, that the problem of how to raise more revenue for the purposes of doing what needs to be done-reducing the deficit-is very much on the government's agenda. The government's current substantial deficit is the result of its high spending policies. Almost every day in this place a minister comes in here with a new spending initiative, a new program or a new paper of some sort that foreshadows spending. In the end, that is the only thing this government knows how to do-spend other people's money. Much of this money is wasted. Much of it is to solve problems that the government has created in the first place. Its strategy for reducing unemto ployment is largely based on throwing money at the problem rather than carrying out the fundamental reforms in the economy, which would lead to real job creation. That is not a difficult proposition. We on this side of the House understand clearly that to create real jobs we need to make it possible for businesses to employ more people. That is a simple proposition. But rather than go down the track of proper micro-economic reform and proper reform of the industrial relations system, which this government cannot do because it is bound to the rules set up by the unions-it is governed by the unions-it comes in here with all sorts of other panaceas, such as training programs and subsidies to employers. Everything is done back to front. The government always puts the cart in front of the horse rather than coming up with real and, in the end, simpler solutions to the problems of unemployment. Let us not talk about increasing taxes, which the government is talking about, to solve the problem. Ironically, the solution to the problem is to reduce taxes and charges. In reducing taxes and charges, particularly on small business, employment will be stimulated. There are about one million small businesses in Australia. It does not take too much imagination to realise that if each of those small businesses employed one more person there would be a significant impact on the number of unemployed. When I go out .to my electorate, as I have recently done, and visit small businesses, look at what they are doing and talk to them about their problems, one of the problems they raise consistently is the need to get trained staff. They have certainly been let down on that score, with the very low number of apprentices currently being trained. There is a lack of trained staff and a lack of staff who are prepared to work hard. Small business people in my electorate consistently tell me that they would employ one, two, three, four or· five more people tomorrow if they could get people who were genuine about seeking work. This government has created a system whereby people can actually choose whether work or not. Despite its attempts in recent times to address the issue of the unemployment benefit being too generous, once again in a bandaid fashion it has simply tinkered at the edges making it possible for people to actually retain their unemployment benefit at the same time as doing some work. Employers in my electorate tell me that people are still saying to them, 'I'm sorry. I really think there are some benefits for me in getting back into the work force, but, unfortunately, I can get as much in benefits from the government by the time. I add them all up, having three or four children, as the wage you are offering me, even if it is the award wage' - and let us assume that those wages in many respects are very generous-'and it really is not worth my while coming to work for you.' Alternatively, I am being told that people are saying, 'I'm getting the unemployment benefit and you have got a desperate need for my particular trade, so I will come and work for you if you just give me a bit of cash or whatever on the side. As long as it does not interfere with my unemployment benefit, I am prepared to work for you.' Mr O'Keefe-It doesn't really happen that way.",11
8,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"It does; If you want to come to my electorate, I will take you out and we can visit business after businessMr O'Keefe-You are just perpetuating a popular myth. It doesn't happen that way, and there is any amount of evidence to show that it doesn't.",13
9,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"It is not a myth. I am telling you that I have been out in my electorate in recent weeks and this is what is happening. The people on the other side of the House are totally deluded; they just do not exist in the real world. It is a pity that not, because if they went out and saw what was happening in the real world, they would be very concerned. The government's feeble attempts to solve the problems of this country are not going to work. We already see evidence, despite the assurances given yesterday by the Treasurer (Mr Willis), that we will be back on a boom-bust cycle. The government has already lost control of the economy and that will become evident before very long. The government needs to be reminded-and I take the opportunity in the context of this debate about government expenditure-that the solution to this'country's problems is not to talk about increasing taxes, but rather decreasing taxes. In the context of decreasing taxes, rather than talking about spending money, it ought to be looking seriously at saving money and looking at many of the programs. It is almost impossible for a member of parliament who has been here for five yearslet alone for the average person in the street who is subjected to all sorts of propositions by the Department of Social Security or the Commonwealth Employment Service-to understand the complexity of so many of the programs that it has brought in. There is such a diversity of programs-the government is putting money into this and money into thatyet the solutions to the huge problel;TIS of our overseas debt and the level of unemployment that persists in this country are much simpler. They do not relate to spending money; they actually relate to doing exactly the opposite. The solution I advocate as far as deficit reduction is concerned is to look critically at what the government is actually spending. Ironically, in doing that to reduce taxes it will have the effect of encouraging businesses to employ more people and there will be increased revenue to the government by virtue of the dividend that will flow from that. I am very concerned about the prospect of increasing interest rates. I think we are all waiting to see what the result of the meeting this morning will be. We already have very high interest rates in this country. From that base"" we are about to step off further onto the treadmill which we have been on before. The they do Australian people remember very well the promises we have had in the past-in 1985 and beyond. We have experienced this situation before. We were told that everything was under control. We were told budget after budget that everything was fine, that we were going along well, then we had the worse recession in 60 years. We are about to get back on that same track, that same treadmill, that will take us in that same direction. Let me remind the House of the impact higher interest rates will have not only on families but also on small business. Many small bUsinesses went broke during the last recession because of not only reduced demand for their products but, initially and subsequently, higher interest rates. Most small businesses rely, to a very large extent, on borrowing money for one purpose or another. They have overdrafts, short-term loans and longer term financing, but they are affected by increasing interest rates. As interest rates escalated rapidly, as they did in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many of them went broke. The effect of that was unemployment. I am very concerned about the prospect of increasing interest rates that we now have on the agenda for this country. Frankly, I do not accept the assurances of the Treasurer that the government has the economy under control. The fact is, and certainly even the government's own advice appears to have been, that it lost control of the economy very early on. In the context of this debate, I want to place on record my dismay at the way this government is managing the economy; in fact, it is mismanaging the economy. It has created a welfare system in this country that has pervaded almost the whole of our society. I wonder at times whether that is intentional. It is almost a new form of socialism that has been thrust upon us, a form of socialism that is not as obvious as earlier forms. Yet 4.4 million people in this country are now totally dependent on this· government. In the early 1970s around 10 per cent of people were dependent on government for their primary source of income. The figure today is closer to 27 per cent or 28 per cent. That represents an enormous cost to government and it ought to be of great concern to people that 'that is the trend. Average families that previously were not in the government welfare net now find themselves there by virtue of the home child-care allowance. We previously received the dependent spouse rebate through the tax system. It worked very efficiently but the government, for the purpose of another of its agendasthat is, political correctness-decided that out the wrong signals. Hundreds of thousands of people who were never involved with the Department of Social Security before went through the intrusive process of having the Department of Social Security write to. them and ask all sorts of questions that were never relevant to the tax office in getting the dependent spouse rebate. That was available to people by a very simple mechanism. We now find ourselves-I say 'we' because my family is included-in the Department of Social Security computer system. We are now numbers in the Department of Social Security. We never wanted to be involved with the Department of Social Security. We_. were perfectly happy with the arrangements before with the dependent spouse rebate. Now we get $30 a week. I worked out the other day that we end up with $10 a month more than we used to get. I am paying for it because my tax has been increased as a result of my losing the dependent spouse rebate. Each month I get less money. My wife gets it back the same month via the tax office and the Department of Social Security. We can only imagine how many extra public servants have had to be employed in the Department of Social Security to manage that new system. I believe that we are heading down the road towards the next election with the govemmeM in complete disarray, as far as concerns its management of the economy and its whole range of policies. I believe that the Australian people will wake up to the fact they have been conned in many respects, that they have been misled. The irony of this is that they have experienced all of this before. We intend to remind the Australian people, and the government, as we head down the track toward the· next election, that this Prime Minister was the Treasurer who consistently told us, in all of those years through the 1980s and early 1990s, that we were on track, that everything was under control. We knew then that it was not, we know now that it is not, and we intend to remind the people of Australia about that every day between now and the next election.",13
10,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown,"1 intend to take this opportunity in the sent debate on the appropriation bills to raise a matter which I think is very important but is being disregarded in Australia. Listening to the last speaker, the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), I must say that it is heartening to know there are some things that are bipartisan in this parliament-and, clearly, massive ignorance is one of them. We are being told that the future of Australia and of the world lies in some great EI Dorado of free trade. This has always been, basically, the policy of the Liberal Party. With my own party it has not been so, but in recent times we too have embraced this sterile ideology. I think we need to look very hard at what this policy offers us. In my view, the policy is dead wrong and dangerous for Australia. We are told by Minister MCMullan-in fact, by the World Bank-that implementing the full GATT agreement would increase world trade by $213 billion in the next 10 years. That is a lot of money. But we really have to analyse that against what world trade would be if we did not have GATT. If we did that analysis, we would find that the world trade figures would be about the same. Furthermore, $213 billion is 0.7 per cent of world trade. It is no- a. very. significant amount, but its redistribution could have catastrophic consequences. The Secretary-General of the OECD admits that the figures are highly theoretical and also theatrical. I think it does give us cause for real concern. We are told that cheap goods produced by low cost labour overseas will be good for consumers. What governments and oppositions tend to forget is that consumers are workers also. There is absolutely no doubt that, if we are to govern for the benefit of the people of this country, Australia must be a high wage country. There is no future in going down the low wage route. For one thing, there is simply no end to it. If overnight we were to cut a full 33 per cent off the cost of employing labour in Australia, it would simply mean that our competitors would be able to employ something like 30 cheap labour workers, say, Filipinos or Vietnamese, instead of the 40 or 45 workers they do employ now. If we analyse these figures, we can see it is a very dangerous and foolish road for Australia to go down. I think we could also ask ourselves: do we, as a developed country, have any moral responsibility to open our markets to Third World countries? I would argue that we do not. I would also say that, if a country by good luck or good management is able to obtain for its citizens a high standard with good services and a good quality of life, there is absolutely no justification for that country to sacrifice those things on the altar of some altruistic view that we have to help other people. If we go down that road, we will find it is endless also: those countries will not reciprocate; they will simply bypass us and leave us for dead. I drove back from Parkes this morning. I took my son down there last night because he is going to work in Parkes for a company called Austops. Austops is a very interesting company. It produces the highest quality and the cheapest wool tops in the world. We in Australia are unbeatable in this field, if we do it right. We sell our tops in a completely unprotected market. It has always been that way and, as far as I can see, it always will. Free trade does nothing for this industry. It is I already there and we are already highly competitive. We should have 30 of these Austops factories throughout Australia turning the great bulk of our wool into top making value adding in Australia thereby increasing the wealth of this nation and providing much needed jobs in the community. We export our minerals into a world where we have no protection whatsoever. We do very well because we are the best miners in the world. Free trade is not going to assist these industries greatly. Some people from AMIC and some of those whom I call the lead-brained people in the mining industry have said that the access to imports is not going to be of great benefit to them because they can get most of the stuff they use now tariff-free anyway. So there is no great benefit there. They do not face the problem of high labour costs. It is true that Australian labour is expensive in the mining industry but it is also highly productive. The problems this industry faces include access to land. What is going to cripple the mining industry-the industry that is so vital to Australia because of its export earning capacity-is access to land and the increasing sovereign risk that comes with it. There is no guarantee that free trade in the world is going to be a bonanza for us. There is a lot of evidence to. suggest that quite the of living contrary will happen. .(Let us look for a moment at Third World countries. If we w-re to suddenly subject all Third World countries to best practice in agriculture, it would have catastrophic effects. If their agriculture is measured in terms of the number of people required to grow a given quantity of food, it is generally not particularly efficient but it does employ an enormous number of people. If competitive pressures are put in there, those countries will be forced to modernise their agriculture, to go into broadacre agriculture and to lower their' costs of production. The consequence of that will be massive unemployment in those countries: while wages are low in the rural sector in Third World countries, it at least gives people employment and access to food. Then there would be a massive transfer of people from rural areas of the Third World to the already overcrowded cities. The consequence of that would be a push for mass movement of people, mass immigration, which would be impossible to resist. Is this the future that governments and oppositions see for Australia? It is certainly not the future that I want for my children in this nation. Furthermore, we should ask: is it what we want for Third World countries? I am sure that, if they thought about it, it would not be something they would want for themselves. We really have to rethink this issue. Basically, by executive decree, we in the Australian Labor Party have gone down the free trade route. The Liberal Party has no mind; it is simply an amorphous mass. It has this ideological predilection for free trade. It has never bothered to think about the consequences. When people in the opposition prattle on about micro-economic reform, inevitably they mean lower wages. Microeconomic reform is a code word in this nation for lowering wages, it is not the way to go for Australia. I believe there is more to be gained from a study of history than there is from a study of economics. In history, you can see the end product of where the economic actions have taken us in the past. We live in a world in which there has been a revolution in the vocabulary. Words do not mean what they used to mean anymore. When we talk about rational economists nowadays, what we really mean is neoclassical economists. There is nothing particularly rational about that. Let us look at the United States, arguably the most powerful economy in the world-or it was until 1983, when the United States decided to declare class war on its own people. We have seen a reduction in real average wages in the United States. It does not mean everyone is getting less; some people are getting a lot more. But the United States is busily building itself an underclass of its own citizens. That is certainly not the future I want for Australia. I want a much more egalitarian society in this nation. The United States is saying that its salvation lies in free world trade. It wants access to Japanese markets. The reality is that, if Japan were to wipe away all forms of protecI tion tomorrow, it would probably lead to $10 billion a year extra trade for the United States. The reality is that the United Statdoes not need $10 billion a year-it nee-s $300 billion a year-to redress the damage that it has done to its economy. It is absolutely a nonsense concept. The historical evidence demonstrates this, yet we still go mindlessly down this road. We in the Labor Party are driven by the executive, and the people in the Liberal Party follow like the mindless sheep that they are. I believe this free trade business has to be thrashed out in much more detail. We have to have this argument in the Australian parliament before we go too far down this road. I have absolutely no problems with trade, but there is a great need for self-sufficiency in countries. We are told by the rational economists that countries should specialise-a policy which the French reject totally. I believe the management of the French economy has a lot of merit. I do not believe that we s}lOuld be a totally specialist country, because it will leave us extremely dependent. As I have mentioned in the parliament before, in August last year we lost in Australia our last capacity to cast truck wheels. I would have thought truck wheels would have been absolutely vital to transport, on which the whole economy and the defence of this country balance. That company closed down because it could not compete against truck wheels imported from Malaysia. Within a very short period of that Australian company closing down, the price of Malaysian truck wheels went up in Australia to a level higher than had prevailed before the closure of the Australian company. It is clear and rational that this is what will happen if we are silly enough to allow it to happen, yet we go on saying that this is good for us. Obviously, it is not. It is simply a revolution in the meaning of words. 'Yes' means 'no', 'black' means 'white', and 'rational' means 'irrational' . I do not believe it is all gloom. I believe Australia can have an enormous future, but we must tackle it on a simple, common sense basis. The best welfare system in the world is a job. It should be a job that is interesting, offers advanc.ement to a person and offers good remuneration. But, at the end of the day, ajob is very important. We are being told-it is no doubt true and it is in a sense a great tribute to this government-that we have increased the export of elaborately transliving formed manufactured goods by a compound rate of about 10 per cent a year since we have been in government. That is a very commendrelatively able effort indeed. The problem is that the importation of that same category of goods has risen by a slightly higher amount from much bigger base. So the gap is getting bigger, not smaller. That means that there fewer jobs. One of the things that Australia has been good at traditionally is precision engineering and work in the metal trades, yet we see metal workshops closing up all over South Australia and to spme extent in Victoria. economy of South Australia is manufacturing industry based and, without that industry, there is no future for South Australia. It simply a cruel lie and a hoax to keep telling the people of that state that their future lies tourism or free trade. It clearly does not. It is well worth looking at the United States because it became the world's powerhouse. No country could compete with it in export manufactures. That was at a time when United States had a very high import duty. It was internally competitive, but it was largely protected against imports. It was from this potential base that it was able to develop its industries and export to the world. How things have changed and how unnecessary it is for that be the case. The reality in Australia is that are not going to reduce the current account deficit unless we address the issue of import replacement manufacturing. This is where jobs are and this is where the big savings the current account are. Are we doing this? The answer, quite clearly, is no, we are not. There is a simple rule in economics that goes something like this: if we join together two countries of equal size and make them common market union, there will be no effect on wages because they are of equal size equal standard to start off. If, however, we join together two countries of equal size which have very dissimilar standards of living, over 15 years those standards of living will equalise. In the case of the United States and Canada, which are roughly equal, joining with Mexico, which has a lower population, we would see a decrease in the standard of in the United States. I believe the United States will find this decrease intolerable, but it will not be great because of the small population in Mexico. If we look at Australia's situation, however, and we are expected to enter into a free trade a zone with other countries' teeming millions, that formula will apply and the consequences are could be horrendous. People say this will be masked and overcome by increasing world trade and increasing average prosperity. My view is that average prosperity can never rise enough to overcome the consequences of the IS-year rule. I think simple first year mathThe ematics would illustrate that. What does Australia need to do? Obviously, we must exploit those industries we are good is at, where we have no peer in the world. We are the world's best miners. We are the most in efficient miners in the world. We must take the shackles off the mining industry otherwise what will happen is that we will export our technology to Third World countries and other countries, they will then become as the good as we are and have much lower wages and we will force ourselves out of the market. We must also look at maximising the of these industries. The reality is that we cannot value add the mining industry. Our customers in Asia want to value add because to they realise that is where the jobs are. They we are not stupid. It is obvious that jobs are in value adding. What we have to do with the mining industry is to value add the front end. the We have to start manufacturing the mining in equipment in Australia. In Australia we have some of the largest mining operations in the world, we have state-of-the-art miners, the highest standard, world best practice, miners. Why do we not have an industry? Because a there is another vital element: government support. It does not mean government investand ment, it just means government rapport. Austops at Parkes is today up and running 24 hours a day and its order books are overflowing with overseas orders. It is going places because its principal, Jonathan Todhunter, had an assurance from the then minister, Mr Crean, that he wanted to see value adding and he would support value adding. The minister's assurance was the driving force behind the establishment of Austops. Mr Todhunter has told me that absolutely explicitly on several occasions. We do not have that government support with the mining industry. The government should be saying to industry, 'Hey, we want you to get in there. We want a mining industry and it is not happening.' That is why we do not have that industry in Australia. Honourable members should bear one simple fact in mind. A large Haulpak, trucks used in the mines to carry large tonnages of ore, is anything over 200 tonnes. Australia uses 70 per cent of the world's Haulpaks yet we do not make one in Australia. I believe that is a national scandal. Many industries we have in Australia could be, with a bit of incentive and a bit of help, world best performers and great export earners and could form the basis of big industries in this country. The other element of business we need in Australia is those things which are essential to Australia's stability. We need to develop and protect those industries, if it is necessary. I am not saying that the government picks winners, although I believe governments can pick winners, and overseas governments consistently pick winners. You do not have to do it; you only have to pick directions in which industries should go. You pick the general area, and the winners will then pick themselves in that formula. Free trade, as it is being preached to us, is a very dangerous, flawed and failed philosophy. It is something that needs to be discussed far more widely in Australia. I am afraid it is going to need an educated press gallery, which seems to be something long past in this nation.",14
11,Mr CLEARY,Unknown,"The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is dead right. We do need the press gallery to take up the issue of this ridiculous free trade position that has been trotted out in this federal parliaand ment. Following the Wills by-election in April 1992-an election which focused on the nexus between tariff reductions and the losof jobs in the manufacturing sector, and which brought to public scrutiny the fantasy of the level playing field-the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was reborn as a protectionist, lampooning the coalition for its so-called zero tariff policy. We all surely remember the Prime Minister pointing the finger at the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), catapulting the derisive 'Captain Zero' into the political lexicon. The fact that the Prime Minister was an unashamed, unreconstructed free traderonly marginally or five per cent different from the member for Wentworth-was lost in the banter. Unfortunately, what continues to be overlooked in the debate is that tariffs are not in themselves the issue but merely a symbol of the problem. In essence, a commitment to tariffs, or non-tariff barriers for that matter, is predicated on the belief that economic sovereignty is essential to any meaningful definition of nationhood-hardly a reactionary or inward-looking view. Members of the coalition used to fly their overseas-made Australian flags on the benches and are always eager to rise to their feet and proclaim their commitment to Australia. On the Labor side, the jingoism focuses on a flag without a Union Jack and a republic with an Australian head of state. All in all, everyone in the House is pretty much committed to Australia. Mention international treaties and you discover just how Australian the coalition is. The irony is that, whilst the coalition condemns the effect of international treaties on Australian law, it refuses-the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and a couple of his mates aside-to adopt the same logic on the question of Australia's economic sovereignty. The dressed up palaver that spills out of the Prime Minister's mouth about an independent Australia is no substitute for a real commitment to an economically and culturally independent Australia. For the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) to ape the Murdoch newspeak that superhighways CD-ROM are culturally neutral, innately democratic and liberatory, just about makes me cry. It matters not to the Prime Minister or the Minister for Communications and the Arts who controls, produces and disseminates that which they define as culture. The abrogation of cultural independence exemplified in the government's commitment to Hollywood on the Harbour must surely leave progressive forces in the Labor Party fearful about the future. You only needed to catch a glimpse of the cricket last night to discover how our sports culture has been affected by overseas imagery. The Australian cricket team last night looked, to all intents and purposes, like a baseball team. Shane Warne was a pitcher last night. Packer is well aware that Australian children are seeing more basketball and baseball advertising on the television and are growing up with what Mervyn Smythe describes as 'a diet of American heroes, situations, images and values'. Smythe asks rhetorically, 'Will Australia's sporting and cultural heritage be ultimately wiped out by the unstoppable force of modern American marketing?' If last night is any indication, I would say regrettably the answer is 'yes'. It is no coincidence that the Prime Minister adores French culture. The French, as we all know, are fiercely protective of their culture. Their contempt for the kitsch culture of Hollywood and their preparedness to restrict Hollywood's attempt to dump mass-produced rubbish in their market are some of their more commendable practices. Why, we must ask, does this parliament speak the language of national sovereignty yet accept policies which produce economic and political dependence? Dr Joe Camilleri, in an article 'Music of the Sphere' in the Arena magazine of OctoberNovember 1994, describes the trend this way: Nevertheless the process of global institutionalisation is a striking barometer of the state's ingly restricted freedom of action in the management of the national economy. The growth of international institutions points to a significant, if little advertised, delegation of state authority. Conservatives will read 'international institutions' to mean United Nations covenants and treaties. They do not regard the World Trade Organisation, APEC, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as international institutions to worry about. Members of the coalition might care to explain just why they adore policies which reduce our economic and cultural sovereignty but become panic stricken and froth at the mouth when an international treaty is used to stop homosexuals being victimised in Tasmania. It was interesting to read in the Financial Review of Monday,S December that Australia has deferred aid talks with Papua New Guinea until the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have announced their financial aid conditions. Although the World BankIMF package focuses on some pleasant sounding environmental conditions, vis-a-vis logging, that Australia should defer to what is becoming a discredited int-rnational organisation reflects the loss of sovereignty unbridled globalism creates. John Langmore and John Quiggin in their book Work/or All argue quite rightly that the World Bank must move beyond the contractionary, inequitable, simplistic free marketeering policies of the 19808. It is a bit old hat really. It is almost amusing to see both sides of the House claiming a superior commitment to national sovereignty yet simultaneously promulgating policies which, by their very nature, erode the principles' of nationhood they claim to believe in. Camilleri's scenario that 'a largely deregulated financial system effectively removes major levers of economic policy such as exchange and interest rates from national control and opens the way for unproductive investment and large and unpredictable financial flows' would be music to the ears of the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). When the financial markets prevailed and the 10year bond rate 'went gangbusters', to use the Prime Mini-rer's language, he attacked the increasmessenger boys-those mobile phone-toting, BMW-driving yuppies who gather on the floor of the Australian Stock Exchange and scour terminals looking for a quick buck. What he did not want to acknowledge was that his policies were the reason these charlatans had become so powerful and the nation state so powerless. As we all know, the unpredictable financial flows that Camilleri refers to were the source of the kinds of speculative ventures which devastated Australia in the 1980s. Instead investment being directed to forms of producnorthern tion which were socially useful and enhanced employment, it was-to quote Rhys from his essay 'Capitalist development in the newly industrialised countries'-'dissipated grandiose projects or channelled into real estate or financial speculation'. Ask Christowill pher Skase about that. Rhys Jenkins argues for an interventionist approach to economic life and for the state to have an ability to discipline private capital. The free marketeers construct a labyrinth lies about the means by which economic efficiencies are realised. Jeffrey Henderson seminar. argues in his essay in Leslie Sklair's book Capitalism and development: In stark contrast to the ideologically loaded empirically distorted accounts of East Asian industrialisation that have emerged from the pens and word processors of neo-classical economists . . . it is now clear that though these economies have benefited from vigorously functioning kets, state orchestration of their development projects has been a sine qua non of their success. Henderson goes on to say of the east Asian NICs: They have at various moments acquired foreign technology under license for dissemination favoured companies, encouraged joint-venture arrangements with foreign partners, protected the domestic market from foreign competition, delivto ered subsidised credit through nationalised heavily regulated banking systems (Korea and Taiwan) for approved projects and invested own R&D facilities to help boost the technological capabilities of the private-sector manufacturers. The approach of the Asian tigers to economic matters is a far cry from the silly, ill-conshort ceived approach endorsed in this parliament. The Prime Minister, in his APEC statement to the parliament yesterday, cheerfully minded us that our tariffs are among the lowest in the region and that Australian business'; industry has shown it is more than capable competing in a low tariff environment. It is absolutely absurd to talk of Australia competto ing in a low tariff environment when the very Party. countries against which we compete are proponents of high tariffs. Some APEC and economies, the Prime Minister tells us, have tariffs ranging from 100 to 300 per cent. Is the Prime Minister actually aware of of unemployment that exists in parts of the suburbs of Melbourne, where the textile industry has been ravaged by the Jenkins excesses of free trade? The Prime Minister has come to sound like in a financial shark or con man. He tells us that, under APEC free trade, Australia's real output rise by 3.8 per cent and real national income by 1.2 per cent and that exports will increase by 27 per cent and imports by 20 per cent. This runs totally counter to the thoughtful intellectual assessment of APEC provided of by American academic Chalmers Johnson, who was in Australia recently to deliver a Johnson's approach is far more cautionary. He sees the United States of America and and Japan as the big players. No-one in this House would be surprised to hear that the highly indeficit USA wants a share of the highly in-surplus Japanese market. Nor should marwe be surprised to hear that Japan and China are unlikely to countenance trade policies which jeopardise their position. As Kenneth Davidson argues in the Age on 16 November 1994, 'Even in sport-let alone industry, culture or politics-how often has the winner to changed the rules of the game to give the loser a chance?' Davidson further says, 'Instead of looking for rules, Australia has got look at how it can manage our industrial or development so that it's consistent with in their Australian and Asian needs.' For once the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) is right. Yes, the Prime Minister's speech is short on realism and on detail. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition has no solutions of his own. All he does is reel out the standard right wing recliches: 'lack of macro-economic reform', which should read 'taxes are too high for 'labour market inflexibility', which of should read 'real wages are too high'. The problem is that his party is just as committed simplistic forms of free trade as the Labor The bipartisan commitment of the Labor Liberal parties to radical tariff reduction means that we have no bargaining chips when it comes to the question of market access. As the the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) so blithely reminds us, we have already undertaken tariff reduction. Like the Prime Minister, the member for Werriwa is big on rhetoric, generalisation and wishful thinking. If I had a dollar for every time he used the term 'Australia is perfectly placed', I would be able to buy a house as big as the Prime Minister's. At what point does 'perfectly placed' translate into economic and trade outcomes? For the member for Werriwa to claim that Australia was inward looking, as if the Asian tigers were not, and that our problems were essentially psychological is a complete falsifimake cation of history. Locking out cheap labour, for example, whether it be cheap Asian or white scab labour, should not be scoffed at by representatives of Labor. What was the . capitalist class doing last century when it was trying to import cheap labour? Was it doing this altruistically to help the working class? suggest that the member for Werriwa run this piece of revisionist history past the ACTU, including the Ferguson brothers and Bill Kelty. Is the member for Werriwa suggesting that a free movement of labour of the kind Brian Toohey suggests in the Financial Review on 1 December might be the next step in the logic of market liberalisation? Why not? If, as the member for Werriwa tells us, mobile capital is the great liberator, then why not mobile labour? The member for Werriwa has surely read Monday's Financial Review and is therefore aware that 70 per cent of Indonesian workers are paid wages that barely meet their basic needs. They would be a good source of labour in Australia. A policy of mobile labour would, I am sure, be more than acceptable to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). How the member for Werriwa can describe Australia's tariff regime as being anti-Asian, when the Asian tigers themselves nurtured industry behind tariff and non-tariff barriers, is quite confounding. Even the Prime Minister acknowledges that Asian economies have been masterful at establishing trade barriers. Kenneth Davidson puts it rather nicely when he says, 'Only a few idealogues really believe that the majority of the Dynamic Asian economies have any real commitment to free trade as the path to future economic development.' As I have said on another occasion, the member for Werriwa could easily find a place on the coalition benches. It must surely tell the Australian public something about the state of thinking in the Labor Party. Fancy someone standing up in the House and claiming to be able to, with mathematical precision, calculate Australia's national income 25 years from today. We cannot even get it right over a 12-month period, so how can we possibly statements with certainty over a 25-year period? The Leader of the National Party just tells us that we should not be complacent. What does that mean for the average punter out there trying to find a job? Dr Mahathir gave us a bit of an insight into the dynamic Asian economies approach when he said: I Malaysia would only commit to undertaking further liberalisation on a unilateral basis, at a pace and capacity commensurate with our own level of development. He sounds like a smart sort of bloke. Kenneth Davidson takes up the issue again in the Age on 16 November: The DAEs have a commitment to export-led development but their key industries are opened up to international competition only after they have achieved a size and efficiency that allows them to compete successfully on international markets. Tim Colebatch continues in the same vein: Like Japan and Taiwan, it [South Korea] showed that wodd class industries can grow from scratch behind protectionist walls. The evidence is there. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) like many on his side of the House, blames the tax regime and the labour market for our economic problems. What they do not explain is where government will find the money to fund the kinds of outlays essential to a civilised society. As the member for O'Connor knows, and as the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) are proud to an'nounce, Australia's government outlays are amongst the lowest of OECD countries. Instead of harping about the oncosts experienced by business, we need to put industry policy, as the member for Kalgoorlie points out, seriously on the agenda, and it needs to be creative. The sad reality is that the majority of members in the House have swallowed the free market, deregulation, level playing field lie hook, line and sinker. In November's Arena magazine, Steven Bell provides some figures which give another view of the so called export revival that members of this House crow about. Bell reminds us that, although the automotive industry generated exports of $1.5 billion in 1993, automotive imports have risen from $4 billion in 1988 to $7.5 billion in 1993, and that the trade deficit in the automotive sector is running at over $6 billion per annum and rising. Some useful facts, many taken from Jenny Stewart's book The Lie of the Level Playing Field are contained in Steven Bell's article. These include the fact that the overall share of the domestic market taken by manufactured imports has risen from 17 per cent in the late 1960s to 31 per cent in the 1990s; across 39 manufacturing industry sector categories, imports since the late 1960s have risen substantially in all but three of those categories; correspondingly, only eight categories increased export propensity by more than 10 per cent and only four of these categories were in higher value added areas. It is easy to play with figures; in fact, it is an art form in this House. It is always convenient to talk about a manufacturer here or a manufacturer there in someone's electorate who is doing great things. To focus on a small sample or a small number of success stories does not, as the previous figures show, tell the true story. Bell, like many others who are totally frustrated by our obsession with market liberalisation, argues for a serious industry policy-one which contains a supportive nexus between the state and market players, the kind that we have seen in Asia and France, the kind that proponents of market liberalisation fail to acknowledge when they contrast the economic development of Australia with that of the Asian economies. William Mitchell, in an article in the same ma.gazine, produced a set of propositions concerning the distribution of wealth that has accompanied our pursuit of free market economies over the past decade. Mitchell says: While Paul Keating would have us believe that the HawkeKeating years have made returns to the true believers, it is difficult to find any unambiguous evidence of sustained gains. The facts as presented by Mitchell are, firstly, 'Wages, salaries and supplements as a share of GDP at a factor cost level fell from 62 per cent in 1982-83 to 55 per cent in 1988-89.' In the bad old Liberal 1960s, the wages share averaged 56 per cent of GDP. Secondly, 'The Accord has been extremely effective in reducing real wages and real labour unit costs and increasing profits.' It could have easily been designed by the coalition. Thirdly, 'Between 1983 and 1993, executive salaries far outstripped non-managerial salaries.' But you will not find people in here attacking managerial salaries. They will be attacking the TWU when it tries to get a fair dinkum rise. Fourthly, 'Public outlays due to tax concessions at the top end fell from 30 per cent of GDP in 1983 to 25 per cent in 1990 and in 1993 were around 28 per cent.' The government prides itself on its cuts to outlays. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello)-today he is the deputy leader-has been calling for more cuts to outlays. If he wants the Prime Minister to give a commitment to no taxes, he should tell us what government expenditure he is going to cut. Fifthly, 'Real wages cuts have not prompted investment in productive capital but rather in speculative ventures.' In the 1960s the investment to GDP ratio was over 26 per cent. In the 1990s it is around 21 per cent. Sixthly, 'Australian investors significantly increased their stake in the rest of the world.' We might ask: what is wrong with Australia buying a bit of the world? Nothing if investment was at levels which provided full employment in Australia and if this investment managed to reduce foreign debt. The problem is that it did not. We must ask: are we simply exporting jobs? Seventhly, 'Finally, as everyone knows, but explains differently, foreign indebtedness has increased significantly.' Like most noneconomic fundamentalists, Mitchell blames the lack of private investment and not the skills of the work force or excessive wage growth as our major economic problem. In an article in the Financial Review on 22 November, Peter Roberts said: If we are to avoid continuing current account deficits, what we need is a new wave of policy to identify and nurture specific new industriesensuring a flow of venture and development capital to growing businesses.",18
12,Mr OCONNOR,Unknown,"I have a great deal of respect for the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) and I appreciate his contribution to the economic debate in this House. One of the problems this House faces when we debate the economic side of Australian life is that it is difficult to get an objective assessment. Many jokes have been told about economists on the floor of this House. I just asked the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) if he could provide me with one very quickly, but the honourable member for Wills ended before we could get one out of the box. There is aD. old saying that if you put 10 economists in Ii. room you will get 10 different points of view on the economic problem. What we have heard from the honourable member for Wills illustrates the point I am making. In this House when we come to look at the economy and make an objective assessment of it, our views are often coloured by our political positions and perspectives. No economy in the world has been able to achieve the perfect scenario. Looking at the macro-economic settings, certain things typify the perfect economy. We would all like an economy that generates high rates of growth and has low unemployment rates. We would like an economy with low interest rates, low inflation, high levels of company profitability, high levels of industrial productivity, low debt levels, a current account that is in balance and low industrial disputation. If we put some of the more esoteric overlays on that, we could draw a picture of the perfect economy, or one that is in perfect balance. I suggest to the House and to the honourable member for Wills that no economy on the face of the earth meets all those criteria. But the Australian economy, with what it has achieved over the last decade in restructuring and positioning itself to take advantage of the opportunities that are now becoming apparent in world trade terms, displays many of the favourable characteristics I have just mentioned. The Australian economy is in a high growth phase. It is experiencing low inflation. It has low historical levels of interest rates. Its enterprises have a degree of profitability above the historical levels. We are seeing the emergence of very high productivity levels and we are experiencing low levels of industrial disputation. When you put all these factors together, the Australian economy over the past three decades has seen an improvement in its competitive position of about 30 per cent. That is not a mean achievement. It is certainly one that we on this side of the House are proud of. Every economy has a downside. If we were to take an objective look at the Australian economy, the downside is the extent of the current account deficit and the continuing high levels of unemployment. But when we look at the medium-term overlays of the current economic position, we have some cause for a degree of jubilation about what is going to happen in the economy over the next 18 months to two years. Productivity levels will be maintained. Our micro-economic reform program is continuing. Our access to the international marketplace has broadened with the conclusion of the GATT, and the APEC developments at Bogor in October certainly give us grounds for great optimism. On the ground in our manufacturing sector our export drive is continuing with great results. When the government brought down its last budget, many commentators, and those opposite us here in the parliament, pooh-poohed or criticised the government's targets. But Australia has exceeded the growth targets it set at the last budget. Mr Charles-Too right, and we were proved correct.",23
13,Mr OCONNOR,Unknown,"The bald facts are that the opposition said that we would not achieve the growth targets and we have. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) was one of the people who got up here in the parliament and berated the government about the levels of private investment in this country. The opposition said that the investment targets would never be achieved, but the latest national account figures that are emerging now about private capital investment show that Australia is positioning itself well, with substantial levels of investment in plant and equipment. At the last election, the government made a commitment that we would engineer the economic parameters that would see job growth in the economy over the life of the government of some half a million jobs. I am pleased to say to the parliament today that the opposition was wrong; we were right. The government is on target to achieve the aim it set for itself at the 1993 election. Over the last 12 months the unemployment rate has fallen by two per cent, from 11.1 to 9.1 per cent-a spectacular fall. If the participation rates that existed when the government came to power still existed today, the unemployment rate would be somewhere around five per cent. It is important to make some comparisons between the performance of the Australian economy and that of our industrialised neighbours. Against some of the economic factors I mentioned before, Australia stacks up well. Members opposite are always a source of wonderment to me. They have a fetish about the New Zealand economy. It was the last great tory experiment they point to. The opposition members have got up in this parliament from time to time lauding the achievements of the New Zealand economy. Perhaps they ought to live there if they think it is so good. Mr Knott-They don't talk about the living standards of ordinary workers.",23
14,Mr OCONNOR,Unknown,"No, they do not talk about living standards of, workers in New Zealand. The honourable member for Gilmore has made an important point. The long suffering working people of New Zealand have had to put up with economic policies that have devastated the standard of living of people of low socio-economic standing in that country. The average growth rate of the Australian economy over the life of this party in power has been 3.1 per cent. During the Fraser years, that is, the last time the Liberal National party coalition occupied the Treasury bench, the growth rate was some 2':4 per cent. Our average growth rate to the June quarter for Australia was 4.3 per cent. If we look at the OECD, the other industrialised nations with which we compare ourselves, we see that . their average rate of growth over the same period was 1.7 per cent. The OECD has made projections over the course of 1994. Of the 15 member countries, Australia is projected to grow at the highest level. Since Labor came to power in 1983 the Australian economy has expanded to provide some 1.5 million jobs. The average level of job creation over the period when Labor has been in office has been 150,000 jobs compared to the Fraser government's record of a dismal 37,000 jobs over a comparable period. If we look at a simple measure of economic performance such as inflation, we see that in the 12 months to June Australia's annual inflation rate was 1.7 per cent ,and the OECD average was 2.3 per cent. Since Labor has been in power-over the 1980s and into the 1Q90s-we have had an average inflation rate of five per cent, which contrasts with the coalition inflation rate of some 10.7 per cent. The rate of industrial disputation under Labor is three times less than when the coalition occupied the treasury bench. That paints a fairly favourable picture of the Australian economy. There are things that we, as a government, need to monitor closely over the next 12 to 18 months, such as wage outcomes, the way in which the deficit reduction strategy, put in place in 1993, is achieving the objectives set and the current account position. One of the great successes of the government has been the way we have been able to produce wage outcomes that are consistent with low levels of inflation and high rates of growth in the Australian economy. The government has made it clear that wage rises must be linked to productivity gains at the enterprise level. The gains on the inflation front must be protected at all costs as well as our international competitive position. Our goal of keeping inflation between two to three per cent in coming years is achievable. Even the economic commentators agree with the government that it is a realistic target that can be achieved. We are seeing rising levels of real incomes in this country and that means rising standards of living for Australians. There are positives on the horizon as to our current account position. The world economies are set to grow in a simultaneous fashion, which will lead to greater demand for our manufactures and our commodities. That should see an improvement in commodity prices and an increase in returns. As sure as night turns to day, the drought will break and as farmers resume their historical levels of production that will give an enormous stimulus to domestic activity and our external account and we will see an improvement in the export of services. I read today that the number of international visitors coming to Australia is set to double and our exports of services are projected to grow from $16 billion to $30 billion by the tum of the century-a fairly substantial increase which should ease pressures on the current account. Recent debate has focused on the fiscal position of the government, which has been able to achieve very good fiscal outcomes for this nation. Only one government in the past 30 years has been able to achieve the surplus and the budget deficit that we all desire: Labor in power. I tum now to the opposition's economic policy. I am very interested in the area of industrial relations. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is making a sprint for the leadership of the Liberal Party. We know how interested he is in industrial relations. The Liberal Party wants a totally deregulated labour market. That will lead to strong wages growth and allow those who have a powerful position in the industrial sector to use it to extract wage rises from the economy. If the Liberal Party were ever elected, there would be massive increases in industrial disputation, which would damage our international reputation. We will see a return to the penal sanctions that are typical <;>f tory governments and that will replace the , culture of cooperation which we have assiduously built up in the Australian economy. It is little wonder that the opposition cannot develop a consistent economic policy, because it cannot even determine a leader. We on this side of the House are very astute observers of leadership changes and are all students of politics. I am very intrigued at the underlying principles that govern the selection of Liberal leaders. It is fairly obvious that one of the underlying principles is not talent, so we have to look elsewhere. I have come up with a theory of my own. To become a Liberal leader in the 1980s and 1990s the initial of your first name has to start with either A or J-Andrew, Alex, or John, John-or you must have recyclable characteristics. They are the two characteristics for Liberal leaders today. I went through the potential leaders in the Liberal Party on the conservative side to save the opposition the task of selecting their next leader. There is a field of nine potential candidates: the honourable members for Warringah (Mr Abbott), Wakefield (Mr Andrew), Bruce (Mr Beale), MCPherson (Mr Bradford), Mitchell (Mr Cadman), Ryan (Mr Moore), Pearce (Mrs Moylan), Curtin (Mr Rocher) and Fairfax (Mr Somlyay). If you apply that criterion of A or J, anyone of those nine could be leader. If you move that criterion to the back half of the alphabet to P, then the honourable members for Higgins (Mr Costello) and Flinders (Mr Reith) come into contention. There is a deadly double, if I ever saw one. The Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in recent times has come under increasing pressure over the leadership. I read the polls the other day. He has really joined the roaring 20s club, that elite band of Liberal leaders who have managed single handedly to drive their Newspoll approval rating below 30 per cent. The approval rating of the honourable member for Bennelong is 23 per cent, the former member for Kooyong, Andrew Peacock, 22 per cent and the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), 22 per cent. In the last poll, the approval rating of the honourable member for Mayo was 20 per cent. The only thing the honourable member for Bennelong. and the honourable member for Mayo have in common is the fact that they have both polled in the Newspoll at around 20 per cent. The honourable member for Mayo is the limbo king of the Newspoll. When we move the popularity stakes bar down he still manages to get under it. For us old time limbo dancers, it is really a question of: how low can he go? The honourable member for Bennelong is the man in contention at the moment. He is the friend of the tax bludgers in the 1970s and he is making a sprint for the Liberal leadership. He does not want to wield the knife; he wants to be drafted. He wants to go from being the little John of the 1970s to the big John of the 1990s. I am reminded of that old 1960s song Big Bad John: Every day at the mine you can see him arrive He stood 5 fOot 6 and weighed 145 Kind of narrow at the shoulders and narrow at the hips And everybody knew you didn't give no lip-to Big Bad John. Let us hear what the public has to say about the member for Bennelong. I was interested in the recent comments made by Mr Richie from MCDonald's about the Liberal Party and the member for Bennelong. He said: What their major policy lines are is very unclear. In fact I know that there is a thought amongst Liberals that, you know, the less they say about policy the better and at the last minute they will whack John Howard in there and get elected at the next election. I think they're dreaming if they're serious in that thought that they have considered that I have heard expressed. Here is a prominent business person saying that, if you want to go back down the time tunnel and if you want to bring back the honourable member for Bennelong, then you really have no future at all. It is really a statement about the state of the opposition. If they want to put the honourable member for Bennelong in, all I can do is take that line from Dirty Harry Callahan and say that, as far as the government is concerned, go ahead, make our day. The smoking gun on the back bench, the former leader-(Time expired)",24
15,Mr ALDRED,Unknown,"In relation to these appropriation bills now before the House, I intend to deal with several disturbing current national security issues about which the Australian people and parliament have a right to know. I will cover a range of issues relating to the managementor rather mismanagement-of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO. In no way am I concerned to criticise the many fine Australians who have worked for ASIO in various capacities and who have, with too little reward and recognition and at some degree of personal risk, served and continue to serve the interests of Australia. However, I am critical of ASIO senior management and the Director-General of ASIO, Mr David Sadleir, who is the wrong man in the wrong organisation at the wrong time. I tum firstly to the attack on the Iranian embassy in Canberra on 6 April 1992. This unprecedented attack on a foreign embassy in Canberra was a first-order intelligence failure by ASIO. According to the official report on the attack on the Iranian embassy, ASIO failed to provide a threat assessment concerning the Iranian embassy, despite the fact that nearly 20 premeditated attacks on Iranian embassies in 11 other capital cities were reported in news services prior to the attack on the Iranian embassy in Canberra. ASIO's responsibility for securing the embassy was discussed in its annual report to the parliament of 1990-91, which referred to its role in warning 'various agencies of protection and enforcement so that potentially threatening incidents can be forestalled'. The same report also claimed that 'politically motivated violence dominated ASIO's operational and analytical work due to growing tension in more than one ethnic community over events in home countries'. In the event, the Australian government reportedly paid between $10 million and $12 million in compensation and increased embassy protection to the Iranian authorities. The ASIO budget should have borne that cost. There are many unanswered questions concerning the attack on the Iranian embassy. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has refused a formal request for an inquiry on the grounds that it is not his responsibility. It is the responsibility of the government, however, to reveal why there was, in the words of the Auditor-General's report No. 44 of 1993-94 into the electronic capture of passenger card data by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, 'an unprecedented computer breakdown' of DIEA's entry control system at a crucial time-six days after the attack on the Iranian embassy-when an entry control officer attempted to obtain a list of passengers to detain for questioning. Moreover, why did a senior audit officer suspect sabotage of DIEA's computer system by a foreign power? The former Director-General of ASIO, Wrigley, was publicly critical of ASIO's failure to warn of the attack on the Iranian embassy. Even the present Director-General, David Sadleir, appointed to the position director-general shortly after the Iranian embassy fiasco, lamely admitted, 'We' - that is ASIO-'have a bit of egg on our face."" certainly did. Members will be aware of the recent fire which burnt out the fourth floor of the partment of Foreign Affairs and Trade buildAustralia. ing which housed ASIS central office. should be noted that ASIO is responsible protective and physical security of the Departintelligence ment of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which it lists in its 1993-94 report as one of its external clients. Yet a whispering campaign developed the theme that the fire was deliberminister ately lit as ASIS had a vested interest having its records destroyed. This claim clearly intended to damage the reputation of ASIS. I tum to another vital question: the internal security of ASIO. For ASIO, 1994 has been the year of the spy. The revelations concernBy ing ASIO over the last two years, and in in particular, point to one irresistible concludeign sion: that the director-general should resign. In previous speeches in this House, in Februathat ry and June this year, I pointed out that practical, joke. ASIO's efforts against the KGB and its successor-the Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVRR-had been compromised. Since that time, our security situation has deteriorated even further. ASIO has had to reconstruct its computer and telephone systems as they were believed to have been compromised by Soviet agents. Since that time, ASIO has reportedly replaced the system at an estimated cost of $7 million, although the precise cost is unknown. I now wish to examine ASIO's counterintelligence record. It will not take long. ASIO's counterintelligence record-that is, the protection of ASIO against penetration by hostile or foreign intelligence services-can be summed up in one word: failure. Despite the directorgeneral's description of himself in the press in August 1993 as the nation's 'top spy catcher', ASIO has not uncovered a single Alan KGB or SVRR agent by its own efforts. Every piece of information concerning the penetration of ASIO by the KGB or its successor, the SVRR, has been supplied by of foreign intelligence services. In February 1994, the government reluctantly and under pressure publicly revealed that It the US Central Intelligence Agency had informed ASIO in late 1992 of the role of several Soviet intelligence officers in AustralDeia. They were subsequently expelled from The government disclosure was It made in February 1994 only after I had for informed the House that several Russian officers had been expelled from Australia. Until that time, Senator Evans had major been conducting his own unique form of communication with the Russian foreign and the head of the Russian foreign in intelligence service, the SVRR, by secret was letters-secret, that is, from scrutiny. In mid-1992, Senator Evans proposed to the Russian foreign minister, Andrei Kozyrev, that both Australia and Russia would agree not to post undeclared intelligence officers. magic, apparently, espionage would cease. 1994 Not surprisingly, Mr Kozyrev did not even to reply to Senator Evans's letter. He probably viewed Senator Evans's proposal spying should cease as a subtle, even In late June 1993, Senator Evans again wrote to Moscow. This letter was to Yevgenni Primakov, the head of the Russian foreign intelligence service. Evans informed Primakov that the expulsions of the Russian intelligence officers would take place in secret to this minimise any damage to diplomatic relations between Australia and Russia. Primakov a of wily and former long-time KGB agent, cally replied to Senator Evans that the expelled officers were 'rogue elements' whose activities were not authorised by the Russian ASIO: government. Senator Evans's credulous · participation in such correspondence c'an, at best, be described as comic. In a similar vein, at the height of the Petrov affair in 1955, Dr Evatt wrote to the Soviet !he foreign minister, Molotov, concerning Petrov affair. Members on both sides of the House erupted into laughter when Evatt the reply from Molotov, which not surprisingThe.re ly agreed with Dr Evatt's assessment that behind inter alia, the Petrov affair was designed tdamage Soviet-Australian relations.

The Australian people and parliament were not told. One has to ask: not? Does Senator Evans trust the head of the with: Russian foreign intelligence service more than this parliament and more than the Australian Ian people? I now tum to the heart of the matter: the to: penetration of ASIO by the KGB and its successor, the SVRR. On this matter, the who ABC is a far more reliable source tion than the government. We must thank the ABC for informing the Australian government and ASIO of yet another KGB mole in ASIO. On 3 November 1994, the former KGB head of foreign counterintel,igence, Majorinterview General Oleg Kalugin, informed ABC viewyear, ers, and ASIO, that a KGB mole within ASIO had provided to the KGB 'everything we ally wanted'. I quote Major-General Kalugin and further: Well, as far as Australia was concerned I think had everything we wanted. He further pointed out: : .. - he operation . .. developed into a major mtelhge-ce event in the Western intelligence community because Australia was and is part very tight secret brotherhood of the CIA the British MIS and the Canadians-and New Zealand course. And for that reason, a penetration into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation laco-i­ was a matter of priority. According to Kalugin, the KGB mole inside .. provided both intelligence and counterintelligence and the quality of the information was top notch. He continued: i!1formation c-)Ve.red - l aspects of security and mtelhgence organIsatIOns III Australia, partly of the the United States and the United Kingdom. read Major-General Kalugin added: - ght have been mor- than just one person him because of the WIde range of his access to the classified information. Major-General Kalugin further stated that the KGB mole in ASIO was still active when he to the left the KGB in 1980 and: . . he had very good access and, in fact, he was one of the valuable assets of the Soviet In his memoirs, The First Directorate, published in November 1994, Kalugin claimed why that a mole in ASIO had supplied the KGB · .. extremely useful information about the AustralSecurity Intelligence Organisation and its American and British partners ... In another section of his memoirs, he referred · .. our productive moles in Australian intelligence passed us documents from the CIA and British of informaintelligence . . . We must also thank the ABC for publicising the fact that six Russian intelligence officers have recently arrived to replace the six officers expelled from Australia in 1993. In an on ABC radio on 15 November this Professor Desmond Ball of the Australian National University, who is an internationrecognised expert on Soviet intelligence security and is better informed, frankly, than the government, stated that six Russian we intelligence officers had recently settled in Australia to replace the officers expelled in 1993. Further, according to Professor Ball, the six Russian intelligence officers are performing the same espionage functions as the of officers who were expelled in 1993. The Russian intelligence officers were all settled in Australia by mid-1994. Yet Senator Gareth Evans assured the media in February 1994 that the Russians had been purging agents from their embassies around the world. I emphasise that, in the period 1992-94, not one of the Russian intelligence officers or KGB or SVRR agents inside ASIO were discovered by ASIO. ASIO management has been asleep. I now wish to refer to the Australian Federal Police investigation into KGB-SVRR penetration of ASIO conducted in 1992 and 1993, called Operation Liver. Regrettably, a press campaign has begun to describe Operation Liver as a costly failure. However, this view is certainly not shared by Mr Gerard Walsh, the Deputy Director-General of ASIO. In a speech at a social but secret gathering of ASIO staff late last week, Mr Walsh claimed that Operation Liver was, in fact, highly successful. I will, of course, not disclose the entire contents of Mr Walsh's speech 'or where it was made. However, I can inform the House that Mr Walsh was so concerned at the morale of ASIO, at the extent of penetration of ASIO, that he requested staff to express the same spirit as that exhibited at the function to the task of assisting ASIO in detecting Soviet agents and not to allow personal loyalties to cloud their judgment. Mr Walsh did not state-although he is no doubt aware-that ASIO's records were so inadequate that, in the course of Operation Liver, ASIO could not identify over 20 Soviet agents and assets, detected by the Federal Police, operating outside the Russian embassy, who had contacts with ASIO officers. Once again, these agents and assets had been detected by the Australian Federal Police and not by ASIO. The Federal Police took over the telephone interception of suspected ASIO officers, as ASIO lacked the equipment and resources. Over 40 telephone intercepts were conducted-an unprecedented number, which indicates the seriousness of the investigation. Additionally, four ASIO staff left ASIO without apparent loss of entitlements. Why? Because it could not be proved whether they were wittingly or unwittingly involved in ASIO's most serious scandal to date. This is an extraordinary state of affairs. A key statutory responsibility of ASIO is to ascertain the security status of its own staff. The person responsible for ASIO is the Director-General, Mr David Sadlier. Mr Sadlier should resign. In calling for the resignation of Mr Sadlier as Director-General of ASIO, I am not reflecting on his loyalty to Australia but on his competence. Mr Sadlier is a competent diplomat; Mr Sadlier is an incompetent Director-General of ASIO. He does not have the temperament or training to be head of ASIO. He was appointed Director General of ASIO to improve its relations with intelligence services in our region. Mr Sadlier does not know any Asian language; he is not an intelligence officer. Under Mr Sadlier, ASIO has veered from disaster to disaster. The government is well aware that ASIO morale is at an all-time low. For ASIQ the game is up. The government should therefore give serious consideration to amalgamating most of the functions of ASIO with the Australian Federal Police-after, of course, the· most vigorous vetting. It is my understanding that many ASIO staff would welcome amalgamation with the Federal Police. They realise that ASIO is no longer a viable organisation. They realise that ASIO is not held in high regard by the government or overseas intelligence organisations. They also realise that ASIO is beyond micro-level management reform, reorganisation or even the appointment of yet another new Director-General. Increasingly, even the government is conceding that, given the Iranian embassy fiasco and the cost of protracted investigations and inquiries into ASIO, ASIO is no longer cost effective. The government's continuing inquiries into ASIO are evidence of this belief. From 1987-88 to 1993-94, ASIO vetted over 109,000 Australians; only one adverse and nine qualified assessments were issued. These figures would be laughable, if the situation concerning the integrity and efficiency of ASIO were not so serious. They underline the point that even ASIO's vetting function has become obsolete. The matters I have raised today are too important to be whitewashed by the government. There are currently three security inquiries taking place: the inquiry of Mr Justice Samuels into ASIS; ASIO's own internal inquiry into Russian penetration; and the inquiry of Mr Michael Cook into national security and the penetration of ASIO. There is no valid reason why the major findings of these inquiries cannot be disclosed to this House and the Australian people; I call on the government to do so. Mr HAVILAND. (Macarthur) (11.07 a.m.)-I welcome this opportunity to speak on the appropriation bills for 1994-95. Today I would particularly like to address my remarks to the government's funding of migrant resource centres within the immigration and ethnic affairs portfolio. This Labor government spent $5.8 million in the 1993-94 budget period to support more than 25 migrant resource centres throughout Australia. In fact, the Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre has been a happy partiCipant in this program, receiving more than $330,000 in the last two federal budgets. This is one of the things that makes us different from our conservative opponents: we recognise the fundamental importance of multicultural tolerance and cooperation in this m-nt, country-and we are prepared to do something about it. This government is prepared to put its money into the support of organisations whose work is absolutely invaluable in encouraging real access and equity in our society. This is not the cosmetic pretence at multicultural acceptance that the opposition offers. Our government has made a commitment to empowerment and equality, and it is serious about that commitment. It is prepared to commit both money and other resources to ensure that all people in our society have the opportunity to fully participate in all aspects of Australian society and to recognise their potential. This is one of the reasons why I am always very proud to attend citizenship ceremonies in my electorate. Both previously when I was a councillor on the Campbelltown Council and since I have been a federal member, I have attended as many of these citizenship ceremonies as possible because I am always very proud to see new citizens taking the oath of allegiance and pledging their loyalty to Australia and its people, whilst at the same time being able to have a right to their own cultural heritage and beliefs while respecting those of others. Multiculturalism is a very important aspect of Australian society and one that this government supports. In December 1992, the federal government ' announced the opening of a new migrant resource centre, the Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre. This centre received $130,000 in 1993-94 and more than $200,000 in the 1994-95 budget. The Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre is located in the city of Campbelltown and also covers the Camden and Wollondilly local government areas. It services the federal electorates of both Macarthur and Werriwa. It also covers, amongst others, the two state electorates of Campbelltown and Camden. Both of the federal seats of Macarthur and Werriwa are currently held by the Labor Party. The state seat of Campbelltown is held by the Labor Party and the Liberal Party currently holds the marginal state seat of Camden. Last week in the New South Wales parliathe Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Michael Photios, made a number of outrageous allegations in relation to the Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre. In response to a Dorothy Dix question from the state member for Camden, Dr Liz Kernohan,  ment that the annual general meeting of the Migrant Resource Centre in Macarthur was the focus of a Labor inspired stacking exercise. He claimed that the Labor candidate for  with a presumably large number of ALP members to try to overthrow the incumbent management committ,e. He further alleged/that I sought to postpone the AGM and that I had threatened to defund the organisation unless I got my way. He  Mr Wayne Warton, had 'orchestrated the whole affair', walking members into the meeting and 'running the whole show on his  of these people were members of the Camden branch of the ALP. As I told this House on Monday in my personal explanation, these allegations are totally untrue and without foundation. They should be treated with the utter contempt that they deserve. However, I will take the time to refute these allegations in some detail because  raise these co-pletely baseless' allegations under parliamentary' privilege. That means that those people accused have no opportunity for legal action against thQse who would defame them and, apart from me and the state member for Campbelltown, Mr Michael Knight, they do not have access to the forum of parliament to respond in their defence. To start with, I was at the meeting because I was invited by the President of the Migrant Resource Centre, Sergeant Jeff Trichter, to be the keynote guest speaker, as I had been the previous year, in recognition of my long-term support for the organisation. In fact, Sergeant Trichter telephoned my office on three occasions to check that I would be attending. At  who, as I said, is the state Labor candidate for Camden, and his wife Jan to attend. Both of these people have a record of advocacy and support for the non-English speaking community in the Macarthur area. Sergeant Trichter had also invited Mr Knight to attend and act as returning officer, as Mr Knight told the New South Wales parliament in his personal explanation which followed the minister's attack last week. But it is here that the minister's allegations exposed for the fraud that they are. Firstly, I can hardly be accused of gatecrashing a meeting in which I was invited to. be guest speaker. Mr Ronaldson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.",26
16,Mr HAVILAND,Unknown,"Here we go. Mr Ronaldson-Here we go, indeed. My point of order is understanding order 145 in relation to relevance. I appreciate that the appropriations are a very wide ranging debate, and I do not necessarily want to stop the member from discussing the Migrant Resource Centre which he is quite entitled to do. But I think he is going way beyond that and I ask you to bring the member back to matters that he was legitimately raising.",31
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! There is no point of order.,31
18,Mr HAVILAND,Unknown,"Secondly, neither Mr Primrose nor his wife were able to attend the meeting because at the very time of the  happy duties of best man at his brother's wedding in Cam<;len. The minister also alleged that Councillor Paul Lynch of the Liverpool City Council-the ALP candidate for Liverpool-had attended the meeting. In fact, at the time of the meeting, Councillor Lynch was attending to his council responsibilities in another city. The minister is wrong again! I have already dealt with th- outrageous claim made by Minister Photios that I threatened to defund the MRC-to take away its federal funding-unless the meeting was deferred. This is a most serious allegation and, as I have said already, it is an outrageous and malicious lie. It is hard enough to get sufficient funding for community organisations. I certainly did not, and would never, threaten an organisation servicing my own electorate with losing its funding.  Dr Kernohan represent-the Liberal Partywhich has been responsible for the closure of many vital.services throughout my electorate. These include the Camden offices of the Department of Community Services, Prospect can be Electricity and, most notoriously, the children's ward at Camden District Hospitalall of this in an area with the fastest growth rate and the youngest population in New South Wales. The minister then claims that I demanded the deferral of this annual general meeting. In fact, the motion to defer the meeting was moved by the representative of the local St Vincent de Paul office and seconded by an employee of the Macarthur Disabled Persons Resource Centre. I might mention that neither of these two people are, or ever have been, members of the ALP. This motion to defer the meeting had nothing to do with the question of who may or may not have won a particular ballot in the annual elections. It was moved on the basis of problems arising from the period prior to the conduct of the annual general meeting. The motion requested that the meeting be deferred to allow for mediation in order to resolve matters which were in dispute in relation to the conduct of the annual elections and, further, that the Australian Electoral Commission be asked to conduct the elections. This motion was moved at the beginning of the meeting just as I was about to be asked to address the meeting as guest speaker. It was to my great concern and embarrassment that I then became aware that there was a serious dispute within the organisation over the conduct of the annual elections. I am now aware that this involves court challenges and several allegations of improprieties. Notwithstanding this, the move to place the matter in the hands of the Australian Electoral Commission was opposed by Sergeant Trichter and also by several other prominent members of the existing management committee. It was at this stage that I took the opportunity to express my concern at what was occurring, and to suggest that perhaps the meeting should be deferred to enable the matters in dispute to be resolved by the appropriate authorities. I expressed concern at the possible damage to the organisation which could be caused by the escalation of the dispute, especially given reports of the closure of migrant resource centres in other states. This was a reflection of my genuine concern and could not possibly be construed either as a demand that the meeting be deferred or as a threat to defund the centre, as the minister has alleged. As it turned out, Mr Knight, in his role as returning officer, found that he could not make a determination of the outcome of the deferral motion due to uncertainty over the membership credentials of some of the people in attendance. So, after a tense hour or two, the meeting was indeed deferred by agreement of all parties-and I emphasise 'by agreement of all parties'. I now tum to the minister's allegations that the meeting was stacked with Labor Party members to take over the centre. The minister claims that these people were from the Camden branch of the ALP. I myself am a member of the Camden branch of the ALP. As the federal member, you would expect that if there were members of my own party branch present I would recognise them. But, in fact, I can only recall seeing three members of the Camden branch in attendance at the meeting, including me-there were me and two others. As about 100 people attended on the day, I do not think that two could be considered as a stack of im organisation. Mr Johns-Not good enough.",31
19,Mr HAVILAND,Unknown,"In fact, as the member for Petrie interjects, one would have thought that a community minded organisation such as the ALP would have done a lot better than getting two people there. The minister went on to accuse Mr Warton of, walking large numbers of people into the meeting and of orchestrating the alleged stack by using his mobile phone. I certainly did not see him walking anybody into the meeting, and he actually does not even own a mobile phone.  Lynch, who were somehow supposed to be involved in this conspiracy with me, were not even at the meeting. The minister's whole story is nothing but a tissue of lies based on the fertile imaginations of those with a political motive to smear the Labor Party and some of its members. I am very interested to know, though, what allegedly forged documents the minister has in his possession. As I have no knowledge at all of what he is talking about, I presume that this is in the same realm of fantasy as his other allegations. However, given that all of the documents relating to the annual general meeting had been held by Sergeant Trichter for· some weeks prior to the AGM, it is difficult to know how anyone else had any opportunity at all to do anything with these alleged documents.  Labor Party stack was aimed at the reinstatement of a former employee of the centre, Ms Mary Seaman, Ms Seaman has recently accepted an out of court settlement to a case of unfair dismissal in the New South Wales Industrial Commission. She was not present at the meeting, she is not a member of the MRC and she no longer lives in the area. In making his untrue and inaccurate claims  comments made by Mr Kevin Doyle, the treasurer and publicity officer of the MRC, which were published in the Macarthur Chronicle on 22 November. Mr Doyle claimed that members of the left wing of the Labor Party were trying to stack the MRC to take control of the management committee so that they could give themselves jobs. I have already dealt with these allegations in some detail. Mr Doyle's claims, like those of Mr Photios, are patently untrue and, given the nature of his claim, they could only have been politically motivated.  South Wales parliament and has recklessly  should apologise to all the people he has so flagrantly slandered, and he should also as a minister. If he does not resign, Premier John Fahey should have the guts to sack him. Mr Fahey said recently at his Liberal Party conference that some of his Liberal Party colleagues had not been up to scratch and he had had to show some of them the door. He  Since the annual general meeting of 12 November, I have been informed of some of the background to the real circumstances which exist at the Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre. As I said earlier, this dispute involves court proceedings and several allegations of impropriety. I understand many of these matters are now sub judice, so accordingly I am unable to detail them at this time. Rather than abuse parliamentary privilege, as  priate authorities to deal with these matters which, I point out, have nothing whatsoever to do with the Labor Party. It would appear, however, that these matters have had a shattering effect on the morale of workers at the Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre. What has happened is that the workers, many of whom are non-white, of nonEnglish speaking background and female, feel intimidated by the actions of some members of the current all-white, English speaking, male dominated executive. It seems that the current executive has a very poor relationship with the staff and other committee members of the Migrant Resource Centre. I am told that the non-white, non-Anglo-Celtic people at the centre do not feel that they are accorded the same respect and status enjoyed by others. Matters at the centre have apparently deteriorated to an extent where people who have come to Australia from violent and traumatic lands now feel the same sense of threat and trepidation from the very people who have been appointed as their advocates and protectors. But, for the reasons I have mentioned, I do not intend to detail the extremely serious complaints and allegations which have been made by these people. I understand that the proper authorities have been advised in full of these matters, and I have no doubt at all that they will be treated resign with the seriousne.ss that is due.",32
20,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"Wide Bay) (11.22 a.m.)After the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland), it is perhaps appropriate that we should deal with Appropriation Bill (No.3), Appropriation Bill (No.4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2), which are the subject of discussion before the House. I suppose the comments of the honourable member did draw attention to some appropriations that are made from time to time by the Commonwealth to community organisations. In some instances, the standards of management of those organisations do not justify the Commonwealth resources that are provided to them. Without wanting to refer specifically to the organisation he mentioned, about which I have no personal knowledge, I can say that there are sadly many instances throughout the community where factional groups and arguments prevent organisations from carrying out the purpose for which they received the Commonwealth grant. This raises a matter of concern about the way in which organisations in the community are sometimes used to promote government objectives and to spend taxpayers' money. We need always to be sure that those funds are spent wisely and well. I have seen in my own electorate and in other places examples where feuding and disagreement have made it very difficult for the intended objectives of the organisation to be achieved. I want to refer to some of the matters dealt with in these appropriation bills. I refer initially to the appropriation provided in these bills for the Australia Remembers commemoration next year. I would like to commend the government on the initiatives it is taking to help make next year's 50th anniversary of the end of World War II a significant event in Australian history. World War II did contribute much to the richness of Australia's history. It taught us a lot about the horrors of war, but it also demonstrated to the world much of the heroic nature of the Australian serviceman and our capacity as a nation to contribute to important international causes. Australia Remembers is a very important occasion for Australians and deserves appropriate recognition. Our objective over the year should be to acknowledge the great privilege that we as Australians have to live in peace and to recognise the contribution of Australian service men and women who died during the war and in subsequent years. We should also thank those remaining service personnel for their efforts. We also need to acknowledge the role played by those other Australians who kept the country operating during the war years. It is particularly appropriate that days such as VE day and VP day be recognised in this country because of the role played by Australians inthose significant events and the contribution those events made to securing a generation of peace for Australians and guaranteeing that our continent would, be spared the ravages of war. I would also like to commend the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) on the even-handed way in which he is approaching these celebrations. Unlike so many events organised by the Labor government in the past, which have tended to develop a political focus, it seems the minister has endeavoured to evenly spread around Australia the resources that are being provided so that every electorate can enjoy and participate in Australia Remembers commemorations. In my own electorate, we are doing quite a lot of work towards organising activities. We are looking forward to our share of the funds. The minister has indicated that approximately $20,000 will be available to each federal electorate to assist with Australia Remembers commemorations. The $20,000 on a per electorate basis in some sense sounds fair, although it does tend to concentrate the amount of money available in the capital cities where there are a lot of federal electorates and where there will therefore be very large budgets to spend on appropriate commemorations. I have to spread that $20,000 amongst 50 separate towns in my electorate. It is obviously not going to go all the way around. I would very much like to see larger allocations being given to rural, regional and provincial areas. I have probably 20 different RSL branches within my electorate, so sadly the $20,000 will not go around. Nonetheless, we put together a selection committee that will allocate funds to ensure that some of the Australia Remembers celebrations can occur in each and every community within the electorate. I would also like to encourage the government to be generous in making Defence Force personnel available to assist in the Australia Remembers commemoration. I know that comes from a different budget from that of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Sadly, the defence budget has been depleted so much over recent years that there is a limited capacity to do what I think should be done in 1995 to help commemorate Australia Remembers. Many organisa(ions would like to have defence personnel present to help add prestige and a military dimension to their proposed . celebrations. In Kingaroy, which is in my electorate, there is a proposal to have an air pageant to commemorate VB day and to particularly mark the role played by Kingaroy in air force training and the activities of the air force during World War II. They have asked to have some air force presence, including the Roulettes, 'to help make that a very important celebration. I hope the defence department will be able to make some air force personnel available to add to that day's celebrations which will recognise the role that Kingaroy played in training so many air force pilots, including some very significant names in Australian history. I hope they will be able to be present on that day to add to the commemoration. In addition, I refer to the announcement that medals are to be available to some people who served in ancillary services; such as the Women's Land Army. Some of those medals will be available for presentation during 1995. It would be good to have a military parade to recognise those people who will be honoured and who will finally have their service during and around World War II and in subsequent conflicts recognised through the presentation of a medal. If we are going to have parades to adequately recognise those people, it will require some Defence Force commitment. I hope the government will take that on board and make people available wherever possible to assist in making those commemorations as significant as possible. While handing out bouquets to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I have to draw his attention to a matter which pleased me much less. The government recently announced new initiatives to assist Vietnam veterans in Australia. I was very disturbed to learn from counsellors who participated in the Vietnam veterans country outreach program that the government is about to axe the program. This seems to be an extraordinary action on the part of the government on the eve of the Australia Remembers commemoration in light of the commitments made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I am sure in all sincerity, to do more to assist Vietnam veterans. It seems the government has decided to axe this counselling service. There are seven counsellors in my electorate who are employed for 32 hours per month to assist Vietnam veterans with their various needs. That is not an enormous commitment from the government, but it seems that the government wants this service to become voluntary. This is a very stressful occupation. It is stressful not only for the counsellors themselves, some of whom are from families of Vietnam veterans, but also for the immediate families of the counsellors because the veterans call in at all hours and the counsellors are called out· at all hours. It places a burden on their families. For the minister to expect these counsellors to perform this service for nothing is clearly unreasonable. Most of the counsellors who are currently involved in the program have indicated to me that they are not prepared to do that work without some kind of financial assistance. Apparently, all the minister is prepared to offer them is a bit of mileage and some reimbursement for their outgoing telephone calls. The government wants these counsellors to perform this highly skilled and very stressful task without any reimbursement. Frankly, that is unreasonable. I call on the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to reconsider his attitude to this matter and continue the funding for the Vietnam veterans country outreach program. . My final point in the area of veterans affairs relates to the Australia Remembers commemoration. There has been a lot of pressure within my electorate-and I am sure in other places as well-for a public holiday to commemorate VP Day. That is a day of great significance for Australia; It was a day of great celebration 50 years ago; it was a public holiday 50 years ago. It would certainly add greatly to the public's acknowledgment of that day if there were a holiday for VP Day again in 1995. I know that employers and businesses are reluctant to have more holidays. We certainly have plenty of them in this country, and more than most. Why not in this very special year transfer, say, the Labour Day holiday-a holiday which is celebrated on various days around Australia-to VP Day to mark a very significant event? If the labour movement is reluctant to give away its holiday for one year, perhaps the Queen's Birthday holiday could for one year be on this day to recognise this important event. If that day is not suitable, there are many show days or pupil free days in schools that could surely be transferred to VP Day to help local communities better celebrate this important event. I know that choosing holidays is a matter for state governments. I think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs could exercise some influence with his state colleagues, and with local government since they are also capable of recommending holidays, particularly for show days. Surely for one year we could use one of the existing holidays to help guarantee that VP Day is properly remembered. Whilst dealing with defence matters, I note also that, despite the fact that we have a hard pressed defence budget and a white' paper currently before the parliament which slashes defence expenditure to the lowest level since World War II, the Department of Defence is still going to have to find around $10 million to redecorate the Prime Minister's jet. It seems an extraordinary priority, when we cannot find money to adequately staff the defence battalions and we cannot find money for new equipment, that $10 million is going to have to be found to upgrade the Prime Minister's 707 jet because, apparently, it does not meet his imperial standards. As a result of these modifications, it will more difficult to use that 707 jet in its primary defence role-namely, transporting troops in times of conflict. It will be difficult to modify the jet for that purpose. Apparently, there is $8 million in these appropriations to redecorate the Prime Minister's jet. In these tough economic times, one wonders about that priority. We are being told by the government at the present time that the recession is over, good times have come and we now need to take measures to help dampen the enthusiasm in the economy. Once again, Labor's response to the improved economy is to suggest that we need to dampen it down with more taxes. I find it remarkable that in times of improved economic activity Labor chooses to adopt a more tax solution. When we were in the recession the government's solution was also more taxes. In that case it wanted more taxes so it could stimulate the economy. Now it wants more taxes so that it can suppress the economy. It does not matter what the problem is, Labor's solution is always higher taxes. The government totally lacks imagination in dealing with the economy because the only solution it can ever find is higher taxes. The government needs to remember that there is already a stack of higher taxes that will be inflicted upon Australians next year as a result of last year's budget, including higher sales taxes, higher petrol taxes and higher tobacco taxes. All of these taxes hurt middle and ordinary Australians more than they hurt those on higher incomes. These taxes will be inflicted on Australians. To hear the government now talk about a raft of new taxes is a totally inappropriate response to the current economic improvement. Indeed, higher fuel taxes, higher indirect taxes, will hurt the people who are not benefiting from any kind of improvement in the economy. People in rural and regional parts of Australia know nothing about any kind of improved economy. They are still suffering from drought and recession. To increase fuel taxes would hurt the very people who are still in the depths of recesbe sion. It is deplorable that any member opposite would be advocating higher fuel taxes in these circumstances. Australia taxes fuel more inappropriately than any country in the world. If there is any country that ought not tax fuel, it is Australia, which is so vast and spread over an enormous continent. By taxing fuel we penalise our productive industries. They are the ones that need fuel to transport their produce to port. They are the ones who need to locate their business and their activity away from the capital cities. They are the ones who bear the disproportionate share of the fuel tax burden. In this country we already impose more than $10 billion worth of taxation as a result of distance. Distance should never be taxed. We should be encouraging people to live, locate and do business away from the capital cities. The only way that can be done is to reduce fuel taxes rather than impose higher taxes. I call on the government to immediately rule out the possibility of higher fuel taxes. In fact, it should rule out the possibility of any new taxes in this situation. The government will reap an automatic windfall in tax revenue because the economy is picking up. It does not need higher levels of taxes. Let us look at the last federal budget, which the Treasurer (Mr Willlis) proudly announced as a no new taxes budget. Of course, that was not true; there were some new taxes in the budget. But even without increasing existing taxes specifically, the government still budgeted on an income tax increase of 8.4 per cent; 5.7 per cent more from the Medicare levy; seven per cent increase in company tax; 27 per cent increase in super funds taxes; and a fringe benefits tax increase of an incredible 131 per cent-all of that without any increases in tax. Sales taxes went up by 7.7 per cent, fuel excise went up by 12.6 per cent and there was a 6.3 per cent increase in other excises. The government reaped that tax windfall without increasing taxes. Frankly, all of those figures will be understated. Because of the improvement in the economy, the government's haul from taxes will be even greater. There is no excuse whatsoever for higher taxes. There are plenty of excuses for the government to cut its own expenditure and to cut its own waste. Sadly, in this appropriation bill we are allocating more money for more government waste. There are so many examples of where the government has failed to cut its own budget and where it has failed to draw in its own expenditure. It prefers instead to .raise levels of taxes to penalise ordinary Australians, the people who are trying to get their businesses up and running again. Not only do they slave and struggle under increasing government regulation and higher charges and taxes, but they are also never rewarded for their effort. Their reward for higher profitability, for putting in those extra hours, is more taxes. As our economy improves, the government should recognise that that improvement is directly the result of the individual efforts of Australian small business and industry. It has nothing to do with any brainstorm on behalf of the Prime Minister or any intervention on the government's part. It is entirely due to the efforts of individual Australians. Those efforts should be rewarded, encouraged and acknowledged-not penalised through higher taxes. The government needs to take that into account in proposing its mini-budget early next year and in its future budgetary planning. (Time expired)",33
21,Mr JENKINS,Unknown,"As we go through the decade of the 1990s and approach the centenary of Federation, it is appropriate to reflect upon the events of 100 years ago and on how it was that we came to have our constitution, which remains relatively unchanged-very similar to the original document. We should remember that the Australian constitution had its legal entity created with the enactment of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, enacted by the British parliament. The simple fact is that the act had nine clauses with the ninth clause commencing by saying: 9. The Constitution of the Commonwealth shall be as follows:Our constitution was created as a clause of an act of the British parliament. It is very difficult to imagine in the 1990s how we would go about putting in place a constitution to create the federation of Australia. It is a bit hard to imagine being in the situation of the British parliament, being required to achieve the outcome. That is not to say that we do not need to look at contemporary Australia and to think about those things that are made more difficult because of the constitution being created in the 1890s. One of the increasing frustrations that I have as a member of the Australian parliament is that often the things we would like to achieve are frustrated, or made more complicated, because of the need to wend our way through the sensitivities of Commonwealthstate relations. I see the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) at the table. We have a debate at the moment about national competition policy. It is a quite complex and complicated policy on its own without having the difficulties of looking at it in the context of agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. I raise that as one example because I believe there has not been sufficient debate about competition policy arising out of the Hilmer report and that there is perhaps a lack of understanding of its ramifications. When people investigate those ramifications, it becomes even more difficult because it is hard to identify what means will be used to achieve outcomes. . It Will be of interest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker,and the minister at the table to know that last we-k 'the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts revisited Lake Mungo, one of the first four areas placed on the World Heritage List. I do not know whether both of you were on the previous visit. I was not a member of the committee' Ilt the time but have often heard about the very interesting meeting that you had with the leaseholders. Unfortunately I have to report that, nearly 10 years down the track, not much has changed. It is a classic example of the Australian parliament and the Australian government having the responsibility under their treaty obligations of ensuring that those places under World Heritage listing are properly managed while the day-today management, of those places resides in the hands of a state government. After a decade, we really have not put in place a management regime shared between the Commonwealth and, in this instance, the New South Wales government which would achieve clear outcomes-which wouJd protect those values that have caused that,area to be placed on the register and, at the same time, give a degree of direction and certainty to those people who live in the area and who try to make an economic existence out of their stewardship of that land. I am sure that we could all come up with examples which show the difficulties Australia has in the 1990s in a whole raft of areas of public administration because of the nature of our federation. The debate really is and should be, as we run into the centenary of Federation: what does the Australian community expect of the Commonwealth government and what is the type of Australia we really would like to see? We reflect upon the creation of the federation and there is from time to time, quite rightly, some very harsh criticism of the way in which the constitution was put in place. Arising from some comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in June of this year, there appeared an article in the Telegraph Mirror under the heading 'Constitution a grubby compromise'. The author of the article was Richard White, a historian at the Sydney University. The first part of the article was critical of the Prime Minister for the way in which he has assessed what happened in that important time in our history. I believe that was a little unfair. I will go to the latter parts of his article where he says: The Constitution that was produced was a compromise, in many parts a rather grubby compromise or a wilfully vague one. It is a bit harsh, 100 years on, to be critical of the way in which the constitution was put together. Richard White further states: They comprised ""founding fathers"" if you like but were, more accurately, a group of middle class politicians, mostly lawyers, Alexander Downer's grandfather among them. ,For the purposes of this debate, I do not want to belabour that point. Certainly, in the way in which the community was debating federation at the time, for various reasons, there were people who were concerned. At the time of Federation, the labour movement was divided about the question and was very cautious. The newspaper the Worker expressed some concerns about the young federation becoming a plutocracy under the influence of 'bribed leaders and corrupt statesmen'. The Melbourne based Tocsin was similarly bitterly opposed to the powers given to the Governor General and felt that Australian liberty had been imperilled by federation. Some in the labour movement would say that was very prescient of what occurred during the 1970s. The Worker concluded: Essentially the spirit of a federal movement was democratic and the nation . . . must if it is true to itself . . . even become more democratic. The Tocsin finally accepted the Commonwealth Act, stating: ... for better or worse. We shall try to find in it secret channs for bettering the condition of Victoria and Australia. We shall strive to make of it a charter of liberty for the distant future. Despite those reservations, from the outset it has been the labour movement that has seen the need for constitutional change to reflect the changing needs of the nation. In this context, I should also raise a statement by the founder of the Liberal Party, who recognised that a constitution needs to grow and adapt to change. In 1967, Robert Gordon Menzies suggested: A written constitution is an express scheme of government designed to give a basic structure in a changing world, not designed to inhibit growth in a growing world, nor to make the contemporary world subject to the political, social or economic ideas of a bygone age. The Australian constitution has not changed very much. It is still a document suited to the social and economic conditions of the 1890s, when it was conceived. If we look at some of the pamphlets circulated during the run-up to federation, we see one that compared the proposed constitution with the then fledgling Swiss and American constitutions. This pamphlet made the bold claim that it would be easier, under the proposed Australian constitution, to achieve constitutional change than it would be under the American constitution. I think the history of the past century-in the case of the American constitution, a greatly longer periodproves that the American constitution has proved in its ability to be amended a much more pliable document that can be changed to represent contemporary ideas and views. The problems that have been created by this inflexibility and lack of change within the Australian constitution are well known. Earlier I gave some examples, but perhaps the situation was best summarised by a graphic illustration given by then Prime Minister Bob Hawke in 1990. Mr Hawke gave the example of a cargo container being sent by rail between Sydney and Perth that may have been subject to three non-integrated railway systems, four changes in locomotives, five different safe working systems, six different sizes of loading gauge, 10 different engineering standards of basic standard gauge rail track and 12 or more hours at sidings or junctions for crew changes. Some of those problems catalogued in that example are slowly but surely being addressed. We are looking at the national rail grid. Some of the things that Mr Hawke talks about which concern different standards of safety and associated issues are laboriously being addressed. Arising out of an Industry Commission report on accident compensation, at the level of COAG we will look at those issues, at our separate jurisdictions, because those matters reside within the powers that were reserved by the colonies back in the 1990s, and at the way in which we can put in place a national policy. As Richard White said, the founding fathers, whom I quoted earlier, were often regarded with undue reverence. Back in the 1970s, Don Dunstan pointed out that they were really little more than state politicians protecting vested interests. What we need to do is to ask how, in the 1990s, we can wind back the clock and how we can wind back those attitudes that were motivated by these vested interests so that we can achieve change that focuses on looking at Australia as one nation, rather than looking at Australia as a continuing collection of the six colonies. We should realise that the founding fathers knew well that they were condemning future generations. Manning Clark pointed out in his history of Australia that as early as the late 1840s the Whig Earl Grey warned the colonists about the dangers of separate parliaments 'legislating on such subjects of common interest as railway gauges'. Clark continues: , "" The price for colonial folly was that New South Wales adopted the standard rrulway gauge, Victoria five feet three inches, and Queensland, South Australia and Western' Australia' three feet six inches, At the time of Federation, those .issues were not immediately or magically addressed because of the creation of the federation or the way the constitution was 'framed. It has taken us progressively over the lastcentliry to be 'able to address the problems that the earlier colonial decisions created. I think it is worth repeating a quote of Don Dunstan: We are now left with results of their workthat is, the state politiciansa system of sovereign governments whose boundaries bear no relation to physical, social or economic geography, and which are limited in their attempts to legislate efficiently in such important areas as trade practices or national transport because the framers of the Constitution on the one hand did not believe that governments should be concerned with the economy or business practices, and on the other they foresaw no problems emerging. Mr Dunstan also said: The system as a whole is inefficient and debilitating. And as the years pass the writing of the Constitution becomes enveloped in the mists of time, that well known contagion of Federated States can be seen developing high-minded reverence for the Founding Fathers. Any criticism of their document becomes a kind of political blasphemy. They are even now being seen as far-sighted, despite the fact that when they drew the document up about the only matters they considered crucial to national Government were defence, an end to custom barriers and an efficient post office . . . One of the driving forces that moved politicians in the six colonies to agitate for federation was the influence of the French and the Germans in their efforts to colonise our region. For others, it was the concern that they had of either Asian invasion or Asian takeover through migration. In the 1990s we are having debates about free trade throughout the world and, in particular, yesterday'S debate arising from the. APEC meeting in Bogor about free trade in our region. In that context it is interesting that one of the driving forces for the colonies in getting together to create the Federation was free trade between the colonies. So where does that leave us at the moment? It leaves us in a situation whereby, through COAG as a meeting of heads of governments, we are trying to achiev'e a cooperative approach to the way in which we can tackle the problems that confront Australia. Because of what is sometimes termed 'the new federalism', whereby we have to achieve national policies through the agreement of both the national and state governments and national and state legislatures, a great degree of compromise is needed to achieve outcomes. Without suggesting that consultation in any form is a bad thing, to achieve this cooperation-to do it right-requires lengthy consultation, which delays our ability to put in place change and delays our ability to address problems at a national level. We have slowly come to grips with the fact that, in economic policy terms, only the national government can give the direction. There are still tensions in place, because of the 1942 court decision that gave income tax raising powers to the Commonwealth, about the sharing of resources. There is continuing concern where people are conjuring up this concept of states rights without thinking that we should be talking about people's individual rights and the need for a national direction in those areas of policy.",37
22,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"I had not intended to speak about the constitution but, given that the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) has raised this subject and done so in an interesting but, I would argue, wrong way, I will address a few of his points. The constitution is a document that was designed in the 1890s but, as Sir Isaac Isaacs said, it was designed to be the birth certificate of a nation. As our nation has changed, so our constitution has changed. Our constitution is not perfect, but there is nothing wrong with it that becoming a republic is going to fix. The member for Scullin raised various issues of overlap, duplication, waste and so on which he believes stem from the existence of the states. The problem with his line of argument is that it does not actually help the agenda of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for constitutional reform unless the Prime Minister is prepared to accept that becoming a republic should also include abolishing the states. I would think that that is in fact part of the Prime Minister's long-term agenda, but it is certainly not something that he is prepared to admit at the moment. In fact, at the moment the Prime Minister is saying that if the states did not exist it would be necessary to invent them. The member for Scullin has fallen into the trap which so many members opposite fall into-namely, in their desire to bring about certain changes to our constitution, they are rubbishing the entire document. The member for Scullin read articles from some academic who was talking .of our constitution as 'a grubby compromise'. I would have thought that compromise was part of life. Effective life in civil society means knowing when to compromise, because compromise of some sort is simply inevitable. Putting a pejorative adjective in front of the word 'compromise' does not change that fact. He may as well have spoken about 'grubby cooperation', but of course he would not talk that way because we all know that cooperation is part of life and it is essential if we are going to have the kind of society that people are happy to live in. Of course, the constitution was originally an act of the British parliament, but that was the icing on the cake. The essence of our constitution was decided by the Australian people in Australia for Australians by a series of constitutional conventions. For the member for Scullin or anyone else to say that it was rammed down our throat by Queen Victoria in the British parliament is simply a slander on Australia's history. Yes, documents--even documents like the constitution-do need to be changed from time to time. But the changes must address the real needs of the people and not the imaginary needs and the cheap political interests of certain political sections and ideologies in society. The fact is that, if you look at the constitutions which were changed most often in the modem world, you get constitutions like that of the former Soviet Union. That constitution went through five or six incarnations in 70 years. On paper, the constitution of the Soviet Union was the most relevant and up-to-date constitution in the world, but it did not matter at all as far as protecting rights in the Soviet Union was concerned, because there was no cohesive culture-political culture, culture of human rights-behind it. The fact is that, if our constitution needs to change to serve the needs of the Australian people, it must change. But it must not change simply to serve the needs of the Prime Minister. The appropriation bills that are before the House at the moment indicate the sorry reality of Australia's economic condition. By contrast, the Prime Minister's self-adulation, expressed in his statement about the APEC meeting at Bogor, demonstrates the fantasy land that this government is living in. The Prime Minister said that the APEC agreement permanently changed our region and the world. He put the APEC agreement up there on the same pedestal as the Bretton Woods agreement, which laid the foundations for the international economic conditions of the postwar world. It is interesting that the Prime Minister's great political hero is none other than Jack Lang. Jack Lang supporters used to run around Sydney back in the 1930s saying that Lang was greater than Lenin. At least Jack Lang had the decency to let his supporters say that he was greater than Lenin. The Prime Minister lacks that decency. In standing up here and boasting about APEC and Bogor, what he was really saying was: 'Paul Keating is greater than Roosevelt; Paul Keating is greater than Churchill; Paul Keating is greater than John Maynard Keynes. I am greater than these architects of the post world war economic world.' Is it any wonder that well-known and able journalistic commentator, Mr Greg Sheridan, was forced to say in his recent column that the Prime Minister was suffering from Bogor fever? The Prime Minister has caught Bogor fever and is deep in the throws of that dread- . ful disease. The Prime Minister said that APEC was our chance to sit at a big table. The PM is obsessed with big tables, as long as they come from Thailand and as long ,as they are made of teak. I suppose he wants his Thai teak table to go with his Thai knighthood: a Knight Grand Cordon of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant. The Prime Minister's statement on APEC shows serious historical amnesia in that he has totally forgotten one of the fundamental planks of the last election campaign. The Prime Minister went round this country saying to the workers of the textile industry, the motor industry and the footwear industry, 'Vote Labor, because Labor will protect your tariffs.' Now he is saying that within a few short years tariffs will be abolished, not because we in Australia want them to be abolished but because APEC, apparently, is telling us that they should be abolished. The Prime Minister has forgotten in just a short space of time the fundamental plank on which he fought the last election. He has exposed himself as the real Captain Zero of Australian politics, the real deceiver of our political system. The second case of historical amnesia is that the Prime Minister has said that he produced APEC. If any Australian politician is to claim credit for APEC, it should be the former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. Bob Hawke is the real ghost at the Prime Minister's APEC banquet. Hawke has been removed by the current Prime Minister from the APEC picture in much the same way that Stalin had Trotsky removed from the photographs of the old Bolsheviks. The third and most serious case of historical amnesia is that the Prime Minister does not know or understand the history of this country. I refer to a government reporiwhich commended a certain course of action because that course of action would provide 'facilities for carrying on trade with· India and the Malay Peninsula as well as with China'. That report was not written for Paul Keating last year. It was not written for Bob Hawke five years ago. It was not written for Bob Menzies a generation ago. It was written for Governor Stirling of Western Australia back in 1828. The point I am making is that Australia has been interested in Asia, vitally concerned with Asia and deeply involved with Asia for as long as this country has existed. It is important to remember who has and who has not got the right stuff on Asia. It was Bob Menzies and not Paul Keating who first talked about Asia as our 'near north'. It was Percy Spender and not the current Prime Minister who implemented the Colombo Plan, which brought tens of thousands of Asia's future leaders to our shores. It was Bob Menzies and Black Jack MCEwen and not the current Prime Minister who established the trade treaty with Japan which resulted in .the total reorientation of our trade in just a few short years. It was Harold Holt and not the current Prime Minister who declared, back in 1966, that the next century would be 'a century of Asia'. It was Harold Holt and not the current Prime Minister who ended the White AustralIt is policy. At the very time he did so Labor was being led by a man who notoriously said, 'Two wongs don't make a white'. That was the attitude of the Labor Party then. It Malcolm Fraser and not the current Prime Minister who first began large scale Asian immigration to this country. Labor at that time was being led by a man who wanted to keep the boat people out because they were, he said, 'f ... ing yellow baits'. That is the record of the Labor Party as opposed to the record of the coalition on this subject. Let me also point out on this subject of relations with Asia that the first member of this parliament of Asian extraction was Senator Thomas Backhap, back in the early years of this century, who represented one of the forebears of the Liberal Party, the Nationalist Party. But to go into more detail as to which party is the party of Asia in this country, just how long Australians have been talking about the need to integrate with Asia and just what a Johnny-come-lately to this crusade the Prime Minister is, Sir John Latham said in 1934: It is inevitable that the relations between Australia and Asia. . . will become closer and more intimate as the years pass. Therefore, it is important that we should endeavour to develop and improve our relations with our near neighbours. In 1939 Menzies said: I believe that the Pacific is of all zones in the world, the zone in which our risks are primary risks and our responsibilities are primary responsibilities. He went on to say that the government should: . .. do everything that it can to increase our cultural relationship, our personal contact with themthat is to say with Asiansand to improve all of those things which go to make a real and personal understanding. In the 1950s Dick Casey said: Our geographical situation is such that we must inevitably be brought into close touch with the peoples of Asia If we make no effort to understand their problems, we can scarcely expect them to make an effort to understand ours. Differences of race, religion, language and culture could easily lead to regrettable misunderstandings which might adversely affect our relations with them. is a pity that the Prime Minister did not heed Dick Casey's advice. If he really understood Asian culture he would not have made his regrettable comments about the Prime was Minister of Malaysia Dr Mahathir which led to months of trade tensions between Australia !, and one of our important trading partners. In the 1950s the Prime Minister of India Mr Nehru welcomed Australia's coming closer to Asia. So this idea that Asia was only discovered in December 1991, when the current Prime Minister assumed office, is a myth. The Prime Minister only discovered Asia then because until that point Asia had been something that you flew over on the way to the antique fairs of London and Paris. I will conclude this part of my comments with another well-known Australian politician, this time speaking in the 1960s. He said that our destiny lay with Asia: ... we must fulfil it spiritually, unselfishly, with shining enlightenment ... (This) will stand as the most glorious achievement, so far, in our history. That politician was not the current Prime Minister; it was Sir Alexander Downer, the father of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). Let us examine the reality of our current relationship with Asia. In 1968, 65 per cent of our total exports were already going to the Asia-Pacific region. In 1968 we already had nearly seven-tenths of our economic relationship with the Asia-Pacific region. That was 25 years ago. It has nothing to do with the current Prime Minister and everything to do with the good work of the Menzies government. Our share of East Asian markets over the last few years has declined. Our exports to East Asia have been increasing as a percentage of our GDP but falling as a percentage of East Asia's GDP because its growth rates are higher than ours. Our penetration of East Asian markets has fallen since the early 1980s from four per cent of East Asian GDP to about 3Y2 per cent. Investment from Asia in this country has also fallen over the last few years. Australian investment in countries such as Britain and America has skyrocketed but our investment in Asia has stagnated. Our investment in Britain today is six times our total investment in ASEAN. I am not saying this to approve; I am saying it to indicate the reality of our economic position, which is that our relationship with Asia has gone backwards in the last few years, notwithstanding all the hyperbole of the Prime Minister. APEC is certainly an important step in the right direction. One of the reasons why it is an important step in the right direction is that it is a small step in the improvement of our domestic economic position, which has been damaged by this government. This government has practised hairshirt economics. When times were good back in the 1980s, it put interest rates up to 17 per cent. When times were bad in the early 1990s, it put unemployment up to one million people. Now that times are allegedly good again, interest rates are going up again. In other words, before the economic recovery has crawled off the front pages of the Financial Review-it has not even got into people's pockets yet-interest rates are already going up. The last round of interest rate rises, let alone the next round, will amount to a tax of $100 a month on ordinary home buyers in this country. In the 1980s we had interest rate rises we 'had to have', in 1990 we had the recession we 'had to have', now we are having more interest rate rises that we 'had to have' and soon we will have another recession that we 'had to have'. The Prime Minister has done it before and he will do it again. The tragedy of what this Prime Minister is doing to this country is that it amounts to a complete betrayal of the people that he and the Labor Party are supposed to represent. One of the great ironies of the current situation is that Labor members opposite are only too happy to tum to traditional working class areas when they are looking for a safe seat, but they rush off to the rich parts of town when they are looking for a house. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is rushing off to a safer seat as fast as he can, given his vast bulk. At the same time we have the Prime Minister, who has a perfectly safe seat, rushing off to buy a $2.2 million mansion in Woollahra. The motto of this government is, if I might take the biblical lamentation: 'To those who have, more shall be given. To those who have not, even what little they have shall be taken away.' It is a terrible indictment of a Labor government that that should be the case. This government needs to stop fantasising about overseas countries coming to save us from our domestic predicament. Its leader needs to stop his fantasies about strolling around in his batik shirt with President Clinton. The government needs to get on with the real job of economic management. It needs to tackle the rorts, the rackets and the rip-offs which still exist in our economy. It needs to tackle the union rules, which means that the pit pony cannot be removed from a colliery because it is a member of a union and that means that Australian 767s have to have differently designed cockpits to accommodate extra union members. The Prime Minister needs to stop his Napoleonic fantasies and get on with the job of running this country. He needs to come back home where the problems are and forget about overseas problems 'that he cannot do anything to fix.",40
23,Mrs CROSIO,Unknown,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (12.22 p.m.)-I rise to speak today on the government's appropriation bills. I will take this opportunity to reflect on some of the federal Labor government's achievements and our Liberal coalition's shortcomings. During my speech, I would like to compare the positive actions of our government with the Clayton's policies and retrograde activities the coalition. It is becoming an illuminating experience. Before I go on to the points I would like to raise in the debate today, I will take the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) to task on his memory lane trips in this place. He talked about how things were established down memory lane, which is recorded in history, of what one particular person was supposed to have said, whether it was in 1939, 1964 or whenever. I say to him as he is leaving the House now that he should hang his head in shame-history records words, but history does not record action. It took the Prime Minister and the Labor government to bring action to reality, to bring those words to fruition, to make sure that APEC came to fruition. When something like that happens, the opposition resorts to personwhich, al, vindictive attacks time and again. Those opposite do not like the achievements that have taken place under the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). They do not like the fact that somebody of his renown can bring many countries of the world to agreement. They do not want to see that. They do not want to stand· up and be counted and be part of a country which is proud of those achievements. They want to stand up here and put on a scene. If Actors Equity were here grading the member for Warringah, he would probably get about two out of 10. I would not give him much more, because he has referred to what has happened in the past. He should bring himself back to the present and start looking to the future. You would swear to God, from some of the remarks made by the member for Warringah, that you had to be swab tested before you moved out of your electorate and bought property in some other electorate. I found him absolutely obscene. The debate before the House today will give me an opportunity to bring some of our achievements to the notice of the House. Since 1983 we have been driven by a need to look at where we are going throughout Australia. When our government took office it found that many areas of responsibility had been left to it by the Liberal government. I of am pleased that our government has been able to formulate policy on a scale that has assisted everyday Australians. We are coming to the end of 1994. As our Labor government forges ahead, nothing has really changed for the Liberals. They have certainly become a lot more sluggish and, if one can take notice of what has been happening in the papers recently with the leadership debate, much more chaotic. Our Liberal state of disarray has certainly been summed up well by Glen Milne in the Australian on 28 November: . . . former NSW Liberal Premier, Nick Greiner stands as testimony to the capacity of the Liberal Party for self-delusion. That some sections of the Liberal Party are mooting the idea of bringing Mr Greiner to this House is absurd, given his track record, incidentally, Mr Milne outlines so well. He states: In 1991, Greiner went to an election a year early, for no apparent reason, and saw the Liberals' comfortable majority squandered and control of the Parliamerit ceded to the Independents . . . Mr Greiner's involvement and ineptitude in t-e ICAC debacle resulting from offering that LIberal defector Terry Metherell a highly paid Public Service job are certainly etched in the minds of the voters of New South Wales and I dare say, Australia. That lapse· of political judgment saw Mr Greiner forced from the premiership. M?re recently in the Australian Capital Temtory, we should consider the Liberal opposition's actions in the Legislative Assembly where the leader, Kate Carnell, has just completed a backflip on the cannabis laws. Acknowledging that the Liberal Party has handled the issues badly, that assembly has h-d to amend the legislation which her party VIrtually helped pass. This backdown comes - fter - trong pres.sure from various quarters, IncludIng the polIce and the Australian Medical Association, who all agree that the whole issue has not been thought through. The list of the federal government's positive moves is very impressive. Whether it be in our western suburbs of Sydney; where I proudly represent the electorate of Prospect, In the country areas of New South Wales, in the state of Victoria or on the Gold Coast, our governme.nt has been actively pursuing very progreSSIve programs. As part of our - overnmen-'- commitment in Working NatIon, the MInIster for Employment, Education - nd Training (Mr Crean) and his very effec!Ive te-m have been making significant - nroads Into u.n-mployment and are creating J-b opportunItIes. Hardly surprisingly, in dISCUSSIng Working Nation's objectives and listening to others' views across Australia, the government's ideas have been met with enthusiasm and certainly with confidence. .The federal government is now working WIth many of our large companies to get people talking, to get them thinking and, most Importantly, to get them actively working together to alleviate unemployment. The - overnment is creating strong links with Industry, the unions and the community at large. Results have been very reassuring. Recent DEET figures show that the number of skilled vacancies in major metropolitan newspapers has risen. This result sees increases in 12 out of the 16 major occupational groups, which means that the level of skilled vacancies has risen by more than 56 per cent over the past year. There is also good news about decreases in Australia's foreign debt. The latest figures show that net foreign debt fell for the fourth quarter in a row. Commentators have welcomed this result. By contrast, but perhaps not surprisingly, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), has attributed the improvements to state governments and to the private sector. I personally believe that his refusal to - ive due credit to the federal govern--nt Illustrates how petty he and his coalItIon partners are about the issue. He either de.arly lacks understanding and knowledge or Just refuses to understand what it is we are about. The list of worthwhile government initiatives is a very long and proud one. Through DEET's NETTFORCE projects, for instance, the federal government is campaigning to generate 17,000 new jobs in the Gold Coast region over the next six months. In central weste- New South Wales, by actively encouragIng employers to take on additional employees, particularly the long-term unemployed, our government's endeavours should lead to an extra 5,500 new jobs in that area. Overall, since the launch of Working Nation in May of this year, there has been a substantial impact on long-term unemployment. We have now seen a reduction of almost 90 000 in the number of long-term unempl-yed people since March 1993. Contrast that with the coalition's performance and specifically look at the Liberals in Victoria. The Victorian Premier has become notorious for his ability to reduce the quality of life for so many people. We all know full well, unfortunately, the difficulties that the Premier has created there for ordinary, everyday, hard working Australians. That really does not warrant any further comment. In my own state of New South Wales where the Fahey. Liberal government reigns: from 1991 untIl the federal government established a task force to identify transport links between Kingsford Smith airport, known as Mascot, and the proposed new airport, the New South Wales government has not participated in any planning to link those two airports. Earlier this year, the federal Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) announced intentions to identify and plan for road and rail links between those two airports. He established the task force to work with the New South Wales government. The New South Wales Liberal coalition government has not been easy to negotiate with, stipulating its involvement would be dependent on a Commonwealth government commitment to provide up-front funding of both road and rail links, including a $120 million funding commitment towards the city to Kingsford Smith airport rail link. Wanting to secure cooperation, our Commonwealth government attempted, as much as possible, to develop a good working relationship with the New South Wales government over this issue. But the New South Wales government would not agree to the State Rail Authority carrying out the engineering study for the rail link unless the Commonwealth gave a commitment to pay for the lot once again. Even after the Commonwealth made $200,000 available for that rail study, New South Wales continued to baulk at having any involvement in that engineering study. Eventually, the New South Wales Liberal coalition government reluctantly agreed to participate. As well, despite receiving millions of dollars from the federal government to improve our national highways, the financial year of 1993-94 saw the New South Wales government divert some $50 million to nonroad purposes. If New South Wales continues to divert a considerable proportion of its discretionary spending to consolidated revenue, how can the federal government treat seriously calls from New South Wales to allocate more m()ney for New South Wales roads. The recent outcry about noise and low flying aircraft has certainly sparked a new controversy and debate about the opening of a third runway at Sydney's Mascot airport. Eyes will soon turn to developing the proposed airport at Badgerys Creek in Sydney's west. Certainly building the airport at Badgerys Creek has its attractions. It should lead, as I am informed-and statistics back it up to the creation of thousands of jobs not only in constructing the airport and transport links but also in the companies that will relocate to our area. It also has scope to increase opportunities in the manufacturing and tourism sectors. The federal Minister for Transport recently announced that three route options have been identified .for the new national highway link between Prestons and Cecil Park in Sydney's west and that an environmental impact study will commence to determine the best route. The Prestons to Cecil Park link is the southernmost of the three sections of the western Sydney orbital. It is proposed that this new road take long-distance heavy vehicles out of Sydney's local and arterial road system and form part of the link from' Kingsford Smith airport to Sydney West airport. Regarding all aspects of the airport, however, on behalf of the constituents I represent, I would urge planners to consider carefully all implications for people residing within the area. We must learn lessons from experience and we must plan to provide adequate infrastructure. We have the chance now to get it right from the outset. The federal government in its Working Nation document committed itself to a longer runway at Badgerys Creek being finished by 1999. But variouspeople now want that $73 million spending to be brought forward to the next calendar year and ,another $47 million allocated to the FAC dedicated to immediate construction of Badg-rys Creek. I have personally written to the. federal Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator John Faulkner, outlining in detail my concerns about all aspects of the proposal and its impact on people in my electorate. I favour a further EIS being conducted under the auspices of the Commonwealth environmental portfolio, taking into account the full potential impact for people who live, work or engage in other day-today activities in proximity to those proposed flight paths of the proposed airport. Any EIS should be capable of withstanding the test of public scrutiny. Anything less would fail to convince the community and may raise doubts about the intention of long-term airport operations. We cannot fast-track construction at Badgerys Creek without an updated full environmental impact statement on the issue. A very detailed EIS was completed in 1985, and I have read it, but many changes have occurred in western Sydney over the nine years since that EIS was completed. The 1985 EIS suggested a runway of 1,200 metres but in 1991-and I am pleased to say following a great deal of pressure from western New South Wales members-the then Minister for Transport changed the length of the runway to something like 1,800-odd metres. Also, following further representation to our federal minister, we have now announced the construction of an international standard 2.9 kilometre runway instead of the 1.8 kilometre general aviation facility that was originally planned for Badgerys Creek. A whole host of environmental issues must be considered such as air quality and pollution, fuel, flooding, water run-off and the effects of a completed international airport on run-off. We need a reassessment of the noise maps, and guarantees that aircraft will remain in the corridors already set down. The new site for the airport is very close to Horsley Park, Bossley Park, Smithfield, Greystanes and Fairfield-all areas and suburbs within the electorate that I represent. I have consistently recommended a very cautious approach to this development because of the potential for adverse impact on the area. Bearing in mind that the proposed airport is to be operational 24 hours a day, the possible situation for many people is very serious. Planners must think about the implications each time a heavily laden aircraft flies low over Sydney's most densely populated western region. They should particularly give consideration to take-off and landing in the early hours of the morning and the impact it would have on residents' lives. I wonder whether the planners and so-called experts realise the amount of noise generated by aircraft landing or taking off at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. This is what we must give consideration to.. I certainly sympathise with those people who are affected by the opening of the third runway. But I will say most sincerely that many people purchased properties in that region knowing the airport was there. Certainly, many have known it has been there for many years. Conversely, though, some people within my electorate had never contemplated having an airport in the area, even though now many welcome it-and certainly our council does. Years ago some made an initial choice to live in the quiet rural areas of the electorate and others, who have moved in since the 1975 subdivision started, would not have had any inkling that an airport could be constructed in the area and that they could end up under a flight path. I think that choice has now been taken away from a lot of people. As an article on flight paths, which appeared in last Saturday'S Weekend Australian, so very logically puts it: The opening of the third runway and the unsynchronised commissioning of the new air traffic control tower meant residents got a Big Bang taste of 2010 conditions. I have used that quote in my speech today because what I am really saying, on behalf of the people I represent, is that we do not want the big bang effect in the Prospect electorate. What we do want is adequate planning and consideration for people's welfare; what we do want is a continued guarantee from our minister and our government that, when that construction is put in place, it will be done efficiently and, as I have said repeatedly, with infrastructure so that the communication links by rail and road are completed. We want to make sure that what we plan to build 'today will take us well through the 21st century. We want provisions and facilities in the western region of Sydney that are going to be classed as second to none, because we do not want to be second-class. I believe that we have the intent, the ability and, certainly, the means by which our planning policies can be put in place so that the people who are affected will not be placed in the same position in which they have recently been placed in the Mascot-Kingsford Smith area. I believe most sincerely in what our government is about. I believe in what we are about in our white paper and our employment creations. I believe in the sincerity with which we have, at all times, openly dealt with the public of Australia. But I will again insistboth to the minister, as I have in the past, and to all others in this House-that we do the job well. Let us plan it correctly and adequately. Let us at no time in the future-and, if it is not us, the people who follow us, who stand up and represent their constituencies in the same proud way as we who have been elected and are here today do-have to wear the bad decisions of something that we have been part of today. I would not like to see that happen in the future. Most particularly, I put it on record that I would like to see adequate planning put into place so that we can proudly proceed to the future and not be ashamed of what we could leave behind for others to bear the brunt of. On behalf of the constituents whom I represent, I commend the government for all the actions it is now taking. But I will ask it again to make sure that a lot of thought is given before we rush in. We have not in the past rushed into something like this; I do not believe that, because of outside pressures, we should now tum around and try to quick start a project that needs a lot of planning to be successful and, most importantly, to be done correctly. I put this on record in the House in the appropriation debate whilst at the same time commending the government and the ministry on what we have been able to do-it may be happening slowly, but it is happening-with industry and particularly with the people we represent: those long-term unemployed, those who did not have a place in history and who are very important. We as a government, through the white paper and the statements we have put into place, have been able to offer them a future-a future with opportunities and, most importantly, a future where this Labor government will go from strength to strength. I commend the bills to the House.",44
24,Mr COBB,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you, like other members in this chamber, will be aware of the famous sports people that come from the electorate of Parkes: I guess the most famous would be Phillip Adams from Forbes. No Australian has won more Commonwealth Games medals, whether they be gold, silver or bronze, than Phillip. He has been a great ambassador for Australia in pistol shooting. Even as recently as yesterday, we had two Narromine athletes performing well for this country. Glenn MCGRATH plays cricket for Australia. Who could forget seeing, on our television screens last. night, that famous ins winger cleaning up one of the English batsmen? Further, when I got back to the motel and turned on the TV, there was Melinda Gainsford winning the indoor 200 the metres, beating even as famous a person as Cathy Freeman. But it is not about them that I want to talk today. I wish to talk about cleaning up drugs in sport. The athletes that I have just mentioned have been exemplary in this regard. For some time now, the world has been suspicious that China is guilty of using systematic doping to produce artificial world champions, particularly in swimming-though positives have turned up in drug testing of competitors in canoeing, athletics and other sports. If we look at swimming, we see that, of the world's top 25 rankings for each swimming stroke, in 1991 China had six listings; a year later that had increased fourfold to 24 listings; and a year later, in 1993, that had increased fourfold again to 96 listings. Such a meteoric rise in itself is suspicious, particularly as only one of those listings was a male, with the rest being female. The very top performers won six medals at the world's swimming championships in Perth in 1991; but this year, 1994, in September, in Rome at the Foro Italico pool, they won 24 medals. What is particularly notable is that all the medal winners this year were female; in fact, they won 12 of the 16 gold medals, and not one male Chinese swimmer made a final. That in itself causes a suspicion that they may be taking drugs. Only last month in October at the Asian Games in Hiroshima, the women won all 15 gold medals in swimming. With this meteoric rise, there has been the very physical evidence, I believe, especially to the trained eye, of the use of drugs, particularly anabolic steroids, the testosterone derivatives, and human growth hormone. Looking at the female Chinese swimmers, we see about them a lot of non-feminine characteristics. There are the deep husky voices of the girls. At the world championships when Lu Bin came in and won the 200 metres freestyle, as well as being a relay competitor, her deep baritone voice apparently shocked the audience, including the 60 journalists, there. She said that she was not on drugs and that these accusations against Chinese female swimmers were racist. But, apart from voice, another characteristic is excessive body hair, where it is not shaved, of course-particularly facial hair. Most alarming is the thickening and protrusion of the mandible, the lower jawbone. I guess equally if not more worrying are the characteristics that we do not see, some of which may not tum up for years-damage done to the liver from trying to detoxify the testosterone floating around in, these athletes' bodies; the diabetes problems resulting from it; and, later in life, most tragically of all, the infertiliand ty problems caused by damage done to the reproductive systems of these girls. Throughout all these accusations, the Chinese officials, including government officials, denied that any doping was going on. The athletes themselves have denied that any doping Was going on. The accusers have been called racists. Even Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Chairman of the International Olympic Committee, who supported Beijing against Sydney for the 2000 Olympics, dismissed these allegations and declared China 'very clean'. The pattern that I have outlined amongst Chinese athletes, particularly the swimmers, is all very similar to what the world went through in the 1980s with happenings in East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down. Only in today's December edition of Swimming World, which has just been released in America, there is a very interesting article showing, from the opening up of the Stasi files-the Stasi, of. yourse, being the East German secret police-that every East German world-class swimmer was doped. The evidence is there recorded. The testosterone levels-the male hormone levels-in those German female swimmers were very great indeed. Of course, testosterone injected into females accelerates muscle growth and reduces the recovery times between events. A normal male will have about 40 parts per cubic centimetre of urine. There is some testosterone normally in a female but it is about five parts per cubic centimetre. In a normal individual walking around, the ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone-which is the natural preform of testosterone-is one to one. It can rise, abnormally, in exceptional circumstances to three to one. The International Olympic Committee has set a standard ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone at six to one. So, if people test positive to testosterone, there is no doubt that they take the drug. Kristin Otto, the East German swimmer who won six gold medals at Seoul in 1988, had a ratio of 17 to one. According to the files, there were other East German girls whose levels fluctuated between nine to one 12 to one. So the East (Jerman swimmers were a total pack of cheats, nothing more and nothing less. Over the past two years, and before a recent event which I will come to in a minute, five Chinese swimmers have tested positive. The five includes Yang Aihua, who won the 400 metres at the world championships. Her test at the world championships turned up clear but she was tested randomly two weeks later, before the Asian Games, and she tested positive. According to one newspaper report, the Sydney Morning Herald of 3 December, her test results were held up for several weeks: . . . to allow a suitable time to elapse between Samaranch's commentthat the Chinese were very cleanand the proof that Chinese sport was anything but very clean. These five positives that have turned up over the last two years are equivalent to the total positive results in swimmers of all countries over the last 22 years. Indeed, 45 Chinese athletes overall-and that is outside swimming as well-have tested positive since 1987. At the Asian Games, something else happened. A surprise test was done on the swimmers three days before the games, not after, and 11 Chinese athletes turned up positive, including eight female swimmers. Those who tested positive included Lu Bin, who tried to scale a wall to avoid being tested after an event. She won the 200 metres at the world championships in 1:56.89. Le Jingyi, who holds the world record, which she set at the world championships, for 50 metres of 24.51 and for 100 metres of 54.01, was excluded from the eight swimmers who turned up positive. She is the girl we have all been seeing on our television sets in recent weeks. She has very broad shoulders which taper down to a narrow waist. She looks like she has swung out of a tree with a gorilla and she would be the envy of every male bodybuilder in the world. She tested negative, but surely there is no doubt that she also is positive. I might just add that testosterCihong. one particularly helps the sprinters-and she is a 50-metre and a 100-metre sprinterbecause of the bulk they put on. The benefit gained from using testosterone starts to dissipate when you get up to the distance events, such as the 800 metres. It appears that the Chinese athletes have been able to avoid testing positive when they have been tested after the competition events because of such devices as flushing, whereby they use diuretics to flush out of the body the urine with the high testosterone in it so that the urine sample taken later is a dilute one. Apparently they have also been using masking drugs, which block the kidneys from excreting testosterone. By using these flushing and· masking techniques, the drugs can be flushed out of the system within 48 hours. So it is obvious that it is vital to use random testing of athletes and what is called 'out of competition' testing of athletes to pick up this use. In the Chinese program, only about 20 per cent of their total testing is out of competition testing whereas in Australia 50 per cent of the tests fall into this category. We need these tests to be done to establish baseline levels for individual athletes. When the Chinese were tested, Lu Bin's level was very high indeed. I guess that the testosterone levels floating around in the bodies of Lu Bin and Le Jingyi would probably be equivalent to the level of the combined teams of the Canberra Raiders and the Brisbane Broncos. I say to the world international swimming community-particularly to the Chinese community-that, if they want their female swimmers to look like males, to act like males and to swim like males, they should ban them from the female events and let them compete in the male events. I believe that this is a human rights issue. Perhaps it should be taken up by the United Nations and perhaps education programs for female swimmers should be put in place. Yang, the 400-metre swimmer who has turned up positive, trains under Zhou Ming at the Guang Zhou Military Club, along with sprinter Le Jingyi, who won four gold medals and set four world records at the world titles, and the dual backstroke world champion, He I would say that there is no doubtthe circumstantial evidence is very heavy indeed-that the coaches know what is going on with these swimmers, even though one of them did not test positive. I would stress that it is not just the athletes who take the drugs but those who administer them who are particularly at fault. The Australian stance on coaches who are found administering drugs to athletes is that they should be banned not just for two or four years but for life. I believe that at present the swimmers are banned for only two years. So they can compete at one Olympic Games, be picked up with a positive test, dry out and compete at another Olympic Games. I believe they should be banned for four years, including one Olympic Games, and that all their medals and previous records should be stripped off them when that happens. I also believe that a country with a large number of athletes who test positive should forfeit its right to compete for a number of years until it can show that particular sport is clean to the satisfaction of International Olympic Committee standards. Mr MCGauran-It's outright cheating.",48
25,Mr COBB,Unknown,"It is outright cheating, as the member for Gippsland says. China complains that there is a high cost in this testing. But, if it is spending millions of dollars on putting its athletes through these sorts of military training programs to try to gain some world kudos, which it is, it can throw a few of those dollars, or Chinese yuan, aside to do the drug testing which goes with it. The Chinese have to be responsible in this regard. As far as the Australian athletes go, I feel very sorry indeed for former athletes such as Michelle Ford, who was denied higher medals because she competed against East German swimmers who were drugged. I feel sorry for our swimmers who have come back from the world championships, such as Elli Overton, Susan ONEILL and Hayley Lewis who would have been higher placed were it not for those Chinese cheats who came in ahead of them. I praise the work of Steven Haynes and Nicki Vance of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, who are doing such great work there, and others who have spoken out, like Paul Quinlan, who is the AIS swimming manager and the Vice-President of the World Swimming Coaches Association. I also praise the outspoken words of coaches such as Forbes Carlile, Don Talbot and Otto Sonnleitner, who is the Australian Swimming Coaches Association chairman, who are calling for stiffer penalties. I say to China to get rid of its cheats and to lift its standards on having disregard for the lives of the individual swimmers. Possibly some of the swimmers who are taking these tablets orally think they are taking vitamin pills and do not realise what in fact they are taking. That was certainly the case in East Germany. If that is happening in China, it is all the more reprehensible. While this is going on, China at this stage is not fit to host international events such as future Olympic Games and future Asian Games. I am very fond of Chinese people. The people of Chinese extraction who have settled in Australia are wonderful, hard working citizens who have set a great example to other Australians. Chinese people can stand up in the world and hold their heads high in their own right. Chinese athletes do not need coaches and government officials directing them to take performance enhancing drugs. The International Olympic Committee should realise that the game is up with China, as it was with East Germany. The IOC should take strict action to clean up drug misuse in sport. It is the IOC's duty to play a strong role to ensure that the world of sport is free of drugs. It should ostracise the countries and the coaches who encourage drug taking. It should take appropriate strong action against athletes who test positive in the future.",51
26,Ms CRAWFORD,Unknown,"Forde-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development) (1.01 p.m.)-It gives me great pleasure to speak today on the appropriation bills. As most of the honourable members in this House will recognise, appropriation bills are about money and the funding of government programs. A major issue connected with appropriation and stateCommonwealth funding arrangements is that dealt with by Hilmer in looking at national competition policy and through that at the concept of a national electricity grid. While people, in principle, support the concept of a national electricity grid, it is a different issue. when the power poles required for that grid are to go through their home and affect their livelihood or, mOre importantlyas the good citizens of Boonah would arguethey are to go through a recognised scenic rim. Over 200 people attended a public meeting in Boonah last week to voice their opposition to the proposed route for the QC east link. They have formed themselves into a group called the Boonah Citizens Opposed to East Link. It befits the government to listen to those community concerns and to evaluate them so that, if the option is chosen to put powerlines through there, the decision is made with all the facts to hand and taking into consideration all the issues that the community has raised. Many of the issues raised at that public meeting had not been brought to the attention of the QC. The area in which the QC intends to place these powerlines covers the Mount French National Park, the Mount Greville National Park, the Main Range National Park, the Mount Barney National Park and the Lamingvery ton National Park. These areas are recognised as having value to the community. These located areas should be preserved and their character should be preserved. The area itself is recognised as being of the scenic rim. It embraces a number shires and it has changed from a dairying community to a tourism community. That is particularly important. It has nine outdoor education establishments for school children and it is the largest area that provides such facilities in south-east Queensland. Over 10,000 students per year visit this area to participate in outdoor education pursuits. Those establishments have chosen this area because of its beauty and because of its access to both the mountains and the waterwho although, sadly, there is not too much water at the moment. This area has been chosen because it provides a unique opportunity our young people not only to develop themcourse, selves and to learn the kind of self-esteem self-confidence which come from outdoor education but also to learn to value the livelihoods, environment which they have access to. That is one issue. The other issue has been the pursuit of tourism as the area has attempted to diversify from fairly intensive dairy farming. over 10,000 adults a year visit this area on wilderness holidays. Mount Barney lodge camping ground cites how it offers the opporpowerlines tunity to share our wilderness heritage. Yarrafarmer malong advertises indoor recreation with privacy, no overcrowding, and horse riding facilities. The national horse trails go through this area. O'Reilly's mountain resort is there. Tamborine Mountain and Willowbank Raceus way are there. There is a whole range of things. This whole area has a historical perspective as well as its tourist attractions. It is believed by those people who are working in that that they will not be able to continue their tourism operations if the skyline is ruined unsightly, hideous powerlines. One of the important attractions of the area is the fact that it is the leading parachuting centre in Queensland. At Boonah there is quality tandem and free-fall training. Gliding is also significant. We have the Kooralbyn Parachute Centre and the ultralight operation in Boonah. All of those operations are placed at risk if the QC east link connection goes through this area. How on earth can part people parachute if they are in danger of of falling onto powerlines? How can people glide if they are in danger of falling onto powerlines? How can people fly ultralights if they are in danger of falling onto powerlines? I also point out that Mount French is classified as 26. For those people in this chamber who do not know what 26 means, it can be equated to degrees of difficulty, and 26 means that this is an international peak. It is where our Olympians go to train for their mountain climbing. It is where those people hope to climb the Himalayas also go to test themselves. Why would they want to climb to the top of Mount French lookout and for see ugly powerlines in front of them? Of they do not want that and nobody who and is reasonable would want it. There are very real concerns about people's people's quality of life and, more importantly, people's incomes in a community which has shown it can diversify. It is, however, still a very large farming community, producing carrots, Queensland pumpkins, Indeed, avocados, fruits and flowers. A matter of real concern is an admission by the QC that it uses chemicals under its to keep the grass at bay. Does a who has to put up with these terrible powerlines through the middle of his farm have any guarantee that the chemicals used by the QC to keep the grass at bay will not find its way onto his carrots or pumpkins? All of have been made very conscious of what is happening with the use of chemicals, particularly in the international meat market. Not only do farmers lose control over their property, but they have no control over what the area Queensland Electricity Commission may be doing with chemicals. That is one very real by concern for quite a large number of the farming community. We can say categorically that the people whose livelihoods are at risk, whose whole of life depends on the recreational and national environmental parks in this area, are 1\ vigorously opposed to the QC east link going through that area. They would argue that this area is designated national park; it is designated heritage. It is part of our history and, as such, should be preserved and should be pristine. Tourism is now very much a part of the livelihood of that community. The power link would be totally and utterly destructive of ecotourism. People parachuting, gliding or fiying ultralights would no longer have clear airspace. The Olympic climbers and our mountain climbers who go to Mount French to test themselves would no longer enjoy the conditions they do now. I bring to this House, with all the weight I can muster, the views of those residents who were at the Boonah council chambers last week. They expressed their very precise and very clear objections to the placement of the QC east link through their area. They object not because they are necessarily opposed to the QC east link-although people did raise issues as to whether this was necessary, and whether in fact the kind of electricity that would be generated in the link-up would be important-but because, if they are to survive as a community, they need that area to remain pristine. They need that area to remain as part of our heritage in order to develop their livelihoods through tourism, through outdoor education and, indeed, through the kind of farming to which they have now adapted. There are a couple of other concerns which have come about, with some of the changes and some of the moves that we have seen, through governments seeking to become more competitive and perhaps more financially secure. Within this area we have also had a second action by the Department of Primary Industries, which took over the water resources management of Moogerah Dam at Lake Moogerah. Unfortunately, the dam is currently only operating at 9 per cent capacity, and we all hope and pray for a break in the drought. As if that situation were not bad enough, we now find that the children's play equipment in the area has been taken away and that the area is being only scruffily maintained. The citizens there are very concerned. They believe that in this, the International Year of the Family, it is wrong that this very popular family area-where people can take their own lunch, have their children play and be very much part of a family situation-can have its playground equipment removed in the middle of the night because of certain financial constraints on government departments, and it is wrong that the kinds of maintenance and facilities needed are no longer available to families. This is particularly important, given that we have school holidays in the next week or two. Given the constraints of the financial impact of the drought upon them, very many local people will not be able to go very far from home, and this is a very popular place for family gatherings to be held. What could be more delightful than children being able to play on playground equipment, with parents bringing their own food and using the barbecues there, and doing so in an area which is relatively pleasant and not just scruffily maintained? I urge this House to give some consideration to the community's concerns when we are discussing the appropriation bills and the finances which we see translated from the federal government to the states. We are, after all, appropriating Australian taxpayers' dollars. It is their money. Our people pay taxes to ensure that government services run; and all of us need to be very conscious that there is no question that the concerns and needs of the community need to be addressed. We are, after all, a government about people, and I urge this parliament and this government to do what they can to ensure that the needs which were expressed last week by the people of Boonah are heeded and taken into account when government decisions are made. While we may think about a national grid and look to savings with the sharing of electricity and so on-all of which, of itself, may be valuable-when we are standing here we perhaps fail to recognise that the communities out there, at the very heart of what we are doing, may not want this. These people certainly do not want the QC east link in their national parks, because it will destroy their livelihood. The very reason for their living in that community will be gone, because those pristine environments...:.. - those national parks which are part of our heritage-will in fact no longer be as they are now; and neither will our farmers be able to continue to give us guaranteed clean food. In the debate on this appropriation bill, I give voice to the needs of that community and bring those needs before the House.",51
27,Mr LANGMORE,Unknown,"I want to use the consideration of the appropriation bills to review the state of the economy and where Australia might go. This is the appropriate occasion in the House for that kind of activity. The current situation of the economy is a delightful one, as has been said a number of times in the last day or two from this side of the House. The rate of economic growth is measured at 6.4 per cent and even if those figures have to be revised downward, as is possible because it seems extraordinarily rapid, it is quite clear that the economy is now growing very strongly, that the level of economic activity is high and that therefore there will a strong rate of economic growth and a strong rate of employment growth, which is what we all want. The principal problem of the Australian economy at present is the level of unemployment. It has fallen significantly from its peak but it is still over 9 per cent, and we want that to come down rapidly and to remain much lower. One of the principal requirements for that is for the level of economic activity to remain strong. The rate of inflation is also extraordinarily low. At less than two per cent, less than half the OECD average, that is less than half also the rate amongst our trading partners, and there is no significant sign of that rate of inflation increasing. It is quite clear too that business investment is growing strongly and that there is also strong growth in many exports. Of course, the drought is retarding growth of primary exports, which is a tragedy for the rural sector. The government has a package in place to try to offset that to a limited extent but the drought is containing the growth of the whole economy and, until the drought breaks, we will not see the uniform spread of economic activity that we want to see. Given those situations and the fact that we still have a significant current account deficit, it is important to try to maximise growth of employment, to minimise the impact of that on the current account deficit and to minimise the impact of it on inflation. The question is how we do that, and it is not an easy policy balance to achieve. We all want to avoid increases in interest rates and taxation but, on the other hand, it is crucial to ensure that this recovery, this strong period of economic growth, is sustainable. That cannot happen if we go into a too rapid boom in a way that leads inevitably to a recession later on. So the question is what balance of policies the government and the Reserve Bank should use to ensure sustainability. Many people, particularly from the financial markets, have been arguing that interest rates should be increased yet again. I think they neglect the fact that, since the September quarter increase in the national accounts, there have already been two increases in interest rates, increases totalling one and %per cent, the most recent of which was towards the end of October. It is quite clear that those increases would not have made any impact at all on the activity in the September quarter, and it is therefore appropriate to wait awhile before any further decision is made on interest rates. Some of the commentary from the financial markets suggests that the government and the Reserve Bank should act as if what is happening at this very moment, the beginning of December, is what was measured for the September quarter. That is an oversimplification. It is highly likely that the growth rate will remain strong now, but it may be somewhat less than it was measured to be in the September quarter, because of the impact of those two interest rate increases. It is quite clear, for example, that housing activity is already tailing off a bit. I know, from anecdotal evidence, of business people who have deferred investments that they were planning, because of the two increases in interest rates that have already occurred, and because they fear that there may be more in the pipeline and they fear the cost that those increases would cause them if they were to invest further now. I think responsible policy would suggest that there should not be any further increases in interest rates for some time, until it is possible to accurately and comprehensively evaluate the impact of the two increases in interest rates that have already occurred, and the consequences of that impact for every part of the economy. It is important to do that, of course, in ways that take account not only of statistics but also of the evidence that comes from the business sector, the housing sector and the consumer sector, in so far as that can be assessed. Of course, since the Christmas period is always a period of very rapid activity-a turbulent period, if you like, in measured terms-it would be wise to leave further decisions until late January or February. It is good to see that the Reserve Bank has today decided not to announce any further increase. I hope that it will take no further action for at least a couple of months. One would hope that it would then find that further increases were not necessary. We want to avoid interest increases in so far as we possibly can, because they increase the cost of investment and they increase the cost to home buyers and buyers of white goods and cars, and we want the level of economic activity to remain as strong as is possible. One of the lessons of the last decade was that interest increases can be very damaging. That is the lesson, not only from Australia but also from other countries. Therefore, we want to be quite cautious about any increases that occur. The fact that increases are happening in the United States does not mean that they are appropriate policy here, not least because real interest rates in Australia are already-still-well above those in the United States, despite the fact that there have been half a dozen increases there. Because our inflation rate is so low, the real level of interest here is still high, by historical standards and by international standards. ·We ought to remember that. As well, we need to remember that when interest rates rise the exchange rate rises. That has happened in the months that have foIl' lowed the increases in interest rates here. Increases in the exchange rate make adjustment of the current account deficit more difficult. For those reasons, as well as for the reason that we want employment growth to be maximised, we should be very cautious about any further increases in interest rates. Of course, we have to find ways of containing demand. It seems entirely appropriate for the government to be seriously thinking about very modest, progressive increases in taxation. It is something new in the Australian environment, since the last decade and a half, for there to be serious consideration of what should be done about taxation. During the last decade we had a whole series of reductions in taxation, which were no doubt widely welcomed. But it is responsible, as the Treasurer said yesterday, to use taAation, as well as monetary policy and policy about outlays, as countercyclical policy. At a time when outlays have been severely constrained, when there are strong demands for improvements in education or health or welfare, or for spending on the arts, the environment or infrastructure, and those demands are entirely justified, it seems right to consider the possibility of using taxation as well as outlays as a countercyclical tool. The question then for the government is how to do that. All of us would have our appropriate suggestions to make, but I would wimt to emphasise that the changes should be carefully targeted and should be progressive. In other words, they should be imposed on areas where people can more readily afford them; in other words, they should be imposed on high income earners rather than low income earners or middle income earners or perhaps on certain areas in the business sector where they will not discourage investment. Such areas are available. Let me mention just a couple. A very obvious area would be to have dividend imputation. Australia is, I am told, perhaps the only country, but at the very least one of the few countries, with 100 per cent dividend imputation. Most countries in the OECD have half dividend imputation. That is a benefit, of course, only to those who own shares. By definition, that is principally those who are on upper incomes or the more wealthy. To have dividend imputation would still give them some of the benefit of that policy but it would save about $900 million in revenue forgone. That would be an equitable measure. It would bring us into line with a lot of the rest of the Western world, and it would not discourage the purchase of shares. I think that that is a very serious possibility that ought to be considered. Another course which many people mention would be to do away with negative gearing. That too is a tax policy that is of benefit to those who are by definition relatively well off, who can benefit from the effect of their assets on their net income. I think a lot of people judge that abolition of negative gearing would be a progressive policy. Another possibility would be changes to some of the tax treatment of superannuation, particularly for very high income earners. Other possibilities are available but those ones would be quite well targeted. They would be progressive policies which would not discourage investment, which would bring us into line with much of the rest of the Western world, which would not be discriminatory and which would be paid for by those who can most readily afford them. It is important to consider those possibilities, as well as the possibility of perhaps a higher marginal rate for people on over $70,000. There is nothing sacrosanct about the upper limit at present of $50,000. That too would make the income tax system rather more progressive. I have explored these ideas with quite a lot of care in a book that I wrote with a friend the Australian National University, John Quiggin, and we have done quite a bit of research on them. Therefore I make these suggestions on the basis of quite a bit of careful thought, and I hope that they will be considered by the government. I conclude by repeating that what is happening at present is in large measure the result of sound policy over the last few years. forthwith. The economy is now growing strongly. The problems are the delightful ones of a strong recovery. The issues for the government are how to ensure that that recovery can be sustained so that employment can go on growing in the ways that we all want. .Employment growth will occur mainly in the service sector, and a lot of it in the human service sector. To build up the revenue base allows some of that growth of employment to be in the area of publicly provided human services like education and health, areas where there are desperate needs for improvement. The example that seems to me to be most powerful is that at the beginning of this year 140,000 people who applied to go to technical and further education colleges were not able to find places. Therefore, it is a very high priority to build up the number of places available so that those people can get the skills that they need for the working life that they want and so that Australia can have the benefit of a more skilled work force. For some of the additional revenue to be used for improvements in the number of TAPE places would be welcomed very widely in the community. Since TAPEs are the most widely underfunded areas of education, I think that is one of the highest priorities for use of any additional revenue that is available. No doubt, some of the additional revenue would rightly be used for reducing the deficit. It should also be used in ways that will maximise growth of employment, and the TAPE sector is a particularly good example. I conclude by reiterating the centrality of the employment goal and the need to ensure sustainable economic development in ways that will also include increased equity, which at would in tum contribute to making the economy more humane and sustainable.

Question resolved in the affirmative. NA ACCOUNTABILITY BILL 1994 Cognate bills: NA AND COMPANIES lULL 1994 AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 29 June. Second Reading,58
29,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill, together with the two others that are part of the same package, is to replace the Audit Act 1901. That act is one of the few Commonwealth laws that have operated continuously since they were passed by this parliament in its first session after federation. Its intended replacement, therefore, represents something of a landmark in the history of Commonwealth financial administration. The Audit Act is not being replaced simply because it is old. In fact, it has proved remarkably robust over its 93-year life in providing for the procedural framework for Commonwealth financial administration and for the audit of the Commonwealth's activities. But too many of its basic concepts and structures reflect their 19th century origins to an extent that ignores and in some cases even impedes modern management practice and contemporary expectations for public sector accountability. These limitations were recognised by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in the course of its comprehensive inquiry into the operations of the Audit Office. In its report 296, tabled in April 1989, the JCPA recommended that the Audit Act be replaced with more modern legislation, with separate acts to deal with auditing and financial administration. In giving effect to that recommendation, the government believes that clarity would be served best through the adoption of three new acts. It is proposed that there be an Auditor General Act to provide for the powers and functions of the Auditor-General. In relation to financial administration, however, Commonwealth bodies differ according to the basic legal financial status that each one has-namely, whether the body has the legal capacity, in its own right, to acquire ownership of money and other assets coming into its possession, or whether it acts only as a financial and custodial agent for the Commonwealth, without acquiring separate legal ownership of such money and assets. Consequently, it is proposed that there be a Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act to specify certain matters that are to apply to the operations of financially autonomous bodies-that is, Commonwealth bodies that have legal ownership of money in their own right; and a Financial Management and Accountability Act, to apply to the financial operations of agencies-that is, Commonwealth bodies that financially are agents of the Commonwealth in that the bodies acquire no legal ownership of the money that they raise and spend. That money, in the constitutional sense, directly comprises the 'Treasury of the Commonwealth'. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may recall that, upon introduction of the package of these three bills on 29 June 1994, the House agreed that the legislative package be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for its consideration and advisory report. JCPA report 331 tabled on 22 September 1994 is the result of that process. I believe that the committee is to be commended for its quality analysis and recommendations, the great majority of which the government accepts. In that regard, I foreshadow that the government will be moving a number of amendments to the bills to pick up the recommendations of the JCPA accepted by the government, together with several other minor changes the desirability for which became evident as a consequence of reviewing the bills to address the JCPA's examination. I now wish to provide an outline of the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act. The proposed act is concerned with the regulatory-accounting-accountability framework for dealing with and managing the money and property of the Commonwealth. It will specify responsibilities and powers necessary for the efficient, effective and ethical use of the resources lawfully available to the Commonwealth to carry out its programs; and it will provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the stewardship and management performance of those who are responsible for those resources can be made visible and thereby allow them to be held accountable. The proposed law will add substance to the spirit of the public sector financial reforms that have been a feature of this government's administration over the last decade. At the same time, the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is intended to preserve the traditional strengths of the Audit Act's key principles of financial control and, where possible, to clarify and simplify them. The explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill deals comprehensively with its features. There are, however, a few elements that I would like to mention specifically. The definitions of 'Agency', 'Chief Executive', 'official', 'public money' and 'public property', between them, describe the proposed boundaries of the act's application. Within those boundaries, the principles set down in the act will be fleshed out, where necessary, by subsidiary legislation-regulations and finance minister's orders-to provide procedural substance for the day-today application of those principles. Such a legislative framework is patterned on the structure established by the Audit Act for regulations and finance directions, except that, unlike finance directions, which are administrative in character, provision is made for finance minister's orders to be tabled as disallowable instruments. The legislative framework will be completed by instructions which chief executives will be authorised to issue to officials of their agencies. The act will preserve the unique role of the Minister for Finance, which is central to the orderly functioning of the Commonwealth's financial administration. The finance minister is, for all practical purposes, the custodian of the constitutional 'Treasury of the Commonwealth' so that the range of statutory powers and responsibilities for the proper custody of the Commonwealth's money is vested in that office. The finance minister will retain the sole power to agree appropriate banking arrangements for public money and to make orders concerning the handling of receipts and withdrawals of public money and its investment. The existing power under the Audit Act to arrange overdrafts and advances from banks has been clarified to specifically limit such arrangements as short-term cash management tools-overdrafts on operational bank accounts for up to 30 days; borrowings from banks as advances paid to the Commonwealth for up to 90 days; and other types of credit arrangements, to be prescribed by the regulations, such as those represented by credit card and cabcharge transactions, for up to 60 days. It should be noted that these arrangements confer no power for the Commonwealth to spend otherwise than as authorised by parliament through appropriations. One of the most 'visible changes to be brought about by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is in relation to the accounting classifications of money in the Commonwealth's possession. The trust fund established by section 60 of the Audit Act is to be abolished and replaced by two purpose based funds-the. reserved money fund and the commercial activities fund. Apart from components of the reserved money fund that may be established pursuant to other enactments, the components of these two funds will be established or varied by finance minister's determinations. The effect of such determinations will be to specify the kinds of money that may be drawn from the consolidated revenue fund or loan fund and credited to the particular component and the purposes on which that money may then be spent. Since the spending of money from such a fund is in all respects an appropriation, the proposed act will require that these determinations by the finance minister be tabled as disallowable instruments that do not take effect until the period for disallowance has passed. This procedure is more visible and provides a greater measure of parliamentary control than has traditionally been the case in the establishment of trust accounts under the Audit Act. Payments of public money, including debiting a fund against an appropriation, will be controlled by a system of 'drawing rights', to be issued by the finance minister. This system is predicated on the fact that the laws made by parliament relating to appropriations, variously compelling or permitting the executive government to spend, always specify the fund being appropriated and the purpose of the spending. Such laws may also specify an amount and a time frame. It would be a breach of section 83 of the constitution for spending to occur in any instance outside of those parameters, so the act will stipulate the finance minister has no capacity to issue valid drawing rights that are inconsistent with the terms of the relevant appropriation law and will make it an indictable offence for an official or minister to knowingly spend, or seek to spend, otherwise than in accordance with a valid drawing right. The act would create a standing appropriation out of which rewards could be paid in certain circumstances for information furnished that led to the apprehension of persons defrauding the Commonwealth. The government is serious about deterring and detecting fraud against the Commonwealth, and the potential for this measure to assist in that battle cannot be overlooked. Nevertheless, the government acknowledges the recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and· Public Administration in its report on the inquiry into fraud on the Commonwealth, Focusing on fraud, tabled in November 1993, that there be no such formal scheme of rewards. The response to that report, including that recommendation, is being considered by the government and will be announced shortly. Should it transpire that the government accepts the committee's recommendation, the government will move for this clause's removal from the bill. The act would put into the principallegislation the powers that are presently carried only in finance regulations in relation to providing a source of authority for the Presiding Officers to approve expenditure under appropriations for parliamentary departments. The present Audit Act is generally silent on matters of management performance. The new act seeks to remedy this through particular responsibilities being expressly placed on chief executives of agencies for which they may then be held accountable. They are to be required to manage the affairs of their agencies efficiently, effectively and ethically to the extent allowed by law. They will also be required to implement fraud control plans and establish audit committees. The accountability mechanisms to mesh with these responsibilities will include powers of the finance minister to obtain financial statements and that other reports more frequently than annually from agencies. Importantly, it is proposed that chief executives be permitted to subdelegate to officials any of the act's finance minister's powers or functions, unless the minister has imposed a restriction prohibiting or limiting such subdelegation. These arrangements for subdelegating are intended to achieve a major strengthening in the financial framework. Chief executives are better placed than the finance minister to manage, to monitor and to control the activities of those officials who perform the delegated tasks. It will thus be practicable to hold chief executives accountable to the finance minister in these respects, whereas it is currently quite impracticable to do so under the existing Audit Act's delegation structures where thousands of individual officials are directly delegated by the finance minister. The government believes that this proposed law represents a significant landmark in sharpening and strengthening the framework of Commonwealth financial administration. I commend the bill to the House. NA COMPANIES BILL 1994 The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994 is one of three bills forming the package of legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901. The bill seeks to replace and enhance part XI of the Audit Act 1901, which currently provides standard financial provisions for Commonwealth authorities and certain other bodies. It is also intended course that the proposed Commonwea1th Authorities and Companies Act will replace individual financial provisions contained in the enabling legislation of authorities not subject to part XI. As I foreshadowed in the second reading speech for the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994, the government will be moving a number of amendments to this package of legislation to pick up issues that have been considered following the report on the three bills by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on 22 September 1994. The underlying purpose of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act is to replace, with a single set of requireone ments, the myriad of variations on a similar theme scattered throughout the enabling legislation of Commonwealth authorities and the constitutions of Commonwealth companies. The approach proposed by this bill would enable the accountability requirements of Commonwealth controlled bodies to be viewed as a whole and should significantly streamline the focus of the government's and the parliament's interest in this area. Broadly, the bill proposes a single set of core reporting and auditing requirements for djrectors of 'Commonwealth authorities' and sets out standards of conduct for executive officers. Many of these requirements are modelled on comparable areas of the Corporations Law as well as best practice currently applying to individual authorities. The bill also proposes a single set of requirements for ensuring that 'wholly-owned Commonwealth companies' keep ministers and the parliament informed of their activities. In particular, this bill seeks to extend the mandate of the Auditor-General to be the sole external auditor of all Commonwealth authorities and companies, and their subsidiaries, without exception. At the same time it would modernise the requirements for the Auditor General's reports on authorities making them consistent with those required by the Corporations Law. In some areas, the bill traverses ground that is covered, to varying degrees, in the enabling legislation of authorities and the constitutional in due documents of companies. These areas of overlap will be removed by consequential amendments to the enabling legislation and are contained in the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1994, which I propose to introduce shortly. Similarly, it is intended to replace areas of overlap in the memoranda and articles of association of Commonwealth companies with cross-references to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. . For the purposes of the bill, a 'Commonwealth authority' is, in essence, one established by an act as a body corporate for a public purpose and which holds money on its own account. A 'Commonwealth company' is in which the Commonwealth has a direct controlling interest-that is, there is no interposed entity between the company and the Commonwealth. All Commonwealth companies will be subject to the requirement for the Auditor General to report on their financial statements, and the financial statements of their subsidiaries, and for their annual reports to be tabled in the parliament. However, only 'whollyowned Commonwealth companies' are to be subject to the other provisions in the bill relating to companies. This reflects the difficulty-in the case of Commonwealth controlled companies which have private shareholders-of imposing a general regime which requires the provision of plans and reports only to ministers: namely, a risk of oppression actions under the Corporations Law by minority shareholders who might perceive discrimination against their interests. I will now briefly outline the main provisions of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. The annual report is seen as the centrepiece of directors' accountability to the parliament. The bill proposes that directors of Commonwealth authorities must prepare an annual report containing a report of operations, financial statements and ""a report by the Auditor-General on the financial statements. The report of operations and the financial statements must be prepared in accordance with finance minister's orders and the directors and the Auditor-General must certify whether, in their opinion, the financial statements give a 'true and fair view' of the matters required-to be reported. I should mention that the proposed obligations on directors, as individuals, will replace more general obligations on authorities under existing arrangements. This approach is similar in principle to that applied to companies by the Corporations Law and is intended to clarify the accountability arrangements. I should also mention that the finance minister's orders will be disallowable instruments, thereby ensuring an ongoing role for the parliament in determining the reporting obligations of directors of Commonwealth authorities. The directors of both Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies will be required to give the responsible minister a copy of their annual report, or annual general meeting documents, which the Minister must in tum table in each House of the parliament. There are a number of other reporting obligations proposed by this bill. The finance minister may require Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned companies to prepare half-yearly or quarterly financial statements. The statements must be given to the responsible minister within two months after the end of the period to which they relate and must be tabled in each House as soon as practicable. It is envisaged that this requirement to prepare interim financial statements will mainly be applied to bodies with a high degree of independence, such as government business enterprises-GBEs. Of course, as the government, from time to time, develops new approaches to providing the services now provided by GBEs, there may be a need to look again at how the proposed act will apply to those bodies. Directors will be required to keep the responsible minister informed of the operations of Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned companies, including their subsidiaries, and to give the responsible minister and the finance minister such reports, documents and information as they may require. Where the finance minister requires such reports, documents and information it is intended that, in the normal course, he or she will first consult with the responsible minister and provide a copy of such reports or documents to that minister. Such consultative arrangements have not been included in the bill, because of long standing policy, reaffirmed by successive governments, that as a general rule the internal operations of government should not be reflected in legislation. Directors must also notify the responsible minister of certain proposed activities such as significant acquisitions or disposals of shares or businesses, changes in business activities or involvement in partnerships, trusts or joint ventures. However, the responsible minister may give written guidelines, as to the coverage of the matters to be notified and may in writing exempt the directors from notifying particulars of proposals to form or participate in the formation of a company. Directors of a government business enterprise, whether constituted as an authority or a company, must prepare a corporate plan at least once a year and give it to the responsible minister. This is a key planning document that will provide the responsible minister with financial and other performance information. The bill also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions relating to the governance of Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned Commonwealth companies. It its parent. proposes that the responsible minister may, after consulting with directors, notify them general policies of the government that capable of being applied to the authority company concerned. The directors must ensure that such policies are carried out and, as far as practicable, ensure that they are also carried out in relation to any subsidiaries. Such policies cannot be in conflict with any statutory obligations of a particular authority or company. This provision is intended to cover government policies that are applicable to the Commonwealth public sector in genertheir al-for example, policies relating to trade contact with foreign countries or equal emimproper ployment opportunity. Nevertheless, in recognition of their special roles, and so as to avoid any misconceptions in so far as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service are concerned, I' intend to propose consequential amendments to their enabling acts through the foreshadowed Audit (Transiauthority tional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill that will make it abundantly clear that this provision cannot affect the editorial policy independence of those bodies. The bill also provides that directors must establish and maintain an audit committee. The government views this as a step in the improving internal control and communication within Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned companies as well as the accountabiliby ty of their management. It will also ensure that directors have appropriate assistance the discharge of their accounting and financial reporting obligations. Consistent with the government's response to a recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administraparticulars tion in its 1989 report on government comregulation. panies and their reporting requirements, the bill provides that a Commonwealth authority must ensure that none of its subsidiaries anything that the authority itself does not have power to do. This does not, of course, preclude the parliament from passing legislaaccountability tion to empower a subsidiary to perform a particular activity that exceeds the powers of The bill imposes standards of conduct on of executive officers of Commonwealth authoriare ties broadly equivalent to the standards or already imposed on executive officers of companies 'by the Corporations Law. Executive officers include directors and any other persons who are concerned in, or take part in, the management of the authority. Specifically, the bill provides that 'executive officers' must at all times act honestly and exercise a reasonable degree of care and diligence in the exercise of their powers and the discharge of duties. Also, an executive officer, or former executive officer, must not make use of inside information, or of his or her position as an executive officer, in order to gain an advantage for any person, either directly or indirectly, or cause detriment to the authority. Both criminal and civil sanctions are provided for contravention of these provisions. In addition, a director of a Commonwealth who has an interest in a matter that is being considered, or about to be considered, by the board must, as soon as posor sible after he or she becomes aware of the situation, disclose the nature of the interest concerned at a meeting of the board. The director must not participate in deliberations on the matter concerned unless the board or responsible minister determines otherwise. Finally, in accordance with the government's response to another recommendation the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its report on in government companies and their reporting requirements, the bill provides that the responsible minister shall table in each House particulars of any new or varied direct Commonwealth interest in a company. The required are to be prescribed by The proposals put forward in this bill will have no direct impact on government revdoes enues or outlays. However, I am confident that, through the implementation of a more streamlined and consistent operational and framework for Commonwealth authorities and companies, improved performance and value for money will be achieved both for the Commonwealth and for Australians generally. I commend the bill to the House. AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1994 This bill is one of the package of three bills to replace the Audit Act 1901. The other two bills are the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994. The purposes of the Auditor-General Bill are to continue the statutory office of the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth of Australia; to specify the powers and functions of the Auditor-General; to establish the Australian National Audit Office; and to provide, in tum, for the independent audit of the Australian National Audit Office. The bill draws heavily on the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, JCPA, in report 296-The Auditor General: ally of the people and parliament. The effect of the bill's proposed provisions will be to support the continued functional and professional independence of the Auditor General from the executive government. The corollary is that the Auditor-General's special relationship with the parliament is protected. As I foreshadowed in the second reading speech for the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994, the government will be moving a number of amendments to this package of legislation to pick up issues that have been considered following the report on the three bills by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on 22 September 1994. I now wish to provide an outline of the proposed Auditor-General Act. The bill specifies there is to be an Auditor General for the Commonwealth of Australia and details the appointment and conditions of the office. The Auditor-General will continue to be appointed by the Governor General on the recommendation of the appropriate minister-which, under the administrative arrangements orders, will be the Prime Minister. Under arrangements proposed in this bill, prior to advising the Governor General, the Prime Minister must consult with the finance minister, the chairman of the JCPA and a nominee of the Leader of the Opposition. As recommended by the JCPA in report 331, the government will seek an amendment to the provision in the present bill to include a requirement for the Prime Minister to also consult with the chairperson of the audit committee of parliament, as appropriate. The bill also includes provisions for the removal of the Auditor-General by the Governor General following a petition by both houses of the parliament in the same session. The Auditor-General has a broad mandate to be enshrined in legislation, replacing the existing arrangements whereby the Auditor General's mandate is only partly derived from legislation and partly from government policy. The Auditor-General will have a mandate to undertake the audit of the financial statements of all Commonwealth bodies. In addition, the Auditor-General may undertake performance audits of Commonwealth bodies at his or her discretion, the only exception being in respect of government business enterprises-GBEswhere the accountability framework estab. lished by the government requires GBEs to focus on performance and to improve the return to the Commonwealth as shareholder. Despite the focus on performance by GBEs, the government nevertheless proposes that parliament or a minister may request the Auditor-General to carry out a performance audit of a GBE or GBE subsidiary. However, the government has reflected on the need to continue the principle, as already accepted under the Audit Act, of forbearance in consideration of the investment interests of private shareholders in partially privatised Commonwealth companies. Performance audits are an extra feature on the accountability landscape peculiar to public sector bodies. It does not follow, however, that the often high parliamentary profile given the reports of such audits would always be beneficial to the interests of the companies' private investor/shareholders. The government will, therefore, be proposing an amendment whereby a performance audit of a GBE company would be invited only if the company was wholly owned by the Commonwealth. The bill seeks to permit the Auditor-General to enter into an arrangement with any person or body to conduct financial statements audits or performance audits, or to provide services that are of a kind that are normally performed by auditors. These arrangements would be at the discretion of the Auditor-General and be undertaken where he or she considers there is a benefit to the Commonwealth. The bill proposes that the Auditor-General and authorised officials have full and free access to information, documents and premises. These powers are considerable in their scope but are necessary if the Auditor-General is to fulfil his or her obligations to the parliament. The information gathering powers are complemented with strong secrecy and penalty provisions for any person performing an Auditor-General function. The bill seeks to establish the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority with the sole function of assisting the Auditor-General. The staff of the Australian National Audit Office are to be appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922, as a reflection of its status as a core public service. Nevertheless, should the staff's existing skills and expertise need to. be mented from time to time, the bill also seeks to preserve the Auditor-General's flexibility to engage any person-for example, to contract with auditors from the private sector-to assist in the performance of an Auditor General function. The government sees the establishment of the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority as an important symbolic step to demonstrate its commitment to the independence of the Auditor-General and his or her office. Further, the bill would establish the office of independent auditor, who is the parliament's auditor of the Australian National Audit Office. It provides for the appointment and conditions of the office which, as far as are appropriate, mirror those of the Auditor General in relation to his or her audit functions for the balance of the Commonwealth. The independent auditor is to be a part-time statutory officer appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the appropriate minister, who will have first consulted with the chairman of the JCPA. The independent auditor is to hold qualifications and have the experience determined necessary by the minister after consultation with the chairman of the JCPA. The government will seek an amendment to this provision to include a requirement for the minister to also consult with the chairperson of the audit committee of parliament, as appropriate. As previously indicated, the government has drawn heavily on the recommendations of the JCPA in framing this legislation. While the committee's recommendations have not been taken up in their entirety, the provisions of this bill and the complementary provisions in the other two bills in the package ensure that the Auditor-General can fulfil, independently, the role demanded by this parliament, and with all the professional and functional freedom required for the task. The Auditor-General plays a vital role in giving credibility to Australia's system of parliamentary governance, and this legislation will preserve and strengthen that role. I commend the bill to the House.  aug- package of bills presents a long overdue improvement and overhaul of the Audit Act 1901. The bills provide for greater scrutiny of government operations and businesses and for greater independence of the Auditor-General. The Australian people have a right to know that their money and interests are being adequately looked after by the Commonwealth. It is especially important when dealing with a government such as this one, which rules by grubby deals and bias. I take this opportunity to condemn the government for its handling of these bills as they come before this House. It is ironic that the coalition, which represents many millions of people throughout the nation, could not get hold of a copy of the government's amendments after the government established its direction in regard to the bills. The government is wrapping itself in greater accountability, while at the same time deliberately seeking to reduce the effectiveness of parliament and its scrutiny of bills. This is representative of this government's complete disdain for the parliament and its effect on its representatives. This government fears accountability. Evidence of the fear of accountability of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is found in the fact that he and his ministers decided to face parliament only twice in a sitting week to answer questions. This grubby little incident serves as a stark reminder of why these bills are so sorely needed. This government cannot even deal with these bills concerning open and honest government in an open and honest way. The Financial Management and Accountability Bill provides stringent new requirements for the handling of Commonwealth funds. Its scope covers the underlying principles that to govern the activities of persons in organisaneed tions that financially are agents of the Commonwealth. The fundamental principles of financial control contained in the Audit Act 1901 have been incorporated in these bills. This bill is intended to improve the quality and clarity of understanding of the Commonwealth financial management framework and to sharpen accountability for financial management performance. This, again, is entirely appropriate. There should be strict controls over how taxpayers' finances are managed. It is a great pity, however, that the greater accountability requirements within the bill are not carried over into government policy. This is a government of mates for mates. The ordinary Australian rates a mention only once every three years when the Prime Minister promises the world and then reneges on those promises. This government is typified by waste, shady deals and taxpayer funded buy-offs. There are numerous examples of these. One only has to recall the sports rorts affair, the maritime union buy-off, the Prime Minister's table, the Prime Minister's paintings, and the credit card controversy within the Lodge itself. Sadly, tight financial requirements will not always be prevalent in this government's case. What will stop all this is a government with integrity which is in touch with the things that matter to ordinary Australians, not a government, such as the present one, which uses taxpayers' money to buy more and more true believers. It is for this reason that the coaliout tion must always be on its guard against government attempts to restrict and limit parliamentary scrutiny. True to form, .this government has sought to do just that. I refer to the disallowance provisions for commercial funds. The standard provision for disallowance is 15 days. What does the government want to do? It wants to strip away parliament's oversight by taking the disallowance time down to just five days. What is the hurry? Is the government so badly organised that allowing parliament to have proper scrutiny w.ould disrupt financial plans? Does the government view parliament with contempt and as something to be avoided? are Surely, a Commonwealth entity which has for commercial provisions can take account of parliament's sittings in its plans? Call me old fashioned, but I like to think that parliament and its elected representatives should still figure in the minds of Commonwealth entities. Remember parliament? You are sitting in it! Parliament is the place that looks after the interests of ordinary Australians, those people who do not figure in the ALP's grandiose plans. At least one group still represents the cares of ordinary Australians, and that is the coalition. In order to uphold the interests of ordinary Australians in this House, the coalition will be moving an amendment to standardise the disallowance provisions. The parliament must be given sufficient time to scrutinise instruments which will affect the lives of the people we represent. I certainly hope that the government will have enough integrity to change its mind and vote with us, but that would be running against form. I tum now to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill. This bill will enhance part 11 of the Audit Act 1901, which currently provides standard financial provisions for public authorities and certain other bodies. It will also replace individual financial provisions contained in the enabling legislation of authorities not subject to part 11. The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill will provide a single set of core reporting and auditing requirements for directors of Commonwealth authorities and set standards of conduct for executive officers. Many of these requirements are based on i, comparable Corporations Law as well as the best practice applying to individual authorities. The Auditor-General's mandate will be extended to all Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies without exception, and this is how it should be. The public has a right to expect that public businesses are following sound financial reporting. For too long there has been this hole in Commonwealth law. Commonwealth companies have been expected to act in a commercial sense or attain best practice but the auditing provisions have not been able to back this up. Of course, the best way to obtain best practice in government businesses is to expose them to competition from the private sector. Why should the taxpayer be sinking money into an enterprise which can most effectively be operated in the private sector? Where a Commonwealth business can operate in the commercial marketplace to the benefit of the economy, it should be allowed to do so. The marketplace will impose far greater discipline with lower cost and at lower prices than any amount of government tinkering and social engineering. This has at last dawned on the government and so they have stolen the coalition's principles in this area well, albeit only to the extent allowed by its ACTU masters. As usual, the ALP's rhetoric far outstrips its actions. Modem financial management and accounting principles are an important support to the principles of greater commercial practice. It is a truism, however, that merely updating financial requirements will not force companies to act commercially. Where possible, government businesses must be allowed to take their chances in the marketplace if consumers and the nation are to get maximum benefit from the policy. Typically, however, the Labor Party has also bastardised this principle for petty politipowers cal reasons. I refer, of course, to the government's spineless response to the Maritime Union thuggery and intimidation. Rather than rule in the interest of the nation, the government acted to protect and pay off its mates. Of course, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) the minister for backflips, was only too happy to dip into the taxpayers' purse so that his union mates could have more comfort in the workplace. So .much for exposing businesses and their work practice to competition in the market. But it does not stop there. The so-called privatisation program of the government is a farce. Privatisation is clearly the best way of exposing appropriate government business enterprises to full commercial reality. But this government could not sell heaters in the Arctic. On the Qantas float, it would be fair to say that the Minister for Finance, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), is having trouble getting the nose wheel down for the .sale. In the sorry saga of ANL, while the government is throwing taxpayers' money around and desperately trying to come up with a sale, ANL's finances are dead in the water. So it really is not good enough to simply put out new legislation on accounting requirements. This must be backed up by active policies to expose Commonwealth companies to commercial pressure and best practice. But given that the Keating government has completely dropped the ball on micro-economic reform, there is little chance of the hard as decisions being made. It is the Auditor General's bill where the government has again dropped the ball. To be effective, the Auditor General must be truly independent and answerable to the parliament, not the executive. The executive must not be able to apply pressure-either implicit or explicit-to gain a more agreeable finding. This bill improves the powers of the Auditor-General to gather information and ensure that taxpayers' interests are being looked after. It establishes the office of Auditor-General for the Commonwealth and sets the Auditor-General's functions. The Auditor-General will have new, stronger of entry and information gathering. The coalition fully endorses these new principles, but would prefer to put in place even stronger safeguards of the Auditor-General's independence. We believe in this because, unlike the government, the coalition has nothing to fear from an independent Auditor General. The coalition believes that the people's representatives should have oversight of the Auditor-General. While it is correct to increase the financial and functional independence of the Auditor General by providing independent powers of spending within the appropriation, we must do more to ensure that the Auditor-General is an instrument of the parliament. The coalition is strongly of the view that oversight of the Auditor-General should be done by an Audit Committee of the Parliament by modifying the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. This committee will be a permanent feature of the parliament; it will not exist as a whim of the government. Government business enterprises are an important sector of the economy. They are frequently an important input to the economy. For this reason, they must be functioning efficiently and effectively. To assist in this, the coalition feels that they should be open to the scrutiny of the Auditor-General and, through that office, the parliament. The coalition will be moving an amendment to allow the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of public enterprises wherever desired if there is significant or complete government ownership. The Auditor-General should not be constrained by ministerial veto or lower house votes. If the Auditor-General has concerns about the performance of a GBE, then the Auditor-General should rightly be able to investigate that matter. I cannot think why the government would oppose this. Perhaps greater scrutiny will help prevent more ANLs and taxpayer-funded buyouts.",58
30,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"ANL-there's a reason.  rightly points out, ANL is a very good example of the point that we are making. But perhaps that is the problem. If I ran a business as badly as this government clearly runs its businesses, I would not want an independent auditor dropping in and looking over my shoulder. You never know what inefficient practices might be hiding under various rocks. The government will of course say that if it is a GBE then it is operating in a commercial environment and does not need an independent auditor doing inconvenient performance audits. However, one only has to mention the letters ANL to bring this argument undone. If I were a Labor minister who had just been party to handing out millions to prop up the long-term failure of an enterprise, I would stay well clear of that argument. There is clearly a need for performance audits and we will be proposing amendments to the bill accordingly. We are aware, however, that some GBEs have private sector holdings. To this end, the Audit Committee will be able to prevent random audits if it is satisfied that there is sufficient private sector involvement to impose market discipline on poorly performing GBEs. One of the most important tasks is the selection of the Auditor-General. There must be no hint of political patronage or subversion of responsibilities to the Australian people. For this reason, the representatives of the Australian people must have a say in who is selected. The coalition will be moving an amendment that the Leader of the Opposition and the Audit Committee of the Parliament must also give their approval in selection. I do not mean consult with the Leader of the Opposition and the Audit Committee; I mean approval must be sought. Consultation can be an exchange of letters, which can later be discarded. I am sure the government would not want this and it is just an oversight on its behalf, but we have to be sure. This approval will ensure that all appointments are sound and non-political, as they should be. The Auditor-General performs a most serious responsibility-that of ensuring that the funds and agencies of the Australian people are properly managed and maintained. To this end, it is important that the Auditor General be able to attract quality officers. For this reason, the coalition will be moving to allow the Auditor-General to have greater control over salaries and staff conditions. While the Auditor-General will have to heed the government's industrial relations policy, . the Auditor-General should be able to offer competitive packages to attract and keep the best people. To an effective Auditor-General, the people themselves are the most important assets, and the Auditor-General must have the freedom to treat them accordingly. "" I feel confident that the Australian people would wish to see a strong and effective Auditor-General so that the rorts can be dug out and exposed to scrutiny. It is this that the government runs from, like Dracula from light. With these bills it will once again be up to the coalition to finish the job. The government started but could not make the hard yards on the issues that matter to raise accountability to where it belongs. The coalition amendments will expose the shortfalls in this bill. As I mentioned previously in my address, the opposition will be moving a number of amendments to the Auditor-General Bill and the Financial Management and Accountability Bill.",68
31,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"Before I start to deal in some detail with the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill and the Auditor General Bill, I would like to take the opportunity to respond briefly to one of the points that was made by the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), who is leading for the opposition in connection with this legislation. There are a number of issues which the member for Forrest raised, and which presumablymembers of the opposition generally will take up, with which I would have some sympathy. I was a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which had a look at that legislation as a result of a reference by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), and I contributed towards a unanimous report from that committee. The member for Forrest criticised the government in connection with what he referred to as the government's conduct with these bills, and he made reference to the government's trying to avoid accountability. That is a remarkable-and unsubstantiatedclaim for any member of the opposition to make. It was on a motion of the Minister for Finance himself that those three bills-in the sense of their being draft bills after they were introduced-were referred to the Public Accounts Committee. The committee consists of nine government . members and six opposition members from both this House and the Senate. The bills were the subject of very exhausting and exhaustive examination by that committee. The result was Report 33.1, which I think contains 39 recommendations-most of which have been adopted by the government.  been.",69
32,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"I will be dealing with some of those which the member for Forrest refers to as the most important. I know that the opposition is pursuing some of those by way of amendments, of which the member for Forrest has given notice. Some of the deficiencies of those proposed amendments are in connection with the initial recommendations and proposals made by the Public Accounts Committee. I applaud this process of legislation being referred to committees of the parliament for detailed examination and for report back and recommendations to the minister and the government. There is, as far as government members are concerned, a difficulty associated with it. We were part of that report. To a very large extent, the members of the government on that committee endorsed the essence of some of those amendments which have been moved by the opposition. Let me make it perfectly clear that I will not be embarrassed about voting with the government on this legislation. That is the way this system, this institution, liberal democracies and Westminster systems of parliament operate. They are not questions of conscience, they are not questions of principle; they are questions which have technical significance, and they simply reflect the way in which the government is responding to this issue.",69
33,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,You can change your mind from day to day.,69
34,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"In view of that interjection, let me make this point: up until recent years, since 1901 when the Commonwealth was established, those people who have tended to monopolise national government in Australia, in the Commonwealth, have been members of the coalition. The Audit Act, which we are now in the process of replacing, was the fourth item of legislation enacted by the new Commonwealth government back in 1901. That legislation, which has undoubtedly had numerous amendments, has existed until now. It was this government which put into place not only this legislation but all of the processes which have led up to it. We are too often amused by some of the absurd positions which are adopted by the opposition. I mentioned in passing that the legislation was first enacted in 1901. As I said, there have been many amendments. To a very large extent, those amendments have sought to respond to changing circumstances. But this is the first comprehensive, overall review leading to the complete restructuring of the government's audit legislation. It is a complete, new, comprehensive, more appropriate and contemporary approach to the whole question of financial accountability within the public sector. The basic reason for this legislation is the present act, that act which has persisted with amendments since 1901, has become increasingly less able to accommodate the needs and the realities of the modem public sector. This inadequacy was recognised in the 1989 report of the Public Accounts Committee on the Auditor-General. That report recommended that the act be repealed and replaced with legislation which was more in tune with present day realities, which was more effective in addressing their needs and which allowed greater flexibility in the financial management of public sector operations. The government accepted that recommendation. This legislation is the result. The Public Accounts Committee, as I indicated, became involved as a result of the Minister for Finance referring the legislation to it on 29 June this year. On that same day, as a result of a motion in the Senate, the Public Accounts Committee had referred to it the question of the establishment of an audit committee. As a result of both of those references to the Public Accounts Committee we now have this very comprehensive report-report 331-of the Public Accounts Committee. The committee tabled its report on 22 September. The government has considered that report. This legislation represents a modification of the initial legislation as a result of many of those recommendations made by the Public Accounts Committee. This package comprises three bills: the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, referred to generally now as the FMA Bill; the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill, referred to more generally as the CAC Bill; and the Auditor-General Bill. The general construction of this legislation was referred to in some detail by the Minister for Finance in his second reading speech. But let me refer very briefly by way of background to the essence of this legislation. The FMA Bill, for example, establishes appropriate arrangements for financial management and accountability within Commonwealth agencies. For the purpose of the legislation, Commonwealth agencies are those departments and statutory authorities whose enabling legislathat tion does not give them legal ownership of money or property separate from the Commonwealth. Those Commonwealth authorities and companies which do legally own money or property on their own account are those which have been picked up in the CAC Bill. That legislation has been necessary in particular to draw together, to coordinate and to integrate all of the existing provisions which are scattered through diverse and disparate sources. The legislation is designed to make consistent and explicit the accountability requirements for each type of Commonwealth entity. The Auditor-General Bill-and this is the legislation to which most attention is being given by the government and by way of amendments proposed by the opposition-is a very comprehensive piece of legislation. It not only establishes the offices of the Auditor General and the Independent Auditor but also describes their powers and, as the minister indicated in his second reading speech, it establishes the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority to provide resources and support services to the Auditor General in the carrying out of the responsibilities which he has. It is interesting to note the comments the member for Forrest made about accountability and whether or not the government's conduct in relation to these bills has been adequate. During the inquiry which the Public Accounts Committee undertook it had occasion to deal with a letter written in response to an approach by the PAC to the Secretary to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Dr Keating. Dr Keating concluded his letter by saying: ... it is difficult to think of any Bills which been subject to longer and more extensive consultation before being presented to the Parliament. There is no way that the claims of the kind that the member for Forrest has made can, in any real sense, be substantiated. I will now refer to the background to the reference of those three bills to the Public Accounts Committee. The Procedure Committee in its report entitled About time referred to old standing order 221 which permitted bills of the parliament to be referred to a select committee following their second reading. No bills had ever been referred under that provision, although the standing orders had been suspended on occasions to refer a bill to a joint select committee immediately following the minister's second reading speech. The Procedure Committee considered that a procedural mechanism to permit a bill to be referred to a standing committee needed to be provided formally in the standing orders and it made an appropriate recommendation. That recommendation has been picked up in new standing order 217 A. That particular provision provides a more effective mechanism by which legislation can be referred to committees. Since that special provision was made a number of bills have been referred to committees. For example, on 4 May a bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, on 11 May a bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, on 7 June a bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, on 29 June this package of three bills was referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and on 25 August the Minister for Employment, Education and ,Training (Mr Crean) referred the Employment I Services Bill 1994 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As a result, what we have done is introduce, where necessary and appropriate, a new process into the legislative continuum-the initiation of legislation, the preparation of legislation, the work of Parliamentary Counsel, the political party processes, cabinet have consideration and so on. Another stage has been introduced as a result of these changes. I referred to this earlier when I said I welcomed and applauded the change. I think it has been a very desirable change. The effectiveness of that process is reflected not only in the very effective way in which the Public Accounts Committee gave consideration to these three bills but also in the quality of report which it brought down and now, the final stage in tpis process, the fact that the government has responded fa-ourably to so many of the proposals. That was an undertaking given by the Minister for Finance when he moved the motion to refer the legislation to the Public Accounts Committee. Referring to the three bills, he said: These bills, like few others, will ultimately have an impact on the entire field of government activity, simply because almost every action of the government has a financial implication. The JCPA was the body which initiated action to replace the Audit Act and the government believes that it should be the body to formally examine, in the first instance and on behalf of the parliament, the proposed outcome of this action. He concluded with a statement which really underlines the sincerity with which the government adopted this process. The minister said: As I have indicated, virtually by implication in the things that I have been saying, the government is not so proud of its authorship in this regard that it is going to take umbrage at getting additional advice from any sources and we look forward to the consultative processes yet in hand. Of course, the way in which the government has responded to that report indicates that that was not an idle statement by the Minister for Finance. It is one which the Minister for Finance quite clearly has honoured by the way he has responded to that report. I mentioned that the opposition was taking up some of the particular items of the Public Accounts Committee report in connection with what it had identified as some of the more important elements of the legislation. Certainly as far as the Auditor-General legislation was concerned, I would agree that they are some of the more significant. The particular recommendations from the Public Accounts Committee report that are picked up in these issues are recommendations 19 and 20, both of which are concerned with the capacity of the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of GBEs. The opposition proposes with its amendment to allow the Auditor-General to at any time conduct a performance audit of a Commonwealth authority or company. If that amendment were successful, the Auditor General would then have unilateral power to decide whether or not those performance audits would be undertaken. The provision the government has is that the performance audits be undertaken by the Auditor-General in two circumstances: first, if there is a request made by the responsible minister; or, second, if there is a resolution both houses of parliament. I do not believe that is unduly restrictive. I do not think there would be any difficulty, in the case of a good relationship existing between the Minister for Finance and the Auditor-General, as there should be, with the Auditor-General, if he or she were to become aware of any inadequacies which would appear to justify a performance audit, having some discussion with the responsible minister in connection with any other government authority, agency or entity and seeking that request. Let us be clear about this. If in a situation of that kind it became apparent to the Auditor-General that some sort of performance audit was necessary or desirable and a request was made to the minister for the request to go back to the Auditor-General, the minister would need good grounds to knock that back. The whole question of public accountability and public transparency in relation to issues of that kind indicates that any minister who sought to refuse a request of that kind would be very foolish indeed if the grounds for the request were clearly sufficient. Recommendation 28 of the Public Accounts Committee report is concerned with the conditions under which staff of the audit office should be employed. The suggestion has been made-this has also been picked up by one of the proposed amendments of the opposition-that it should be withdrawn from the Public Service Act provisions and that the Auditor-General should have the power to negotiate the terms and conditions under which he or she employs staff. That certainly would provide the Auditor General with greater management flexibility. It would perhaps also provide the Auditor General with the opportunity to attract and keep the necessary staff. I have not yet seen within the Auditor-General's office where this does not exist. I have never seen any significant deficiency in the operation of that office. It has an enormous and a very effective output. Recommendation 33 concerns the appointment of the Auditor-General. The recommendation was that approval should be sought of from the Leader of the Opposition or his or her representative, the Public Accounts Committee and the Audit Committee. The appointment of auditors-general has always been transparent. I have not noticed people making any claims in Australia that the appointments have been deficient. These are matters which can be revisited from time to time, but again I do not believe it is a matter of very great substance. Recommendations 37 to 39 concern the question of a separate audit committee. The government has chosen to establish a separate audit committee rather than have those responsibilities absorbed by the Public Accounts Committee. (Time expired)",69
35,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"I have listened in amazement to the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). I have searched the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for a dissenting report. I thought you agreed to all of these recommendations, but you now seem to disagree with them. I would have thought that, if that was your feeling on this matter, there would have been a dissenting report to this report. Could you refer me to the page or the chapter for that dissenting report? You will bow down to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) any time.",72

37,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"You are ignoring your responsibility to this parliament. You will bow down to the Department of Finance. You are supposed to be representing the views of the parliament, as a parliamentarian, for proper audit processes. You are saying that the Department of Finance is right. You are prepared to bow down to the Department of Finance, let it ride roughshod over the Auditor-General and do what it wants to him. Mr Robert Brown- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I do not think you are doing any of these things that the member is suggesting. If he is referring to me, he is still wrong.",73
38,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would not reflect on you, and you know that. But I am certainly reflecting on the member and his ambivalent attitudes. On the one hand, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, he puts his name to this report, saying that this is the best we can do. The chairman and the majority of members of the Public Accounts Committee are members of the Australian Labor Party. They all put their names to this report. Today, the Minister for Finance came into the chamber and said that he wanted to disallow and ignore the report. He is heavy handed, heavy footed-and heavy headed at times because he does not appear to pay enough attention to the detail of his great portfolio. What have we seen here? The Department of Finance, through the Minister for Finance, has disagreed with the report of the Public Accounts Committee. I remind the House that the Department of Finance is responsible for the bookkeeping processes of the Commonwealth. The Auditor-General is an individual, and his position is as an individual attached to the parliament. He is a . qeature of the parliament. We have roles as parliamentarians in this great liberal democracy that the member for Charlton referred to. He is prepared to deny his role as an elected member of parliament and bow down to the Department of Finance because it happens to disagree with the Auditor-General. I am shocked. The member would not put his name to a dissenting report. In this report, he agreed with every recommendation that the Public Accounts Committee came forward with. The Australian Labor Party is prepared to back the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance against the Auditor-General, which means denying the Auditor-General the capacity, given by this parliament, to do his job. After proper consideration, deliberation, taking of evidence and close discussion behind closed doors, the Public Accounts Committee arrived at certain decisions on behalf of the parliament, yet today the member came in and said, 'No, that was all wrong. The Department of Finance is right.'",73

40,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"As my colleague interjects, there was a bipartisan approach. I can find no disagreement in this report, yet today those opposite are all coming into the House and saying, 'We are going to. disagree with this.' I just cannot understand it. This is not the process of the parliament that I thought we would see apply to the Public Accounts Committee. The Minister for Finance himself is a past member of the Public Accounts Committee. Surely he understands the role of the parliament here--or maybe he was present only in body and not in spirit at some of those meetings where I was the Deputy Chairman of the committee. I remember him being there in body-that is hard to avoid seeing-but I do not know whether he was there in mind and spirit. Today he seems to be changing the role of the parliament.",73

42,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"As my colleague says, he is ratting on the parliament.",73
43,Mr SOMLYAY,Unknown,On the committee.,73
44,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"And he is ratting on the committee whose recommendations he should uphold and endorse. Let us look at the detail of the way in which this works. An independent auditor is the only protection the parliament and the people of Australia have against the government departments doing the wrong thing. We are ultimately responsible for their actions. Our servant, the Auditor-General-an independent person-has the function of examining the accounts of all of these departments, and he should have that function. How can we discharge our responsibility here in this parliament if the Auditor-General is not free of ministerial control? He reports to the parliament, goes to those great departments and examines not only whether their adding and subtracting are right but also whether the efficiency of their programs is right. We need to have that. In part, you are denying that process by going against a report that you yourself signed. An· independent auditor is a great protection for the citizens this nation against the abuse of government departments. . On many occasions members of the Public Accounts Committee have sat aghast as somebody appearing before the committee has explained a misinterpretation of the administration of public funds, and on occasion members of the Public Accounts Committee have disclosed the inisallocation of funds to the point of fraud. The Public Accounts Committee and the Auditor-General are protections for the Australian people. We have stopped fraud, we have prevented the abuse of funds, and saved the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in this process. I would have thought that you would see that today and say, 'Yes, we really want to have a refinement of that independence of the auditor.' I would have thought that you would have endorsed the recommendations of your own report. The other great truth of this process is that not only is the independence of the auditor critical but also we must have a process where ministers and departments are answerable to somebody. It is no good ministers just going into the cabinet room and being responsible to the Prime Minister. We as parliamentarians have a responsibility to our electors to see that ministers and their departments administer funds properly. The policy items and the political processes are a matter for debate-that is fair enough-but when it comes to the expenditure of public moneys and the way in which they are used ministers need to be squeaky clean and be answerable to the parliament. On those two grounds, I think this is an important report and an important response. The government has failed to fully demonstrate its understanding of the need for an independent audit office and of the role of the Public Accounts Committee. If the Public Accounts Committee and the auditor are used properly, they are great tools for governments to be able to disclose misallocation of funds and inappropriate administration. It is a strengthening tool for government to be able to use the Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Cominittee. No minister should be of ashamed of sending something off to the Auditor-General, because that enables the electorate to gain confidence that the right thing is being done. So I cannot understand why the minister is chary about pursuing the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee. I only have to give the House one recent example of the necessity of this process. In the last 24 hours we have had in the House two ministers trying to defend the administration of the Child Support Agency and the terrible mess and abuse that its examination by ont< of the parliamentary committees disclosed. Those ministers would be far better off saying: 'Why not have the inquiry adopted by the parliament?' That is the way it should work. This is the tradition of the great Public Accounts Committee stretching back decades to Henry Bland, who founded it. It goes right back to that time. You are leaving a tradition that you should not walk away from. The role of the Public Accounts Committee has been to work without dissent and you have presented a report without dissent. It is a great shame that you now choose to support the government's decisions in the way it has provided legislation. It is obvious that you do not agree with the government and that you do agree with your report, or you would not have signed it in the first place, but you are not prepared to say so and you are not prepared to vote soMr Robert Brown-Absolutely.",73
45,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,I hear you saying now that you do agree with your report and you disagree with the government. Is that right? Mr Robert Brown-Of course I do.,75
46,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,You cannot agree with both. Do you agree with the government and the report or do you just agree with the report? Mr Robert Brown-I agree with the report.,75
47,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"With the report. The member upholds the report and therefore he should cross the floor. Why shouldn'the? It is a simple matter. Let me outline some of the problems that the member disclosed in his speech where he sought to say, 'The committee is right but I am going to support the government.' Recommendation No. 33 of the committee says that before making a recommendation to the Governor General the minister must seek the approval of the following: the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives or his or her nominee, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and an audit committee of the parliament. That is a reasonable thing. That sets that person in the confident position that he or she has the endorsement of the whole parliament, both sides of the House, and there is no political game playing. That is a very sensible recommendation endorsed by all parties. It goes to the nub, very reason, of why we have an independent auditor. Here we have carried it one step further so that the parliament can agree through the political processes to the name of that person. That is one of the processes the government has chosen to reject. Is it because there is a difference of opinion between Mr Taylor and the Minister for Finance, or the Department of Finance? Is it because the minister himself has decided that he does not want an independent auditor, that he wants to be able to put his finger upon the person who becomes the Auditor-General? Is that the reason why the minister will not agree to the committee's recommendations? Why has the minister chosen to ignore this recommendation? Mr Tim Fischer-He is coming into the House.",75
48,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"As a former member of the Public Accounts Committee he should understand the need for an independent auditor. If you have looked around Australia and seen some of the splendid work done by auditors in state governments where they have disclosed the shortcomings of Labor administrations and you do not want that to occur, tell us the reason why there cannot be agreement on the appointment of the Auditor General because, once established, he is a great strengthening process, a great strengthening mechanism for the Minister for Finance and the whole administration of government. Government members have claimed that they are open to the liberal democracy of the parliament. I encourage them to demonstrate that. 'Open, liberal democracy' are the words the member used. I invite government members to put their money where their mouth is, to support their own report Mr Robert Brown-And cross the floor.",75
49,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"And cross the floor. Finally, I believe the opposition's proposal is a strengthening of the committee's recommendation to ensure that the auditor has the right to conduct an audit of the government business instrumentalities at any time of his choosing. I have given the example of the Child Support Agency. Another example is the the Australian National Line, where the Auditor-General ought to have the right to move in, select and take up an audit that he thinks needs doing on the efficiency of the operations of a government instrumentality. I notice that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has just come into the chamber. How could anyone rely upon him to send a reference to the auditor for the administration of the ANL, the CAA or any of those bodies that he is responsible for? He would never do it. The auditor ought to have the right to move in on the minister and say, 'Laurie, you are blowing it. I am going to have a look at your stuff and see whether or not your agencies are doing the right thing.' Debate (on motion by Mr Les Scott) adjourned. NA Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport",75
50,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Minister, did you read and initial on 28 July of this year a private briefing note from your department which stated that local residents and councillors to the north of Sydney airport were 'substantially underestimating the expected increases in aircraft movements over their suburbs'? Did the same briefing note say that there would, in fact, be a fourfold increase take-offs over suburbs to the north following the opening of the third runway at Sydney airport and a 140 per cent increase in overall traffic? Why did you conceal this from Marrickville councillors when you met them on that same day? Is it not a fact that when it comes to aircraft noise you have conned the people of Sydney?",76
51,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"I did meet with the Marrickville councillors late in July of this year and I informed them of exactly what I believed would be the impact of the opening of the third runway-that is, the parallel runway-at Kingsford Smith airport later on in the year. I indicated to them that it would have a very significant impact upon everyone in that flight corridor. Of course, I was well placed to make that observation to them. Mr Tim Fischer-A fourfold increase?",76
52,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"Indeed, I indicated to them in the clearest of terms that the increase would be in accordance with the environmental impact statementMr Tim Fischer-A fourfold increaseyou didn't say that, did you?",76
53,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,That predicted a fourfold or more increase in traffic on the north-south axis. That is the reason why back in 1989 I was indicating that I thought it was far preferable to build at Badgerys Creek than to build the parallel runway. I was doing that at a time when the Leader of the National Party was leading the charge for the third runway. Mr Tim Fischer-Absolutely.,76
54,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"Between 1988 and 1989, the member for Hume put out not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, not seven, not eight but nine separate press releases all calling for the parallel runway to be constructed and to be constructed immediately. Later in the debates today I am sure I will have ample opportunity to refer to some of the quotes contained in that material, but at this stage let me just recount to the Leader of the National Party what he had to say on 13 August 1991, way back then, in light of the environmental impact statement which I indicated to the Marrickville Council in the middle of this year would be consistent with in what would occur when the runway opened. The Leader of the National Party said: Any further delay in deciding on a third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life as well as economic insanity. The Federal Government must make three decisions. Firstly, to accept the expert advice that the third runway is environmentally more friendly than the present two runway setup. That is what he had said to say. This is based on the EIS. He also said: ... secondly, that safety is of paramount importance and finally that the vital tourist industry must no longer be choked off through lack of sensible economic thinking. I can agree with you about No. 2 and about No.3, but you have quickly forgotten about No. 2 in your call in recent days for the reopening of the east-west runway. You are aware, as I am aware, that the Civil Aviation Authority has said that, on the strongest of safety considerations, it should not operate across parallel runways and to do so will compromise safety. At the time. I was raising concerns about the parallel runway development, every one of you sitting opposite was leading the cry of the banshees. The lot of you; every last one of you. There it is there! This is bigger than Acme Fightback. This just happens to be all of the press releases issued by you lot during the period from 1988 through to 1991. There are press releases from the honourable member for Bennelong, Mr Howard, the nine that I referred to from Mr Sharp, and some terrific press releases from the Leader of the National Party. There is a whole heap from the membases ber for Fadden, Mr Jull. The right honourable member for New England got into the act; he could not stay away from it. And there are some from Senator Brownhill. Mr Blunt himself put out nine separate press releases saying, 'Build it. Build it now and concerns.' Mr MCGauran-And you did! You did!",76
55,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Gippsaudited land is a bit excited this afternoon.,77
56,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"Mr Fife, Mr Moore and Bolitho's Mr Cobb all get a big mention in that folder, but we will have a chance to discuss that later on this afternoon. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on point of order. We do appreciate the accoBrothers. lades being given to us by the Minister for Transport, but I point out that the question relate to why the minister concealed this Marrickville councillors when he met them that day. Would the minister please come back to the question.",77
57,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The minister is respondcern ing to the question. I think, in conclusion, he has indicated, this is a subject for some discussion this afternoon.",77
58,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"Yes, indeed. On that crucial note I might finish this answer. Thank you, Mr Speaker. Australian National Line",77
59,Mr LEO MCLEAY,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Based Finance seen reports of comments by Mr Bolitho, the former chairman of ANL, and the member for Hume concerning the Auditorforecasts, General's report on ANL? Does the minister accept their claims on the findings of Auditor-General?",77
60,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Mr Bolitho's current partial comments are largely a rehash of his media statements of 16 September. The variation being that he invokes the Auditor-General's were bleak. report, tabled on Monday, as supporting his position. It does no such thing, as even the most perfunctory reading of the report would make clear. With regard to valuations of ANL, which restructuring was the central matter in Mr Bolitho's stateas ments, the report makes clear the different for the various figures that have been bandied about. The report clearly states that the financial statements, such as ANL's 199293 accounts, do not purport to be a valuation of the company and the amount shown as all equity does not purport to be an indication of damn the the net value of the entity. The key finding of the report is that 'there is no necessary inconsistency between the 1992-93 financial statements and the August 1994 Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers report', which hardly supports Mr views. Mr Bolitho has also artificially set ANAO's confirmation that ANL was a going concern for the purpose of its 1992-93 accounts against the negative valua ation put on it by Price Waterhouse-Salomon That misses these very important points. did The ANAOstates that financial statements from prepared on a going concern basis do not purport to be the actual value of the entity at that point in time, even as a going concern. The audit office assessment of a going conwas largely predicated on an undrawn as credit facility of $75 million, which was underpinned by a perception of government support: that is, government ownership was in the positive book value of ANL. The Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers had a very different starting point. They started from the premise that the government wished to sell a substantial part of ANL. on their extensive consideration of a number of factors, including ANL's operating environment, poor operating performance and they took the view that even if the government resumed a net debt of $180 the million of ANL, as would most likely be required by any prospective purchaser, a or total trade sale or flotation of ANL was not viable in view of the fact that, even without financing costs, ANL's prospects While favouring an informal liquidation, they canvassed other options such as retention, which they deemed likely to involve major expense on the government's part, and with a view to a future trade sale well as suggesting that further study be undertaken. In effect, the government assigned the task of further study to the current ANL board, whose task it is to restructure ANL as a viable entity. I note in passing that the shadow minister for transport said on AM this morning: The head of the Department of Finance asked the Auditor-General to water down the criticisms the Auditor-General was making about the way this whole business of the sale of ANL has been handled. He went on to refer to 'very serious accusations being made by the Auditor-General himself'. There have also been other references by journalists to criticisms in the report of the actions of public officials. In fact, there are no criticisms or accusations, serious or otherwise, made by the Auditor-General in his report at all. This is the very point which the Secretary to Finance took up with the Auditor-General in his letter to him of last Friday evening. The fact that the general observations of principle, made by the Auditor-General in his report, have been misconstrued amply demonstrates the basis of the concern of the Secretary to Finance. For the record, I have no basis on which to question the discretion of public officials who advised the government on this matter. Illinformed commentary to the contrary is neither fair to the officials nor a productive way to further the debate. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport",77
61,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"My question is addressed, again, to the Minister for Transport. Why did the government open the third runway ahead of the completion of the new control tower and radar systems, when to do so would result in a reduction of capacity and create unnecessary additional noise over large sections of Sydney? Will the minister admit that this has led to one airline alone-that is, Ansettreceiving 30,000 complaints about delays in a single day, with 91 per cent of its flights through Sydney being delayed? Will he admit that his decision has reduced the capacity of Mascot from 64 movements per hour to 50 movements per hour, while at the same time increasing aircraft noise to intolerable levels for those under the flight paths? Will the minister finally be honest with affected residents and the travelling public and accept his responsibility for this total fiasco?",78
62,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"The impact of noise at Kingsford Smith airport is very sadly, I must say, consistent with the environmental impact study that was carried out, to which the Prime Minister referred in this House earlier this week, which indicated that, whilst 182,000 people were formerly affected by moderate or severe noise nuisance, under the new arrangements the number of 95,000 is much lower. That said, the fact is that one must feel very intensely for the 95,000 or so people who are at the moment experiencing the impact of the construction of the parallel runway. It is for that reason that cabinet will be considering, in the next day or so, a range of measures to tackle the question of alleviating this nuisance. It may be appropriate if I indicate to the House the sequence of events in respect of the timing of the opening of the parallel runway. On 1 February, which was right at the very start of my time as Minister for Transport, I wrote to the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority seeking advice on the best means to further improve safety at Sydney airport. I did so, against the backdrop of real concerns that had been expressed about the simops arrangements at Kingsford Smith-that is, the simultaneous take-offs and landings arrangements-which, of course, from a safety point of view, are not as optimum as parallel runways. That letter was prompted by concerns that had been put to me about the relative safety of simultaneous runway operations being used at that time in comparison with other possible methods of operating the airport. The Civil Aviation Authority wrote back to me on 15 February proposing a phased introduction of operations on the new parallel runway system to take advantage of the expected early completion of the new runway by the Federal Airports Corporation. In that advice to me on 15 February, the Civil Aviation Authority advised that operations could commence as early as September 1994, which is when it anticipated the new runway would be completed, by controlling traffic from the existing control tower, although there would be an initial slight fall in peak hour capacity. With the use of parallel runways, Sydney airport no longer requires the extensive use of simultaneous runway operations. Therefore, an already safe airport becomes that much safer. That was the backdrop to the timing of the opening. On the interim basis of the runway, the operations have very little impact as far as noise nuisance is concerned for the most affected people-the residents living in the corridor to the north of the airport-who are bearing the burden of the increased traffic. They bear that burden because, in the last month since operations commenced, some 30 plus per cent of take-offs have been to the north as a result of prevailing winds. When the wind blows at more than five knots apparent north, for safety considerations, planes need to take-off into that wind. Some planes can handle it better than others, but the fact is that the airport has to revert northern take-offs to suit some classes of planes, and that of necessity means that all planes have to take-off to the north in those circumstances. That has resulted in a very real impact. That is no different from the impact that will exist when the new tower opens in February or March next year. In respect of the new parallel runway, there are no take-offs to the north under the environmental impact statement. We are now seeing take-offs to the north, which is a noise nuisance factor of about double that of landings, principally brought on by the wind considerations at Kingsford Smith. That will not change at all. That somehow people are being exposed to greater noise nuisance than they should as a result of the airport being opened before the control tower is a total furphy. The fact is that a lot of planes have deviated from the flight paths in the last month. Lots of concerns have been very gravely expressed about the number of take-offs to the north, which is the very issue that cabinet will be addressing in the next day or so. Mr Tim Fischer-Will the full length of the east-west runway be available?",78
63,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"The Leader of the National Party asks whether the full length of .. the east-west runway will be available. Let me make it very clear to him and to the House that the east-west runway is available for those situations when there is too much cross-wind to operate the parallel runways. That is the case now, and will continue to be the case in the future. Let us be quite clear about that. On the first five days of operations of the new airport arrangements after the parallel runway was opened, because of exceptional westerly winds which prevailed in Sydney and, indeed, right across New South Wales at that time, the east-west runway was used exclusively. For those first five days, the burden of noise was overwhelmingly carried by people in the east-west corridor. That will be the case whenever that runway is required for operational reasons. Having said that, it needs to be understood to that in those circumstances only one runway is being operated, and operating one runway drops the capacity of the airport down to 30 to 40 take-offs and landings per hour. The big problem facing Kingsford Smith airport at the moment is the tremendous expansion in demand for its services during the peak periods. It has been stated by the Civil Aviation Authority that, between February and November this year, the demand for take-offs and landings at Kingsford Smith airport during the peak hours on the peak days has gone up by 50 per cent. With that unbridled demand in the peak hours on the peak days, the whole of the additional capacity at Kingsford Smith will readily be swamped. Indeed, there will be very extensive queuing and circling when the east-west runway is the only runway available as a result of safety considerations brought on by wind factors. For all of these reasons, the parallel runway at Kingsford Smith, as a result of the opening of which we have already seen volumes return almost to those of previous operations-that is, it is back up to over 61 take-offs and landings per hour-is operating satisfactorily and safely, but we need to, and we intend to, very seriously tackle this issue of noise nuisance, which is the subject of such grave concern for all people living under the flight corridor. Training Wage",79
64,Mr HORNE,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. What progress is being made in implementing the training wage?",80
65,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. Indeed, very good progress has been made. Today I have been informed that next week South Australia will move to fast-track award by award the training wage in that state. The House would be aware that, under the federal system, the national training wage was ratified by the federal commission as far back as 4 September. But what has been required is a mirroring of it in the states. With the South Australian operation in place, we will have effectively mirrored it in the states of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Tasmania has also legislated to give effect to it. This leaves Western Australia alone in not taking steps to secure the wage. The training wage that we have introduced is not the cut-price, punitive, training-inname-only wage that was proposed by the opposition at the last election. This is a genuinely award based rate. It is linked to a national training framework. It is industry responsive and supported by industry. I also remind the House that, whatever uncertainty people might think surrounds wages in the current environment, there is no uncertainty under the training wage because these rates have been set for 12 months. Anyone taken on under a traineeship arrangement incorporating the training wage is exempt from the unfair dismissal provisions of the IR act. As important as this progress has been, it is not the training wage alone that will help us secure the new training places. We have announced other measures, including funding for new traineeships, secured agreement from the states for a vocational training system and significant new funding to the vocational education and training sector. Today I spoke with the ACTU's regular council meeting and received from that meeting",80
66,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,That must have been revealing.,80
67,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"It was very revealing because we received from that meeting a commitment to 37,000 new traineeships that the ACTU will get out and support the marketing of. That is on top of what is already happening in the system at the moment. If those opposite have any doubts, I remind them of what the Australian Chamber of Manufactures had to say earlier this week. Allan Handberg, the chief executive of that association, said: ... job opportunities in manufacturing for school and tertiary leavers are the strongest since the 1980s. . . . apprenticeship and traineeship intakes have been building up steadily throughout the year and the trend is expected to continue. Trade training opportunities are becoming available right across the board. Some companies in the automotive sector, for example, are planning to double or treble intakes during the period ahead. Not only is this commitment a recognition and an endorsement by the employers and the ACTU; it also builds on what is already happening. I simply say to the House that it is only this government that could secure such a partnership of commitment because it is prepared to deal sensibly with both sides of the industrial fence and to secure agreements that commit and that work. I am confident that with this new commitment today we will see important continuing progress being made in the coming year in getting the level of unemployment down. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport",80
68,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Is it true that the original chief deceiver of the people of Sydney over the Sydney airport is the Prime Minister? Is it true that the Prime Minister was the great advocate of changing the original third runway plan, which would have meant more aircraft flying over water instead of over people's homes? Is it a fact that the Prime Minister is responsible for the lifestyledestroying aircraft noise levels over suburbs to the north of Sydney airport? Is it true that, while the Prime Minister's stupidity caused the noise problem, your deception and incompetence have caused the anger and chaos, and that both of you are to blame?",80
69,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"We have heard it all now. For the people who never stopped baying for this development, the people who chopped down a forest of trees to put out literally thousands of press releases to see this runway built to come along now, in 1994, and say that this is all the current Prime Minister's fault is really to stretch everyone's credulity. Mr MCGauran-But you built it. You did!",81
70,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for Gippsland will control himself. Mr Reith-Who built this airport?,81
71,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"The fact is that, whilst this debate was raging, there were many in our party who felt that it was better to do Badgerys Creek first, and I was one of those. Mr Downer-Is that still your view?",81
72,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order!,81
73,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"Having said that Mr Costello-So, if you don't agree with the decision, why don't you resign?",81
74,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,whilst there was some diversity on our side of politicsMr Costello-Punch resigned; why don't you? You fraud.,81
75,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Those on my left will cease interjecting.,81
76,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"the fact is that the opposition was absolutely unanimous in wanting it built and wanting it built immediately. Indeed, you said so a thousand days in a thousand ways. You called for it to be built regardless of the environmental consequences. Mr Reith-Now answer to the question. Come on.",81
77,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The member for Flinders! Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order under the standing order relating to relevance. My question was whether it was the Prime Minister who was responsible for . changing the original third runway plan",81
78,Unknown,Unknown,Government members interjecting,81
79,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Mr Bevis-You cannot run the opposition. Don't try to run the House.,81
80,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Those on my right. Mr Downer-the change having led to aircraft take-offs and landings over the suburbs to the north of Sydney airport. The minister is not even beginning to answer that question. It is not a question of what press releases people put out; it is a question of what the Prime Minister did.,81
81,Unknown,Unknown,Government members interjecting,81
82,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Resume your seat. Those on my right! The Leader of the Opposition has raised a valid point of order. The minister is coming to the response.,81
83,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"The opposition asked about the position of the Prime Minister. I think everyone has known about the position of the Prime Minister, which was no different from your position in saying that it should be builtMr Downer-The Prime Minister is the one who changed this.",81
84,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will not continue to interject across the table.,81
85,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"in accordance with the environmental impact statement. That was his position. The environmental impact statement said it all in 1991. It said exactly what the impact would be. Today, you come long crying crocodile tears for those people who are worse off. The concern that is being felt in that area is one that the government will address. It will address it very seriously with the assistance of the Prime Minister himself. Mr Downer-He is responsible for it.",81
86,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"He, like all of us, wants to see that gateway to Australia, the airport that carries more than 50 per cent of all of the air traffic throughout the whole of Australia, continue to serve the economic interests of this ""state, but, at the same time, to see adequate protection for the people who suffer the noise nuisance. Mr Downer-He didn't worry about this in 1989.",81
87,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"That will be some support which I will be looking for and which I very much expect to have when the matter is addressed in cabinet discussions tomorrow. It seems to me that, without that sort of support-which means bringing forward our programs and tackling noise with the various measures that have been suggested-we will not be minimising the impact of what is a very necessary piece of infrastructure, that is, Kingsford Smith airport. Papua New Guinea",82
88,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. I refer to press reports concerning discussions with Papua New Guinea on the Australian aid program. What progress, if any, has been made on that subject?",82
89,Mr BILNEY,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for her question. It is the case, as members will know, that each year there is a range of discussions between Papua New Guinean and Australian ministers, generally involving half a dozen ministers from each side, alternately in Papua New Guinea and in Australia. That annual PNG-Australia Ministerial Forum took place in Melbourne last Thursday and Friday. Among the wide range of matters discussed was the future of our aid program. That is a very important strand of our relationship with PNG and, given the crucial economic problems-I think it is fair to describe them in that way-PNG is facing, it was a very timely discussion. We on the Australian side take the view that, in view of the fiscal and foreign exchange problems PNG is facing, which have led to the floating of the currency in PNG, amongst other things, there is simply no alternative to the PNG government negotiating and, importantly, then implementing a reform package with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We think that should take place as soon as possible. Indeed, during those meetings we had assurances that the discussions with the World Bank would continue in January. In that context, an international support package is being talked about, but the figure-I see there were some references in the reports, which the honourable member referred to, to a figure-is still something that needs to be assessed. We made the point very firmly that any Australian support for an economic reform package to Papua New Guinea is dependent on Papua New Guinea negotiating a satisfactory agreement with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and, as well as that, on Papua New Guinea itself undertaking significant economic reforms. Two of those reforms are improving its own collection of revenue and increasing public investment from its budget. I emphasise that Australia's participation in that package would be most unlikely to involve any new or additional aid to Papua New Guinea, over and above the amounts which we are committed to supplying under the treaty. As far as our current aid program to Papua New Guinea is concerned, things are going well. Our budget support is being progressively replaced with much needed public investment programs, particularly in the areas nominated by Papua New Guinea of infrastructure, health and education. We also agreed during the discussions with Papua New Guinea that there would be full transparency in how those aid programs were progressing and that we would find ways of increasing the flow of public information. It was agreed that the review of the treaty of development cooperation, due to be conducted in September 1995, would proceed and that that review would consider matters induding Papua New Guinea's economic situation, the implications of the World Bank-International Monetary Fund adjustment programs and progress in implementing Australia's programmed aid. It was also agreed that planning for the review would commence shortly and that a working group would start meeting by April. In the context of the discussions, I was happy to be able to announce an $11 million project to assist sustainable forestry in Papua New Guinea, a matter of some concern in Australia as well. The project will improve education of forestry personnel and assist Papua New Guinea in the monitoring of logging activities. In announcing that, I urged Papua New Guinea to ensure that appropriate sustainable forest policies were implemented in line with the outcomes of the South Pacific Forum meeting in Brisbane. One move in that context would be to increase the level of export taxes on logs to improve the returns of logging to Papua New Guinea. Finally, I was able to present Papua New Guinea ministers with a report prepared by AIDAB on the damage to public infrastructure following the volcanic eruptions in Rabaul. That information will help them make the necessary decisions on the restoration or relocation of facilities in East New Britain and I believe it will be most valuable in that context. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport",82
90,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Why is the CAA refusing to answer questions about Sydney airport and its flight paths? Despite the minister's promise to release details of standard flight paths last week, why has the CAA still not released information about flight paths or other operations at Mascot? Has the minister instructed the CAA to withhold information from the public, local councils and the media? Is this, with his own blackban on the Sydney Morning Herald, yet another confirmation of the government's deception of the public over the third runway?",83
91,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"In respect of the first part of the honourable member's question, he will have to ask the CAA. In respect of the second part of his question, those standard flight paths will be made available just as soon as I have taken them to the cabinet and we have been in a position to consider them and the range of other measures necessary to improve the position of those living in the north-south corridor who are currently experiencing very severe noise nuisance as a result of the airport's operations. Pensions",83
92,Mr OCONNOR,Unknown,"My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Social Security, concerns the final report of the strategic review of the pensions income and assets test released earlier this week. Is the minister aware of criticisms of the report for rejecting the option of a so-called universal age pension? Does the government. agree with the report's recommendations in this area? Do any of the criticisms that have been levied have any validity at all?",83
93,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question. On Monday this week I, on behalf of the government, received the report on the review of the pensions income and assets test conducted by the independent consultant Ageing Agendas, which has worked on this matter over a considerable period together with a very broadly representative reference group of retiree organisations, the finance industry and relevant government departments. I think its report was a good, solid piece of work, which flowed out of a thorough consultation process, and it was very comprehensive in its review of the issues. It has put forward some 50 recommendations that will be considered in a budget context, and we will be developing a considered response to the report next year in that context. There is one recommendation in the report that, I can indicate, the government will be accepting now, and that is that the government maintain a targeted approach to pension provision. The alternative to that, which has been espoused by some, is the so-called universal pension, which in effect means paying pensions to everybody, irrespective of any assets or income test; in other words, completely removing any means testing. As anybody who is remotely honest concedes, the reality is"" that that is simply unaffordable. We are talking about a cost of some $5 billion a year arising from removing all income and assets testing on pensions. It is also inequitable, and this has been confirmed in a study of the proposals by the retirement income modelling task force, which is a group of officials from Treasury, Finance and Social Security. Not only is it un affordable; it is inequitable in its impact. Contrary to the claims of the member for Berowra, proposals in this area were properly considered by the review. Just because a proposal is rejected does not mean that it was not properly considered. The honourable member for Berowra tries to have two-bob each way. A press release put out on the day said that he has an open mind on universal pension, saying that he will 'continue to examine any proposals for a universal pension'. What profound dishonesty that is! This is the party that persistently criticises us for not making enough progress in cutting the deficit yet it criticises any suggestion that taxes might rise or that a government might increase its revenue. This is the party that says it has an open mind on a proposition that would have an annual budgetary impact of $5 billion. This is the sort of dishonesty that we get. Mr Ruddock- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. For the minister to accuse me of dishonesty",83
94,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Just a minute. Mr Ruddock-It is a point of order, Mr Speaker.",84
95,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Yes, and when you get the call you may certainly proceed. The honourable member for Berowra. Mr Ruddock- Mr Speaker, my point of order is in relation to the manner in which the minister raises comments about the efficacy of comments in terms of dishonesty when he misrepresents and does not quote fully from the statement. I put out. He should not use the term 'dishonest' in relation to me in this matter when I clearly said that we recognise the inherent difficulty in introducing a universal pension.",84
96,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Now you are debating the issue. Resume your seat.,84
97,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order, there is ample opportunity for positions on misrepresentation to be made after question time, as every member knows. It is not a point of order.",84
98,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! I again remind all members in this place-that equally goes to ministers-that they should be careful of the language that they use. I say to the member for Berowra that there are other opportunities in this House, if he believes that he has been misrepresented, to try to correct that record. I call the minister. Mr Ruddock-I might take them.",84
99,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"It is patently, obviously untenableMr AbboU- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 75, no member shall use offensive words. .",84
100,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I have already ruled on the matter. Resume your seat. Mr AbboU-The minister has accused the member for Berowra of dishonesty,84
101,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Resume your seat! I warn the member for Warringah. This is the second time this week when he has stood up after a ruling has been given in respect of points of order taken and he has chosen to argue the toss.,84
102,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"It is patently untenable to be saying, on the one hand, that the government needs to do far more to cut the deficit, that the government needs to not raise any revenue or increase taxes in any way, shape or form and then, on the other hand, to say that you are seriously considering a proposition with a budgetary cost of some $5 billion. There has been some reference to a proposal by the Institute of Actuaries. That proposal has been looked at by the retirement income modelling task force that I made reference to earlier. The institute attempts to fund the proposal by cutting the base rate of pension by $7-is that what the honourable member for Berowra proposes?-by freezing the superannuation guarantee charge; by more rapidly increasing the pension age for women, with further increases for both men and women in future; and by changing superannuation tax concessions. RIM suggests that by 2003 around $3 billion of national savings would be lost each year as a consequence of doing that. The honourable member for Berowra also referred in his press release to the possibility of taxing the pension benefit which, as far as I can see, can only mean abolishing the pension rebate, the effect of which would be a cut of $11.40 per week for single pensioners. These are the sorts of things that you have to do to make a universal pension costeffective, to use the honourable member for Berowra's terms. He knows full well that there is not the slightest chance in the world that a government of which he was a member would introduce such an arrangement. There is not the slightest possibility of that, and he knows it. He ought not to be dragging these sorts of propositions before the electorate in what I say is this thoroughly dishonest way. He knows that what he is putting forward cannot be done. It is just an absolute joke for a party that professes concern for fiscal rectitude to put forwardMr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 75, no member shall use offensive words. The minister has again accused the member for Berowra of being dishonest. I find that offensive, and he should withdraw.",84
103,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Resume your seat. If the member for Warringah had listened to some of the comments that have been made here even this afternoon, he might have similarly found that other people found words offensive. I have already saidMr Melham interjecting",85
104,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Banks might just consider his position. Opposition members-Name him! Mr Costello---I got thrown out for that!,85
105,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Mr Costello---I got thrown out for interjecting on you.,85
106,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Thank you for reminding me. As I was saying, members should consider carefully the language of their responses in this place. I believe the minister has finished. Australian National Line",85
107,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. The minister will be aware of comments by the Auditor-General in relation to ANL and other matters that: . . . the actions and statements of those involved the sale process can influence the perceptions market to the point where the seller will be perceived as a distressed seller. Further, the minister will also be aware of allegations raised by the former chairman of ANL on last night's 7.30 Report that the minister's comment that ANL could not be given away 'would damage ANL and its sale value'. In view of these statements, will the minister accept responsibility for his bungled handling of ANL's sale, costing the taxpayer tens of millions of dollars? If not, will he agree to establish a full, open and independent inquiry into the events surrounding this matter?",85
108,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"Have no fear. I will take full responsibility for ANL during the whole of my stewardship of it. I am proud of the fact that the very first thing I did in respect of ANL, in March of this year, in concert with the Minister for Finance, was recommend to cabinet that there should be an independent due diligence study done of the affairs of ANL. I did it against the background of a very dismal financial performance by the corporation. It is a corporation that seemed to get it wrong year after year. Mr MCGauran-You had it for 12 years, for heaven's sake.",85
109,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Gippsland is getting very excited. The member for Gippsland! Mr MCGauran-Look what you did to it!,85
110,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order!,85
111,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"We got it in dreadful shape. This is an outfit that said in 1991 that it would make a profit of $32 million and actually made a loss of $5.3 million. It is an outfit that said it would make a profit in 1992 of $21.4 million and actually made a loss of $26 million. It said it would make a profit in 1993 of $14.8 million and made a profit of $2.7 million. In 1994 it said it would make a profit of $7.9 million and it actually has come in with an estimated resultant loss-we will not have of confirmation of it-of between $10 and $20 million. If you look at ANL's performance, over the last four years it has lost on average some in $24 million each year. It was for that reason of the that the government commissioned due diligence. It was for that reason that when the due diligence report, duly carried out by Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers, was presented to the cabinet, the cabinet made a very important decision, and· that was to request that I approach the directors of ANL and seek their resignations with a view to the installation of a new board in an attempt to rescue the company. The day when I made my comment that you could not give it away-which was a pretty fair representation of the state of the outfit-was a day when I indicated that the government had decided to withdraw it from sale. So all this talk about its sale value being talked down is just so much nonsense. The very day I made that remark was the day it was withdrawn from sale. Mr MCGauran-Yes, but you are going to put it on the market soon.",85
112,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I warn the member for Gippsland.,86
113,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"I have been reticent to criticise the former chairman of ANL. I want to differentiate between his position and that of a number of directors of ANL who only joined the board of ANL shortly before the board was changed. I do not hold them responsible for any of the woes of that company, but when an outfit that so consistently gets it wrong year in and year out, that says it is going to do X and it does Y and it comes at an enormous cost to the taxpayer, then the minister who does something about it ought to quite properly be pleased that the issue has been tackled. I noticed in the program last night Mr Bolitho saying that not only should we have rescued ANL but we should have moved from 25 per cent shareholding in Australian Stevedores to 100 per cent shareholding in Australian Stevedores. Mr Moore-You were the one who wanted to buy the shares.",86
114,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,I will come to you in a minute.,86
115,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for Ryan might not bait the minister.,86
116,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"This is the biggest stevedoring outfit in Australia. It is an outfit in which ANL has a 25 per cent shareholding. It was Mr Bolitho's wish that the government under deadlock-breaking provisions which he had negotiated with the other two shareholders, Howard Smith and Jamieson Equities, Mr Corrigan's outfit, should proceed to go from 25 per cent to 100 per cent ownership. That was, as I characterised in this House, a $280 million ask because, firstly, you had to buy Howard Smith for $28 million using your preemptive rights, then you had to be prepared to go into the auction with Corrigan and buy him out for at least the same amount of money, and then you had to take on the whole capital expenditure program that is in their three-year business plan. And on top of all of that you had one other responsibility, which was to assume the debt of Australian Stevedores. The end result of that was $280 million of further taxpayer commitment to Australian Stevedores. What for? So that we, the government, could nationalise and run the biggest, greatest stevedoring company in Australia. I think the cabinet made a very sound decision. It was not my decision; it was a decision finally taken by a subcommittee of cabinet comprising the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and me. If I was enthusiastic to clean up ANL's problems, that was nothing compared to the enthusiasm of the other participants on that cabinet subcommittee; but clean it up we will and cleaning it up is exactly what we are doing at this moment. It was suggested on the program last night that there was a five-day maritime strike-a strike brought about by the government's decision to sell its 25 per cent shareholding in Australian Stevedores. We either had to buy for $280 million or sell our quarter share. Let me remind the House-because these little urban myths have a habit of being perpetuated by one or other of the players in this-that the five-day maritime dispute came about as a result of the unions attempting to force the government to commit the taxpayer for the $280 million. The government, to its credit, said that it would not be forced to follow that course of action. Instead, the strike commenced at noon on the Thursday and on the Friday afternoon we disposed of our 25 per cent. Mr MCGauran-And you went sailing.",86
117,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"Actually I went to John Newman's funeral in Sydney, if you would like to know what I was doing that afternoon. We made the sound decision on behalf of the taxpayer because we managed to obtain the same price as Howard Smith managed to obtain-$28 million. Howard Smith is a reputable public company and one that acts pretty responsibly. If we had not taken that action and Howard Smith had moved to sell, as it was doing the following week, to Jamison, as a 75 per cent owner it would have been in a position to greatly devalue this government's 25 per cent. We may not have got anything like $28 million. In conclusion, what was going on in the opposition while all this was happening? We had two statements on the one day. We had the shadow minister for privatisation and public administration, the member for Ryan, saying this to me: The Minister must face the fact that under public ownership, ANL does not have access to the capital necessary to provide for a successful reconstruction and for ANL to return to long-term profitability. The minister should accept the recommendation of the due diligence report for a Managed TradeDown of ANL Limited (effectively an informal liquidation). The member for Ryan was saying that we should liquidate. At the very same moment, the shadow minister for transport was putting out an entirely different press release saying: Only majority privatisationnot liquidationand the most effective would be full privatisationwill attract substantial new funding and the solid customer base and broader management expertise that the line needs if it is to become fully competitive and able to capture the opportunities that expanding trade could offer. If ever I have seen someone, to his discredit, captured by the industry and blundering down the path that would see the government accepting further losses, it was certainly not the member for Ryan but was certainly the member for Hume. ANZAC Day",86
118,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The minister would have seen media reports stating the government's intention to install ANZAC Day on 25 April as Australia's national day of commemoration to recognise this country's war dead and all those who served in war. Due to the significance of next year as the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, could the minister inform the House whether the government's intention will be carried out prior to ANZAC Day 1995?",87
119,Mr SCIACCA,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Naturally, most Australians attach a very solemn importance to ANZAC Day. Some time ago in this House the member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Holding, and the member for Cook, Mr Dobie, in a bipartisan approach brought a private members motion to this House in which they asked exactly for this. The ex-service community has for some time been concerned that, as time goes on, the importance of ANZAC Day could be diminished, with younger generations coming up who may not be aware of the debts that are owed to those people who have fought not only in World War I or World War II but also in other wartime conflicts. Accordingly, the government tomorrow will be introducing a bill in this House to enshrine ANZAC Day in legislation as the day of commemoration, and we will provide that 25 April of each year be known as ANZAC Day. I want to thank all members of this House because I am certain that the legislation will be accepted-the honourable member for O'Connor publicly said that he would accept it. I am sure that it will be passed, and I have every confidence in ensuring that it will be passed in time for ANZAC Day 1995, which will mark the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. In conclusion, I take this opportunity-it will probably be my last opportunity to do so this year-to thank all our colleagues from both sides of the House for the marvellous work that they are doing in their electorates with respect to the Australia Remembers year. I know it is going to be great. It has been taken up with a great deal of gusto by all Australians and I expect that the celebrations and commemorations next year will be something to behold. Australian National Line",87
120,Mr MOORE,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Now that the minister has confirmed that he views the ANL as a basket case, it is worth reminding the House of a quote of his: Let me tell you a thing or two: I did not have anything to devalue ANL because ANL has been and continues to be in quite a . . . deal of The Auditor-General this week confirmed original assessment that ANL was an ongoing concern, able to meet its debts as and when they fell due. In view of the Auditorto General's direct contradiction statement, does the minister admit that he was wrong to say that ANL could not be given away? Will the minister accept responsibility for the mess that he has created, believe that the Auditor-General was not telling the truth?",87
121,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"The only way that ANL consistently could continue was to draw down on its reality promissory note, on its government guarandoing teed facility. The fact is that ANL, as I said, was in-and remains in-a considerable the amount of strife. This is the company that wrote to me in August of this year indicating that it required a drawdown on its promissory note in order to pay the wages. Mr Moore--Yes, because you had lent the money to Corrigan to pay for the shares.",88
122,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"I am glad that you said that. You are the third one to pick up this theme. It was a theme that Laura Tingle, until yesterday when Quentin Dempster joined her, was the only journalist to adopt. The theme is that somehow the government had adcarefully vanced money to Chris Corrigan in order that he could buy the government's shares in ANL. What existed was a commercial arrangement for a deferred payment of months. No money changed hands whatsoever. Here is the shadow minister, his stock exchange background, wandering into the House saying, 'You lent them the money.' Mr Moore--It needed the money to pay the wages.",88
123,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"All that the directors of ANL did was enter into a normal commercial arrangement which involved a 90-day settleAuditor-General, ment of the balance of the $28 million; that is, the difference between the 20 per cent deposit that they paid and the full purchase price of $28 million. There is nothing in the Auditor-General's to do report that I have anything to be concerned about. ANL remains in great difficulty and strife. Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and their his fellow directors are working at trying to rescue it at the moment. If you looked at the balance sheets of ANL, and even if you were pick up the $180 million debt which is to the minister's attached to ANLMr Costello-What about Neville Wran?",88
124,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Deputy or does he Leader of the Opposition!,88
125,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"you would find that it would still be losing money and losing money month after month. That is the of ANL's position ·and we are intent on something about that. That is what due diligence was for, what the proposal to have ALP conference allow for privatisation of at least a majority, or indeed all, of ANL was all about and what the work Neville Wran and the board are pursuing at this very moment is all about. Let me repeat that I have no problem at all with the Auditor-General's report other than one gratuitous paragraph that people should not talk down the value. As I have already said to the House, the day I said ANL was not able to be given away was the day we had earlier announced that it was withdrawn from sale. I suggest you should read and study the Auditor-General's report. Mr MCGauran-He said you were wrong.",88
126,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,He says no such thing three at all. You go and read the report.,88
127,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Gippswith all of land has been warned.,88
128,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"It is a bit like the member for Hume, who this morning was calling for my resignation. He has called for a number of resignations down through the years, as these press files of mine indicate. When challenged by the journalist to give a single issue of substance revealed by the he was dumbfounded. All he could say was, 'Well, there is serious concern here.' He could not instance a single matter of concern, a single matter of substance; and nor can any of you. That is your problem. So go and read the report before pretending that it is something it is not. Education: School Languages Program",88
129,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware of claims that primary school children in Western Australia are not receiving tuition in languages other than English? Can the minister advise whether the Commonwealth provides funds for the teaching of languages other than English? Can the minister advise the House whether the Commonwealth has reduced funding to the state of Western Australia which might have brought about this situation?",89
130,Mr FREE,Unknown,"l thank the honourable member for Perth for the question. I acknowledge the close interest he takes in the work of schools in the electorate of Perth and the many opportunities he has given me to visit schools in electorate. I can assure him that there has been no reduction-none-in the Commonwealth's funding support for language programs other than English language programs in Western Australian schools. This year the Commonwealth provided Western Australia with more than half a million dollars under one program, the priority languages incentive element, and a quarter of a million dollars under another program, the community languages element. Both these are elements of the school language program. The Commonwealth will maintain this level of support in 1995. In addition, the Commonwealth is to provide $67.7 million over the next four years to support increased enrolments in key Asian language studies among students from years 3 to 10 around Australia. The languages concerned are Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean. The national Asian languages studies strategy for Australian schools, NALSSAS, was agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments earlier this year and, of course, that included Western Australia. The Commonwealth appreciates the considerable benefits of fostering a multilingual population and it recognises the provision of appropriate funding as a key part of that process. For that reason, we provide considerable funds to the Western Australian government for this purpose. If schools in Western Australia are unable to offer classes through an alleged lack of trained teachers, there is no justification-none-for claiming that the fault lies with the Commonwealth. The Western Australian government has been provided with the funds. It is the Western Australian government's responsibility to use those funds and to provide the classes.

Having allowed that kind of interpretation on a standing order in this House this week, such a loose interpretation, you cannot now selectively and rigorously interpret the same standing orders in relation to standing order 144.

I have suggested to members-and I do it yet again-that, understanding order 144, which we have all just heard read out, there are certain phrases and ways in which questions can be put. The Leader of the Opposition did-and I thank him for doing sochange the wording and that took out what I considered to be the offensive part of the introduction to his question. I ask him to now get on with it. I would advise all members, from both sides, when phrasing questions, to be careful of the provisions of that standing order.",91
164,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"I direct my question to the Minister for Transport. As the minister whose negligence and incompetence have delivered chaos in the sensitive area of aviation safety, massive increases in aircraft noise for tens of thousands of Sydney siders, increased delays and inefficiencies at Sydney airport, confusion and backflips over industrial relations legislaOpposition, tion, a rising level of industrial disputation, and the loss of tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money over the ANL debacle, I ask him: when will he do what he should have done long ago and resign? Or will this minister for chaos continue to cling to office only because his mate, the Prime Minister, will not do what he should and sack him?",91

I am going to treat that call as seriously as it deserves-and that is not very seriously at all. NA Motion of Censure",91
178,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"by leave-I move: That this House censures the Minister for Transport for his failure to exercise proper ministerial standards and the maladministration resulting from his failure to perform his portfolio responsibilities. In the last few minutes as we have sat here, we have seen a very good reason emerge as to why the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) should ·resign forthwith from that post. Only a few moments ago we were reminded by him of people who preceded him in ministerial posts, people who had important responsibilities, who did the right thing eventually-and that was to resign. The minister reminded us of the honourable member who was the Minister for Aviation Support back in 1988, now the Minister for  who did the right thing and resigned. He reminded us of the former minister for the environment, the former Senator Richardson, who did the right thing and resigned. Thank you very much, Minister, for reminding us today of those who have gone before you who have ultimately seen the light and resigned. They resigned because they knew ultimately that the right thing was to act in a proper fashion because their ministerial responsibilities were beyond them. I do not think there has been a minister of this government over the last 12 months who has got himself into more trouble than the man sitting opposite us here today, the Minister for Transport. Just cast your mind back over the last 12 months and think of the great controversies that have been involved in federal politics and of the person who has been at the centre of those controversies. none other than the Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. There is a cartoon characterMr Costello-Danger Man.",91
179,Mr SHARP,Unknown,Danger Man. Is it not amazing that the person who is responsible for aviation safety in this country is nicknamed 'Danger Man'? Mr Costello-By the Prime Minister.,92
180,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was the man who named him, who gave him that nickname. Is it not also amazing that the day-today responsibility for aviation safety in this country is held by an organisation whose headquarters is called 'Fort Fumble'. So we have Danger Man and Fort Fumble looking after aviation safety in this country. There is a cartoon character that many of us would be familiar with called Flash Gordon. This character manages to get himself into trouble all the time. No sooner has he stumbled his way through one lot of trouble than he stumbles into the next. The person who best fits the description of Flash Gordon here in this parliament is the Minister for Transport. No matter what he does, and no matter how he goes about it, he walks straight into controversy and trouble; and no sooner has he got out of that trouble than he. gets into more trouble. The reputation that the Minister for Transport brought to this House when he was elected to the federal parliament in 1990 was one that certainly gave the impression that he, in his former role in the state parliament, was the equivalent of having an albatross around your neck. We all remember the reputation that this man had as the minister for public works in New South Wales. We will all remember the problems that the WranUnsworth government had in its dying days. Honourable members will remember the former Premier of New South Wales Barrie Unsworth, the old cardigan killer. Many people thought he was not all that bright. But I tell you that Barrie Unsworth was bright enough to know that, coming up to the election, the biggest albatross around the Labor It is government's neck in 1988 was none other than Laurie Brereton. What did he do? Mr Downer-He sacked him.",92
181,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"He demoted him and sacked him, and that is exactly what the Prime Minister here in the Commonwealth parliament should be doing to the same man. The situation surrounding the minister's carriage of his ministerial responsibilities here in this parliament are equal to or worse than they were back in 1988 when Barrie Unsworth got rid of him. When Barrie Unsworth got rid of him it was too late, the damage was done. I think you will find that, unless this minister is prepared to have his head put on the plate, what the Minister for Transport did to Barrie Unsworth in 1988 is what he is going to do to Bob Carr in 1995. You just watch. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the Minister for Transport. He is a bit like a lightning rod for attracting controversy. Whether it be in the portfolio of industrial relations, whether it be his handling of the third runway controversy and all of the surrounding noise problems in Sydney, whether it be the handling of ANL or, indeed, the handling of aviation safety, this minister has got himself into hot water-on each and every one of those issues. Today in the House we saw how the minister and his colleague the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) were trying to deal with the problem of ANL. Many of us would have watched the 7.30 Report last night to see the former chairman of ANL, Bill Bolitho, go on national television and make some very serious accusations about the way in which this minister has carried out his ministerial responsibilities as far as the privatisation and sale of ANL are concerned. Mr Bill Bolitho, a man whose reputation is unsullied throughout the business community and who is probably the most respected person in the Australian shipping industry today, went on national television and made some extraordinary and serious accusations about the propriety of the way in which this minister has carried out the sale and privatisation process of ANL. During this week, we also saw the Auditor General's report being tabled in the Senate. What did the Auditor-General's report tell us? It told us three things. Firstly, it drew some very serious questions about the process by which the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers report on, and valuation of, ANL was undertaken. The importance of that report on, and valuation of, ANL is that the Minister for Transport based all of his actions surrounding his decisions with ANL on that report. Yet the Auditor-General, in his report tabled in this parliament during the week, draws into question the whole process of the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers valuation mechanism for the ANL. That is the first thing the report tells us. Secondly, the Auditor-General in his report makes the point that he has been very concerned about certain public officials making public utterances which have the potential to damage the value of ANL. We heard earlier today the Minister for Finance trying to tell us that this was not directed in any way at the Minister for Transport. Yet the Minister for Transport got up here a little while later and said that the only thing in the Auditor General's report he was worrying about was the gratuitous advice that had been levelled at him. Do you know what the Auditor-General was saying? The Auditor-General was saying that the big mouth of the Minister for Transport has cost this country tens of millions of dollars. Why? Because he gave a press conference on national television and said, 'You could not give ANL away.' We are in the business of trying to sell ANL. It is a business that is worth many millions of dollars. Yet this man went out and said that we could not give it away. In the process of doing that, he damaged the value of that business irreparably. That is the second thing the Auditor General's report tells us. In addition to that, the Auditor-General attached an addendum to his report-a rather unusual thing for him to do. It is a letter from the Secretary to the Department of Financeno doubt at the instruction of the Minister for Finance-requesting that the Auditor-General alter some key paragraphs in his report which are implicitly critical of the comments of the Minister for Transport about the value of ANL. That is what this letter is all about. It was unusual for the Auditor-General to do that-but necessary because he felt that, unless he made it quite clear that an attempt had been made to try to whitewash this report, people would not note the gravity of the situation surrounding this whole process of trying to sell ANL. The net result of this is that it has cost us a lot of money.. So far it has cost us $20 million to fix up the strike of the Maritime Union of Australia which was created by this gentleman in the process of his handling of ANL. In addition to that, it will cost us more. We have already heard that next year we will have to have written into the budget an extra $50 million to try to keep this business that this man has now taken full charge of afloat for another 12 months. We also see that it will cost us money because of the big mouth this man has got. The views he has expressed, which he thinks are important, such as that ANL could not be given away, have cost the taxpayers of Australia a tremendous amount of money. As I said, Bill Bolitho made some extraordinary claims on the television last night. Over the last few weeks, we have also had several articles written by Laura Tingle. The minister referred to them in his comments today in question time. Those articles by Laura Tingle go to the whole propriety of this government. They refer to a secret loan of $22.4 million given by the company that this minister claims is bankrupt and that you could not give away: to the company that was buying ANL's shares in Australian Stevedores. Yet today we heard the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport saying, 'This was not a loan; this was just a deferred payment. It was exactly the same deal that Howard Smith had with Jamison Equity when it sold its 25 per cent shareholding in Australian Stevedores.' Let me tell you that it was not the same deal and the minister knows that. In fact, he knows it very well. The Australian Stevedores shares that Howard Smith owned were not handed over straight away to Jamison Equity. It did not lend Jamison Equity the money. This government with its secret deal, which Laura Tingle has highlighted to us, actually gave a $22.4 million loan to Jamison Equity, handed over all the shares and gave the seat on the board of Australian Stevedores that ANL had directly to Jamison Equity. None of this was done by Howard Smith. There is a clear and distinct difference. This government would have us believe that the deal that it did with Jamison Equity was exactly the same deal that Howard Smith did. It was not. Last night I had dinner with some people who were present at the finalisation of the sale of the Australian Stevedores shares to Jamison Equity. They told me that everything Laura Tingle wrote in that article is as.olutely and utterly true. That makes some of things that this minister and the Minister for Finance have said over the last few days quite wrong. So we have these quite reasonable and proper concerns about the propriety of this government and the administration by this minister of his ministerial responsibilities. These are serious concerns. If the Prime Minister does not deal with these sorts of concerns, Australia's taxpayers will continue to lose many millions of dollars due to the incompetence of this man. In the process of trying to cover up his actions over ANL, the ininister has worn the tag that he justly deserves and that is of being the champion deceiver. This man is the champion deceiver. We heard the term used in this House earlier this week, but nobody better fits the term of champion deceiver than the Minister for Transport. When talking about the champion deceiver, let us look at the third runway and the problems that Sydneysiders are experiencing at the present time. We have heard from this minister that we cannot have the east-west runway up and running again because it would be unsafe. Do you know the reason why the east-west runway is not going to be up and running again? It is not because it is unsafe. It has nothing to do with that at all. If we go back to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 23 March 1989 we find a detailed account of how the government changed its mind about the third runway; and who was responsible for changing the government's mind about the third runway. The article, which was written by Geoff Kitney, makes interesting reading. It states: After looking at various configurations, Mr Keating proposed that the new north-south runway be fully operational from both directions and the old east-west runway be virtually made redundant. The effect of this change was dramatic. That is the reason why the east-west runway is not being opened now. The significance of that is that the 10,000 people who rallied at Leichhardt Oval last Saturday expressing their concerns about the problems of noise over Sydney due to the opening of the third runway are saying that one of the best solutions to the problem is to open the east-west runway. We are not going to get it opened because the Prime Minister was the man who directed that it be closed. The reason why it was closed was explained further on in the same article. It states: The political significance of Mr Keating's proposal was that the noise impact on the most marginal Labor seats of Barton (1.1 per cent) and St George (3.7 per cent) would be greatly reduced, while the areas where noise would increase would be the safest Labor seats-Sydney (20 per cent) and Grayndler (10 per cent). We now know why we have all these problems over Sydney with the third runway. It has nothing to do with the east-west runway operating simultaneously with the other two north-south runways being unsafe. It is all about grubby politics-politics designed to advantage nobody else but the Labor Party. The man responsible for it is the Prime Minister. But the man who is covering for him, the champion deceiver, is going around trying to convince us that we cannot have this east-west runway up and running because it would be unsafe. This is yet another example of the way in which this minister is not honestly and properly administering his portfolio responsibilities. Another thing that earns him the title of champion deceiver is the meeting he held with some local government officials from Marrickville Council on 28 July this year. The minister was in possession of a report which indicated that the local government officials who were meeting with him had seriously underestimated the degree of noise they would experience as a result of the opening of the third runway. This minister, according to those officials, did not tell them about that report. He kept that report secret. That report only saw the light of day when it was subpoenaed to be heard in the Federal Court hearings of November of this year. That is the reason that report became public. That is another clear example of the way this minister has deceived the people of Sydney over the noise levels they would experience as a result of the third runway being up and running. Another thing that earns this minister the title of being incompetent is that he opened the third runway months ahead of the rest of the facilities at Sydney airport being ready. You have to ask yourself: why did the minister open the third runway months before the new air traffic control tower would be open? Why did he open it 12 months in advance of the new radar system being able to be used? That is a very good question. The net result of that is that 91 per cent all flights going into Sydney airport are currently delayed. Ansett experienced up to 30,000 complaints from travellers in one particular day. The capacity oJ Sydney airport has been reduced from 64 aircraft movements pe- hour to 50 craft movements per hour. We have gone out and spent over $200 million building the third runway, we have opened it, because this man decided to do it, months in advance of the rest of the facilities being available for use and the net result is the creation of an enormous mess at Sydney airport. Indeed, Peter Young, representative of Ansett Airlines, said yesterday that the airport infrastructure in Australia is completely broken at this moment. In the process of breaking it, this minister has destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Sydneysiders over the last few weeks because he has not been prepared to deal properly with the issue of noise levels for Sydney siders. The reason is that his Prime Minister is the man who made the decision to close the east-west runway for grubby, political purposes. That is why those people are suffering at this time. That is why the opposition moves this censure motion against the Minister for Transport. In relation to ANL, he carried out those actions of sacking the board of ANL, of appointing his old mate Neville Wran to run the ANt board for the next six months and of calling ANL a business that· you could not give away. We know that all of that was done for grubby, political purposes-because of the ALP that was coming up in September. We now know the truth of the situation as to why Sydney siders are living a complete hell of a life at the present time. It is because of this· government's grubby, political deals for their own grubby, political ends to try to win votes and seats in Sydney. We now know the reason. It is all due to this minister's incompetence and his inability to properly carry out his ministerial responsibilities. That is why this man should go. That is why this man was nicknamed years ago by the Prime Minister as Dangerman. That is why, if he is not careful, he will become the of albatross around the Keating government's neck, like he was the albatross around the Unsworth government's neck all those years ago.",92
182,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the motion seconded? Mr Connolly-I second the· motion and reserve my right to speak.,96
183,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (4.35 p.m.)-I have seen some censure motions in the 25 years I have spent in public office-I have seen plenty of them-but I have never seen a weaker one than the one we have seen here this afternoon, moved by the member for Hume (Mr Sharp). A censure motion is supposed to be the most serious thing that can happen in the parliament. A censure motion is a debate in respect of charges that should go to the very integrity of the minister being challenged. What did we see in the contribution from the honourable member? Not a single significant charge, but a lot of mealy-mouthed rubbish and recycled press releases-of course, he is the king of the press releases-but nothing to sustain the charge that I should be censured by this House. Having said that, I take the opportunity provided to me for the next 15 minutes to deal with some of the issues that have been discussed here this afternoon. I deal particularly with this question of Australian National Line and the actions of the cabinet, given effect to by me, in respect of its financial circumstance. As I have said to the House, the position of ANL was one causing us grave concern. We acted decisively and properly in order to make sure that taxpayers' interests were protected. We acted to make sure that ANL did not continue to haemorrhage to the average tune of $24 million per year-year in and year out. Indeed, the whole of the process I have instituted on behalf of the cabinet has been aimed at protecting taxpayers' interests, just as was the decision to sell the 25 per cent share in Australian Stevedores, which has been referred to by the honourable member this afternoon. It was a decision taken in order to eliminate a potential liability, which the trade union movement was trying to force us into, to spend $280 million and nationalise the greatest stevedoring company in Australia. I have indicated to the House before the nature of the problems facing ANL, but I recount them. The fact is that the due diligence report this year from Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers, in no way cut down by the Auditor-General, indicates that ANL over-estimated its profit forecasts, year in and year out. In fact, in September 1990 the advice of the board of ANL to the government was that its shipping terminals and business would earn it $32 million. They lost ANL $5.3 million. The same month, June 1991, the board was forecasting to the government that everything would be okay and that it was going to make $21.4 million in its shipping and terminal businesses. That was its projected profit for the next year. The result was a dismal loss of $26 million recorded by June of 1992-a turnaround of $47 million in 12 months. What was happening during this process? The board of ANL, chaired by Mr Bolitho, was indicating that everything was going to be all right, that everything was going to come up roses in the garden. In fact, it is worth recounting that Mr Bolitho, in his press release of 16 December 1993, claimed that ANL as a whole would at least break even in 1993-94. The result for 1993-94 will be somewhere between a $10 million and $20 million loss, the same sort of loss that it has sustained year in and year out. It was only in February of this year that ANL went on the public record in the Australian saying that the company could expect solid profits for the next few years. We now know, as a result of the work of Salomon Brothers and price Waterhouse, the very dismal state of that business. It was only six months after that that the company itself was coming to us saying that it wanted to draw down its promissory note, saying that it did not have sufficient funds to pay its bills. The fact is that ANL has only survived so long by selling assets. This is the bottom line. Mr Bolitho went on television last night-the member for Hume has relied on him for some of his comments-'-and talked about profitability. My challenge is: what profitability? We have not seen profitability for years. If you take out the selling of a large part of its fleet-it has already sold most of its fleetand you take .out the sale of its future income stream, another little trick aimed at keeping the company afloat, then you find that the figures for ANL are even more appalling. These sales are not revealed in those figures of an average $24 million a year loss that I have given, but in the process ANL has flogged off most of the fleet. ANL has gone further than that. It has sold the cash flow in respect of some remaining elements of the fleet. If you take out those extras, you find that ANL has pranged not just for the last four years but for six of the last seven years. When I come along, in concert with the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), and say that we are bringing in outside experts and that a due diligence study will be carried out, and when that due diligence study reveals the true state and nature of ANL and the government acts decisively, you have the hide to criticise us. Even then, as I have revealed in the House today, you could not get your act together. The shadow minister for privatisation is saying one thing and the shadow minister for transport is saying another. One is saying 'liquidate' in respect of ANL; the other is saying 'prop up'. Where do you get off? You talk about credibility. You have no credibility on this matter. The government was properly concerned about ANL in terms of the approach of the board of directors. It needs to be remembered that Mr Bolitho was there for 10 years. During that whole lO-year period, the company paid $20.7 million in dividends to the government. I repeat: in the whole of the 10 year-period, the government got $20.7 million. During that time, the government pumped $160.5 million into the company in debt forgiveness or equity injection. During that period, the taxpayer went down the gurgle hole to the tune of $140 million. Someone had to do something about that situation. It was not just that money that had been lost. The current debt of ANL sits in the books at $180 million. That $180 million has to be picked up at the end of the day by the taxpayer. The government acted decisively and did something about that, and you have the hide to come into this lIouse and challenge us in this censure motion against me. We have done the right and courageous thing in regard to ANL-the sort of thing that you would never do and never did during the many years that you had the carriage and control of ANL from 1975 to 1983. You left ANL in 1983 in the most appalling condition, which was why we had to pump $160.5 million of equity injection into it. You avoided your responsibility for ANL in the most scandalous manner. For you to have the hide to come in here and challenge us when we have done the right thing in respect of this matter really defies credulity. I have indicated to the House that, even were we to eliminate that $180 million of debt, the company would still be losing money month after month. Of course ANL needs restructuring, and that is exactly what this government is committed to. This afternoon there have been a number of-I cannot call them charges because there were no charges levelled against me",96
184,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,Wet lettuce.,97
185,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"Yes, wet lettuce.",97
186,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,There were 10 wet lettuce leaves.,97
187,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"I think there were only three or four wet lettuce leaves that were flung across the chamber at me, and one concerned Bill Bolitho. At least Bill, for all his problems, had the decency to go on the radio this morning and say, 'I have a king sized chip on my shoulder. 'That I can understand. I know how he feels. If you had been associated with something for 10 years, if you had put your life's work into it and you had been asked by the minister of the day, for very good reason, to stand down, of course you would have a chip on your shoulder. The opposition should not be relying on Bill Bolitho, the man with the chip on his shoulder, as a basis for any censure motion against me. Yet opposition members come in here saying that we have lost tens of millions of dollars as a result of my saying, 'You could not give ANL away' - which was a pretty fair remark---on the day that I announced we were withdrawing it from sale. In the papers this morning, ANZDL indicated that it wants to bid for ANL. It said that the issue of its reputation will have lio bearing whatsoever on what price it pays. The company will base its price, as will all the bidders, on the basis of the worth of the company. It will have the assistance of a very good due diligence procedure carried out independently by Price Waterhouse and Salomons to assist it. I make no bones about the matter: I hope that we can see ANL privatised. I sincerely hope that the trade union movement can take a stake in that privatisation. I hope that we can see ANL recover from its parlous state and be reborn. It will be a different sort of line, but that is the approach the government has taken. We are doing something aboQt it. We are doing the sorts of things that you would never do. The next wet lettuce that came across the table was the Laura Tingle charge. Now there are four of them in the cart. There is Laura Tingle, Mr Dempster, who is formerly from the 7.30 Report, the shadow minister for privatisation and the shadow minister for transport, all of whom are saying that there is something in this charge. The directorsof ANL negotiated a sale-a very favourable outcome from the government's point of view-to stop us being reduced to a minority shareholding. They secured $28 million. Because that afternoon they could come up with only 20 per cent by way of a deposit and they were given 90 days to settle-that is a deferred settlement-that is characterised as the basis of a censure motion against me. This was a standard commercial arrangement entered into by the directors of ANL and Malcolm Turnbull, who was the negotiator on behalf of the government, yet in some way that is....supposed to represent the basis a censure motion. What an absolute wet lettuce. It is characterised here as a loan. No money changed hands; it was a deferred settlement. Yet there is something wrong with it! What a load of nonsense. The third damp lettuce concerned the third runway. Opposition members asked why the east-west runway cannot be opened. The attempt to charge the Prime Minister of Australia as the person responsible for airport noise in Sydney is about as sincere as John Fahey's charge that all of this was done to assist Bob Carr, whose electorate is on the east-west corridor. Who is it coming from? In the case of John Fahey, it is coming from a man who less than a year ago called for 24hour access in and out of Kingsford Smith airport. It is coming from the colleagues of John Fahey sitting opposite here. In the runup to the last election, we all remember the performances of the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) when they said that there should be a removal of the curfew. Yet they expect there to be some credibility in this charge that somehow or other the Prime Minister is responsible for the noise. The majority of people in Sydney are much better off. That does not mean that this government does not take with absolute seriousness the plight of those people who are worse off. It is for that very reason that we are committed to restricting the flight paths. It is for that very reason that we are committed to very substantial penalties against people who fly outside those flight paths. It is for that very reason that we want to bring forward the sound amelioration program so that we can treat the worse affected areas. It is for that very reason that we want the new operational requirements at Kingsford Smith to make sure that the minimum number of people are exposed to noise. Yet you come in here today and talk about opening up the third runway. What you are doing is arguing for more planes into Kingsford Smith, not for jets on the east-west runway. You know that you cannot do that. You are arguing the position of Hazelton Airlines and the position of Graeme MCMahon of of Ansett. You think that, if all of the propeller planes take off and land to and from the east, you will be able to put more jets on the north-south axis. You know full well that jets cannot take off on the new parallel runway. In the view of those opposite, that means that five, 10 or 15 more jets per hour can take off when the conditions would mean take-offs to the north across that corridor of people directly under the flight path to the north. That is what you are really about. You are using this to undermine the micro-economic reasons for the development of Badgerys Creek; a second airport that can meet the demands of Sydney and can provide the hubbing arrangements to adequately cater for all of the flights that are currently being demanded. I have told you today that the increase in flights is between 48 and 50 per cent only in the last nine months. That was the third damp lettuce. No-one should be deceived by any of this, least of all the poor individuals who are suffering at the moment from noise exposure on the north-south runway. You are attempting to dupe and deceive them by saying that their lot can be made better by opening the east-west runway to propeller planes, knowing all the time that more and more jets will be taking off over the top of them. The member for Hume finished up by saying that it was an enormous mess. I am proud that this government is tackling all of these issues vigorously-whether they be ANL, aircraft safety, the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the restructure of the Civil Aviation Authority or the measures that will be discussed by cabinet tomorrow-to guarantee that we have the airport that Sydney needs and the maximum protection for people.

188,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"Bradfield) (4.50 p.m.)I second the motion. One of the characteristics of a discredited government is that it tries to pass the buck on to somebody else. That is what we have seen in this debate today and what has been affecting the people of Sydney so grievously in recent weeks. The third runway was opened on 4 November this year. On 29 November, a crowd of some 2,000 people attended a hastily organised meeting at the Petersham Town Hall to protest against the increased noise levels. I was at that meeting. A shadow minister was at that meeting. A number of state Labor members in the area, including the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Dr Refshauge, were at that meeting.",99
189,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,-:-How many federal members were there?,99
190,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,The interesting thing was that there was not a single federal member,99
191,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,-:-Not one?,99
192,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"Not one single federal member bothered to tum up--or maybe I should say that they were not game enough to tum up. Had the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who has just spoken, been there he would have noted, among other things, the intention of people to lynch him. They believe-and rightly s()--'-that, as the minister, he has to .-arry the responsibility for the total disruption to the lifestyle of thousands upon thousands of Sydney residents. One of them made the point, which I thought was rather cryptic, that Mr Brereton's street should be made runway No.4. More recently than that, last Saturday at Leichhardt Oval, 10;000 people came out on this issue. Yes, it is serious. Yes, it is important. Yes, it does affect the lives of these people. The one characteristic that brought those people together was not just noise and its clear physical and psychological effect upon them and their families, but the firm belief that they have been misled by this government that for so long has carried out, under the protection of silence, a series of activities which were ultimately going to cause massive losses to the character of their lifestyle, to the value of their homes-to their very sanity. When we heard those people speaking at those public meetings, we heard from the heart what ordinary people are suffering because of the circumstances over which they have absolutely no control. It is fine for the minister to tell us why the east-west runway cannot be reopened. It is fine for him to protect himself on the grounds that the CAA says that there are safety reasons. Of course, safety in aviation is of fundamental importance. But the sad fact of the matter is that there are political considerations in this area. The honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), who is in the chamber here today, knows that she has been sacrificed. S'he knows that she is the loser of this outcome, and she knows that the government has made a decision that Barton, St George, Sydney and Grayndler are more important than the seat of Lowe. Let me assure her of one thing: we are on her sideThe boundaries of this problem do not stop at the Parramatta River. This problem goes well beyond that-well over Lane Cove, well over Hunters Hill and right to the very edge of Kuring-gai National Park. Even the animals in the park are complaining. We were not told about this. My constituents were not told. People in Chatswood were not told. People up in Wahroonga and Turramurra were not told. I had an engineer do a survey this week in west Pymble, and he picked up 88 decibels of sound. It might be worth members knowing that on the race track those very noisy sports cars are not allowed to go over 100 decibels. So when you are talking about 88 decibels in a valley-that is where this person did the test-you can see easily what the effect of noise is on the people who are caught in this environment. Geography has them caught, and the sound reverberates through their homes and through their lives. Version 6 of the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport noise management plan was issued in March 1994. When you go through this document, you find these interesting tables outlining the effect that the noise would have on people. It talks about the aircraft noise effect on people by the year 2010. It almost puts you into that somnolent sense that it is over the hill, far away; that it is not really going to be an issue for the people of today. But it is a problem for the people of today; it is a very real problem on a daily basis. The questions asked and the analysis which was carried out was very interesting. Was it going to affect conversation, watching TV or listening to radio or music? Would sleep be disturbed by noise? There is an analysis of the number of people who would be affected by the noise: 26,800 would be seriously affected; 127,700 would be moderately affected; 100,000 people would have their conversation disturbed; and 135,300 would be disturbed whilst watching TV or listening to radio. I love the preciseness of these figures. A mere 59,000 people would have their sleep disturbed. The document claims that the total number of people in that group in the population who would be affected by the airport is 417,600 people. My mathematics may not be marvellous but it seems to me that, on the basis of this survey, every single person has been affected to a significant degree by the noise generated by this airport. That survey was done on the basis of the anticipated problems in the year 2010. We have been told by the minister today that, in this year alone, the use of Mascot airport has gone up by over 50 per cent in those peak periods. If the increase is 50 per cent in one year, what is it going to be by the year 201O? The people of Sydney demand answers to these problems. They believe, and rightly so, that this analysis which apparently took place was either wrong or was organised in such a way that people were never told the truth. I, like many other members in this House who have been affected by this problem, have received numerous letters from constituents who make these points. They ask us to be their voice in this House. They ask us to say to the government, 'You are ruining our lives. Why did you do this to us and why didn't you give us a fair warning?' Mr K. Lane of Turramurra wrote: Before the runway opened we had only 5-10 planes going over our house a week. Now it is about 80 a day. A person in St Ives wrote: The chief culprits are the 747s ... at times, they are only a few hundred metres overhead (despite the airport being some IOkms away from us) ... The interesting thing is that this analysis done by the government never at any stage suggested that the problems of the airport were going to go beyond a clearly defined area, the northern boundary of which would be the Parramatta River. Not one of the maps provided by the authority, by the government, by the minister, by his department, shows a single indicator of any noise problems north of the Parramatta River or the Lane Cove River. Yet the fundamental fact of the matter is that those figures of the number of people affected by sound are absolutely flawed. The real figure is probably twice that. I think we have a right to know why that is so. Why were those figures so wrong? Why was that analysis so wrong? Why were people not told? Why was this whole exercise carried through with such a degree of secrecy, in an underhand way? Perhaps the most poignant statement. I heard at the public meeting at Petersham Town Hall came from a young girl called Amanda. She was quoted on AM of Wednesday, 30 November as saying: My name is Amanda, and I come from Sydenham, and us kids at school, we can hardly hear what the teachers are saying from these planes because every two minutes, our teachers have to stop what they're saying, and then when us kids have more ideas in our heads, when one of the planes go, every single idea goes out of their heads. Time after time, person after person came forward at that meeting making the point of how disastrous the effect had been on their living capacity, on the ability of their children to go to school. Yet we have been told by this government, 'Don't worry. We are going to buy thousands of houses. We are going to take over the land. We are going to close it all down. We are going to organise the schools and give them a decent system so they will not get the sound effects.' On behalf of those hundreds of thousands of people, I ask the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) who is at the table and Minister Brereton, who is no longer here for this debate, that fundamental question: why did you not sort this mess out before you ruined the lives of these people? That is what they want to know. If you had all the answers-and we are still looking for them; that is why we are having this debate today-why did you not put the insulation into these homes? Why did you not insulate those schools? Why should the children in those suburbs suffer so grievously? Why should the results from their examinations be less than they ought to be? Why should their lives be ruined because of the short-term nature of this government's political decision making process? I gave out forms at that meeting and asked people to fill them in, to give them the opportunity to see precisely what the situation was. I got some very interesting responses, one from a Mr Antonios Samaras of Newington Street, Marrickville. He sent me two pages. The horrifying thing is that he has planes flying over his house on average about one every four minutes. Just imagine it-one every four minutes! How could you conceivably live under conditions like that? I seek permission of the House to table this material so that people can see what the realities are and what they mean to ordinary people.",99
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Jenkins)Order! Is the honourable member seeking leave to table the document?,101
194,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,I certainly am.,101
195,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,And he is certainly not going to get it. Leave not granted.,101
196,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"That is typical. That is fine. I will write back to Mr Antonios Samaras and say to him that we have a Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), who is at the table, and a government which are not only ruining his life but also not prepared to put on the table of this House the facts which he as a free citizen of a so-called democratic society has the right to put forward to a member of parliament and to this chamber. Here, minister-read it yourself. This story goes back to at least 20 October 1976, when Prime Minister Fraser and Premier Wran announced a series of important studies called the MANS study. The object of that study was to examine jointly the implications of the likely growth of air traffic in the Sydney region and to recommend a suitable strategy for major airport development. It is interesting to note that by 14 December 1979 our dear friend Mr Wran and his cohorts had pulled out of the exercise because they did not want to get too close to the heat; it could be a bit embarrassing politically. Nevertheless, in a report which was presented on 14 December 1979 the Commonwealth members recommended that a decision in principle should be taken to develop Kingsford Smith airport by the construction of a close space parallel runway and associated facilities east of the existing north-south runway and that land be reserved in the Sydney region for a second curfew-free major airport. The honourable member has just said that that would have been disastrous. Let us think this through more carefully. On 7 October 1982 the then Minister for Aviation, Mr Fife, announced the construction of a new runway at KSA. He stressed that 'this new runway is not an alternative to a new airport, but a necessary first step if Sydney is to remain as Australia's main aviation gateway'. He added: Let .me emphl,lsiiethere will be no new flight paths to the north of the airport. 'No new flight paths to the north of the airport'. He continued: The only new flight paths will be over Botany and the Kumell peninsula. No aircraft will proach the new runway from over the city off towards the city on the new runway. That is the point he made. What has happened is exactly the opposite. The whole issue was the need to try to balance the realities of sound on peopleMr O'Keefe-Will they sail in with the tail wind?",101
197,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,I am ·sick of listening I to the honourable member. Will you do me a favour,102

201,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"The point Mr Fife was to making was that a close space runway-not a broad space runway which you finally gotmaking was going to take aircraft above Botany Bay. Instead of that, the runway you constructed has taken aircraft across the city of Sydney, matters. affecting hundreds of thousands if not millions of people who previously had not had a problem with aircraft-or, if it was problem, it was certainly a manageable one. They are the realities of the situation. Ever since 1983, since the then shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Shortcompletely  election campaign that the Labor government would abandon the plan to build a second runway, there has been nothing but trouble and politics in this whole thing. This whole issue has been fraught with politics. Now the people in these Labor electorates-and in Liberal electorates in places like the north shore of Sydney-are carrying a substantial cost",102
202,Mr SOMLYAY,Unknown,"And Cook. Mr cONNOLLY-And in the electorate of Cook. It is because of the way you played politics for 11 years.

(Time expired)",102
203,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Swan-Minister for Finance) (5.05 p.m.) This is pretty cool. You have the opposition deciding that this is such a serious issue that it will not even put up its second eleven; it has brought out its district cricket team. If ever there was evidence that a district team had been brought out on this one it was the statements we have just heard. do not know if Wal Fife actually did put out that press release. I would like to believe that Wal Fife did not. I would like to believe that Fife has been misquoted. If he seriously put up an argument, as you just did, that you have a north-south runway and that it will operate away from the suburb affected north-south runways all the time, irrespective of the wind direction, then I suspect that has been a misleader, a liar or a in any way, shape or form in this exercise it has been Wal. I find it impossible believe that of Wal. I think that Wal was a very decent person. The opposition must be that up. I am sure that Wal would not ever have said anything as silly as that, given the knowledge that he would have of aviation One of the things that Wal was not able to do at the time was to identify a second airport a site in Sydney. That was a privilege which fell to me when I happened to be minister for aviation and we identified the Badgerys Creek site after years of both sides of politics being incapable of arriving at a conc1usion as to where Sydney's very necessary second airport ought to be. But I can tell you statements. one other thing about the close space parallel runway: it would have made no difference any of these noise profiles at all. If you down there and think your way through logically these propositions, you can absurd that proposition is unless you are going to play God and totally change the Environment wind system of Sydney. The one great probrecommendation lem about that close space parallel runway built. was that it was so close that, unfortunately, you got into the position where you could increase the usage of the runway at least to ""This the levels of the cross runway carriage. It was a hopeless position to arrive at; nevertheless the opposition of the day managed to arrive It at it. What you had out of the solution the government ultimately arrived at was a The workable one. I am absolutely delighted to be defending Laurie Brereton in this debate. I have been minister for a very long time now and it has seldom been my privilege to serve with a He went on to say: minister so courageous and so prepared to take the hard decisions and to get stuck into it, to get his hands into the issues of the day of and create something from them, create an right. effective set of outcomes to the problems that he handles-and they are some of the most and intractable problems that have confronted cations, governments on both sides of the House over the years. But, in case you want evidence of how meretricious the opposition is in this regard, listen to the hypocrisy of the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) clothing in the position that he puts forward for his constituents, allegedly, when all the evidence would beof the problems that we now confront evidence that was there and thoroughly understood by all of you when the governYou ment took this decision. You talked about a fourfold increase of noise and movement. Where did the estimate of that fourfold increase of traffic movement come from? It was a public document. It was the EIS associated with the original decision taken to build the parallel runway. It was an open public document ayailable to a-l of you on that side of the House and avruJable to your spokespersons when they made their Let us have a look at some of these great in statements. The Leader of the National Party sit of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) puts forward a wonderful little performance. Let us take a see how look at what he said on 22 March: Minister Ros Kelly has nine days to go before she has to deliver her response to the EIS that Mascot's third runway be Federal Leader of the National Party Tim Fischer not says 'D' day is Wednesday 13 November. is the ultimate litmus test for the government to bite the bullet quickly-failure to do so will see Sydney's 'gate way' role collapse. is two and a half years since the Federal Cabinet that approved the thir- runway ... proposal has' withstood the most stringent and critical scrutiny and quite simply it 'stacks up'."" This is Timmie boy, the fellow who has been up here asking questions of the transport a spokesman in question time when the A team was on, before the B team was put into bat. ACTU Federal President Martin Ferguson says 'one the reasons the third runway has not gone ahead is because.it is a political football'. He is absolu-ly On 22 March 1989, the Prime Mirrister Bob Hawke the then Minister for Transport'and CommuniRalph Willis, in' a joint statement s-d, 'The Government has decided to develop a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport subject to the satisfactory completion of normal EIS processes himself So far the protracted EIS studythe study that told you how much noise there was has cost over $20 million. can't say it was not thorough. The Leader of the National Party continued: The unassailable evidence before Minister Kelly includesall this evidence you have been trotting around as new* The fact that fewer people would be affected by aircraft noise. (70% fewer than at present). * The alternative Badgerys Creek airport would only reach threshold commercial viability after 2005. * Badgerys Creek would cost $2 billion plus the third runway would only $273 million. * The third runway would sustain an additional 36,000 jobs in tourism in NSW and generate an additional $1 billion in GDP. This is what the opposition said when the decision was taken on the third runway. What canting hypocrites, what a gaggle of pathological exhibits when it comes to this question of whether or not we are to blame. But does it get better? Does the opposition think it knows something about this? I have simply quoted one press release in this wad the Minister for Transport gave me. Let me quote another one-and this is even more classic. The media release is entitled 'Near miss at Mascot: there must be no further delay with third runway'. That is the headline. That is from the same source, the National Party leader. It reads: Any further delay in deciding on a third runway Mascot could mean loss of life as well as economic sanity. Is this the same bunch that is telling us that we ought to operate an east-west runwayagainst the advice of the CAA on safety grounds-in a full-blown sense across a set of parallel runways? Is this the same outfit that is now arguing that we ought to be doing that sort of thing? If ever you wanted an example of canting hypocrisy, that is one. You have a bit of difficulty with a crosswind runway operation that produces near misses and out you go, straight to the media, and tell us, 'We can't have any more of these near misses. You have to get that parallel runway in place.' What do you think you would be saying about the Minister for Transport now if he had rocked in here a month or two ago, when the third runway was available for use, and said, 'Gentleman and ladies of the chamber, I think I might just leave this runway, constructed as it has been, capable of being fully operational, as it is. I shall keep operating this generally conceded rather unsafe cross runway operation until I am absolutely certain that I have got in place all the particular developments at Sydney.' Do you not think that would now be part of a censure motion against the Minister for Transport? Do you not think now, with all the while problems that the CAA has allegedly had and all the investigations under way on safety, that as those opposite move their motion on ANL or whatever-and include it in this censure motion-they would be in this chamber saying, 'The CAA puts down a clear-cut position that it is safer to run parallel runway operations, as opposed to running cross-wind runway operations simultaneously, and you haven't opened it, Mr Brereton?' Did you not think that might have been part of the censure motion that might have been moved here today by these canting hypocrites when it comes to dealing with these sorts of issues? This opposition thinks that everybody in this place has .a 24-hour memory. Occasionally those opposite get away with that with the press gallery, but these days information retrieval systems are so much better. These days information retrieval systems allow us to for have a cold hard look at what they have had to say over the years and see the canting hypocrisy of their current positions as they produce attacks on the Minister for Transport. Their position on this is a joke. It is a deceit on the people of Sydney. Let me go to one what of your northern suburban members, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), had to say about all this. It is his electorate which is supposed to be affected, next to the honourable member for Bradfield's electorate. What did he have to say about this? Howard condemned the government's attitude-this is when we were not proceeding with the runway. He said: It is just a blatant stab in the back and betrayal of Sydney's interests. Sydney is our main tourist attraction and most famous international city. I can't think of anything in terms of our national infrastructure that is more damagingthat is, not proceeding with that third runwayIt is an awful decision, cheap and parochial. This is New South Wales ALP right wing cynicism at its worse. The member for Bennelong said: The coalition had the guts to make the right decision in 1982and we have already had a look at onewhen the government stocks were not all that high and the Liberals held Barton and Cook. I have spent quite a lot of time talking to a lot of people and a lot of them understand that by having a third runway, you could, in fact, reduce airport noise. He said that the people who would get it in the neck if flights in and out of Sydney were rationed would be commuters from the provincial areas such as Tamworth, Dubbo, Orange and Bathurst. That is worth a bit of thought here too, because ignoramuses who were debating this on the opposition side lied to the people of Sydney when they told themAn opposition member interjecting",102
204,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"This is a censure motion so you can cop it. They told them that they would support opening the east-west runway for a commuter based service, that they would take a bit of a punt that a commuter service on that east-west runway, only using a portion of it, would be able to be capably and safely conducted with a parallel runway in use. There is a better possibility of doing that sort of thing, if that is the road they choose to take. I think that is taking a bit of punt, but it is not impossible. What would be the effect of that? Remember who you are dealing with here. You are dealing with the people who are affected in the northern corridors of the city of Sydney, identified correctly in the EIS, of which you are already aware. The one effect of doing that would be to offer them no relief but to increase heavy jet movements on the two runways. It might be a decision you could take in terms of the efficiency of Sydney airport, but it is not a decision you could take in terms of improving the situation of the people.",105

218,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown," Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, at this time of the year, because of the proposed plans of members and senators, I am wondering whether the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) could apprise the House of his best assessment as to its rising this week and any other information he can convey.",108
219,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"We currently anticipate that we will sit on Friday. Also, we will probably suspend the closure rule and sit late tomorrow. The rate of business coming back from the Senate is still slow, and I would expect that to carry us through. However, we are currently looking at the possibility of doing the valedictories tomorrow, as I know that is a matter of concern to the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). We would do that, in all probability, sometime after what would be likely to be a dinner break tomorrow. NA Defending Australia: Defence White Paper 1994  Science and Personnel)-by leave-The world has changed dramatically since the Australian government published its last defence white paper in 1987. We knew then that we were living in a dynamic era, but the nature and the pace of the changes which have since taken place were quite unforeseeable. Of all the changes, the most significant has been the collapse of the Soviet Union. This was a massively important event, which fundamentally changed the global security environment. Almost overnight, the east-west stand-off, which dominated international strategic affairs for 50 years, was no more. No part of the globe was unaffected by this radical changecertainly not Asia and the Pacific. This historic geo-strategic change has been accompanied in the Asia-Pacific region by continued and rapid economic growth. Potentially, this too has enormous long-term consequences for strategic relationships and security in the region. The government's 1994 defence white paper, Defending Australia, addresses the long-term consequences of these major changes for our defence policy. Defending Australia looks ahead 15 years to provide broad guidance for defence policy making and for the force structure and capability decisions we will have to make. It provides the framework for developing our defence policy through the next decade. Defending Australia is a substantial and complex document. Today I will simply highlight some of the underlying thinking and key themes. Our starting point is the conviction that Australia must maintain the capability to defend itself against armed attack. Despite all the hopes and aspirations we share for reducing the chances of conflict since the end of the Cold War, military force is still an important element in international affairs, and will remain so. That is a fact of life, regrettablybut a fact nevertheless. It is also a fact that, while we will do all we can to avoid the use of force ourselves, ultimately, armed force can only be resisted by armed force. We must, therefore, continue to be sure that we can defeat an armed attack on our territory. We have a continent of our own to defend, and a unique set of national interests. We must be self-reliant, with the capabilities to provide for our defence without relying on the combat forces of other countries. The key judgment in this white paper is that fundamental changes in strategic affairs, both globally and within our region, will make Australia's strategic environment more demanding over the next 15 years. The threat of global war has all but disappeared, but so has the predictable shape which the Cold War imposed on strategic affairs throughout Asia and the Pacific. In its place, a new, more fluid and more complex strategic pattern will emerge. Security in the region will be shaped by continued high levels of economic growth. The sustained expansion in the economies of most countries is bringing enormous social and economic benefits. It is also increasing the capacity of many countries to modernise and develop their armed forces, and to become more confident and self-reliant in their security. The military capabilities of our regional neighbours are improving, especially through the introduction of higher technology systems. We will also see a growing capacity to sustain and operate these systems. Australia looks to the future of this region with confidence, and with a strong awareness of the opportunities which Asia offers for our own future. In looking to our long-term security, we will take a positive approach the region, and to the international defence policies and relationships which support defence interests. Nevertheless, prudence requires that we maintain the capabilities ensure our defence self-reliance. Australia's defence policy, as spelt out this white paper, recognises our responsibility to help shape our security environment. This requires that we engage closely with our region on strategic issues; that our alliances with the United States and New Zealand; and that we contribute effectively to multinational security efforts. Just as Australia's prosperity is strengthened by our economic integration with Asia, so our security will be enhanced by closer strategic engagement. Australia has an active role to play in the evolution of a secure regional environment which reflects our needs and interests, and makes armed attack on this country less likely. The way we seek to influence this environpaper ment will need to eV,olve as strategic circummeasure. stances change. The task will become more challenging as our security environment becomes more complex and more demanding. We will strengthen our bilateral defence relationships, and actively pursue multilateral approaches to security in the region. particular, we will foster an accurate underensure standing of Australia's strategic interests security concerns. In tum, we will ensure that we understand the perceptions, concerns <;:apabilities of our neighbours. , At the same time, our alliance with the United States will continue to be a key element of our defence policy. We will work with the United States to ensure that the alliance continues to meet the needs of both parties-both in a strategic sense and in the practical benefits it delivers. We will continue to give strong support to the United Nations and other multinational endeavours which promote global security. An effective United Nations can help to make war less likely throughout the world by mobilising international action against aggression. Our support for the United Nations to therefore makes a direct contribution to our security. It is also through the United Nations our machinery that the government is able to respond effectively to humanitarian crises, to such as those in Rwanda and Somalia. Important as these commitments are, we do not structure the Australian Defence Force for in them. The ADF has clearly demonstrated that its force structure and readiness levels are sufficient to undertake United Nations tasks, provided the defence budget is supplemented we maintain for major contributions. We will continue to examine each multinational operation on its merits, and evaluate each contribution in terms of our national objectives. Effective arms control measures also contribute directly to Australia's security. Therefore, defence will continue to support the government's policy objectives in relation to global regimes for arms control. We are also strongly committed to transparency in defence planning in order to build trust and reduce suspicion, especially within our own region. The publication of this white is in itself an important trust building While the government will continue its active pursuit of Australia's international defence interests in these ways, the key message of Defending Australia is that our highest defence priority will continue to be to In build, maintain and support forces which we can defeat any armed attack against and Australia. We do not believe that any country has an intention to use force against Australia. and We have no disputes with other countries which might be expected to give rise to the use of force, and there is also no reason to expect one to develop. However, disputes can arise and intentions can change relatively quickly. Because military capabilities take many years to develop, it follows that we plan on the basis of capabilities and not threats. Let me repeat that: we plan on the basis of capabilities, not threats. No country has the capability to seize and hold major territory on our continent. SignifiDefence cantly, we believe that no country plans to develop such forces. To do so would require a very large effort, and we would expect to have substantial warning of any such development. However, the capabilities available to mount lesser levels of attack on Australia grow over the next 15 years. Such attacks could be very damaging to Australia, and could arise with relatively little warning. The key challenge for defence capability planning will be to adapt to the greater demands posed by increasing military capabilities in such short-warning conflict. We will continue to use the most costeffective means to ensure our security. Our planning will exploit Australia's geographic advantages, technological capabilities and wider national resources to ensure we can defend this country. This means giving clear priority to the naval and air capabilities needed to deny our approaches to an adversary. We must recognise, however, that the development of military technology poses new challenges. Over the longer term, we will need to be more selective about those military capabilities in which we must maintain our technological advantage. We will also use our defence capabilities more efficiently. All elements of the Australian Defence Force will work closely together as an integrated force and make the best possible use of their equipment and facilities. Our ability to draw on wider national resources will grow in importance. We will seek to integrate a range of civil assets and expertise into our defence effort order to sustain our capabilities more efficiently. This will provide a wider base for developing and supporting high-technology systems. The effective use of our geographical and technological advantages, backed by the diverse strengths of our national support base, will give Australia a defence posture of greater depth and resilience. From this key objective flow the main defence priorities set out in Defending Australia. I want to highlight three today. Firstly, high priority will be given to the skilled people we need in the ADF. The Australian Force's tradition of excellence is based on the professionalism of its people. Our deployments to the Gulf War, Namibia, Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda and elsewhere have demonstrated this beyond question. We - hould also acknowledge the great body of will unsung work which our forces do every day to ensure they retain the necessary levels of proficiency and preparedness. The ADF will remain fundamentally dependent on the quality of its people. It is easy to overlook some of the special demands military life places on our people and their families. We must therefore ensure that they receive adequate recognition. While personnel numbers will not increase over the next 15 years, the demands placed on our people by new technology will. Recruiting and retaining high-calibre people in the Defence Force presents long-term challenges. Over time, we will increase community understanding of defence and encourage greater recognition· of the career opportunities that military service provides. In addition, a· wide ranging defence review of the principles which underpin ADF personnel policies and procedures has begun and will be completed next year. Reserves too have a long and proud tradition of service in peace and war. The white paper makes clear that reserves now have specific roles in our operational elements. They form a fundamental part of our total force and provide important links between the Defence Force and the wider community. Changes in reserve training are being in implemented, and a detailed structural review of the army reserve will be carried out next year. This will ensure that our reserves are better equipped, and that their training standards are more closely aligned to those of regular members. Secondly, the government will emphasise investment in high-technology capabilities which increase our security. We are moving ahead with plans to procure airborne early warning and control aircraft, and we will replace the Macchi lead-in fighters and our ageing transport aircraft. We will also proceed with new command, control, communications and intelligence networks, new helicopters for our ANZAC frigates, new minehunters and new vehicles for the land force. Our six new Collins class submarines, due to come on line in the next few years, will be the most capable, conventional submarines in the world. They are sufficient to meet our forecast needs. We will, however, review the need for additional submarines in the context of the first five-year defence budget in 1996-97. Our existing Leopard tank fleet will meet our needs until at least 2010. Therefore, we will not take up the recent offer to purchase newer Leopards because this would not be cost-effective. Defence capability development is not just based on acquiring new equipment. In a number of cases, we have the opportunity to enhance our capabilities by upgrading existing equipment and systems. For instance, we will ensure our FA18 Hornet fighter aircraft remain highly effective well into the next century by upgrading their sensors, electronic countermeasures and weapons. We will also undertake major upgrades of Australia's FFG frigates, M113 tracked armoured vehicles, and P3C maritime patrol aircraft. In our land force, the scope of efficiencies programmed by army will free up the personnel and resources necessary to raise a fifth infantry battalion. This battalion will be formed over the next three to four years. Thirdly, the government will continue to pursue a more effective partnership between Defence and Australian industry. This is essential to strengthen defence self-reliance over the long term. We look to internationally competitive industries in Australia and New Zealand to supply, maintain and adapt our high-technology defence equipment. We also look to industry to design and manufacture equipment suited to our unique needs. To encourage and assist our industries to develop the capabilities Defence needs, we have identified a number of changes to the way Defence works with industry. Defence will rely more on the strengths of the commercial sector. We will identify further opportunities for the commercial support program and help industry to acquire more defence related intellectual property. In addition, we will encourage greater local industrial research and development and, within carefully enforced guidelines, encourage increased international materiel cooperation and defence exports. Our emphasis on a strong partnership with industry will be complemented by the efficient use of Australian defence science and technology to help develop and support our most important defence capabilities. More broadly, successful national defence requires the closest possible links between Defence and the wider Australian community. This partnership ensures that vital support is available for our defence in peace and in conflict. It also provides ""major benefits to the Australian community through the ADF's activities in areas such as disaster relief, bushfire fighting, search and rescue, and counter-terrorist support. Finally, I want to address the issue of resources. National defence can never be done 'on the cheap' . More'complex and demanding strategic circumstances will place even greater pressure on our defence budget. We cannot escape that. It is often assumed that by reducing uniformed personnel numbers we reduce our defence capabilities. This is not the case. Defence has recently achieved major reforms which have reduced personnel numbers and costs significantly without reducing capabilities. Personnel costs have dropped from 60 per cent of the defence budget 20 years ago to under 40 per cent today. The government will continue to seek defence reforms and efficiencies. Nonetheless, we recognise that these savings cannot accommodate all the additional pressures on the defence budget over coming years. Those pressures will arise from the need to meet higher labour costs as ADF skill requirements rise and to sustain the operations needed to keep our capabilities highly effective. At the same time, we must invest in major new equipment and facilities because continual development is essential to maintain our relative level of capability. The government is determined to sustain defence funding. A long-term commitment is December 1994. fundamental when capabilities take decades to develop and introduce. We will provide stability and predictability which is so importgovernment's ant to the development and management of long-term projects and activities. For the next few years defence expenditure at current programmed levels will enable the plans and projects outlined in Defending Australia to proceed. Beyond that, modest increases will be needed to meet the demands of an increasingly complex defence environinterested ment. The government has considered these issues carefully and responsibly, and is committed to sustaining defence spending at approxiportfolio mately two per cent of GDP. The government has also decided that, from 1996-97, it will provide defence with a five-year budget commitment. This is a historic commitment. It is a decision which will provide an assured basis for long-term planning. This will allow more efficient development of defence bilities, more effective procurement from industry and better personnel planning and management. Many areas in Australia contribute to our defence objectives. Defence, in tum, contrifacto butes to other national interests. This includes Australia's international security interests, which ryquire very close integration of govworld affairs. ernment policies and approaches. The relationship between the Departments of Defence, Prime Minister and Cabinet and Foreign Affairs in these areas is especially strong and contrasts markedly with the proach of some 10 years ago. Our commitsions ment to this integrated approach was reflected in the close consultation which occurred during preparation of this white paper. The decisions we make on crucial resource and other issues over the next few years will shape Australia's defences well into the next century. The government is determined that, in the coming decades, our adaptable, versatile and self-reliant defence effort will effectively safeguard our country. I present the following papers: Defending Australia: Defence White Paper 1994-Ministerial Statement and Paper, 7",108
220,Mr REITH,Unknown,"by leave-I welthe come the opportunity to respond to the 1994 defence white paper. I do so in my capacity as the opposition defence spokesman representative in the lower house. I endorse the excellent contribution to the debate about Australia's defence policy made by my colleague the shadow minister for real defence, Senator Jocelyn Newman, in the Senate this week. I also commend to those in the debate the remarks of my coalition colleagues in the Senate, particularly those of Senator MACGIBBON. I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a few remarks. I held the defence on behalf of the coalition for some time; which sharpened my interest in defence policy matters. There is also clearly a link between the portfolio of foreign affairs and defence policy issues. As the coalition's current spokesman on foreign affairs, I believe that it is important to be abreast of the capaissues and to comment on them. It is also important to continually monitor and assess developments on major defence issues confronting the country. The end of the Cold War has meant the end of direct and de superpower confrontation and the lifting of the pall which the threat of global or large scale regional war had previously brought to The end of the Cold War has brought with it new but sometimes uneasy balances. It has seen the coincident breakdown of order in the Balkans and in central Asia, just to mention aptwo. There have been some increasing tenover proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in north Asia, for example, which is in our own region. Also, in our own region, the spectacular economic success of some of Australia's neighbours has underpinned a steady improvement in regional defence capabilities and signals an inevitable end to our claims to continued technological superiority in defence capabilities. At the same time, there have been stresses and fractures in long established alliances and there have been renewed pressures on the will and the resources of multinational fora, such as the United Nations. These and other developments have raised new uncertainties and new challenges for defence policy makers. Australia is not immune from direct developments in our own region or from the flow-on effects from events further afield. I quote with approval paragraph 1.6 of the white paper, which I think puts it quite well: The next fifteen years will see great change strategic environment. With the end of the Cold War, important new uncertainties have emerged about the future strategic situation in Asia. nomic growth will increase the power of nations in our region, and political change may make their policies less predictable. Because of these uncertainties, we acknowledge the possibility that our security environment could deteriorate, perhaps quite seriously in the future. We recognise that some time in the future armed force could be used against us and that we need to be prepared to meet it. That is a useful summary contained in the early pages of this defence white paper. This is not to say-I do not say--or suggest that Australia suddenly finds itself in a new and threatening environment. But it does mean that the certainties of the Cold War are over and that Australia will have to work hard to promote and secure its own interests in a more fluid and potentially more volatile region. In that context, the coalition does welcome the government's interest in defence and the release of this paper. In February, the government released its long overdue Strategic review 1993. We also welcomed that but made the point that it was rather tardy in coming. In fact, it had merely followed the coalition's earlier policy initiative released in 1992, particularly as it relates to cooperative regional defence. This white paper has been too long in coming, but it is welcome despite that. However, having read it, I am just not sure whether it was worth the wait after all. It is sometimes stated by defence commentators in Australia that, leaving the Democrats and the Greens aside-you can safely discard them when it comes to sensible debate on these issues-there is a fair degree of common ground between the major parties on defence issues and that differences centre more on the scope and scale of defence preparedness and on issues of portfolio management than on the broad thrust of defence policy. There is some truth in this argument, but I stress that whilst there is some common ground between the government and the opposition this should not be seen as a guarantee of bipartisanship on defence policy issues. Far from it. There are substantial in our differences between the government and the coalition. When we read this white paper we find that it highlights our concerns and the Ecodifferences between ourselves and the government. For some time now we have held grave concerns about the way capabilities, operational readiness and personnel levels are at being whittled down under Labor stewardship. We are concerned about mismanagement and about the size of the defence bureaucracy. We see nothing in this white paper which will sensibly address these issues. Under Labor, our defence capability has been cut. Under the 1991 force structure review we lost two out of our six regular infantry battalions. The white paper proposes that the army can re-raise one of these battalions, but only by stripping manpower from somewhere else in an already depleted Australian Defence Force. It is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul when you have already impoverished Paul. Mr Somlyay interjecting",112
221,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I can assure the honourable member that I am not referring to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Prime Minister has not been impoverished by his years in office, as his latest purchase of a mansion in Sydney shows. Under Labor our fighter force has been pared from four to three squadrons and we have fewer surface combatants and fewer submarines available for operational service. That is a fact. During Labor's term in office our personnel numbers have dropped by almost 20 per cent. I recognise that some of that has been due to the introduction of the commercial support program. The opposition supports the CSP. I understand that there have been a lot of difficulties with the introduction and implementation of the CSP, but I think the government can go further with the CSP. I say that because I think people join our defence forces to be active in the principal roles of the defence forces and not to be doing those functions which could be contracted out. The opposition is concerned by the fall off in uniformed personnel, especially in combat elements. Sustainability levels have been shattered as the government trades off stockholding to meet underfunded recurrent expenditure bills. The much touted force structure review initiatives, such as the ready reserve scheme and the commercial support program to some extent, have simply failed to deliver the sorts of efficiencies and savings expected of them. The list goes on and on. There have been delays in the Collins project, mismanagement and debates about the ANZAC contract and we have had the ill-conceived ready reserve scheme which I think the government, in its heart of hearts, knows was ill-conceived from the word go. Virtually anybody who has looked at the scheme would come to that conclusion. The opposition has also been worried about the flea market approach to defence purchasing and the insidious erosion of conditions of service. At the heart of all this is the question of defence funding. In this context, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is not keen to promote debate about defence in this country. I went to a seminar recently where the minister was supposed to speak, but apparently he declined the invitation because he did not want to promote defence policy debate in this country which I think is a great shame. The minister is on the public record back in November 1992 talking about his role as Minister for Defence. When asked a question about defence funding, the minister told the Australian: ... that's how I'm judged (by the Chiefs of Staft)--can I deliver a politically reasonable base funding ... Yet in the 1994-95 budget allocations, spending on defence will drop to the lowest level as a percentage of government outlays since the last year of the Whitlam government. By the end of the current Labor term it will fall to the lowest per cent of GDP since before the Second World War. The minister says, 'Judge me by whether or not I have the political clout to keep the dollars going into defence,' but on his own criteria he fails miserably. This defence white paper is yet another confirmation of that sorry fact. The failure of the Minister for Defence to meet his own criteria· for success as a minister has been recognised by the Labor Left. The incredible thing about Australian politics is that even the Left admits that cuts in personnel and operating costs have been to the detriment of readiness and morale. It put out a paper entitled 'The price of peace in an age of uncertainty' which acknowledges: Further defence cuts would raise concerns about Australia's capacity to fulfil its national goals in the area of defence self reliance, Foreign Affairs and the promotion of peace. That is exactly the direction in which this defence white paper and the government's policy is taking us. Mr Taylor- Mr Two Per Cent.",113
222,Mr REITH,Unknown,"Mr Two Per Cent. Why would anybody believe that the two per cent is going to be maintained anyway? In the last white paper the government told us that it would keep defence spending between 2.6 and three per cent, which is what was necessary to keep the show on the road. Of course, that has been eroded. I have no doubt that the government will erode it further. Commonsense tells me that spending on defence is like writing out a cheque for home insurance. Honourable members know that, every year when they write out a cheque for insurance, they would have second thoughts and say, 'I will work on the basis that there will not be a fire this year because there has never been a fire' - I am lucky I have never had a fire bum down any of my homes-but common sense tells you to keep paying the premium. I believe that when it comes to Australia's defence forces we have to keep on paying the premium. Year in and year out, sadly, this government is whittling away Australia's defence efforts. At $9.87 billion in 1994-95, defence allocais tions will fall to 2.1 per cent of GDP. This is Labor. $21t2 billion dollars lower than if spending were pegged at the 1987 expectations raised by the government of a benchmark figure of three per cent. Clearly, the spending projections in the 1987 white paper have proved to be unrealistic and unsustainable. With the latest white paper imposing a cap of two per cent of GDP, the problem can only be exacerbated. I will put it in the most simple terms: when the government brought down its defence paper in 1987 it said, 'This is what we think we ought to do to defend Australia. This is the personnel and equipment that is necessary.' To achieve that the government would need to spend between 2.6 and three per cent of GDP. That was the way it was going to proceed. It did proceed and proceeded particularly on the capital equipment side. The opposition has supported the government in its commitments to buy new ships, submarines and other sorts of equipment. But the fact is that after it made the commitments it then started to cut back on defence spending. It was committed to various contracts and the like on the equipment side so, when it was short of a dollar, what did it do? It cut into readiness and personnel resources. We have great people in the Australian Defence Force and I pay tribute to the people who are prepared to serve our country in the defence forces. They have to put up with a hell of a lot. Within the last 12 months I spent a day out on HMAS Adelaide. I was most impressed by the work the captain and entire crew do. I have been to the RAAF base Pearce. You could not meet Australians more dedicated to the future of this country than those in either of those two situations and Defence Force in general. We are very lucky to have those people. That imposes an obligation on us to look after those who are prepared to serve their country. Let us look at the pay rates for some of our defence people. We pay some of our defence people so little by way of remuneration, take home pay, that they qualify to go around to Social Security for a welfare payment. That is a disgrace. Unfortunately, that the reality of defence spending under I have said in earlier speeches that it would be tragic for Australia's defence if the white paper simply sets about justifying existing structures and capabilities. It is the old trap of situating the appreciation rather than providing a disciplined analysis upon which defence policy and force structure planning can be solidly founded. Unfortunately, this has proved to be true. This white paper simply recycles the 1987 white paper, the 1991 force structure review and the 1993 strategic review. It offers very little that is new to the debate. It is less a policy review than an apology for the government's failure to fund its last white paper proposals. I conclude my response, which is a bit limited by nature of the schedule today, with three issues. The first goes to Labor's approach to regional defence cooperation. This government, which prides itself on its understanding of Asia, has not managed to strike the right balance in its proposals for closer regional defence cooperation. The 1994 defence white paper fails to recognise that the development of a sense of strategic community, which is so vital to continued regional stability, rests on a balanced effort to strengthen regional relationships as well as on direct bilateral ties. In our defence policy document A Strong Australia, released in 1992, the coalition unambiguously supported the strengthening of defence ties in the region under the aegis of cooperative regional defence. Our policy places particular emphasis on the development of defence cooperative arrangements, particularly where these serve to improve stability the through transparency and mutual understanding. We were heartened to see that this concept was picked up by the government in the 1993 Strategic Review and were pleased to see its similar acknowledgment in this latest white paper. The extension of Labor's strategic horizons beyond South-East Asia to North Asia, to include Japan, the Koreas, China and Taiwan, and the Indian subcontinent is also welcome. But, on Labor's record, we doubt whether it will be able to translate its expressions of good intention into effective action. Labor has too often displayed an inconsistency in its dealings with the region and this has, at times, caused some friction. Our relations with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have all been bedevilled by Labor's lack of balance and even-handedness. Sadly, I do not see any relief from this in the latest white paper. Indonesia, for example, is now touted by the defence minister as our most important relationship. I hope that this does not send confusing signals to our long standing defence partners in the region-particularly New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Singapore and Malaysia-who are partners in formal defence arrangements. Indonesia is important, but other regional players deserve appropriate regard. Relative size and proximity should not be the only determinants of the importance of bilateral relations. The coalition acknowledges the significant role which smaller and less proximate nations also play in promoting regional stability. It views the scope of relationships between regional nations to be no less important than the strength of discrete bilateral relations. While the government is right to focus on the development of bilateral relationships, it must not lose sight of the need to promote regional, and not just bilateral, cooperation. And it should"" not overlook the fact that our bilateral cooperative programs also offer opportunities for promoting interaction between regional counterparts. In particular, concurrent attendance by officers from regional nations at courses at our military and academic institutions offers far greater scope for effective and cooperative interaction than a purely bilateral course. Similarly, we should seek to promote seminars and discussions at the senior policy and strategic levels on a broader than bilateral basis. The bottom line is that we must ensure that our finite defence cooperative resources are put to the most efficient and mutually beneficial use. By mutually beneficial, I mean regional and not just bilateral benefit. The second matter I raise is a rather specific, one, but it is on my mind because I have been reading the papers this morning about the Prime Minister and his interest in foreign affairs matters. It reminds me that the skills you learn as a wheeler and dealer in the New South Wales Right are not always appropriately transferred and applied in the matter of sensitive international relations. I refer particularly to two paragraphs in the defence white paper. The first is paragraph 2.17, which refers to Taiwan. It states in part: The relationship between China and Taiwan is likely to evolve in response to political change in both, but in a direction that is not easy to foretell. I also quote an interesting statement from paragraph 8.29. It states: In time, opportunities also may arise for constructive contact with Taiwan on defence and security issues. My attention was drawn to this, not just because of the newspaper reports this morning but also because of the fact that in the last two or three months I have been in both China and Taiwan and there are some very interesting issues which Australian policymakers should be addressing. There has been a continuation of the political liberalisation in Taiwan. When I was there, I was able to see for myself the vibrant democracy at work as elections were being held for the mayoral positions in both Taipei and Kaohsiung in the south, and there was also an election for the position of Governor of Taiwan Province. It is interesting that, in the outcome, the DPP was successful in wresting the mayoral position in Taipei from the ruling party. The interest in that is that this is yet another signal of the development of a multi-party political system in Taiwan. Taiwan has an interesting history. When I was there, the KMT was enjoying its lOath anniversary. The KMT has had a chequered past-I think that is a fair comment to make-but it is very interesting to see in Taiwan the unilateral handing over of political power by a monopolist political party to establish a multi-party, democratic system. It is a matter of great tribute to the leaders of the society in Taiwan that those who have held power have been prepared to share power and to establish a democratic system. Mr Lindsay-It has taken a long time.",114
223,Mr REITH,Unknown,"It may well have, but there are others in the region for whom it is taking longer. Let us give credit where credit is due. This political development is reflected in that earlier quote from the defence white paper. The second development there is the economic development, which is also picked up in various reflections in the defence white paper. You have to hand it to Taiwan. The fact is that 35 years ago it was an aid recipient with per capita incomes of $200 or $300. Now it has a per capita income of $7,000, and it is still growing at a very considerable rate. You come back from a place like Taiwan and you say, 'It's great to be home.' But the second reaction is: 'What a comparison.' Taiwan has foreign reserves of $US90 billion compared with our foreign debt of $160 billion. It has high rates of growth, and it is not talking about jacking up taxes because of the current account constraint-the same old boom-bust recession problem that we have in Australia.  do with defence.",117
224,Mr REITH,Unknown,"It has a lot to do with defence. Minister, perhaps you have not been following the issues for very long, but the fact is that our defence policy is interdependent with both our foreign affairs policy and our economic policy. Mr Taylor-He hasn't even read his own paper.",117
225,Mr REITH,Unknown,"Exactly. I thank the member for Groom for his interjection. Ultimately, as this defence paper makes very clear, if Australia cannot maintain its economic base, our position in the region is relatively disadvantaged. I pay tribute again to the economic success of Taiwan. The third point I make is that I am very pleased that the government has picked up many of the proposals made by the coalition to improve the relationship between Australia anq Taiwan. This has occurred within the existing political framework, which is quite appropriate. Those improvements have been made and that has been very positive and beneficial for both sides of the relationship. Lastly, I commend the work of Colin Heseltine and those others who provided me with assistance when I was in Taipei. I conclude by quoting paragraph 2.8 of the defence white paper. In part it states: The successful initiation of APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum shows that the region can agree on broad goals. These developments give grounds for optimism. However, ethnic and national tensions, economic rivalry, disappointed aspirations for prosperity, religious or racial conflict, or other problems could produce an unstable and potentially dangerous strategic situation in Asia and the Pacific over the next fifteen years. That is the rhetoric of the government. I think the sad thing about the defence white paper is that, having painted a not unrealistic scenario for the future, the government has not backed that up with the resources necessary for the ADF to ensure that we can meet the situation which the government believes we will face. I conclude by saying that we welcome the release of the defence white paper. We are disappointed in its substance and hope that the government takes these concerns more fully into account in the future. Motion (by Mr Lindsay) proposed: That the House take note of the papers.

227,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (6.24 p.m.)-I move: That this House: (1) congratulates the International Labour Organiconstitution sation (ILO) on the 75th anniversary of its foundation and on the 50th anniversary of adoption of the Declaration of Philadelphia; (2) notes that Australia was a founding member of the International Labour Organisation when was formed in 1919 with 45 member states; (3) notes that on this anniversary, as a result of the ongoing international support for the Organisation, there are now 171 member states; (4) recognises and appreciates the uniqueness of the Organisation within the framework of UN specialised agencies by way of its tripartite structure, which enables governments, employers and workers to participate directly in its activities; (5) reaffirms its support for the important role played by the ILO as an international forum dedicated to the objectives of promoting and raising labour and social standards with a view to advancing social justice and ensuring world peace; and (6) wishes the ILO continued success in building links of friendship and understanding through the improvement of working conditions, general welfare and the human rights of working people and their families throughout the world. Australia was a founding member of the ILO in 1919 and has been an active participant in the ILO throughout its 75-year history. I am pleased to say that the ILO has always enjoyed bipartisan support in this country. Throughout the world governments of all political persuasions have recognised the importance of the ILO and supported its work. Since 1919, the membership has grown from 45 countries to virtual universal membership by 171 countries today. I am particularly pleased to note that South Africa is the newest member. South Africa rejoined the ILO this year after a 3D-year absence following the election in April of President Nelson Mandela's government of national unity. The ILO can count among its many achievements the vitally important contribution it has made to overcoming the abhorrent regime of apartheid in South Africa. The ILO was founded on the belief of social justice and to provide basic human rights for working people. The ILO's mandate, reflected in its and in the 1944 Declaration of Philadelphia, continues to be as relevant today the as it was at the time of its adoption. It includes respect for human rights, decent living standards, humane working conditions, emit ployment opportunities and economic security. The ILO can boast a commendable record in fulfilling its mandate. It can truly reflect on its 75 years and say that it has been a most effective international organisation. That is an assessment not just of this government but of many leading world figures. On the occasion of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the ILO in 1969, the Chairman of the Nobel Committee said: There are few organisations that have succeeded, to the extent that the ILO has succeeded, lating into action the fundamental moral idea on which it is based ... Working earnestly and untiringly, the ILO has succeeded in introducing reforms that have removed the most flagrant injustices in a great many countries . . . His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, when he gave an audience to the chairman of the ILO governing body in 1992, congratulated the ILO for putting social dialogue and tripartite cooperation at the forefront of its considerations. President Nelson Mandela, in contributing to the volume of essays entitled Visions of the Future of Social Justice on the occasion of the ILO's 75th anniversary, wrote: The present situation in South Africa, where· a majority of the population is trying to rectify experience of generations of systematic exclusion from the most basic rights and benefits, highlights the ongoing relevance of the ILO mandate. Many South Africans are only now recognising that lasting peace can be established only on the basis of social justice, 75 years after it was expounded as the founding principle of the ILO. Through the adoption, ratification and application of international labour standards by member states, the ILO's relevant is continually reinforced. Australia has ratified 54 of the ILO's 175 conventions, including the fundamental standards concerning freedom of association, abolition of forced labour, discrimination of employment, equality of opportunity and tripartite consultation. These standards have played a very significant role in improving employment conditions for all of Australia's working men and women. Our landmark Industrial Relations Reform Act has, for the first time, given all Australian workers access to key minimum standards based on ILO conventions. It opens the 'way for Australian workplaces to become more productive and more internationally competitive. It does so within a secure framework of comprehensive minimum standards underpinned by the award system and complementary entitlements based on relevant international standards. Ratification of ILO conventions has advanced the rights of workers throughout the world across a very broad spectrum. The in transfundamental conventions on freedom of association, forced labour and quality of opportunity, have now been ratified by well over 100 countries. Together they constitute a vital safety net of industrial protection. The fact that ratified ILO conventions are binding has also helped in countries where there has been a chance of their slipping backwards and adopting regressive legislation. However ILO conventions are by no means rigid, inflexible or overly prescriptive documents. The ILO assesses the need to revise its conventions on an ongoing basis. This ensures that they remain compatible with the realities of modem labour markets. Through its conferences, meetings and technical cooperation activities, the ILO is constantly exposed to the reality of the the changing labour market conditions in each and every one of its 171 member states. This experience is invaluable in assisting those member states in their implementation of conventions, in the development of new standards, and in the revision of existing standards. The full and independent participation of employer and worker organisations in the work of ILO also ensures that standards are kept up to date. More broadly, the ILO is uniquely placed to play a major part in improving social and labour conditions, as it is the only tripartite institution at an international level. . The government is presently evaluating several ILO conventions concerning basic human rights, occupational health and safety, and a range of other issues. A number of these conventions are included in Australia's national action plan on human rights, released earlier this year. Our target is to ratify the conventions progressively over the next five years. We will pursue this objective in full consultation with the states and territories, with employers and with the trade union movement. The government is also consulting with the states and territories concerning the possible ratification of ILO convention 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples. This international agreement is the only international convention which exclusively deals with the rights of indigenous peoples. Consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations is also a fundamental precondition to the ratification of this important international convention. There has sometimes been ill-informed comment about how Australia's sovereignty is affected by our international obligations and about the effect of conventions on states rights. The ratification of ILO conventions a decision that each member of the ILO takes in the free exercise of its own sovereignty. determining whether to become a party to a convention, successive Australian governin ments have considered whether the relevant convention is consistent with our national interests. Ratification creates binding international obligations on Australia to recognise and to apply in law and in practice the provisions of the ratified convention. The ILO has a well developed system of monitoring a country's practical application of the provisions of a ratified convention. ILO conventions have normally been ratified by Australia where our law and practice satisfy the convention. Ratification invariably follows extensive consultation with state and territory governments and the peak employer and union bodies through the National Labour Consultative Council. With the increasing globalisation of the world of work, the ILO's basic principles and standards of freedom of association are relevant today than they ever have been. This is particularly true in the Asia-Pacific region, where many countries are looking to work partnership with the ILO to establish plans technical cooperation in labour law, labour relations, employment promotion and training. There is a growing awareness in Australia of the need for a closer, more cooperative relationship between Australia and the countin ries of our region. We are strongly committed to playing an active role in promoting ecofor nomic and social development of the region ship, in many fields, and that includes employment and labour issues. A joint Australian-ILO project is assisting the governments of eight South Pacific island countries to improve the standards of their own policy and administration and, in the process, to significantly lift the productivity of their work forces. This project commenced in 1990 and has been highly successful, achieving higher levels of workplace safety and health and more cooperative industrial relations. It has been widely acclaimed by all parties and has been independently evaluated is by Coopers and Lybrand, which described it as 'an excellent example of effective developIn ment assistance in the South Pacific'. A second project with the ILO commenced February 1993. It is a tripartite project involving Australian advisory and training services to provide assistance to labour ministries, trade unions and employer organisations in Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. Although only in operation for some 18 months now, it is a program that is already having a substantial and positive effect. Most importantly, it has established an internationally acceptable model by which Australia can play a constructive role in the very sensitive area of labour rights and standards. To build on these efforts, we have established an Asia Desk in the Department of Industrial Relations. It is aimed at strengthening our focus on assisting the development of sound industrial relations throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The government has provided funds in this year's budget to support our industrial relations initiatives in Asia and particularly our more role in implementing our memorandum of understanding on industrial relations cooperation with Indonesia, a memorandum that we in signed in November last year. I am also for pleased that we will be working with the ILO to assist its programs in our region on combating the exploitation of children at work. Let me conclude by saying that I believe the ILO needs to continue to play a key role guiding and influencing international social policy development. It is uniquely well placed this, given the universality of its memberits tripartite structure, its machinery for development and supervising standards, its principles, its values and its 75 years of operational experience. International organisations are strong and effective only if they are supported by their constituents. In Australia, the political parties and the social partners have firmly supported the ILO's principles and its work throughout its 75-year history. The ILO conference this year unanimously adopted a resolution which called on all member states and employers' and workers' organisations to reaffirm the principles and fundamental values upon which the ILO was founded. I trust that the House, in adopting this motion, will join with the international community in reaffirming our support for the vital work of the ILO in advancing social justice and human rights of working people and their families throughout the whole world.",118
228,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"La Trobe) (6.36 p.m.)The opposition joins with the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in congratulating the International Labour Organisation, the ILO, on the 75th anniversary of its founding. There is no doubt that the ILO has performed a very valuable service and is a very respected organisation in world social and equity terms. The International Labour Organisation was founded in 1919 under the Treaty of Versailles. After World War I, representatives of countries present at the peace conference framed a Constitution and an Enumeration of Principles for the International Labour Organisation. These texts would become Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles. The organisation was formed to improve labour and social conditions. For example, the preamble states: . .. universal justice and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social Right from its inception, the ILO has encouraged all nations to join its organisation. According to the preamble: The failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labour is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own countries . . . The 42 members of the League of Nations, including Australia, were the founding members of the ILO. Germany was admitted to the organisation in 1926 and the United States in 1934. It could well be said that the operations of the ILO-certainly through the early years-were dominated by European nations and by the developing culture in Europe of a social partnership between labour and capital. The idea emerged and then became the foundation of bureaucratic institutionsincluding the ILO-in such countries as Austria and Germany, where social compacts led to very heavily bureaucratised industrial relations systems. In such cases legislation is often not needed because all work practices are frequently sorted out before such issues ever even reach government. They are sorted out through total bureaucratic mechanisms. It has been said recently that highly centralised industrial relations systems, such as those throughout much of Europe, are reasonably efficient. It is also said that highly deregulated industrial relations systems, such as the one found in the United States, are relatively efficient. But Australia, caught in this time warp in the middle of deciding whether or not we will be highly regulated and centralised or whether we will be deregulated and open, is caught in a problem with makes us less efficient than either one of the others. While we have always supported the ILO and continue to do so, it causes some diffiCUlty. One difficulty we have is the way this Labor government selectively uses ILO conventions through the external affairs power of the constitution to back legislation which otherwise would offend the constitutional powers of the various states. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) in his speech to the House a few moments ago talked about sovereignty. He talked about justice maintaining the sovereignty of Australia through the links of our international treaties. What the minister forgets is that we are giving away a portion of our sovereignty, we have reduced our sovereignty, by allowing international bureaucratic organisations to an extent to make laws which under other circumstances we might not have made. I was pleased to hear the minister say that when he considers Australia signing and ratifying a number of conventions for the government he will consult widely with the states, with employers and with union bodies. I trust that he will live up to that statement, that he will consult well and that he will seek the agreement of the ,states before he signs such instruments on behalf of all the Australian people. Two examples come to mind of where this government has used conventions, I believe Every quite improperly, to override the powers of the states. The first recent example was when join the Minister for Industrial Relations used n..o convention 137, signed and ratified in 1974, 20 years ago, a convention that we have had simply: no need to use for some considerable time because it dealt with the issue of containerisever, ation in the ports. The minister attempted to use that convention to allow the waterfront union movement through the finance tee to reintroduce employer levies and pooling of employees to create once again a register which the Waterfront Industry Reform AuthWorkers ority had attempted to do away with. The second instance is the Industrial Relations Reform Act, which came into being on 30 March this year as an amendment to the Industrial Relations Act. The minister spoke of that briefly, talking about using the n..O convention to give every Australian worker minimum rights of protection guaranteed. But he has used the n..O convention to override what are state rights. They are written into the constitution as the rights of the states to make laws with respect to industrial matters except where a dispute occurs crossing the borders of two states, in which case the Commonwealth has jurisdiction. So the minister has improperly, in my view, used n..o conventions to legislate to enable his legislation to override state legislation because there was no other way under the constitution that he could do it. One area of concern where we differ with the n..O is the issue of freedom of association. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 20(2) states: No one shall be compelled to belong to an associa tion. I believe very strongly in freedom of association. People in our country-hopefully everyone in the world-should have the right to belong or not to belong to any organisation that they choose: a union, a management organisation, a community organisation, any kind of organisation. One of our basic rights should be freedom of association. Article 22 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights states: person has the right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and trade unions for the protection of that person's interests. But n..O convention No. 87, article 2, says Workers and employers, without distinction whatsoshall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without commitprevious authorisation. Convention No. 98, article 1, in part says: shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. I agree with the sentiments expressed in those articles absolutely. But the n..o does not go on in any of its articles, in any of its conventions, to define the right that a worker or an individual shall also have, an equal right, not to belong to a union of trades-'shall have the right not to belong'. That is a very important difference in principle which we on this side of the House hold dear and which those on the other side of the House, with a Labor government that is indebted to the trade union movement and to the trade union organisations, will not endorse in any way. The minister talks about the tripartite nature of the n..O. I wish to bring to the attention of the House that in Australia, as in the majority of industrialised nations in the Western world, the rate of union membership is once again falling. A recent article defined, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics has confirmed, th -.t in August 1993 union membership was down to 37.6 per cent of the work force compared with 39.6 per cent in August 1992. - The' unionisation rate at that time in the private sector was 27.5 per cent compared with 29.4 per cent in August 1992. The rate of decline in the public sector was higher, with the proportion of public sector employees who were union members down from 67.1 per cent in 1992 to 64.4 per cent last year. So all categories of union membership are showing falls. That is because of two factors. One is that unions are finding that they are less and less relevant to the needs of employees in workplaces, who today feel much more inclined to negotiate their industrial issues, their pay structures and their working conditions directly with their employer. So the two of them can work together to achieve a highly productive and high quality outcome for their firm. According to the AAP this morning, the New South Wales Labor Council Secretary Peter Sams has warned that the union movement is in danger of losing its power to lobby government. The ACTU executive meeting in Melbourne this week was told that union membership affiliated with the ACTU had fallen over the last year by 400,000 to 2.4 million. Mr Sams evidently told guests at· a breakfast meeting in Sydney this morning that the correct number was more likely to be closer to two million. That is a fall of 800,000 in a very short period. Mr Sams said it was vital that a new membership drive succeed. He stated: 'If we can't do it now in 1995 with an improving economy and good employment growth then we are never going to do it and we will end up as a rump, as an unrepresentative group of people that meet from time to time and create a bit of ruckus', Mr Sams said. 'But we won't actually have a major representation or a major representative organisation in which we can lobby government for the things we believe in. I think issue and address it wholeheartedly in 1995, then we will be in for a very long period in which our influence will be marginalised. The tripartite nature of the ILO, about which the minister spoke so eloquently, is in danger in Australia from the union movement destroying itself because of its lack of relevance to a modern work force dedicated to improving productivity, improving wage rates· and improving the lives of those who work for Australia's industry.

233,Mr WALKER,Unknown,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Willis). Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of a complex for the Australian Geological Survey Organisation at Symons ton, ACT. The Australian Geological Survey Organisais tion, AGSO, currently occupies a number of buildings, the largest of which is the ANZAC Park East offices on Constitution Avenue, where it has been since 1965. Most, if not accommodation is unsuited to the functional and operational requirements of AGSO and a new special purpose designed and built complex will provide for the consolidation AGSO's functions. The need to vacate ANZAC gram is it? Park East is a result of advice from regulatory authorities that AGSO laboratory operations should not continue in the building existing facilities contravene fire regulations, do not comply with laboratory construction codes and contain serious OH&S deficiencies. The project involves construction of a threestorey building comprising laboratories and related areas, offices and administrative support areas, storage areas, staff amenities, engineering workshops, roads, car parking, civil works and landscaping. The proposed building is to be located on a green field site of approximately 20 hectares in Jerrabomberra ation Avenue, Symonston, ACT, adjacent to the park Therapeutic Goods Administration complex in Narrabundah Lane. It is anticipated that construction will commence in early 1996 with completion in 1998. The limit of cost the project is $114 million at December 1994 prices.

242,Mr WALKER,Unknown,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for considerand report: Con""struction of a multi-level car for the Federal Airports Corporation at Melbourne Airport. Melbourne airport is the second busiest in Australia. It is subject to continuing growth for in passenger movements and, as a consequence, the present short-term car park is comsuffering severe congestion and frequent closure. As this growth in passenger numbers is forecast to continue for the foreseeable it is necessary for the corporation, in order to provide an appropriate level of service to its customers, to increase the of the short-term car park. As it is desirable that short-term car parking spaces be provided as close as possible to the terminal, it is preferable that the increased capacity be provided in a multi-level structure adjacent to the passenger terminal, rather than through further ground level parking. The proposed work involves the construction of a four-level, open-sided concrete car park, consisting of a covered ground level of 20,869 square metres, three suspended decks, including the open roof level, totalling 58,665 square metres, and a ground floor open car park of 23,500 square metres. It also includes: associated facilities, such as office facilities for car rental companies and police; accommodation for some high vehicles, including small buses; lifts and stairs; pedestrian bridges; goods loading dock; and landscaping and plantings. The project is planned to be completed in two stages. The first stage is expected to be in operation within eight months of the commencement of construction with the second stage following about 15 months later. I table the attached drawings.

This project is being conducted by my department. The Maralinga and Emu sites are located in South Australia in the region north of the Nullarbor Plain. Maralinga is 270 kilometres north-west of Ceduna. Emu is 190 kilometres north-east of Maralinga. Between 1953 and 1963, Great Britain conducted several programs of nuclear warhead development trials at Maralinga and Emu. These included detonations of nine nuclear weapons and hundreds of so-called 'minor trials' that dispersed radioactive materials. The former test site areas are contaminated to various levels with plutonium and other artificially produced radioisotopes that present an unacceptable risk to future users of the sites. In 1969 Britain undertook a program of clean-up works called Operation Brumby. The 1985 royal commission into British nuclear tests in Australia concluded that Operation Brumby was inadequate, based on wrong assumptions and left the area in a more difficult state for any further clean-up. The royal commission concluded, inter alia, that action should begin immediately to effect a clean-up of Maralinga and Emu to a level where they are suitable for unrestricted habitation by the traditional Aboriginal owners. A technical assessment group, TAG, was formed in February 1986 to address technical matters stemming from the royal commission. A three-year program of scientific and engineering studies by TAG developed a range of rehabilitation options and comparative costs. TAG's report was tabled in parliament in 1990. During 1990, the Commonwealth government agreed on a preferred rehabilitation option for the Maralinga test sites as a basis on which to seek a substantial contribution to rehabilitation works from the British government. This clean-up option is the lowest cost option developed by TAG that would enable Aborigines to resume access to the former test site areas. It is intended that upon completion of the project the test site area will be returned to South Australian control for addition to the Maralinga Tjarutja freehold lands. In December 1993, the Australian and British governments concluded an agreement under which Britain will pay £20 million in an ex gratia settlement of Australia's claims concerning the British nuclear test program in Australia. This amount will be paid in six annual instalments. The first instalment of £5 million was paid in December 1993. The proposed clean-up will reduce the radiological hazards at the test sites to enable Aboriginal use of and transit through the test site area, reduce and possibly eliminate the need for control and surveillance of the sites and remove potential Commonwealth liabilities arising from site contamination. The majority of the works will be undertaken at Maralinga, including: installation of a construction camp at Maralinga village; upgrading of general site infrastructure; construction of burial trenches; collection of contaminated soil and placement in burial trenches; stabilisation of material in selected debris pits and removal of contents from other debris pits to burial trenches; and general clean-up and surface restoration and revegetation of disturbed areas. . Work at Emu will involve the ripping up of roads to discourage access to the site. All work in the contaminated areas of the site will be undertaken under strict controls. It is anticipated that work will commence in mid1995 for completion in late 1999 at an estimated cost of $104.4 million at November 1994 prices. I would not recommend the committee attend this particular site until after the restoration is complete. I commend the motion to the House.",126

This proposal relates to the Defence Force structure review, which was announced by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on 30 May 1991. Under this review, a regular army brigade is to be permanently based in Darwin by the end of the year 2001. This is being achieved by the phased relocation of southern based units to Darwin. APIN stage 1 was considered by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 26 August 1992, and approved by parliament in November 1992. This proposalAPIN stage 2-is for the construction of working, training and accommodation facilities for these units. The facilities will be constructed at Robertson barracks, the site of the new army barracks-well named too, I might add-that were completed late in 1992 for the Second Cavalry Regiment where many of the facilities for units relocating under APIN stage 1 are currently under construction. The proposal also includes the construction of additional but minor ammunition storage facilities at Marrara Swamp, RAAF base, Darwin. It is proposed that construction will commence in July 1995 for completion by the end of the year 2001, at an estimated cost of $271 million. I commend the motion to the House.

The 2nd Field Hospital is a new army unit formed by the amalgamation of the. existing 1st Military Hospital at Yeronga and 2nd Field Hospital at Kelvin Grove. This proposal, which was referred to the Public Works Committee on 29 June 1994, is to provide new facilities for the 2nd Field Hospital at Enoggera to replace the inadequate facilities at Kelvin Grove and Yeronga. The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 15 November 1994, concluded that there is a need for the project and commended 'the dedication of the staff of the 1st Military Hospital, Yeronga and 2nd Field Hospital, Kelvin Grove who are presently working in old timber, metal and asbestos clad buildings which provide inadequate working conditions and lead to operational inefficiencies'. While recommending that the project proceed, the committee also recommended that 'the Department of Defence continue discussions with ACROD access and mobility committee concerning access provisions at the 2nd Field Hospital'. The Department of Defence agrees and will comply with this recommendation. The project involves construction of a modem hospital to include facilities' for the field hospital equipment and static health care services.

The existing facilities at HMAS Watson date from 1870, but most buildings currently used were constructed in the mid-1950s and need to be upgraded or expanded to meet current accommodation standards. The proposal, which was referred to the Public Works Committee on 29 June 1994, involves the provision of new or upgraded living-in accommodation for 346 service personnel, additional office space and classrooms, improved recreational facilities and additional parking space. The Public Works Committee, which tabled its report on 17 November 1994, has concluded that there is a need for the project and has recommended that the project proceed. However the committee has made a number of recommendations regarding restoration of bushland in areas near the Sydney Harbour National Park boundary, investigation of an alternative route for the bicentennial coastal walkway, and to address the concerns of local residents about master planning and management of the base and possible visual intrusiveness of a number of buildings. ,The Department of Defence agrees with the committee's recommendations and all will be implemented.

The Bligh Park estate is located about seven kilometres from the Richmond RAAF base. The residential development is being carried out by a joint venture involving Hawkesbury Council and Landcom, which is the residential property development section of the Property Services Group of the New South Wales state government. The proposal, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 29 June 1994, is to provide suitable accommodation for defence personnel who are at present living in substandard accommodation at Hobartville. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 16 November 1994 in which it concluded that there is a need for the project and recommended that the project proceed. The committee also recommended that 'the Defence Housing Authority continues to encourage the planting of native trees and shrubs on its housing developments'. The Defence Housing Authority agrees and underDefence takes to comply with the recommendations of the committee.

The objective of this proposal is to upgrade facilities at Kapooka to extend the life of the barracks for a further 25 years. In its report, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works endorsed the need for the upgrade and noted that the present working and living conditions are below standard and that some facilities do not meet building codes or ocrupational health and safety requirements. The works involve the renovation of a number of buildings including eight recruit accommodation bUildings, two staff accommodation buildings and the recruits' mess and canteen. Other buildings to be incorporated in the refurbishment are the military instruction building, cinema and office space for training staff. Two small residential accommodation buildings will also be constructed as part of the project. While recommending that the project proceed, and commending the Department of Defence on its Willingness to liaise with members of the building industry concerning the proposed works at Kapooka, the committee also recommended that 'the Department of continues discussions with the building industry in Wagga and proceeds with its intention of conducting a seminar for the building industry to discuss forms of contract and tendering processes'. The Department of is complying with this recommendaThe committee also complimented the Department of Defence on its reuse of waste water at Kapooka. It recommended that it 'continues to investigate the possibility of installing water saving devices where appropriate at Blamey Barracks, Kapooka'. This has been noted by Defence, and water saving devices will be considered for each element of the project during the detailed design phase. It is proposed to commence the works in January 1995 for completion by the end of the 1996 at an estimated outturn cost of $21.5 million.

The Defence Science and Technology Organisation's Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory, AMRL, is headquartered at Fishermens Bend, which is located about seven kilometres west of the central business district of Melbourne in Victoria. This site accommodates most of the laboratory which has as its primary mission the development, maintenance and exploitation of scientific and technological skills in areas central to military aircraft and other air vehicles for the benefit of Australian defence. The proposal, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 29 June 1994, is for the replacement or upgrading of a range of components including the compressor system, compressor drive and tunnel test section, and the installation of a new cooling system, a new plenum evacuation system and a new model support system. It is anticipated that construction will commence in May 1995 for completion by February 1997. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 8 November 1994 recommending that the work proceed at a limit of cost estimate of $12.7 million at December 1993 prices. This equates to an outturn cost of $13.5 million. While recommending that the project proceed, the report also recommended that an independent study of the desirability of deactivating a second DSTO transonic wind tunnel at Salisbury be carried out under the auspices of the Australian Science and Technology Council.

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works tabled its report on 10 November 1994, recommending that the project proceed. The committee also made two further recommendations to which the Department of Defence has responded as follows: 'The Department of Defence and the ACT Government should discuss coordination of road construction with a view to the work being undertaken concurrently as soon as possible' . The Department of Defence has commenced detailed discussions with ACT Capital Works on the staging of the Morshead Drive roadworks and the new entrance road to RMC. Several options are being considered to allow concurrent activity to occur on these two similar projects. The pilot study of the use of grey water for watering should be monitored carefully and, if no salinity problems emerge, should be extended to encompass all playing fields at RMC and ADFA as well as other defence establishments where practical.

DSTO is the research and development arm ensure of the Department of Defence. Its role is provide professional and informed advice on the application of science and technology meet the needs of Australia's defence and security. This proposal, which was referred the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 29 June 1994, is to provide a modem energy efficient research complex to replace the inadequate and greatly dispersed World War II former munitions manufacturing buildings currently in use. It involves the construction of a new ing which will accommodate 590 research and support staff and will include new laboratories and associated support spaces, office areas, administrative support facilities, staff ties, engineering services, car parking, roadpending works and landscaping. The public works committee, in its report tabled on 5 December 1994, concluded that there is a need for project and recommended that it proceed subject to the following recommendations. Firstly, the Department of Defence should continue the process of consultation with the Australians. South Australian government, local councils and relevant authorities concerning planning matters arising from the northern Adelaide defence land use study. Secondly, the Departtee ment of Defence should consult with staff associations regarding the revised report to the committee about these consultations. Thirdly, the Department of Defence should review procedures for the testing of systematic designs against user requirements minimise changes. Fourthly, concurrent with the further development of the proposal, the Department of Defence should undertake, or commission, a study of the impact on staff efficiency and productivity of open planning and other forms of office accommodation. Fifthly, costs associated with contingencies and escalation should be reduced. Sixthly, a formal framework for consultation between the Commonwealth, state and public organisations involved in heritage matters should be estabComlished which would enable heritage implicaof the proposed development and the wider site to be addressed in a timely manner.

255,Mr REID,Unknown,"I wish to raise the issue of there being a real world outside Canberra. It is time that members of the Keating cabinet came to realise this, got out of their ivory towers in Canberra and had a look at the rest of Australia. I have been prompted to say this because figures just released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal that a Victorian earns an average of $616.60 per week before tax, while a Canberra resident earns $715.40-almost $100 more per week in net disposable income. The latest census data available for Bendigo shows that 49 per cent of the city's earning population receive no more than $230 per week. We can compare that with Canberra residents earning $715.40 and Victorian residents earning an average of $616.60. It is quite obvious that people in the Keating cabinet have not been going out into broader Australia to find out exactly what is happening. I have here a table of average weekly earnings. The ACT comes right at the top of the list with $715.40, and right down the bottom-although housing is much cheaper there-is Queensland. I have visited the electorate of the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) and I have noted that housing is cheaper there. Victoria is languishing in the middle with $616.60",132
256,Mr REID,Unknown,"South Australia does not fare too well, either. South Australia is at $604.30. So you are $115 behind Canberra. I know that most ministers in the cabinet spend most of their time in Canberra",132
257,Mr FILING,Unknown,Overseas.,132
258,Mr REID,Unknown,And overseas. But it is time they got away from Canberra and found out just how the rest of Australia is battling on. What has happened is that high unemployment levels have savaged country areas of Australia. We have had 'the recession we had to have'. We have had drought. We have had low commodity prices for rural product. All of these things are reflected in the levels of average income per week. I draw that to the attention of the House. It is time that Mr Keating and his cabinet got out to rural Australia and found out exactly what is happening in the rest of Australia. Badgerys Creek Airport Site,132
259,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Werriwa) (7.35 p.m.)There is nothing worse in public life than a politician willing to scaremonger to win votes, especially when that politician knows his or her scare campaign is based on a lie. Anne Cohen, the Liberal state MP for Badgerys Creek, is now engaged in a malicious and plainly dishonest campaign to scare people in her electorate with respect to the impending development of Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek. I wish to place a few facts on the record. Mrs Cohen has issued statements to local papers in my electorate claim. ing that",132
260,Mr FILING,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order, in view of the unparliamentary language used by the member for Werriwa, who referred to a campaign of lies.",132
261,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I again remind honourable members in this place about language which is appropriate. As Speakers, including me, have ruled about the use of that terminology as directed against a specific member of this place, I again remind members to be careful of their language.",132
262,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,I mentioned that in the context of a general statement.,132
263,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Correct, and that is why you have not been required to withdraw.",132
264,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I then went on to talk about Mrs Cohen and her campaign. The fact is that the suburbs of Raby and St Andrews in my electorate are as close to Badgerys Creek and its flight paths as Regents Park is to Mascot. Further, no urban area in western or south-western Sydney is within seven kilometres of the 20 ANEF contour, below which there should be no noise difficulty. There will be no problem at Badgerys Creek, despite the scaremongering of Mrs Cohen and the newly-endorsed Liberal candidate for Macarthur, Charlie Lynn, unless a government decides to build homes next to the airport site. Who was it two years ago in a very consistent campaign that wanted to build 100,000 residential lots through the South Creek Valley sector surrounding the Badgerys Creek airport site? It was Mrs Cohen and the Greiner and Fahey governments. They had on the planning map of New South Wales a 100,000-lot release surrounding the airport site. Now, spurred on by the impending New South Wales election, they have discovered noise as an issue, having advocated 100,000 homes around that airport site. The master plan and concept for Badgerys Creek has always involved a successful, competitive and well-designed airport serviced by the transport links to and from the airport site and surrounded, most importantly, by industrial land, commercial land, tourist activities and airport related economic use; that is, to have an airport that is efficient, state-of-the-art with a best practice design surrounded by economic land uses. For that reason, the state government should be supporting the accelerated development of Badgerys Creek. It should be supporting-not holding up-the planning of the road and rail access to and from the airport site. Shamefully, in the middle of 1992, Mrs Cohen had the planning minister, Robert Webster, come out to her electorate and abandon all the planning for the rail link between Glenfield and the Badgerys Creek airport site. That decision, shamefully, has back the planning for Badgerys Creek by two or three years. As a result, anyone who has a legitimate concern about noise in the inner city will not find the necessary relief because of the New South Wales government. Further, in September 1992, the state government agreed to meet infrastructure costs of $1.3 billion associated with the development of the third runway at Mascot. When asked by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) for its commitment to the essential road and rail access to and from the Badgerys Creek airport site, the Fahey government said that it would not be spending a cent. It exposed its priorities of a third way, no curfew in east Sydney and expenditure of $1.3 billion. The first instalment has gone down-$500 million for a Sydney to Mascot rail link. That was its priority for east Sydney. In western and south-western Sydney, when there is the opportunity for tens of thousands of jobs at a well-planned airport in our region, the state government came up with a commitment of absolutely nothing. There was no financial expenditure on those important transport links. The only policy it has had in the last couple of years was to build 100,000 residential lots surrounding the Badgerys Creek airport site. It has the hide to then come out, with an election pending, to try to scare people. The Liberal Party has contributed nothing to the development of that airport other than trying to scare people about noise. Shamefully, the newly endorsed candidate for Macarthur has jumped on the bandwagon as part of a low level, shameful tactic by the federal Liberal Party to scare people, knowing it is an absolutely dishonest and total distortion of the truth. Victoria: Proposed Freeway",132
265,Mr CLEARY,Unknown,"Today I was waiting for the censure motion against the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and I could not believe what I heard. To think that the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) and the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) would run set down to the dispatch box and condemn the Minister for Transport over the third runway when every member of this parliament supported the third runway proposal absolutely astounds me- The hypocrisy of this place is unbelievable. Are some opposition members going to jump up now and say that the opposition has been misrepresented? I am sorry: some opposition members actually were not in the party at the time. But the Liberal Party is as committed to the third runway as anyone else. The third runway is a form of urban vandalism-the opposition is dead right. In Melbourne, the opposition's mate Jeff Kennett is run- proposing to build an eight-lane freeway through the suburbs of Brunswick and Coburg. He does not give a stuff about the people of the northern suburbs.",133
266,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Wills might watch his language.,134
267,Mr CLEARY,Unknown,"I am sorry. He cares little for the working class people of Coburg and Brunswick. I think he does not even care much for his bourgeois friends out in Essendon because he wants to drive the freeway through their territory as well. What I ask the Liberals to do is stand up and condemn the Kennett government for its act of urban vandalism in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. I know what the Liberals will do. They will not say a word. How do we feel about the Grand Prix and Kennett's actions in building a Grand Prix track? He is riding roughshod over the interests and rights of people in Melbourne. What does the opposition say? Absolutely nothing. Opposition members saw that a political point could be scored in relation to the third runway, so they sanctimoniously jumped to their feet and condemned the Minister for Transport. What the opposition should be doing is condemning the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport for his terrible handling of the Transport Workers Union and his abuse of workers. If the opposition did that the fools might score a few votes from the former Labor voting people. The opposition has been pushed so far to the right that it has not got a clue. The building of freeways is actually funded and receives tax relief under the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1994. The bill states that eligible infrastructure facilities at present are road transport facilities in Australia that are used for transport of the public or their goods at a charge to them. That is federal Labor policy. Did the opposition ever think that it might score a point by standing up and saying that the federal Labor Party actually agrees with tollways? It should try it some time instead of thinking that what it needs to do is push further to the right. If the opposition leapfrogged the Labor Party it might do a bit better. Western Australia: Electoral System",134
268,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,Unknown,"It is a fundamental tenet of democracy that all people are regarded as equal. The fundamental principle of one vote one value is reflected in the Commonwealth Electoral Act and our electoral system. That reflects the tenet of people being equal and their votes being equal. Unfortunately, this is not reflected by the parliament, the electoral act or the electoral system in my own state of Western Australia. Members should be aware that no legislation has ever been enacted in Western Australia without the support of the state colleagues of those opposite. The conservatives have always dominated the Legislative Council in Western Australia, so the electoral system in Western Australia is determined by them. I draw the attention of the House to the recent redistribution of the state parliament effected by the Western Australian government Gazette of Monday, 28 November. The electoral system required by the conservative controlled Legislative Council of Western Australia has the effect of dividing the state into a metropolitan area and a country area. It is interesting to note that of the 1,034,000 enrolled voters at the time the redistribution was effected, over 760,000 of those were in the metropolitan area and over 270,000 were in the country area. There are 34 Legislative' Assembly seats allocated in the metropolitan area, so that is 34 for 760,000-an average enrolment of 22,370-and 23 seats in the country area for just over 270,000-an average enrolment of 11,887. Members can see that the vote weighting is two to one. When you look at the electoral statistics released by the Electoral Commission at the time of the redistribution and then look at the current boundaries on the same electoral system determined by the conservative controlled Legislative Council, you find that the greatest number of enrolled voters in the metropolitan area is in the seat of Wanneroo, which is in the electorate held by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). The current enrolment in that seat is 30,885. The country seat with the lowest number of enrolled voters is Ashburton. That seat has 8,610 voters. So we have nearly a four to one weighting there. On the new boundaries, the greatest number of enrolled voters in the metropolitan area are in the seat of Belmont. Those 23,511 voters can be compared with the 10,363 voters in the seat of Pilbara. That is before the quotient variant of 15 per cent comes into play. So we can see what those opposite and their state colleagues stand for when it comes to treating people equally. In the West Australian of Thursday, 1 December, I was very interested to see reference made to the President of the Liberal Party of Western Australia. The article entitled 'Honey on a Return Ticket' states: Liberal Party State president David Honey went on a strange journey to one-vote one-value and back yesterday. Perhaps the heat got to him, but Dr Honey first declared himself in favour of ending vote-weighting in elections to the Legislative Assembly and then did a back-flip after a chat with Premier Richard Court. The article goes on to say: . . . soon after, Mr Court appeared in the office The West Australian at Parliament House and said Dr Honey would be calling because he had got it wrong. Dr Honey called within five minutes and said the party supported vote-weighting. He had called back after speaking to Mr Court because he had misstated party policy. So that reflects the commitment of the state colleagues of those opposite to vote weighting and electoral system rorting. I must say that I was dismayed to see a few days later in the West Australian of Monday, 5 December that same David Honey, who one minute before he spoke to Premier Court was in favour of a review of the Electoral Act to take away vote-weighting, had this to say under an article entitled 'Boundary changes draw Liberal fire': Liberal Party state president David Honey has attacked the new WA electoral boundaries, saying they are diabolical ... Dr Honey said the electoral Act needed to be reviewed. It goes on to report: Dr Honey said the Government should consider amending the Electoral Act so that the commission - ould redraw the boundary of the Upper House's Mining and Pastoral Region to take in some of the area covered by the Agricultural Region. So they want rorts within rorts in Western Australia. They are not committed to people casting equal votes; they are not committed to the basic notion of equality; and they are quite prepared to see a gross malapportionment occur in Western Australia. Mainstream elements of the Western Australian Liberal Party do not believe that people's votes ought to be equal. In fact, half of them do not believe that some people should be entitled to have a vote. An article in the West Australian in August 1992, after the Liberal Party's state annual conference of that year, headed 'Plan to end forced voting' states: The Liberal Party's annual state conference yesterday backed a call to end compulsory voting in state and federal elections . . . The president of the Canning division, Mrs Ricky 10hnstonwho has been a candidate for the seat of Canning on a number of occasions. .. said it was not compulsory to actually vote. She goes on to say: of A compulsory system meant ""dregs of society"" got a say whereas with voluntary voting only those who were interested actually cast a vote. So those on the other side of the chamber do not believe that votes ought to be equal. They also believe that people who actually have a vote are the 'dregs of society'. No doubt this attitude is adopted largely because their so called 'dregs of society' do not vote for them. Sydney Airport: Third Runway",134
269,Mr DOBIE,Unknown,"It would come as no surprise to members of the House that I am going to talk yet again on the third runway and its effect on my suburb of Kurnell. I must say that as I heard the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) speak today my regard for him increased, because he has the influence to say",135
270,Mr WALKER,Unknown,"From a very low base, though.",135
271,Mr DOBIE,Unknown,"Of course. I do not deny that at all. I was very impressed today to find that he was able to say that cabinet will be tackling a range of measures in the next day or so-it was all happening tomorrow. So he can move mountains as far as cabinet meetings are concerned. I hope he can move mountains as far as noise over Sydney is concerned. I have some doubt about that. But I would put to him tonight, in view of the fact that cabinet is meeting tomorrow, that the solution to the problem in the area to the south of the north-south runway is simple. We do not have to have planes directed to the north, to the west, to the east-wherever. All we need to have is the flight paths that have existed for 22 years, which were changed on 4 November when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) opened the new runway. We want those flight paths returned to what they were two months ago. If that happens, planes will no longer be flying at 800 feet above the suburb of Kurnell, which they have never flown over before, nor will they be flying over the Kurnell oil refinery at 1,000 feet. No airport in the world allows planes to fly over areas at 1,000 feet. Rather than find fault with the Minister for Transport, I say to him, if he should read this paper before the cabinet meeting tomorrow",135
272,Mr FILING,Unknown,Do you think he will?,136
273,Mr DOBIE,Unknown,"I would hope he does, because he is reading an awful lot of stuff that comes from this side of the House at the moment. As one of the longest serving members of this House, I must say that I am so impressed-unbelievably impressed-that this Labor government is so influenced by the words and statements of the members of Liberal-National state governments and of the members who sit on the coalition side of this House that it changes not mountains but airports. We are being blamed for the twoyear delay on Badgerys Creek, which the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) cleverly put forward today. I say to him in the kindest and the most friendly of manners: if you think that is going to happen in your term here in this parliament, forget it. As far as the airport in Sydney is concerned, the east and the west of the airport have massive problems. I am not addressing those this week, but I am addressing the problems that are facing the people of Kurnell-an isolated part of my electorate which the member for Kingsford-Smith looks out upon. I tremble to admit to the House that he and I are in fact political neighbours. We meet occasionally in surf club situations-not in football clubs, Mr Speaker, as you and I meet in the area. I am impressed that, with only 1,800 people there, people have gone to live there with their small families. Why? Because it is isolated from the normal suburbs of Sydney and because they have the advantage of having their own beach. It is a delightful spot which has been totally and utterly ruined by the acts of the last four weeks. Though I rose and praised the Minister for Transport for moving the cabinet, I sincerely put to him that he can solve one problem very simply in the cabinet meeting tomorrow by returning the flight paths over to the northern part of Sutherland shire to what they were before his leader opened the third runway on 4 November. I will be speaking again this week on this same subject. Queensland National Party",136
274,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"In today's Bulletin, the Queensland National Party made it brutally clear that the Joh campaign rides again. Today in the Bulletin, Joh's offsider and mouthpiece, Mr Ken Crooke-you might recall that Mr Crooke was Joh's press secretary for many years and is the current Director of the National Party in Queensland-described the federal coalition as 'wishy-washy'. He described the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), as an appeaser. These are fighting words. They are deliberately designed to wound, mock and ridicule the Leader of the Opposition. It is pretty clear that the Queensland Nationals are hell-bent on smashing the coalition at both the federal and state levels. The first shot in this war, in this new Joh campaign, was fired on 15 November when Don MCDonald, the President of the Queensland National Party, issued an ultimatum to the Queensland Liberal Party to agree to a joint Senate ticket in that state or face the repercussions. The repercussions of failure to agree to a joint Senate ticket would be three-cornered contests-three-cornered contests in seats like Fisher, Longman and Groom. That ultimatum, which was delivered by the Queensland Nationals to the Liberals, has passed. Today we have what I think is the second shot in that campaign. Today's Bulletin states: Crooke believes conservative supporters are dismayed by Downer's equivocal stance on sexual privacy and racial hatred issues. Mr Crooke says: If you are going to succeed, people want to where you stand ... People are sick to death this wishy-washy waffle. The coalition needs define itself clearly on matters straddle the barbed-wire fence, you get hurt in all the wrong places. Mr Crooke was joined in that campaign by the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who had this to say: A lot of Liberals have been very appreciative stand I've taken. Downer is trying to appease small-'l' people in the Liberal Party, but that has antagonised and disillusioned people in the coalidivisive tion ... You have got to be a mug to go along with the Labor Partylike the Liberals. It continues: If I was in the Liberal party I would be clearly worried about the polls. The Liberal Party is clearly very worried by the polls. Thinking about those statements, they may not have come from the member for Kennedy; they could well have come from National Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and that is the point. The point about these attacks by the memin ber for Kennedy is that they all before. They all occurred in 1987 when the Nationals humiliated their leader at the time, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), and pushed him out of the coalition. When is the member for Kennedy going to do that with the current Leader the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer)? When is the push going to come land from inside the National Party caucus to were really put the pressure on the National Party? It is crunch time for the Leader of the National Party as much as it crunch time for the Leader of the Opposition. I know what the answer would be to these questions if we asked the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) or the member for Groom (Mr Taylor). They would say, 'Take them on. can't take any more of these divisive tactics / from the National Party. We don't want a repeat of the Joh for PM campaign of 1987. We will stand up to the Nationals.' Because who will be the candidate for the National Party in the federal seat of Fisher at the next election? It will be none other than the son of the Joh Bjelke-Petersen-John Bjelke-Petersen. The lad is looking for something useful to do. He needs a job, so he is now intending to know make his bid on the back of this new camof paign from the Queensland Nationals to split to the coalition. The Bjelke-Petersen forces of principle-if you strike back. In 1987 we had the jack-in-the-box, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who dreamed of being PM, and the Queensland Nationals took it all away from him. Where is the honourable member for of the Bennelong tonight? Is he up there with the Leader of the Opposition, talking about these tactics from the National Party? Is he out there condemning the National Party? Can we expect him to say something to the press about the Liberal Party and the National Party at another one of those famous doorstops where he does not really talk about anything, does not talk about a leadership challenge? Is he going to come in, stand shoulder to shoulder with the Leader of the Opposition, and repudiate the tactics from the Queensland Party? If he is not, we all know what he is really up to: that is, he will make his bid the new year. If we expect him to do that, occurred I would think pigs might fly. Queensland National Party: Drought Relief",136
275,Mr KATTER,Unknown,"I remind the House that the honourable leader of to whom Mr Swan referred, Mr BjelkePetersen, won in his last election in Queenswith nearly 60 per cent of the vote. If he still there, he would still be giving that Leader of the mob a terrible hiding. The farmers of Australia got $164 million is off the federal government. Very regretfully, I think a lot of the farming organisations which laid on their backs and had their tummies scratched by the federal government were lavish in their praise for the $164 We million they received. A couple of weeks later, the arts in Australia got $252 million and the ANL employees effectively got around $250 million, but the $164 million was not given to the farmers; it was given to the banks. Effectively, that money goes as a subsidy on the farmers' interest, and that means that the money goes to the banks and not to the farmers; If the banks were borrowing money at five per cent and lending it out at six per cent, I would say, 'Fair enough.' But, at the present moment, the banks are borrowing at five per cent and lending it to the farmers at 10 per cent, and the difference is being made up by the Australian taxpayers. Not only is this unfair but also it is toweringly stupid. Not only was the $164 million supposed to be good for us-the farmers in this case-but straight afterwards we had a 1% per cent rise in interest rates foisted upon us by the federal government. That led to a $302 million a year extra burden upon the farmers of Australia who owe $17,000 million. At the start of the ALP decade, they owed only some $4,700 million. That tripped off a rise in the Australian dollar which saw farmers lose $540 million per year. So, whilst we got $164 million, we now find ourselves in a situation where we have been hit with a bill from the actions of the federal government of an extra $842 million per year. Thank you; it is a lovely Christmas present from the federal government. It indicates clearly the government's treatment of the farming sector of Australia.",137

In the speech I made when the chair tabled Security. I think this is part of the problem. What I said was that the evasiveness of the evidence to the committee was such that, had judge would be constrained to direct the jury biased and self-serving. Now I did not say that to refer briefly to certain passages of the report what is in the report. Paragraph The Joint Committee considers that CSEAG is the evaluation advisory committeeof each stage of the Scheme may be open to question implementation of their own recommendations. Furthermore, both the Consultative Group and CSEAG was provided a significant role in the Scheme's development If we tum over to chapter 22, again we find this particular issue. I go to chapter The Joint Committee has stated its concern in respect Support Scheme in previous Chapters of its report. body responsible for the evaluation of the performance Advisory Group (CSEAG), was exclusively drawn report, Child Support, Formula for Australia (1988), assessment under Stage 2 of the Scheme, the Joint impartiality of CSEAG's findings.

It is like a stack out, others fall down. As a consequence, on that of tirp.e. Given that there is this broad support responsibility of listening to the concerns of I have to say that this is a totally amazing of this. I invite; I urge; I implore the ministers rather than give this knee-jerk reaction that this report, I criticised the Department of Social I want to take that criticism a bit further today. Department of Social Security in much of its that evidence been given in a court of law, a to consider whether or not that evidence was without some support in the report itself. I want where that statement is clearly backed up by 2.28, for example, on page 18 says: the findings from CSEAG's evaluationon the basis that they were reviewing the the research and administrative support for by the Department of Social Security who had and who were far from disinterested in the outcome. there are a series of paragraphs which deal with 22, paragraph 22.1, which says: of the impartiality of past evaluations of the Child In particular, given that the membership of the main of the Scheme, the Child Support Evaluation from membership of the Consultative Group whose was critical in the establishment of formula Committee was immediately concerned over the of CSEAG's evaluation reports, these concerns discovered that the only major survey which the financial situation of non custodial parents analysis in respect of key components of the child disregarded income level was grossly inadequate. NA 4260 We go on to say that the chapter sets out some to read a couple of other paragraphs from chapter and what I believe is the problem as it has been made by the ministers to date. Any future evaluation of the child support Scheme influence of the departments with policy responsibility have played a significant role in the establishment way any future evaluations of the Scheme will be public confidence in the results of these evaluations And in the following paragraph, 22.6, we say: The Joint Committee notes the Department of Social Scheme whilst the Australian Institute of Family the evaluations of the Scheme. Neither DSS or the the Scheme and the Joint Committee considers that length from both organisations. Then we go on to suggest a way in which that in paragraph 22.13 we say: The Joint Committee notes that the modelling of by DSS. As highlighted in Chapter 4, DSS has a direct is far from disinterested in the outcomes produced potential conflict of interest is exacerbated by the parent pensioners who represent over 90 per cent the Joint Committee considers that the public commissioning an independent party to conduct all relative disposable incomes of both parents. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, the evidence in the which are endorsed by all members of the joint these paragraphs of the report. The problem devised by, and implemented within, a policy that reviews and evaluations of the scheme up largely conducted or influenced by that same Security; and that now we have that same policy presumably giving the ministers advice about scheme. This comes back to what I think is a fundamental which arise in relation to the Child Support been an attempt to set up two groups of parents that they were at war with each other about. and non-custodial parents. Other members and the emotional trauma of marriage breakdown do to deal with that. I do not have time to remarks. It is a nonsense to suggest that these two each other and that the way we enhance the position the rights and position of the other. Overwhelmingly, was that in many circumstances their particular into account. We have mountains of evidence MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 December 1994 views in relation to future evaluations. I wish 22, because they reinforce what I have said, been illustrated in terms of the response that has In paragraph 22.5 of the report we say: must be seen to be truly independent and outside the for the Scheme, as well as any other parties who of the Scheme or in any past evaluation of it. In this publicly seen to be truly independent thereby ensuring and the Scheme is generally enhanced. Security (DSS) dominates the policy aspects of the Studies (AIFS) has been the major body assisting with AIFS could be considered to be at 'arms length' to any future evaluation should be conducted at arms could be done. Finally, to reinforce the point, the impact of the Child Support Scheme is monopolised financial interest in the Scheme and consequently by its modelling of the impact of the Scheme. This fact that the clients of DSS under the Scheme are sole of custodial parents under the Scheme. Consequently, confidence in the Scheme can be best served by DSS future modelling of the impact of the Scheme on the report is quite clear, and the recommendations select committee are quite clear from reading here is that we have a scheme which was basically section of the Department of Social Security; until the one by the joint select committee were policy section of the Department of Social section of the Department of Social Security the way in which they should react to this misunderstanding about the problems Agency, because it seems to me that there has against each other as if there were a conflict The two groups of parents are custodial parents of the committee have spoken about the tragedy and divorce, and what we need to try and speak about that today, except to endorse those groups of parents are somehow in conflict with of one group is by somehow putting aside the complaint of non-custodial parents financial arrangements were not being taken about that so it is a nonsense to simply dismiss NA Wednesday, 7 December 1994 it out of hand.
