2,Sir CHARLES MARR,Unknown,"During the last sittings of Parliament I brought to the notice of the Minister for the Interior cases of eviction from houses in the Australian Capital Territory of the wives of certain men serving with the Australian Imperial Force overseas. The Minister promised to consider the matter, and the cases that I mentioned were satisfactorily adjusted. I receivedto-day from a woman in this Territory whose husband has performed valiantly in a division in Egypt, a communication stating that she has been notified that unless she pays certain arrears of rent within fourteen days she will be evicted from her home. Will the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior stay the threatened proceedings, and see that the wives of absent soldiers receive fair treatment?",12

4,Mr MULCAHY,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Minister for the A m y been drawn to the statement published last Sunday in a Sydney newspaper, to the effect that soldiers being invalided to Australia from Palestine, suffering from Bpondulitis, have been refused medical attention? Will the honourable .gentleman see that all of those who are returned invalided from this war, as well as returned soldiers of the last war, receive medical attention, whether their disabilities are or are not due to the effects of war service?",12
5,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"I have had my attention drawn to the subject-matter of the question, and shall be glad to be furnished with details of it. I am not preelecpared, at the moment, to commit myself in respect of the proposition that medical attention be provided in respect of all men who return from the war, whether their disability be due to war service or not, because such a proposition must be subject to some time qualification, but I am prepared to approach it in a very broad and sympathetic spirit. THE WAR. NA WHELAN.  the Minister for External Affairs been drawn to an article which appeared in the Sydney Sun on the 19th instant, a portion of which reads as follows: The Reverend Father Whelan, who came from Dublin, on his way .to Bathurst said: ""The Irish people were most anxious to keep right out of the war. They want Germany to lose, but they would not mind England getting a .bit of a licking just Uie same. If the Minister considers that the views reported to have been expressed by Father Whelan are vile, and repugnant to all true Britishers, including Australians, will he take steps to prevent a repetition of the like, or institute other appropriate action ?",12
6,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATEMENT BY REVEREND FATHXB,"My attention was drawn to the statement referred to by the honourable member. I , in turn, drew the attention of the relevant service department to it. I feel bound to say that, if the gentleman concerned, or those on whose behalf he professes to apeak, are experiencing exultation because .of the mass murder of British civilians, the desecration of national shrines, the destruction of hospitals and infirmaries, and the sinking of mercy ships, he and they are entirely out of step with their co-religionists in Australia, many of whom have already given their lives, and others their sons, in order that Britain shall administer, not receive, a licking. NA WORKERS.",13
7,Mr DRAKEFORD,HOUSING FOR MUNITION,"Will the Minister for Labour and National Service inform me as to whether or not it is. correct, as has been publicly stated, that the Government has decided to build 300 houses for occupation by munitions workers in the Maribyrnong district, the rents for which will be from 27s. 6d. to 32s. 6d. a week? If so, has his department made any investigation of the 'South Australian housing scheme? If it has not done so, will he have such an investigation made, in order that homes may be built at a cost which will permit the charging of rents that the workers are in a position to pay?",13
8,Mr HOLT,HOUSING FOR MUNITION,"It is correct that one of a number of projects upon which the Government has decided to embark is the provision of adequate housing accommodation for munitions workers in Footscray. In the very near future 300 homes will be erected in that district, but no decision has yet been reached as to what rentals shall be charged for them. That matter will be determined on the basis of the cost of the houses, which, if present plans reach fruition, will be erected under the auspices of Housing Commission of Victoria, a body that has had considerable experience in the construction of cheap but serviceable homes. I had the privilege, when in Adelaide last week, of investigating houses that had been constructed by the Housing Trust of that State, and a further investigation of tbem will be made by officers of my department in the very near future. There are certain differences between the costs of land and materials in Victoria and the costs in South Australia; but the honourable gentleman, and other honourable members, may rest assured that the action which the Government is taking will result in the economical construction of homes that will prove both adequate and congenial, and the rents charged will not be at all disproportionate to those of private homes in the neighbourhood. RATIONIN G OF TOBACCO.",13
9,Mr BADMAN,HOUSING FOR MUNITION,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether tobacco manufacturers are responsible for the present rationing of supplies of tobacco? In view of the statement reported to have been made by the honourable gentleman, namely, that supplies of tobacco will soon be available from Rhodesia, will he state whether there is any possibility of augmentation of supplies to the public? Will he also make a clear statement of the position in relation to rationing ?",13
10,Mr HARRISON,HOUSING FOR MUNITION,The rationing of manufactured tobacco is the responsibility of the manufacturers; the rationing of imports of tobacco leaf is the responsibility of the Government. The statement attributed to me that the agreement with Southern Rhodesia would result in more tobacco being made available is true to the extent that the manufacturers are prepared to purchase additional supplies of leaf in' order to supplement what is available from other sources. The matter raised in the third part of the honourable member'squestion will receive consideration.

60,Sir EARLE PAGE,AGE LIMIT FOR MEMBERS OF,"Woo l for Australian manufacture is dealt with under special terms of the agreement with the British Government, which has purchased the whole of the wool clip.

The Central Wool Committee, I know from personal investigation, has been in close consultation with the British Government in order to ensure that maximum quantities of wool are available for carbonizing and wool-scouring concerns in Australia. The result has been that in many of the establishments two or three shifts are working at a greater pace than before the war.

Last night an additional regulation was gazetted, the effect of which is that before engaging certain classes of employees an employer engaged in munitions work must register with the Department of Labour and National Service such particulars about the employee, including the name and address of his previous employer, as the Minister specifies. The appropriate labour exchange must be notified by the employer of his intention to engage specified classes of employees.

Stocks of diesel oil fuel have been built up on the basis of normal uses of that fuel, and no trouble has been experienced so far in maintaining stocks for those uses. If , however, any extensive new uses were encouraged, it would have to be at the expense and to the detriment of present uses, for which no ready substitute iE available, since it is not possible to our imports of diesel fuel.
