19,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMINISTRATION OF WHEAT,"All I can do now is to promise that the matter will be considered. In reply to Mr Justice H i g gins' statement yesterday I should like to make my own position clear. Three or four reporters came to me the other night. They told me, I think, that Mr Justice be Higgins had announced his intention of resigning, and I replied that I was not aware that any information on the subject had reached the Government, which is the fact. I went on to say that I had observed from the newspapers that Mr Justice ITiggms had, quite a number of times, threatened to resign; but I immediately and deliberately withdrew the word ""threatened"" in order to avoid saying anything which might give the slightest offence to His Honour, substituting the word ""proposed."" Unfortunately the reporters let the word ""threatened"" appear in their reports. I regret that the word has appeared, but it is not my fault. I wish to add that I share the opinion that it is unfortunate that there should be a controversy in public between a Judge on the bench and any member of Parliament. PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE'S CORRESPONDENCE.",20

21,Mr RODGERS,ADMINISTRATION OF WHEAT,"I am not in possession of that correspondence; it was directed to the Committee, and is in the Committee's custody.

23,Mr WEST,ADMINISTRATION OF WHEAT,"I draw attention to the fact that the High Court Procedure Bill, which stands second on the notice-paper, could be disposed of very quickly, whereas the discussion of the Tariff, which precedes it , will take a very long while. suggest, therefore, that the Government might well get the High Court Procedure Bill out of the way before the Tariff is proceeded with. That will give the Senate something to do, and would enable many persons who wish to get to the Court to do so. Wisely or unwisely, Parliament adopted a certainprocedure.",21

26,Mr JACKSON,ADMINISTRATION OF WHEAT,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs if the Quarantine Branch has considered the advisability of establishing a quarantine station for Northern Tasmania. If so, what is likely to be done?",21
27,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADMINISTRATION OF WHEAT,"The matter has been considered, but it is thought that no station would be capable of providing for the traffic between the mainland and North Tasmania which did not cost less than £60,000 or £70,000, and in view of the fact that there is a quarantine station at Portsea, in Victoria, and another at the southern end of Tasmania, which can be made to serve, the Government does not feel justified at the present time in incurring that expense.

31,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADMINISTRATION OF WHEAT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Attention was drawn to this matter in February last, when inquiries were made from the British Ministry of Health. 2. The methods of preparation of the material used have not been divulged, and tha remedy up to the present has been kept a secret one. It is impossible at present to express any definite opinion on the value of the remedy, as the evidence available is not scientific and is very incomplete. WOOL SALES.

Whether, under the new Bawra scheme for the purchase, sale, and export of wool, wool-growers will be compelled to send tlieir wool to certain ports for appraisement? 2. If so, will he supply the names of the ports? 3. Will the Minister include Eockhampton as a port of appraisement? 1 4. Is it proposed under the new Bawra scheme for the disposal of wool, that wool growers in Central Queensland shall send their wool to Brisbane, instead of Rockhampton, for shipment?",22
33,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMINISTRATION OF WHEAT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No. 2. See answer to No. 1. 3. There is no need to-make general appraisement arrangements at each port from which wool is shipped, because nearly all wool sent from ports other than tliose where wool sales arc regularly held is consigned for sale in London and in that case will be appraised there. In the comparatively rare instances where this is not the case, special arrangements will be made to meet the particular circumstances. 4. No. Mr HIGGS aslied the Acting Prime financial year?

34,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMINISTRATION OF WHEAT,"There will be establishment only? uo restrictions of any kind in dealing in ever wool within Australia. The only condisubmarine tion is that if wool be submitted for export not being for resale overseas, ultimate' purchaser of the wool in Australia must show that he has paid a sum for the wool not less than the Bawra serves fixed for the particular class wool being shipped.

42,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There is no oath of allegiance required from an officer; the oath of allegiance forms part of the oath of enlistment to serve for a definite period, while an oflicer is not required to enlist and holds the King's Commission.

45,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable mem asked a question on the 4th May in regard, to an article in the Age newspaper dealing with the erection of mobilization stores at Seymour. The following information has been supplied in answer to the honourable member's question:The first letter was despatched to the Works and Eailways Department on 17th March, 1920, asking for estimates of cost. The Works and Bailways Department supplied' estimates of cost on 10th A p r i l, 1920, and the matter was referred to the Public Works Committee on 29th April, 1920. of the Public Works Committee came to hand on 3rd July, 1920. The recommendations of the Committee were agreed to by the Defence Department, with the following exceptions:Recommendation V., that the height of - the walls of the vehicle shed be reduced to 9 feet 0 inches. This was not agreed to, foT the reason that some of the vehicles to be housed in these sheds are 9 feet 6 inches high, and consequently the walls should be sufficiently high to permit of doors of 10 feet in height. Recommendation VII . , that double doors be provided for the vehicle stores, framed ledge 8 feet high and 9 feet wide. This was agreed to, with the exception that one door in each end of shed should be 10 feet in height, to permit ingress of vehicles 9 feet 6 inches in height. Recommendation IX . , that the two equipment stores be erected parallel to one another and one on each side of the proposed railway line. From experience in handling the equipment at the Liverpool Stores, it was considered that the two stores sliould be on the same side of the siding to facilitate the transfer of stores from one building to the other. The extra cost of the railway line would be offset by the saving in the construction of roads. On the 21st July, 1920, parliamentary approval was given to carry out the project as submitted by the Public Works Committee, except in the above items. Funds . were made available on the 4th August, 1920, and the Works Director for Victoria was notified on the same day and instructed to make preparations for the execution of the work. At the present time none of the buildings has been completed.. Difficulty has been experienced in obtaining supply of material; shortage of cement, timber, and bolts at various times delayed progress, and for the first six months the supply of labour was also unsatisfactory. The Works and Railways Department a n t i cipates that the first equipment shed will be completed next month, and the second equipment shed is sufficiently advanced to permit of SEYMOUR. its completion before the first shed is fully occupied. All of the stores which have so far arrived in Melbourne have been, provided with cover, the equipment being housed eitlier in the store at Spotswood or in the camp buildings at Seymour. The vehicles arc paeked in the open at Seymour Camp, and protected by tent floors. As regards the roof principals, these were originally intended to be constructed of Victorian hardwood, and quotations were invited and a contract was let for the manufacture of the whole of the principals accordingly. Timber from Apollo Bay was used. ' On inspection of the material after being cut into lengths, it was found to be so unseasoned The report as to be considered unsuitable for the purpose so far as the larger members of the several trusses were concerned. It was not considered possible to obtain sufficiently seasoned Victorian hardwood to insure a good job, and consequently arrangements were made with the contractor to substitute Oregon pine for the larger members and blocking pieces in the trusses throughout the buildings. Many of the trusses have been erected in the work, and are quite substantial and sound. One of the trusses was left lying in for some considerable time before being put the work, with the result that the tie beam became considerably sun-cracked, and the man in charge of the job considered it bind this tie beam with hoop iron, and so against any further defect occurring therein. No principal has failed or shown any signs of undue stressing. The statement that the stability of the ings is affected by the principals is not stood, as they are quite substantial in way. As regards the cost of the buildings, i anticipated that the estimated amount will exceeded, and to date the actual cost is the amount of the estimate. In regard to Broadmeadows, the Defence Department propose to ask for authority on next year's estimates to commence the removal buildings from Broadmeadows to Seymour, it is anticipated that the Broadmeadows will be in use during some portion of the year to allow for the removal of stores now - niour Camp into the mobilization store.. In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 28th (vide page 7897), on motion by Mr. GKEENEThat duties of Customs and duties of [vide page 726), first item, be imposed.",23
46,Mr MAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Hindmarsh) [11.22] It is not my intention to make this contribution to the general debate on the a prelude to a series of speeches upon various items. Rather dp I desire to line the main principles which will my votes upon those items. Neither Free Trade nor Protection can be regarded a panacea for the nation's political - The economic emancipation of the worka ' ing classes cannot be secured through either medium. Under the existing comdicates mercialistic system the adoption of policy would afford but a temporary extection. pedient. But we must deal with things as they are, and not with what we would desire them to be; we must face the blems of the living present, and when take into consideration the merits. Free Trade and Protection, I realise there are degrees of advantage to tained by supporting a policy of tion. Two cardinal principles appear me as being the redeeming features that policy as compared with the policy of Free Trade. Protection will provide a medium for constituting Australia self-contained nation by the development of its own industries. Furthermore, the sun will serve to provide adequate employinto ment for our people. If principles of .an foreequitable character, industrially, were wise to prevailing throughout the world, there guard might be justification for instituting a policy of Free Trade; but when we find certain degrees of standards' buildof living applying throughout.^ the variunderous, nations of this earth, we must realise every that it would be decidedly to the disadt is not vantage of that nation which afforded the be higher standard of living if it should atwithin tempt to subject its industries to open competition from countries in which a lower standard of living was prevailing. of The policy of the Labour party is to but adopt that form of protection known as Camp new Protection, which, while affording to at Seythe manufacturers of commodities made locally ample protection, also gives security to the local consumers of those TARIFF. commodities, and to the persons employed in making them. Already this Commonwealth* Parliament has endeaApril voured by the passage of legislation to establish that new Protection; but, unfortunately, because of the limitations of Excise our Constitution, it proved to be ultra vires' by the decision of the High Court in the case of Barger versus the Crown, reTariff ported in the Commonwealth Law Rethe ports, vol. VI . , 1908. However, although outI am a layman, and have no claim to legal govern knowledge on such matters, I am under the impression that the decision given by as the High Court last year upon the powers ills. of the Commonwealth, which decision, to certain extent, reversed previous decisions in relation to the same powers, in that this Parliament really is emeither powered to enact some form of new ProI t is very desirable that this should be done, because there are some persons associated with the local manuprofacture of goods-the y are only a small I percentage, certainly-wh o are prepared of to take undue advantage of the prothat tection afforded to them by extorting be obfrom the public exorbitant prices for Protecthe goods in which they have been to enabled to create almost a monopoly. of That is not a circumstance that generally governs the industries of Australia. Those who favour Free Trade contend that free .as a imports mean lower prices for many of the commodities used by us, and therefore it a reduction in the cost of living. I doubt the accuracy of that assertion, and my doubt is founded upon substantial facts set out in reports of the Inter-State Commission, which some time ago investigated Tariff matters. Prices are not based upon a competitive system, but rather upon the capacity of the people to pay them, and at times the prices fixed are altogether beyond the means of the people. circumstance changes the whole phase of many contentions on the merits of Free Trade and Protection which would have been received logically and with some justification in 1791, when the - principle of Protection was first recommended to the United States. The relationship of commerce has considerably changed. Mr . Piddington, Chairman of the Inter-State Commission, in a recently-published volume entitled The Next clearly . indicates that wages just 12 months behind the cost of living. It would seem that competition plays an insignificant part in the determination of our economic conditions. For this th© manufacturers of Australia, in my opinion, are not responsible. are, as I have said, isolated instances where local manufacturers unfortunately have taken undue advantage of the protection afforded them. But generally speaking it is the wholesale warehouses which extract from the people exhorbitant dues 'and adopt a system under which competition is absolutely reduced to a minimum. It would appear that there is a desire on the part of some of those associated with the wholesale undertakings of this country to camouflage their actual operations and to make it appear that they have no arrangement for fixing prices. The President of the Melbourne Warehousemen's Association, giving evidence before the Inter-State Commission regarding the question of clothing, said : The association does nothing in the way of fixing prices. It never even discusses prices. It never takes any joint action to secure trade prices from manufacturers or suppliers. We fix terms, but not prices. When I say "" terms,"" I mean terms of payment for our distribution. If that is not a direct attempt to fix prices then it is difficult to know what the witness did intend to convey. He went on to say thatWe never attempt to arrange any terms for ourselves from the manufacturers or suppliers. The Commission in their report point to the inconsistencies of the evidence submitted on this occasion by stating that the Mr Makin. minutes of the Warehousemen's Association show thatShortly after the outbreak of war, correspondence passed between similar associations in the various States with regard to increase of prices owing to war conditions, but it was finally resolved that action in that direction be left to the discretion of individual members. Another instance which showed a desire to fix This prices occurred in the latter part of 1014,, when the Melbourne Association requested the Adelaide Association to join in fixing the price of calico, owing to the competition of non-associated houses. It does not appear that any combined prices were actually adopted by the associations, and the president of the Victorian Association,'when asked to explain the account in the minutes said:-""On the face of it that would seem to show that we aimed at fixing prices, but I say that there was no suggestion as to fixing the price, though I cannot explain exactly what it means."" Step, are At page 44 of the same report the Commission, writing of the controlling in fluence of wholesale distributors statesSpeaking generally, the price of clothing is affected more by the wholesale distributing houses than by any other section of the trade. The immense bulk of imports, the large proThere portion of Australian-made goods which is only procurable through warehouses, the great and increasing amount of manufacturing carried out by wholesale merchants, and their financial connection with many retailers' businesses, all combine - to suggest that no control of prices can be effectual which does not include that section of the trade which occupies the stage between production and the retail house. The position is further explained at page 45 of the same reportPrices are now fixed by wholesalers, not by adding the same uniform percentage to landed cost, but by directing 'the head of each department, e.g., manchester goods, ready-made clothing, silks, &c, to produce at the end of each half-year a defined gross profit on the sales. The departmental head knows what his goods have cost into warehouse, and so adjusts the additions to that cost of the various articles handled, as to bring out an aggregate amount in turnover which will yield the stipulated gross profit over aggregate landed cost. Articles imported at a low price are not sold at low rates, but are used as a sort of balancing medium. The same course is followed with respect to local manufactures, and the warehouses so adjust the circumstances <pf their businesses as to obtain from the general' publio the fullest contribution of profit that it is possible to secure from them. It is stated by the Commission thatWhen supplies are ample, either of imports or of Australian manufactures, the warehouseman balances prices so as to insure himself against possible losses on certain classes of goods. Bisks of this sort do not now exist, as the unanimous testimony of the trade is 'that everything iB readily sold which can be got into the warehouse. I desire to make very clear the point that Australian consumers do not secure any direct advantage'from cheap importations. The warehouses are the controlling factor. My view is that we should make it necessary for the warehouses to purchase locally-manufactured rather than those manufactured abroad, so that we may in that way insure more employment for those engaged in industry in Australia. I object to the system at uresent operating under which warehousemen exercise a most effective control over the affairs of our country and the requirements of our people. I do not agree with the contention that the Commonwealth Parliament has not power to deal with such a system, but if it be correct that we do lack the power, there could be no graver reflection on the framers of the Constitution. We have, however, to meet the circumstances as best we can, and 1 feel it is far better that we should adopt a policy which will keep our workmen full y engaged rather than carry on under a policy which leads to frequent periods of depression and to the swelling of the great army of the unemployed. It is stated in the report of the Inter-State Commission in regard to groceries thatThe wholesale merchants are a very important factor in the conduct of the grocery trade, not only in the control of prices, but also in the control and distribution of both local and imported goods. Here, again, in respect of lines which .profoundly affect the cost of'living , these' wholesale warehousemen make their presence felt in the most marked' manner, and have a directly controlling influence over the . powers of. the , people. Greater power is possessed by . the big warehouses of Australia in regard' to the determination of the economic conditions of the people than is enjoyed, according to honourable members opposite, by the Parliament itself. I agree, however, with the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan), that under section 51 of the Constitution we have ample power to deal effectively with the trade combinations that of recent years have become so marked a feature of the commercial world. I desire now to refer to the Brisbane Merchants' Association. I find that the. association of retailers exertno undue influence over prices^ but the operations .of the Merchants' Association T334] evidences a decided mastery over both transactions and prices,' as the following extract from the report of the Inter-State Commission shows:-According to the secretary, the wholesale lists issued from time to time is compiled in the following manner:-There was no regular time for issuing those lists, but it was generally found necessary to take some action in that direction when an increase took place in the import price. goods, In. Sydney there is a retail house, which has been registered under the name of Merchants Limited. That firm has endeavoured to purchase direct from the manufacturers with a view to benefiting the public by the exclusion of what is known as the wholesale middleman; but the warehouses have instituted a form of - boycott and have endeavoured by all the means' in their power to prevent direct supplies. One line of commodity alone affords proof of the intimidation, which the wholesale warehouses endeavour to exercise over manufacturers. I refer to the Dr Morse Indian Root Pills, which are manufactured by AV. H . Comstock, Sydney. The Brisbane Merchants' Association wrote to the proprietors of these pills, asking them to confine their sale to members of their, association. This request the pill proprietors refused, whereupon the association threatened to-adopt a plan that would prove extremely detrimental to future sales of the article. There was, however, a second refusal, and the Merchants' Association then raised the price of the pills 'by 25 per cant. There can be' no doubt that that was a deliberate attempt at intimidation. The facts I obtained from the report of the Inter-State Commissionj and they afford ample corroboration of the statements regarding the powers exercised by warehousemen. The Inter-State Commission also reports as follows: Generally speaking, it may be said that the wholesale merchants are in the best position of any of those .'engaged in the grocery trade. They are, as a rule, able to make larger profits than. most of the .manufacturers, and are in a very much better position as to profits than the retail grocer. I hear repeated complaints from retail grocers that they are subject' to undue pressure by the wholesalers concerning certainlines that they supply for rjublic use.' Many of the retail storekeepers are held responsible for the.increase in the cost of living, but, as matter of fact, that sin does not l i e at their door, so much as at the door 'of the. wholesale men. It is my hope that we may be able to institute a form of protection which will secure the people against imposition, guarantee the worker a congenial standard of living, and protect those engaged in manufactures and industries generally against any. unfair advantage cn the part of those engaged in similar work in other parts of the world. In the Age, early in 1920, there was reprinted a circular, which had been sent out on the 16th December, 1919, to retail dealers in men's wear, by the Australian agents of a - well-known English firm of felt-hat makers. This circular certainly affords proof that the warehousemen actually endeavour to fi x the retail prices of certain commodities. The circular was as follows: Dear Sirs,-As you must appreciate, we find it necessary to again rearrange the wholesale and retail prices of hats, which will now betPlain colours in soft felts 282s. Mixture colours in soft felts 30Qs. ' These revised prices will come into operation on 15th December, and the new retail prices will apply to all stock on hand. We shall, therefore, be glad if you will arrange to remark all your present stock in accordance with the new retail selling prices. The attached retail price list we would ask you to place in a prominent position in your store for reference - Your s faithfully, It will be seen that the wholesale men do not confine themselves to goods actually passing at the time to the retailers, but dictate the retail prices of goods already 1 stocked in the retail houses. Only during the last fortnight there appeared in one of the Melbourne newspapers an advertisement, inserted by a man named Henderson, who carries on business at High-street, Northcote, and who, I understand, has been subject to interference by the wholesale people. They have endeavoured to intimidate and boycott him, in their desire to control his business. We have been able to successf u l l y establish ini Australia the tweed in dustry, and it is one which should be fostered and encouraged. however, that the wholesale people of Flinders-lane have secured an almost governing influence over the output of the mills. The Mayor of Geelong, Alderman Hitchcock, spoke at a civic luncheon at Ballarat, tendered to Geelong municipal visitors, and he is thus reported : Alderman Hitchcock - congratulated Ballarat on its woollen mills. Geelong, he said, had five such mills, but, nevertheless, in that city they could not buy their own tweeds. That fact - Mr Makin. placed them in a ridiculous position. They had to go to Flinders-lane, where from 20 to 25 per cent, profit was made. He considered that the people in centres where mills had been established should be able to get their material at reasonable prices. It was possible that new woollen mills would be established with the special object of supplying goods direct to retailers, and so give the advantage to the public. I submit not only that the people who live in the localities referred to should have the advantage of cheaper cloth, but that the advantage should be extended to the people of Australia generally, and I know positively that according to the price at the point of production, this can be done; I saythat with emphasis. This is but another proof that the manufacturers are not directly responsible for the great increase' in prices; the responsibility is that of the great distributing warehouses which are able to secure more than a fair return for the services they render Wholesale. Retail. to the public. The arrogance and indiffer35s. ence of these wholesale people certainly 37s 6d. show a lack of morale and of appreciation of the duty they owe to the community. Mr Daniel-Solomon, manager for J . and B. Sniders, of Flinders-lane, gave evidence before the Fair Profits Commission in March, 1920, and the following is an extract from his evidence: He stated that in the whole of his thirty-four years' experience there had never been such a scarcity of suitable materials. The Chairman - Is there any hope that for the .rest of this year there will be any mitigation in prices for tweeds and serges?- I do not think-there is - the slightest hope. Prices may go still higher. Is not your department making a bigger gross money profit than it was six years ago?-Yes , a little more. How did you account for that?-That is the ethics of business. It is like the old song, "" Everybody's doing it."" It is the-people of Australia who are made to dance to that tune; and discredit is thus brought down on our manufacturers,' because Australian-made goods are not procurable at a fair margin of profit. There is no doubt that this discredit is The fact is, shared by many others who are endeavouring, legitimately, to foster Australian industries and render this country self-contained, and whose efforts are frustrated by those who do not understand their duty to the public. Mr J . H . M a r t in , manager of the dress and silk department of Bichard Alleni and Son, Flinders-lane, also gave evidence before the Fair Profits Commission, as follows:- , The Chairman - You r firm instead of taking a normal profit on these tweeds has taken a much larger rate of profit than it did on imported ones. The Witness - We have - to counter-balance the small profit on imported tweed. You never can tell when the market will break. The Chairman - You bought Marrickville tweed at 6s. 6d., and sold it at 13s. Gd., a profit of more than 100 per cent. We think that quite unreasonable. The Commission proposes to bring the principal of your firm before it under the Necessary Commodities Act. We shall declare your prices to be unreasonable, and will consider what action should be taken. Tliose are the circumstances that govern the position of Australia today, and as it is proved that the warehouses are a dominant factor in the control of prices and the regulation of trade, we should do something*to compel them to purchase the locally-manufactured article in preference to the imported. Many will doubt whether by the exclusion of imports we shall in any way improve the situation. If the imported article were to cost only one-fourth of the price of the locally-produced article the consumer would not secure it a.t a cheaper price, because the warehouses are out to make the maximum of profit. That was instanced by disclosureain regard to shaving' brushes imported from Japan at a very low cost, and sold at the maximum price. The regulation of prices is out of the question, because the great commercial institutions have honourable, or, as I think, dishonourable understandings among themselves to fix, not only the wholesale price, but also the minimum retail price. The disadvantage experienced by the local manufacturers in not being able to' deal directly with the retailer, but being compelled to sell their goods through the medium of Flinderslane establishments, can be readily understood. It is with a desire that such trade shall not be availed of by the warehouses to further enhance their profits that I am prepared to give such Protection to the industries of Australia as will enable them to further extend their operations, and provide means of employment, not only for the workers already in Australia, but for others who may desire to come from the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire to engage in industries that will be profitable to the community - Therefore, I shall afford my support to the proposed measures of Protection for the local manufacturers. ' I desire it to be understood, however, that [334]- 2 I am not a revenue Protectionist; my desire is to make Australia self-contained, so that it may be secured against the fluctuations of markets and trade depressions on the other side of the world, and afford the maximum avenues of employment to Australian workmen. . In framing a Tariff it is well to have regard to the industrial and economic conditions obtaining in those countries which are likely to be the most formidable competitors in the Australian market. They seem to be the Asiatic countries, particularly Japan. Japan is only 5,000 miles from Australia, less than half the distance from the Commonwealth to the nearest European country. Having regard to the conditions of labour in Japan, it must be recognised that Free Trade would work to the decided detriment of the people engaged in Australian industries. It is very desirable that our public men should interest themselves in this problem, for we on this side, at any rate, do not desire to see the social and industrial standards of the Australian workers loweredin fact, it is our determination to see that every standard of comfort is provided, the minimum being the standard set by the Basic Wage Royal Commission. Although our standard of living and conditions of labour are amongst the most advanced in the world, they are still far from being perfect. As an indication cf the conditions against which we have to compete, I submit the following table of wages in Japan and Australia in the year 1917, that being the latest year for which I could get returns, for Japan:-JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIAN WAGES PER DIEM, DEC EM CER, 1917.

"" The views of those members, however; are not typical of those of the Australian farmers, who, generally speaking, are fairly broad minded. Honourable members in the Corner do not faithfully represent the views of the men upon the land. that in not one industry is the Japanese wage sufficient to pay for the ordinary cost of living. According to Professor Iwana, of Tokio University, the' cost of living,-on the data available to him, wa3 37.46 yen, or £3 15s. a month. The industry in Japan which most nearly approaches that standard, is the brickmaking industry, the labour employed in which receives about £3 lis., or £3 12s. per month. In that country not only does the husband go to work, but the wife and members of the family generally supplement the income of the home with their exertions - The nation employs a larger number of females than of males, and a big percentage of the labour in factories is child .labour. .'. In 1917 the operatives in Japan numbered 458,638 xnale3 and 636,669 females. In Australia, I am glad to say, there are more male workers than female workers, our operatives numbering 233,959 males and 87,711 females. An article in the Transpacific, for May, 1920,"" contains an able exposition on the subject of the employment of female labour in Japan^ and much information concerning it is to be obtained from the Japanese Year-Book. The rates of wages that I have quoted are from that source, and the information is, therefore, as authentic as it is possible to secure. Many of the conditions of employment in Japan, especially those connected with the employment of girls in the textile industries, are revolting. The conditions of labour are not such as we regard as desirable, nor even in accordance with our average .standard of public morality. Under these circumstances, I shall ""not vote to give .a .nation which pays insignificant wages to its people, and employs them under industrial conditions which are below the average standard of the world, an advantage over our Australian trialists. Japanese manufacturers have Mr Makin. not been faithful to the decisions adopted at the World's Labour Congress, which was to set world standards of industrial conditions - In order to adequately protect our employees, and to allow them to maintain and even to improve their industrial status., because I am convinced that it can, and must, be improved to at least provide for the finding of I find the Basic Wage Royal Commission, I shall support"" the Tariff Schedule generally, reserving to myself the right to consider the special circumstances of certain industries dependent upon importations. I find that in Japan, in the raw silk factories, the hours of labour are from thirteen to fourteen a . day, and in the weaving mills from fourteen' to sixteen hours, and that the general national working day of .Japan is from ten to twelve hours. Japan has competed successfully against the western nations because of her cheap methods of production due to her low wages, inferior industrial conditions, and long hours of labour. It is said that the labour of an eastern woman is equivalent in value to .one-third that of a woman in Western countries, but, even if that be so, the instalment of up-to-date machinery, and the adoption of scientific methods, will keep Japan in a position of great advantage, so .that if we do not give ample protection to our industries, our workers may be required to lower their standard of living. I trust that that will never happen, and no one will fight harder than I shall to prevent it. Women are largely employed in mining in Japan, both underground and on the surface. They even work in the coal mines. No fewer than 50,323 Japanese women work underground in the mines, and 41,235 are employed on surface operations. The average wage of Japanese miners varies from lOd. to 2s. 2$d. per day.  ber proposes to handicap our mining industry by imposing duties on its requirements.",24
47,Mr MAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not desire to handicap OUT mining industry. My view is that, instead of it being affected adversely by the fluctuations of indus- the metal market' abroad, we should manufacture our raw material into finished articles. May I remind the' honourable member of the result ' of Asiatic intrusion upon the world's metal market regarding an Australian mineral product, tungsten? The importations and exportations of Japan show the in fluence that she is exerting upon international trade. In 1917 her exports were valued at 1,603,000,000 yen, or £160,300,000, and her imports 1,035,000,000 yen, or £103,500,000. The value of ner exports thus exceeded that of her imports by 568,000,000 yen,"" or £568,000. Without desiring to offensive to the Japanese, I say that 90 per cent, of their manufactures are deceptive. Some of the dealers in precious gems in London are finding that out now) and we have discovered it in Australia in regard to things used in the home. The crockery that has come here from Japan of late is not in use very long before it cracks, the handles come off, and it becomes, useless and has to bo thrown into the rubbish-bin. . In stead of making our own requirements, we import them from Japan, and, paying the prico of a good article, get only an inferior one. By confining our purchases as much as possible to the Australian product we have powers to determine standards of quality. The Japanese Government .have fostered and encouraged industry might well give - employment to the people' of Australia. Not . only does Japan amply protect her industries with Customs duties, but she ""helps them also ""with preferential rates on the railways, goods of Japanese origin being at an advantage oyer those imported into the country. The report of the Inter-State Commission contains - this pertinent passageNothing in the present inquiry has been more striking than the reiterated emphasis of Australia's dependence upon importations. That the greatest wool-producing country in the world should occupy such a singular position in regard to woollen clothing is a continual challenge to the thought and interest of Its citizens. In times of war the capacity to provide from its own resources an abundance of suitable clothing alike for the soldier and for the citizen is an object of capital importance, but it is in times of peace that the preparations must he made by which alone that object can be attained. Although Australia is capable of producing practically every class, of raw material necessary for the purpose of clotfiing its people, it is dependent upon importation for the greate* proportion of such material.for the purpose of manufacture We depend upon importations wholly for our supplies of cotton, linen, and silk goods, and in respect to woollens it is questionable whether we are in a position to clothe one-third of our people, unaided by importations. During ths debate just concluded upon at the wool question we were informed thab we are manufacturing-locally not more than one-tenth of the woollen goods required by the people of Australia. Y e t X be find that during the three months ending; the 30th September, 1920, Australia i m ported from Japan apparel, textiles, and manufactured fibrous goods valued ab £1,282;280. We have large stacks of wool hero, in fact we have a depression of prices owing to a surplus of carry-over wool which is jeopardizing the pastoral industry j yet the people are not being; supplied with cheaper, woollen goods. It would be much more desirable if local manufacturers could absorb more of the raw material and turn it into the finished article, thus providing employment for many people who are now walking the streets of our cities looking for work. That instance alone affords me strong ground for supporting the industries of Australia against those of countries overseas. If the honourable member for Barrier; which (Mr .Considine) had endeavoured to employ his efforts towards the establishment of industries in Australia which would absorb the raw material produced by the mines of Broken Hill , he would have adopted the best course for stabilizing the metal mining industry, in which so many of his'constituents are vitally concerned. Prior to the war, the best customer for Australia's metals was Germany, bnt the raw material we supplied to that country was ultimately manufactured into munitions of war, to be used later on against us. Perhaps the same thing is occurring in respect of Japan. That country is ready to buy our metale. Owing to recent trading conditions, Japanese buyers have nob lately been able to make large purchases of our raw products, but past experience indicates that, when the opportunity offers,"" they will be prepared to resume their purchases of our metals, which it is just possible they will apply to the veiy same purpose to which they were applied by the manufacturers of Germany-ulti mately to be used against us, as has happened in the past.",29
48,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is it not better to worry more about getting the mines gpi&g than about the destination of the output of the mines'?,31
49,Mr MAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is more desirable to establish, industries in Australia which will absorb the output of our mines, and thus deprive any aggressive nation of the opportunity of securing a raw material so essential in the manufacture of munitions of war. B y doing this we would be more eecure against aggressive action on the p a r t of any other nation. At any rate, the miners of Broken Hill would appreciate the fact that the establishment of local industries which would absorb the product of their mines would secure for them that continuity of employment which they desire and prevent that market-rigging which is indulged in by speculators in other parts of the world.",31
50,Mr FOLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Evidentl y some of the men there do not desire that continuity of employment. Mr MA.KTN - The honourable member does the miners of Broken Hill ; and elsewhere, a great injustice when he suggests that those who express feelings of extreme dissatisfaction, though they are really only a u n it of the great body of the workers, are - to be-accepted as speaking with an authoritative voice for the great - number of men who are desirous of being employed in the mining industry.",31
51,Mr FOLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Unfortunatel y they are the men who are guiding the movement at the present time.,31
52,Mr MAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not agree with a great many of the opinions expressed by those whom I regard as holding irresponsible views on industrial matters. we cannot doubt the sacrifices made by many of those who go through the experience of industrial turmoil in order to i m prove the conditions of their fellows. They might bo regarded as lacking in correct judgment as to matters of industrial relationship, but surely the hardships they suffer indicatetheir sincerity.",31
53,Mr FOLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Thos e who are leading the men are not suffering much hardship. - Mr MAKIN - If that is the case the remedy lies with the Australian workers. Those who are anxious to engage in indust r y , under congenial conditions and at acceptable, rates of pay comprise the great bulk of the workers. If there is anything wrong with their leadership the responsib i l it y rests with themselves, because whenever they choose to do so they can secure fresh leadership or any position which they collectively desire. We all desire to see the establishment ' of - an idealistic form of society. I am anxious that the true brotherhood of men should prevail on this earth and that equity and justice should be the heritage of. all people, but the world is in ' such a complicated and perplexed .condition industrially, socially, economically, and even politically, that we must meet the circumstances as we find them. Instead of remaining up in the clouds public men .should be practical. They should come down to mother earth and. endeavour to find solutions for the difficult problems confronting them. The secret of prosperity for any people lies with the people themselves, and in their determination to control and regulate matters for themselves instead of intrusting them to a ooterie of individuals who fatten upon the efforts of. the producers. Australia has been the happy hunting ground of mercenary mendicants from abroad who have been encouraged as far as possible by our warehouses. Our importers, realizing that they can get an extra margin of profit by importing from abroad, entertain no feelings whatever of loyalty to the locally manufactured article. They are quite prepared to enhance their own positions at the expense of the credit of their country. It is necessary to stabilize our own industries and the market for our raw material. We must have protection for industries already established or for those that can prove a likelihood of successful establishment in the future, but I am not prepared to impose a duty onany article which is not being manufactured in AusB ut ' tralia today, or in respect of which there is no likelihood bf it being manufactured here. However, the local manufacturer ""must have the fullest protection against the inferior working conditions of other parts"" of the world. Australia must keep its own credit within Australia.. We have been and are at the present moment involved in financial commitments abroad, and are seriously embarrassed by reason of the rate of exchange in several countries being against us. Our credit does not occupy the position in which it ought to stand. By keeping the credit of the nation within the nation we should secure to our own production the greatest advantage. That is a form of protection that I desire to see extended to our i dustries.. An adequate population is the greatest security we can have against the aggresSurely siveness of foreign nations. It is better the highest forms of industry. than all the machinery of Defence and other provision by way of defence, which involve the country in great exare pense, and help to build up for us a huge unproductive debt.

Many industries .Australia have been subjected to serious depression, and we have great armies unemployed walking the streets of our - capital cities. Industry needs to be couraged. The security of Australia rest upon the strength of her people.

54,Mr MAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"O u r first duty is to our income by - own people. We should see that who produce reap some of the advantages of the production for which they are sponsible. I am completely in - cord with the view expressed by the Prices Commission, that industries are secured by a protective Tariff should .be allowed to export only their surplus production, and that the people of Australia should have the first claim upon' what we produce. My desire is that people shall secure the advantages of the wealth for the production of which they - are responsible. Are we prepared to go sidiary industries. on doing the unskilled work of the world Should we not rather be anxious to give to our own people the highest forms employment by opening up new industhat - tries, which will insure to them the best n - standards of life?

If we are to become worthy of a place in the councils of the renations we shall have to become absoaclutely self-contained. We must offer the Pair very best inducement to our people to which remain here, and we can best do that by building up our industries and improving the conditions of living.

Assurances, however, have been given to me by Union officials, and manufacturers, that at present no such industry exists, and that there is certainly little prospect for the immediate future. This article, perhaps, could be placed on the deferred list. No doubt there may be many similar cases, especially in foodstuffs. It would be unreasonable to cause a depression in that trade by imposing an unreasonably high duty, and thus defeat the very purpose for which We'are endeavouring, and in consequence penalize our own people. I make no excuse for my support of the principle of Protection. The great body of unionists in Australia favour the application of the principle of Protection to all forms of industry. I desire that our workmen shall have an opportunity to engage fully in the development of our great resources and shall enjoy full ad; vantage of what can - be manufactured and produced in Australia.

60,Mr CAMERON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Brisbane) [2.15] Personally, I believe in a Protective Tariff drawn up on scientific lines. It strikes me that, just as a father is prepared to pay a premium, and assist his son to become efficient in a trade, so this country should be prepared to assist its industries by putting them in a position to compete with those of other countries. Then, again, just as a father, after having assisted to establish his son, expects him to then rely on himself, so I feel that our industries, .having been once firmly established, should be prepared to carry on without further Protection. I should like to take this opportunity to quote from the latest Queensland statistics a few figures with regard to the position of .manufacturers in that State. The figures will be comparative as between 19.10 and 1919. £BODT/CTIOIT-MANUFACTORIES , ETC. - t Number Hands Salaries Baw Year. of and factories. employed. Wages Paid.

The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), when speaking last week, remarked that several members, on the Government side had changed their opinion in regard to Protection since the previous Tariff was discussed, and it is undoubtedly a fact that many have learnt the lesson which the war should teach us. Lord jellicoe has remarked that Australia's defence power lies in the development of industriesthat supply national wealth in times of peace, and means of war in times of strife, and in the growth of a self-reliant industrial population. There - is-no doubt whatever that we should do everything possible to become a self-contained nation. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), speaking last - week, made an eloquent appeal for protection for the cotton industry. Since then honourable members have had an op portunity of hearing Mr Jones, the Queensland cotton expert, and it must be admitted that he gave a most interesting account of the industry. He pointed out how, at the present day, in the northern State, there are only 2,500 to 3,000 acres under cotton, whereas fifty years ago there were 14,000 acres so employed. It is recognised that Queensland is the finest cotton-growing country in the world; and I trust that the Government will be able to afford the industry adequate protection. I am also entirely in agreement with the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) in his appeal for higher protection for the banana industry, in which many of our returned soldiers are employed, and are - at present having a very difficult time. What they ask for is shown in this extract from a pamphlet issued by the Southern Fruit-growers Association Limited, which states-A protective Tariff giving, fair compensation for the difference in the cost of production between black-labour conditions outside Australia as against white labour and fair living conditions in Australia. The industry going ahead, fair prices being realized, happy and contented settlers, wives and families well cared for, empty spaces of tins vast land being filled up by men on small holdings, returned men, feeling that the promises of tliose who put them on the land are being fulfilled. Liabilities on holdings promptly met. I trust that the request of these men, as expressed in the words I have read, and voiced by the honourable member for Lilley, will receive the consideration and support of all honourable members. We have also to consider the present position of the timber industry. I hope that adequate Tariff protection will, be 'afforded during the present session of Parliament against the dumping of timber into 'the Commonwealth from tha United States of America, the Baltic, Russia, $ apan, and other places. Director of - Forestry in Queensland recently said. the recent dumping Of timber attributable largely to forced realizations the part of a number of oversea concerns, of which were selling sawn timber at less than the price of the unsawn logs; and, though a large percentage of the 45,000 saw-mills in the United States of America and Canada had . closed down during the universal depression, there still remained a proportion which Were, working upon timber concessions that cost nothing more than the obligation to open up new districts. We have heard in this House that Timber Combines have made it very difficult to carry on the construction of War Service Homes and other works; and no doubt this matter will have to be thoroughly investigated. During the war it became essential for the southern States to import Queensland timber, whereas in the past those States had used timber from foreign countries; and that fact alone shows how important the industry is to Australia. I have already said that 1 believe thoroughly in a Protective Tariff drawn up on scientific lines, and I shall say nothing more now, reserving any further remarks until the items are under consideration.  [2.26] - j l wish to say, at the outset, that this is not the Tariff of the party to which I belong, and it is not the kind of Tariff that the party on this side would introduce if they were in power. I make that remark, because a good deal of criticism has been levelled at this side of the House by members of the Country party, who have been described by the honourable member for Hindmarsh as the foreign Country party, as if we were responsible for the Tariff.. Every one knows, or every one could know, that the fiscal policy for which we on this side stand is that of giving protection, not only to manufacturers, but. to consumers and the workers, the latter of whom, are, of - course, included amongst the consumers. That is what we call our New Protection policy.",33
61,Mr HILX,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Where do the producers come in?  producers would of course ,be included amongst those I have mentioned. Under the circumstances, if anything goes wrong The with this Tariff, - from the - Corner party's point of view, and - any injustice is done to any section by its means, then, not was only the Government, but the Country on party, which - keeps the Government in' some office, must take the responsibility. Mr - BURCHELL - Is the Tariff a party issue ?  explaining that we on this side stand for a fiscal policy which will give protection to the whole community, producers and consumers alike, and such a' policy we would endeavour to carry into effect if we were in power. I ' stand in a position different from that of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), who says that he believes in what we call New Protection, but that if he cannot get it , he-apparently prefers Free Trade. My position is that if I cannot get the New Protection, I prefer the old Protection. I am not only a New Protectionist, but an. old Protectionist. This, country can produce nine-tenths of what we require; it is a young country with immense possibilities, its whole destiny before it ; and if any one who claims to be a true Australian takes up any other attitude than that I have indicated, .I am unable to follow him. The difficulty has been to follow some honourable members opposite who have spoken on this question. Without any desire to utter, a personal word, ' I inust say that the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page), in the whole course, of his speech, conveyed to me the impression that he was speaking with a desire to give effect to what he believed to be the majority opinion of his own party, and that that opinion was one with which he is not whole-heartedly in agreementSeveral times, in the course of his remarks he declared that this country must be a self-contained one, and must build up its own industries; and yet, as I say, his - speech in other parts seemed designed to meet the wishes of the majority of his colleagues, whose ideas, if carried into effect, would make such a result impossible.",34
62,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Why ?  were given to the policy enunciated by the  he impossible to make this country selfthe' contained. The country can be - self-contained only by building up our would endanger only himself. industries, and the only means of doing - that is a policy which will trul y tect the manufacturing and producing interests.",35
63,Mr HILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,B u i i d up some industries :at the expense of others.  of all our industries. It is time that somebody refuted the libel placed on the great majority of men upon the land whose opinions honourable members in the corner claim to voice when they say that this country should adopt what amounts to a Free Trade policy.,35
64,Mr HILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We say no such t'hiug. Why not speak the truth ?  placing my interpretation upon the speeches delivered by honourable members in the corner, and I shall quote-them in support of that interpretation,. The crux of the argument used by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) was thisTools of trade for primary production should be purchased in the markets of the wbrld free of duty.. It is not right £o compel the primary producers to pay Protectionist prices for their tools of trade and to sell their commodities at Free Trade prices. The only construction that can be placed on that statement is that if the duties are removed from agricultural implements and other commodities we shall get a cheaper commodity. In fact, that is the consensus of opinion amongst members of the Corner party. I emphatically deny that contention. It is disproved by the whole of our statistics and the fiscal history of the Commonwealth.",35
65,Mr GKEGOEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Is that why you are continually increasing the duties?  tened - to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr . Gregory) and I would not have thought such an utterance possible in this second year after the war - I was depressed by the speech, but so sure was the honourable member that he was right that he even went so far as to threaten honourable members who disagreed from him by saj'ing that he would make known throughout the constituencies how f effect they Voted on the Tariff.",35
66,Mr GKEGOEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Oh , no! - I hope honourable member has since realized made that he would be doing; something which I know that a speech such as he made would not probe acceptable to my constituency, and I represent a country seat. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) and the honourable member for Swan  duty were taken oft agricultural implements the farmer would get a cheaper article. I shall quote pricelists to prove that the honourable member is entirely wrong'. I do not wish to misrepresent him, but I cannot help thinking that he was expressing the views which he thought would be favoured by the majority of the people in his electorate, cause he said that ' if he repre-' sented a city constituency such, I presume, as. Melbourne Ports, he, too, would be all out for Protection. It is a sad state of affairs when honourable members regard a question of this kind from the point of view of their own constituents only.",35
67,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is very human.  be human, but the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is so staunch a Protectionist that if he were representing Wimmera he would still advocate Protection. I am a New Protectionist, but if I cannot get new Protection I shall take the old, in the hope that in the near future the party ou this side of the House will be in office and convert the old Protection into the new. In the meantime, if we cannot get all we want, let. us take as much as we can. If the late war has. taught one lesson more emphatically than another, it is that we should embark on a policy that will make this country self contained, so that we may not be again left in the predicament in which we were during the five years of conflict. That lesson should have been taken to heart by even the rankest Pree Trader in the country. No honourable member would be consciously opposed to the interests of country, but I desire to point out to .those honourable members who have advor cated the lowering of our Tariff wall that their policy would lead us into certain disaster if we were again in the circumstances which prevailed during the troublous years of war. One of the most pleasing features of this debate is the number of converts to the policy of Protection.",36
68,Mr HILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There will be some deathviews bed repentances.  not contemplate without amusement, the - fact of the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook), who was a pronounced bewere, liever in the Cobdenistic doctrines, happilv are now being deserted by the big majority of the people, being today an advocate of Protection. Yet, it is only what is. to be expected after our war experiences. Por that reasonthe attitude of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory^, who does not seem to have moved with the times, is all the be- more deplorable. Whilst I contemplate with amusement .the change of front* by the Acting Prime. Minister and others I welcome it. So far from h6lding them up to ridicule, I congratulate them on having seen the light. It is gratifying indeed, to find, both inside and outside Parliament,' that a number of the erstwhile believers in the superstition of Pree Trade are now wholehearted Protectionists. I believe that the influence which, above all others, caused them to change their views was the experience we gained during the war, which taught the utter fallacy of not seeking to make ourselves a self-contained community. Personally, I have never held any other view, - notwithstanding that I have never represented anv but a country constituency. When I represented the electorate of Indi. now represented by a member of the Country party, I won the seat because my opponent had "" gone cold "" on the accepted fiscal policy of this country, and the present imember for that electorate can find only very cold comfort from the attitude of the party with which he is associated. However, that is his concern and not mine. So far, the debate has been of a very ""general character, and very few items, except agricultural implements, have been singled out for detailed discussion. For his that reason I shall speak principally of those articles this afternoon. Certain members of the Country party concentrated their attention upon agricultural implements, and their sole argument was that the lowering of duties would make the articles cheaper to the user, whilst an increase in duty would make them dearer. I propose to show that that contention is quite erroneous. I refuse to. concede the claim of honourable members in the corner that they are voicing the of the people living in the country.",36
69,Mr HILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"T t is good for the honourable member that he is not representing a ""Victorian country constituency. ' If he he would have difficulty in justifywhich ing his statements.  present a Victorian country constituency without changing my fiscal views.",36
70,Mr HILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But the honourable member changed his constituency.  fiscal question had no bearing upon my loss of the seat. The issue was then an entirely different question, as is well known. When I won the constituency Protection was one of the strongest planks in my platform; but the honourable member indicates by his interjections that if he were representing a country constituency in some other State he would alter his views; But, knowing the views of many of the men on the land, I feel it incumbent on me to disprove the. contention of those who, posing as the spokesmen of the country peopio, say that they stand for Free Trade. That is an exploded notion. The  has told us that a binder which was quoted at .£80 last year was quoted' at £120 this year, and he said that the effect of the proposed Tariff had therefore been to increase the price by £40. That statement was - absolutely misleading, as a reference - to the printed price-lists of the importing company will show. According to its pricelists for September, 1920, this machine was quoted for delivery after1st January, 1921, at £125, but an Australian firm is now making a similar machine for £95, and the February quotation of the imported machine was £101, a reduction of £24, which was brought about by the competition of the Australian article. I challenge contradictionin respect of these figures, because I have made myself thoroughly conversant with the facts, and know them to be correct. The' cost of the, locally-made machine is therefore £6 less than that of the imported machine, thus enabling the primary producer to save £30 on the price charged for this machine before it was manufactured locally.",37
71,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is absomen.' lutely correct.  glad to have the corroboration of the honourable member, who represents an of important farming community. Some machine, members think that if they repeat materially. their statements often enough those in statements, however fallacious, come true. I , as al Protectionist, passing could never agree with the honourable member for Swan, who is A Free Trader, on many things; but. neither of us can get away from the facts. When he and others who hold similar fiscal views declare that the imposition of a duty on agricultural implements, or on anything else, increases the price, they are making a statement which is not correct. It is in the interests of the primary producers that I advocate Protection, because I - know that the-effect is to decrease prices by the competition thus created. A Protective - Tariff builds up Our own industries, and frees us from the exploitation of foreign manufacturers' combines.",37
72,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If a duty of 45 per ' cent, decreases prices to a certain extent, why not impose a duty of 90 per cent., and make prices still lower ?  impose on articles that we .can produce locally, not revenue duties, but duties that, would effectively protect the Australian workmen engaged in their manufacture,, their employers, and the consumers and users of them.",37
73,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member would prohibit importation?  But you cannot call, a Tariff Protective unless it really protects. The weight of evidence proves that Protection is in the best interests of the primary as well as of the secondary producer. The statement that Protection will crush the primary producers is a very old one. I am not sure whether the Minister went back to the 1906 figures to show that the Tariff of that year brought about the reduction of prices.",37
74,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not think so.  shall do so. In 1905, the price of the 5-feet harvester was £81. In 1906-7, the year in which a duty was put on, it was reduced to £76, arid next year to £70.",37
75,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Such a machine is out of date now, except for very small  so, but it does not. affect my argument. I am showing that the .imposition a duty did not increase the price of the but, on the contrary, lowered it Then grain drills cost £87 10s. 1906-7 and. £78 in the following year."" beSimilar reductions were made after the of the 1906 Tariff in the prices of diamond harrows, disc ploughs, and chaffcutters. Let me now compare the prices of agricultural implements in a Free.Trade country with their prices in . a protective country. If there were anything in. the contention of the Free Traders, prices should be lower in the Free Trade country than in the protected pountry. Now the header .thresher is sold in the. Argentine, which is a Free Trade country, and in Australia, where there is..a duty, by two American companies. matter was referred to by the Minister when introducing the Tariff. He pointed out that these machines were dearer in the Argentine than in Australia. . Since then some writers in the press have declared him to be wrong. "" Fact, not Fiction "" Was the signature of one of these writers; but the Minister's reply must have convinced that person that there was more fiction than fact in what he wrote - At any rate, we heard very little from him afterwards. A cablegram was sent to the Argentine by the Minister,- and the reply showed that for the header reaper or header thresher, without the engine, the retail price - in that country was 1,900 gold dollars, equivalent to. £380, and for either machine with an engine the price was 2,650 dollars, equal to £530. The - same machines were being sold without engines in Australia at the same time for £ 2 5 0. If , as our friends in the corner claim, the admission of these implements into a country free of duty has the effect of reducing their price, the primary producers of the Argentine ought to be living in a paradise as compared with the farmers of Australia; but the facts are all the other way. At any rate, in respect to agricult u r a l implements the primary producers of Australia derive a considerable advantage by a margin of protection. I respect the opinions of my friends who sit in the corner, but I am unable to follow the devious methods they employ for the purpose of convincing others that the adoption of a Free Trade policy would be in the best interests of the Australian farmers.",37
76,Mr HILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"W h e r e were those reapers and threshers manufactured?  America. One would think, to hear some honourable members talk, that the' people in country districts were interested i i i nothing else but the duty on agricult u r a l implements, whereas, as a matter of fact, they are interested in full y 70 per cent, of the items in this Tariff. For instance, they are interested in the very first item, the duty on ales and spirits. We must have barley for malting purposes. Would not the position of. the man - on the land with barley to sell be affected if we wiped out the duty on ales and spirits ? Some people talk about the duty on boots and shoes as if it were an item affecting only the. I .think this workers in factories; but is not every man on the land interested in having a substantial protection on boots and shoes? It affects the skins and hides he sells.. The man on the land is not only interested in agricultural implements. He benefits, also, by the protection afforded to the industries engaged in the manufacture of nearly three-fourths of the commodities covered by the Tariff. There is a .hoary-headed statement, well worth repeating, that the interests of the primary producers are more. highly conserved by a local market than by leaving them entirely dependent on foreign buyers; but if we allow our secondary industries to be crushed by exposure to the competition of cheap, foreign labour, we cannot have a good home market for our farmers. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) is interested in the progress of knitting mills at Clunes, as I am in getting'woollen mills at A l b u r y , Wagga, and elsewhere. . But how can those mills prosper if ' he supports - the' policy of his friends in the. corner? We cannot have woollen mills', knitting mills, and factories spread all over .the country, and at the same - time pursue a policy which makes Australia the dumping ground' for' products of other countries.",38
77,Mr JOWETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does any one say that we can do so?  speeches made by honourable members in the corner have indicated that they are prepared' to adopt a policy of admitting almost free of duty the products of other countries.,38
78,Mr JOWETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I do not think they have indicated that.*  like to know where the honourable member stands. He has changed his ground somewhat in regard to the fiscal policy of this country; 9,38
79,Mr JOWETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Most sensible men bave done so.  like to know where the honourable member stands today.,39
80,Mr JOWETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am strongly in favour of many of the duties in the schedule. Mr - PARKER MOLONEY - I would like, to know how the honourable gentleman will vote in regard to the duty on agricultural implements.",39
81,Mr HILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"You will know in good time,  what the honorablo member for Grampians said when he was a candidate for the Maribyrnong seatAny country that hoped to maintain itself against enemies must/ not' allow any important articles, which it - was capable facturing itself, to be brought in from abroad, but must establish within its own borders, on as large a scale as possible, every industry required for carrying on war ancl the ordinary avocations of life. Where would Australia have been, for instance, had she been dependent during the war on the importation of all the machinery necessary for harvesting our wheat crop ? I interpret the honourable member's speech to mean, that his vote in regard to the duty on agricultural'implements will be consistent with his remarks on that occasion - The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) does not seem to agree with the statement which I have just read. Apparently we cannot expect very much cohesion , in the corner when the division is taken. However, I thoroughly endorse the words of the honourable member for Grampians: Where would Australia have been during the five years of war if she had been dependent on the importation of the machinery necessary for harvesting our wheat crops?",39
82,Mr JOWETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Unquestionabl y we would have been short of many of the agricultural implements we require.  making that speech in Maribyrnong the honourable member has become a representative of a Victorian country constituency-, and the speech he has made upon this Tariff is not upon the lines of the speech he made when he was' a candidate for a city constituency. I hope he has not adopted the attitude of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), who says, in effect, that because he is the representative of the Wimmera, district, he is a Free Trader, but he would be all out as a Protectionist if he were a representative of a city seat.",39
83,Mr HILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member is unfair. The honourable member for Wimmera did not say that he was a Free Trader.  only quoted Hansard in regard to certain articles, and I'only mention the honourable member for Wimmera because he is one of the few members of the Corner who have had the courage to let the House know just where they stand. If the honourable member for Grampians is to vote consistently with the speech I have quoted, he will vote to give a full measure of protection to thp agricultural implement-makers of the Commonwealthj but of manuthe speech of the honourable member for Wimmera indicates that ou that particular item of the Tariff he will be found voting against the honourable member for Grampians. I said a moment' ago that the best market for the producers of this country is the local market. What the local market means to them is shown by the following figures relating to the local production and consumption for the years from 1914 to 1919 :PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION nr AUSTRALIA OF WHEAT , BUTTER, CHEESE, AND MEAT. Article. Unit of 1914-15 to 1918-19 . Qunntity. (flvo years). Wheai. ; Production Bushel 546,750,140 Consumption Bushel 199,512,928 Butter.

These figures go to show the importance of the local. market to here our primary producers. period to which I have referred, we proi duced 55,000,000 bushels of cats, tually consumed 58,000,000 bushels, so that we had to import to make good the step. shortage. We produced nearly 18,000,000 once. bushels of barley., and 17,500,000 bushels. The percentage in nise respect of the production and local congive sumption of maize, hay, and potatoes is largely the same. I have taken these country. figures from the official statistics, and they go to shcgv what the local market means to our primary producers. They go to shew also what the local market may be made to mean to them by a system, which leads to the building up of our dustries. I have shown precisely where I stand i regard to the Tariff. . I am prepared give a genuine measure of Protection anything we can produce in this country, but anything that we cannot produce should be obtainable by us in the free markets of the world.",39
84,Mr FLEMING,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member - means that anything that we cannot duce here at .a profit should be allowed to come in free.  produce here eight out of every ten comoi: modities that we consume or use.,40
85,Mr FLEMING,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We can produce almost anything, but there are some things that we cannot produce profitably.  going toi pass a vote of want of-confidence in my fellow producers. The people Australia are as capable as are those of any other country.",40
86,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,But the honourable'member will admit. that there are certain tilings which it is not economically fitable to manufacture here at the preaccept sent time.  that.,40
87,Mr GREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"And the honourable memthings ber holds that those things which can economically manufactured here should be protected.  policy to protect anything that can be' produced economically and on sound lines in Australia.

88,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We have to go step by We cannot realise everything at  that ; but our objective should be to every measure of Protection possible to the building up of industries in this,40
89,Mr HILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Would the honourable member compel the manufacturer in a pro 1 tected industry to disclose his profits-to open his books to the inspection of the in - proper authorities once every twelve months ?  n have already indicated that the policy for to which the Labour party stands is that of to New Protection. That would enable us to do what the honourable member suggests. I would go even further, and exhaust every means of getting at the cost of production abroad, and finding out exactly whether or not the prices charged profor imported goods were exorbitant. Under the policy of New Protection, it would be. impossible for a local toexploit the. people of this any other country. That is the policy for which I stand. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he proposed to appoint an Advisory Board to enable him to go into the manufacturing costs of various commodities, and thus to make it possible for him to of protest the consumers. I am not a-.lawyer, but I offer the opinion for what it is worth-that this Parliament has at the present time considerable power to give _ effect to our New Protection proposals. I do not stand for the policy of protecting proonly one section of the community: I such a policy only because nothing more is offered to me by the Government.",40
90,Mr JACKSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member must agree with me that there are certain which, from the point'of view of be national safety, we must have made in Australia, whether we like it or not.  are; but no matter how necessary they may be, we should see that the manufacturers of them do not exploit the people.",40
91,Mr JACKSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is so.  exactly where I stand.in connection with this matter. We have only a certain measure of Protection given to us by the Government'. As a believer in New Protection I have to choose - between the measure of Protection offered us and the policy of Free Trade. If I caunot get all I want,. I am going to take as much as is offered to me in the hope that the party in this House which stands for New Protection will be able to mould the Tariff into an effective instrument for the protection of producers and consumers alik«. Some of my honourable friends of the Country party have raised the objection that by granting a higher measure of Protection we shall build up here combines that will be able to exploit the people. If I a m to choose between two sets of combines-a n importers' combine and a combine which is built ,up under a system of Protection such as the Government is offering us, then I prefer the local combine, although both are highly objectionable to me. We have a chance of dealing with combines in our own country, whereas we cannot hope to control those operating overseas. The fallacious argument has been advanced by some honourable members of the Country party that Free Trade does not expose a people to the vicious principles of a combine. The very worse for m of trade combinations with which any country could be afflicted is that-of combines overseas.",40
92,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"And the, people represented by the Country party have paid more toll to the overseascombines than have any other section of the community.  because we have no chanoe .of dealing with such combines - Under this half measure of Protection, which protects only the manufacturer, and not the;consumer,-we may have - combines, but we can deal with them. in many ways. Apar t from the Advisory Board which the Minister proposes to, - create, we have ample power under section .51 of.the Constitution, dealing with imports .and exports, to ascertain the cost, of production. If the Government say that they are not going to do that, then that is their concern. . We are not in power,: and ;to that extent we disown this Tariff. It is not such a Tariff as we would have.",41
93,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It i6 a l it t l e better than the Tariff which the Labour party brought in .  orable member will admit that circumstances have entirely changed since then, and that a Tariff which might have been entirely effective in 1906 would not be effective today. To vote against the.measure of Protection that is offered us at the present time by the - Government would be. to leave Australia at the mercy of foreign combines. We could not be exposed to a worse for m of combination. I cannot conceive of the people adopting any policy , save that which will make us self-contained- a polioy which will build up our industries, and by doing so will not only benefit our working men and the secondary producers of Australia, but provide the best form of market .we could have, a substantial home market, for our primary producers. 'Such a policy is in the in terests of not only the secondary, but also the primary, industries of the country.  remarks made 'by me on a previous occasion in regard to the ' price charged for binders have - been misunderstood. In September last while I was in Western Australia, a representative of thos© who sell binders told me. that he had sold a binder that week to a brother of mine for £-78 cash - I said, "" That is remarkable. We used to get binders for £ 4 0 and £ 4 5 each for some years before the w a r . "" "" That is nothing, "" said the man, "" I have' instructions from my principals ""that, on and after 1st January, 1921, this machine' is to-be sold at £ 1 2 0 . "" That Was the precise statement made to> me by an agent who had his printed instructions at the back of his note-hook. Several honourable members have t r i e d ' to show that because Mr H u g h V . MCKay started to make this machine at £i00-r-others say £95-the priee of imported machines was reduced, and we (thus saved because pf the Tariff. But does that give the farmer much consolation, since before there was a T a r if f , and no local competition, the price was .£7 ? The tendency ought to be for prices .to f all , because it was due to the war that it rose to .£78. Now we are told that because of the Tariff the price of this machine is to be £120. Competition may bring it back to £100, but there will s t ill be a difference of £22. When a man has to pay for these articles with his own money, it takes something more than the mere book information of the honourable  to impress him.  get away from the price-lists. Mr..GREENE - I can assure the honor subsequently to the period of which he speaks, and before the end of the year, : and before the Tariff, the same company raised their price to £98, at which they are selling in New Zealand now.  spoke was quoting the September schedule',- which was dated forward. The details were similar, I suppose, to those in the schedule in the possession of the Minister. But that means nothing except that the Tariff has incited the,firm to raise the price. I may say that I am not an absolute Free Trader. I am a Protectionist of the type of Mr David Syme, the former proprietor and editor of the Age, in his earlier days, when he preached the doctrine thatProtection should be given to industries during their infancy. Things have developed very much since ' those days, and Protection is now given to industries which, with advantage to the people, could be carried on in reasonable competition with other parts of the world, particularly industries which are naturally secondary to this country. The main point iswhat protection is to be afforded to the primary producer in a White Australia, if the secondary industries are to be protected?",41
94,Mr ELLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member for Swan has already spoken in the general debate on this first item. Is it your ruling, Mr Charlton, that he may speak twice on the first item?",42
95,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH," The honourable member for Swan is perfectly in order. On the Tariff he may speak as often as he likes, and as long as he likes.  reference to the remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), who took considerable pains to point out the small pay and long hours for labour [335] in Japan, and how difficult it was for a manufacturer in Australia, under the con- * ditions of this country, to compete. I thoroughly agree with the honourable member; but I wish him to take a broader vision than is implied in the view that that argument applies only to secondary industries. The argument applies to primary industries just as much as it does to secondary industries. Japan grows one-third as much wheat as does Australia. While Australia's average per acre is 9.47 bushels, Japan's average is 18.27, with cheap labour. I am in competition with that country and other parts of the world.",42
96,Mr GREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Tell me how much wheat Japan exports.  Japan is a competitor in the world's supply of wheat, even if she supplies only herself-he r own supply is part of the world's supply. In the United States of America the average yieldper acre is 15 bushels, with an average freight of H i d . per bushel, while the freightage on Australian wheat is 4s. These figures are supplied by Mr Knibbs himself, and they show a tremendous handicap on the Australian growers. Eussia has an average yield of 12 bushels per acre, with a freightage of only about one-third that of ours. France has an average yield of 21 bushels, with scarcely any freightage at.all to the world's markets; and Germany has an average yield of 25 bushels, right in the centre of the world's markets, with cheaper labour than in the Argentine and elsewhere. How c£n primary producers be expected to face the world's competition in a Free Trade market, and buy their requirements in a Protectionist market? This business requires levelling up. The honourable member for Hindmarsh - made a reasonable statement when he said - that he was against high duties on some items which would prove injurious to more important items and interests, but otherwise he was prepared to swallow the ' Tariff ""holus bolus."" I agree with him in the contention that if a high duty on certain items will prejudice the production of more important items, the wise policy is to drop the burden on the smaller items. Now I ask honourable members whether wheat, in Australia, is a small or a large item? Are we not in competition - with other parts of the world? Do not low wages elsewhere have as much to do with primary producers as with the secondary producers here in Australia? The argument applies all round, and some means should be devised to place the producers of Australia on a fair line of competition with other countries. Then, again, there is the item of motors. What we need in this country arerailways, good roads and traction generally; but we are faced with duties on chassis so heavy as to make it almost impossible for us to secure cheap traction.",42
97,Mr RILEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We are making great progress all the samel  and it can be shown in a hundred and one ways, that the primary producers, are desperately handicapped. America is beginning to appreciate the fact that, with higher wages and shorter hours in the large cities, people are leaving the country districts. I emphasize that fact, because a precisely similar condition of affairs prevails in Australia, and has been observed for the last twenty years. Something is wrong-when this drift takes place to such a marked extent.",43
98,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Hon. J. M. Chanter),- I wish to call the honourable member's attention to the fact that, while the Standing Orders impose no limitation of time, or as to the number of speeches an honourable member may make on a general Tariff discussion, we follow the usages of Parliament, and allow a member to speak only once in the general debate on the first item. If an honourable member speaks a second time he must confine himself strictly to that item. I am sorry that, in my temporary absence, that fact escaped the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), who was acting as my deputy. ' Mr Charlton - Permi e me to say that in your absence, the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley), raised a point p i order, and I ruled that, seeing that the Standing Orders do not govern Tariff discussions, an honourable member is entitled to speak as often as he likes on the Tariff. I was not aware that there was an understanding or that it was the usage to speak only once.",43
99,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member is quite right as regards the Standing Orders; but outside those the practice has grown up, by general agreement, to give a facility which the Standing Orders do not provide. It is a matter of convenience, and the same course has been followed during the whole life of this Parliament.",43
100,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,-Does that mean that I have no right of reply on the general debate.,43
101,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There is no restriction on the Minister.  to conform to the rules, and my reply is that I never wish to do otherwise. I was speaking on a ruling, givenby your deputy; and now that ruling is disagreed with. I have no intention at the present moment to speak on the first item exclusively, and therefore will satisfy myself with the remarks I have already made. I may say that my desire was rather to make those remarks by way of explanation. Mx. GREENE (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.29] - I move That progress be reported. If I say a few word's now, will that close the debate?",43
102,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It will not close the debate.,43
103,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If I simply start to spe.ak now, will the debate be closed, or will any other honourable member, who has not already spoken, be at liberty to rise and speak to the whole question ?",43
104,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes ; any honourable member who has not already spoken on the general question can speak. Motion agreed to; progress reported. EXPORTATION. OF WOOL.
