27,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"Is it the i tention of the Prime Minister, during the recess, to create a Public Works Department, and transfer all the works to that Department ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - The moment we get into recess, I propose to go into that matter, so far as it relates to the co-ordination . of all the Departments. Most of them want re-shaping, and the duties re-allotted, and one of my objects will be to create a Public Works Department pure and simple, which will deal only with matters relating to public works. I hope we shall have an opportunity of dealing with that matter when we reach the recess. ELECTOR AL ROLLS.",14
28,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"H as the attention of the Acting Minister of Home Affairs been drawn to the fact stated by Mr Knibbs, that there were 175,000 more names of persons on the rolls than were really entitled to vote at the last general election ? If so, is he taking any steps to purge and purif y the rolls, so that we may have pure voting at the next election?",14
29,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes . The information was known prior to the introduction the B i ll to amend the Electoral Act. The information was then given to the House, and the additional time necessary before the election to enable the officials to deal for some time. with the glut of new business imon mediately prior to an election was i serted amongst the amending provisions of that measure, but, failing its passage, that particular reform suggested by the Efpctoral Office cannot be brought into efxect. We are taking the utmost care tralia. to see, not only that every person is enrolled, but that no person shall be enrolled more than once. Mr KING OMALLEY r - Did not the Acting Minister of Home Affairs also see that Mr Knibbs had said that it was impossible to reduce the number of duplications much below what existed, on account of the great number of people that were constantly changing locations and addresses ?",14
30,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I did not observe that Mr Knibbs said so.,14
31,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Has the Chief Electoral Officer issued a report in connection with the alleged duplication of names on rolls, and if he has, will the Minister n - place it upon the table of the Library?",14

34,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I shall go into the matter carefully, and give the honourable member au answer, if possible, tomorrow.",14
35,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think the Government Statistician should be protected in this House, if honourable members take the view that he has been wrongly quoted. As I read the evidence given by the Statistician, he said that on the printed rolls there was an excess of a certain number, but that is not the roll on which the vote is taken.",14
36,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! Is the honourable member asking a question, or making a statement?",14
37,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am going to ask a question. It would be unwise to raise this question in the meantime, that is, of until we get the facts.",14

41,Mr RILEY,NORTH HEAD QUARANTINE,"Has the Minister representing the Minister of Defence read the reports in the Sydney press regarding an alleged riot at Liverpool camp on two occasions] If so, will he make in-quiries to ascertain if there has been any disturbance there, and see that the thing does not occur again?",15
42,Mr KELLY,NORTH HEAD QUARANTINE,I think some honourable member of the House has already been informed that inquiries were being made by the Defence Department. NA POLLING BOOTH.,15
43,Mr RODGERS,NORTH ADELAID E HOSPITAL,"-Is it a fact that the Minister has abolished the polling booth at the North Adelaide Hospital, and, if so, why?",15
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTH ADELAID E HOSPITAL,"I am glad to have an opportunity of stating the facts in connection with this case. Some other individuals, in some other place, have been indulging in a tirade of abuse in connection with this matter, adopting that attitude in preference to the simple method of asking for the facts of the case. If they had asked for the facts, they would have found that what we did had good reason behind it . A telegram was received the other day from the officer in Adelaide stating that the North Adelaide Private Hospital would not be available as a polling place for future elections. "" Therefore,"" he said, "" I recommend its abolition before the issue of the writ."" It had.to be done hurriedly, because after the issue of the writ we cannot make provision for other polling places. We had to take action promptly, because the people in charge of the hospital gave us to understand that they would not give us the use of a room at the hospitalfor a polling booth on this occasion. ELECTORAL ROLLS.",15
45,Mr ANSTEY,NORTH ADELAID E HOSPITAL,"Has the Acting Minister of Home Affairs noticed a statement made by Mr Francis Maldon Robb, to the effect that a friend and supporter of his, named Robshaw, was .walking round Brunswick at the last election with hundreds of ballot-papers illegally in his possession; and is he going to have this man arrested and prosecuted for obtaining and using those ballot-papers in the interests of the other man instead of myself?",15
46,Mr KELLY,NORTH ADELAID E HOSPITAL,"I would be ""obliged if the honourable member would give me his assistance to probe this matter.",15
47,Mr ANSTEY,NORTH ADELAID E HOSPITAL,Does the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs believe there is any truth in the statement that there was a man walking about Brunswick with hundreds of ballot-papers in his possession ?,15
48,Mr SPEAKER,NORTH ADELAID E HOSPITAL,The honourable member cannot ask a hypothetical question.,15
49,Mr ANSTEY,NORTH ADELAID E HOSPITAL,It is not hypothetical.,15
50,Mr SPEAKER,NORTH ADELAID E HOSPITAL,The honourable member must not argue the point with the Chair. He is out of order in asking a question of that character.,15
51,Mr ANSTEY,NORTH ADELAID E HOSPITAL,Then I shall ask if the Minister is prepared to take any action against Robshaw for taking ballot papers about Brunswick?,15
52,Mr KELLY,NORTH ADELAID E HOSPITAL,"If the honourable member will lay an information, the requisite steps will be taken to give it every consideration. NA ADMINISTRATOR. Mr KING O'MALLEY - When does the Minister of Home Affairs propose to make the position of Administrator of the Federal Territory a permanent appointment ?",15

57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"My recollection is-and I think it will be found in the Estimates-that there remained the end of last financial year a sum of FORBESTabout £1,100,000 owing on account of the Fleet Unit. I think the previous Government paid during their three years about £3,000,000 on account of the Fleet, but there remains to be paid this year a sum of between £ 1 , 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 . , POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION tentious Bill returned from the Senate with amendments, iucluding amendments in the title.",16

The two things are quite dif",16
65,Mr WH IRVINE,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"The Bill practicreally makes compulsory the reserve which you, in effect, made.",16
66,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"The Attorney-General - will see that every additional million of circulation will not give a single penny in return to the taxpayers of Australia. If we double our circulation we shall not receive another penny, but with a reserve of 40 per cent, we increase our income with every extra million pounds in circulation. Mr W. H. IBVINE - I admit it . there is a large expansion of the issue it will not be the same as your practice, but . for the present issue it is practically the same.",16
67,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"The point is a very subtle one. People will say, "" You will be as well off under this proposition with the note circulation, as it stands now as you were under the existing system."" But as you increase your circulation you lose your money. That is the point that ought to be put clearly before the people.",17
68,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Does the honourable member take no notice of the experience of other countries?,17
69,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"I take notice of the experience of, not only other countries, but Australia. Does not the Treasurer know that a certain banking and financial journal, which opposed our note issue scheme most bitterly, has been converted recently to the view taken by myself, and has expressed that view without stint or reserve ? Perhaps it would be well to give the righ t honourable member the benefit of a quotation from this journal. He will admit, I think, that a criticism by The Review of Australasian Banking, In surance, and Finance is worth quoting in this connection. In its issue of 31st May last, it published an article entitled "" The Safety of the Australian Note Currency,"" in which it wroteWe have been asked to express our opinion as to the safety or otherwise of the Australian Note currency, and we feel in duty bound, comply with the demand. However might prefer to be silent on the subject, we feel our readers have a rigbt to our opinion. It was, of course, hardly to be expected a Labour Government would inaugurate a rency system on lines that would meet with our tion. unqualified approval, but we have to acknowarticle ledge that advice given in our columns some four years ago has been so far acted upon that pur further criticism has been practically armed. We must admit that the Commonwealth Goto be in office. vernment has acted with praiseworthy determination to secure the soundness of the system. Though the Commonwealth Government, with its immense powers of taxation, isbehind every note issued, it treats the gold .deposited in exchange for the notes as trust money, such por. tion as is considered safe from any reasonable probability of demand being invested in gilt edged securities. Even the interest in excess of cost, which is very considerable, amounting lo far more than ;£ 100,000 a year, is not taken by the Government, but is invested in the same way as the principal. "" But what would happen,"" we are asked, "" if the people were all to make a rush for the conversion of the paper into gold ?"" Well, if the rush were confined to these notes, so as to conIf vince Mr Fisher that the people were anxious to get rid of his currency, he would pay out his treasured gold, sell off his gilt-edged securities, give the jingling metal for every bit of paper, and then take advice as to what he should do with the 250,000 sovereigns that would be snugly tucked away in his safe. By this time people might be wondering why they had rushed. ' But,"" persists our inquirers, "" is there no way that the people could lose by this currency scheme?"" Without violating the law as laid down in the Act under which the scheme is conducted, there is no way, unless something should happen that would make our gilt-edged State securities of little or no value, and at the same time nullif y the taxation powers of the Commonwealth. right",17
70,Sir JOHN FOBREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Our State securities would not be there. We shall use them all .,17
71,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,The right honourable member ought to be out of office if he is going to do that?,17
72,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,I did not expect that interjection from the Treasurer.,17
73,Sir JOHNFORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,It is the truth.,17
74,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"If I may say so, without desiring to be offensive, the Treasurer does not understand this matter.",17
75,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,The r i g h t honor- . able member has had such a lot of opportunities to arrive at an understanding of the question and to enable him to understand it better than I do!,17
76,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,If the right honourable member will permit me,17
77,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,What experience has the right honourable member had ?,17
78,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Order ! I must ask to the Treasurer to refrain from making much we frequent interjections. MI . FISHER - The Treasurer is in that error in saying that he intends to use up curthese securities. He has no such intenThe securities referred to in this are the securities which we hold as a double cover against the note issue. disI am sure that he has no intention of touching them. If he had he ought not,17
79,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,To what double securities does the honourable member refer ?,17
80,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,To the securities which can be sold and used as a double cover against the note issue.,17
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,What are they?,17
82,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"They are Common- * wealth securities, which can be placed on the market at any time to provide the money necessary to pay off the whole of the note issue, and they are plus the gold reserve.",17
83,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,My point is that they .are not .State securities.,18
84,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"They are Commonwealth 'securities, and the right honourable member interjected that he was going to use them up. - Sir JOHN FOBBEST - The right honourable member spoke of "" State "" securi ties.",18
85,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"It would be better for the right honourable member to look into this matter before he begins to dogmatize upon it . The term "" State securities "" is used in the article as referring to Commonwealth securities.",18

I must attack when statements are made that are likely to be removed , from their context and used to misreprethat is meant. sent our position-used , not by the right honourable member, but by others.",18

Does he think that gold would be availwho able at such a time?",18
91,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,It could be obtained without the slightest difficulty. .,18

93,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Australi a is a goldthe producing country, and it could be tained here - The amount that we should require would be comparatively nominal. . Mr Rodgers - A general panic would affect the whole country.",18
94,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Order !,18
95,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"We strengthen our case when we induce the other side to wants talk. This country could never be fully depleted of its gold supply. It is a gold, producing country, and its securities are £*quite ample. In 1892-3-4, we were mulating gold, notwithstanding that were then passing through the most degentleman. pressed times we had ever experienced. I admit that otlier countries tunately situated. We should have to from draw on the gold reserves of Australia for a merely nominal amount in respect of our note issue, with practically half gold against them in our own safes. When I was interrupted, I was giving utterance, not to my own views, but to the statement of a financial journal The : criticism proceedsWe are bound to admit that Australia's paper money scheme is upon a basis that leaves .no doubt as to its soundness. We began this article by inferring that the Australian Note system did not meet with our unqualified approval, but honesty compels us to admit that had our system been taken in its entirety it could not have given any better security to note holders.. did the Others may not agree with us, but if we were in Mr Fisher's place we should look upon the bonds he holds as better security than his treasured sovereigns.",18
96,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,The writer'means honourable the bonds of the States.,18

100,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,I think the reference is to the bonds which the Treasury to l i - holds from the States.,18

102,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"I am not fond of using quotations, but I brought these with me, because I thought the question would be raised. Mr Finlayson, the manager of Union Bank in Victoria, who, as the obhead of what is a veryconsiderable institution, may be regarded as an authority, in giving evidence before the Royal Commission on Banking in Victoria, just after the financial crash, said, in reference to a State note issue:If the note issue was confined to the natural of the people, I believe I can say that the State could get along with a comparatively small reserve of coin-say , perhaps, 5s. in the accuI think the right honourable gentleman we will pay heed to the statement of this Then, Mr Frank Grey Smith, of the National Bank, speaking are more foralso of the reserve, said I think the general consensus of opinion is one-fourth to one-third in specie.",18
103,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,When was this?,19
104,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"This was evidence given before the Royal Commission in Victoria in 1892 or 1893. Mr Henry Gyles Turner, who is still with us, saidGenerally, it is.held that from 25 to 33 cent, is sumcient in an ordinary circulation. The Treasurer, in his speech, did not quote anybody on the point, but pointed to the Bank of England, which, however, is not analogous in any way, as I am clined to think the Treasurer knows, his' smile is any guide.",19
105,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"I quoted the great - countries of the world. Mr Bruce SMITH,-Did the Leader of the Opposition see the Bankers' Journal of Hew South Wales, in which it is said .that anything - below 40 per cent, would be a danger to the State?",19

108,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"At any rate, that was said at that time. The banking authorithe panic? ties in New South Wales have never been favourable to a note issue outside their - banks; and in this I do not blame them. Why should we expect the banking note to do so. authorities, who can get better results from a private issue, to enthuse 'State issue?",19
109,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FEDERAL TERRITORY,The right honorabout. able gentleman cannot get rid of an 'opinion of that kind by attributing bias. that time.,19
110,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"It is not bias. It is no reflection to say that the banking institutions conserve their own interests; bers but it is a reflection on the representatives of the people in this Parliament to - suggest that we should give up, not only 'the securities, but the revenue to which we are entitled by issuing a paper as as other currency.",19
111,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Did not the right 'honourable gentleman, in order to allay fear, give an assurance that he would not go below 40 per cent. ?",19
112,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Yes , I did give an undertaking not to go below 40 per cent.",19
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,The right honorpossible able gentleman changed his opinion in very short time.,19
114,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"I never at any time - changed ray opinion on this matter. When I introduced the Bill I said that I believed 25 per cent., with a working margin pf 33 per cent., would be ample and over much. But with a measure of this Jrind we have to take the timid with us; and we were able to do so, and per get it passed. I venture to say that if , unfortunately, this Bill should pass, which I believe it will not, it will be only a year or two before it will have to be repealed. In the early nineties, and inespecially in 1892-3, there was, as honorif able members will remember, a depreciation of bank paper. It has been said in this House, and quite truthfully, that the note issue' of the banks was practically redeemed at face value in time; but when the collapse took place the poor people who held the notes lost, to my knowledge, up to 5s. in order to get imme",19

117,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,That is an inane sugown gestion! We might as well expect the sovereign to depreciate as expect a State,19

119,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"If all honourable memopposite were bank managers, it would make no difference to the facts; and I can quote a bank manager against the honourable member for Calare, and not only a bank, manager, but a bank direcwell tor. The lateHon. James Dickson, who was one of the Treasurer's colleagues in the first Federal Ministry, was a considerable authority, in his own way, on financial matters; and he said, in the discussion on the Queensland measure in 1893, that, although he was dead against a State note issue, it was practically imto depreciate State paper. That a was on the negative side; and on the positive side he said that, although four-fifths of the Queensland note issue was depreciated, and the people had lost, immediately the imprint of the Government was put on the notes, they would return to face value and remain at that. matter of fact, the very day that the Government P r in t i ng Office put on the p r in t ""Queensland Treasury Notes"" they became equal to the sovereign, and were accepted by every one. Surely that is evidence strong enough for honourable members? There is no danger in a note issue with not less than 25 per cent, reserve; and the words "" not less than 25 per cent, at any time "" demand that there shall be a sufficient margin of gold kept above that proportion- a working margin sufficient for all reasonable demands, not only in ordinary times, but also in times of panic. The systems of the United States of America and Canada have been referred to, but the conditions of Australia are not at all like those of Canada. Our trade is fairly regular throughout the seasons, whereas in Canada, as in all countries where they have long, cold winters, the harvesting is confined to four or five months in the year.  disturb the equilibrium of trade.",19
120,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,They usually affect only one industry.,20
121,Mr ARTHUR,FEDERAL TERRITORY,And only one part of the country.,20
122,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Yes . There is a difference between a thing that happens occasionally and one that happens regularly. In Canada, during the harvesting season, expenditure increases, and the demand for currency is excessive as compared with the remainder of the year. The Canadian system has to provide for that. Here in Australia there is no part of the year that is more productive of wealth - than another. We have the wool season, the wheat season, the butter season; and mining, of course, gives returns all the year round.",20
123,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL TERRITORY,The weight of finance falls in the month of March.,20
124,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"The bankers say A p r i March and A p r i l are tight months, b that is chiefly because of the settlement C\at takes place then, and hardly my argument. Every man who honestly examines this question with an unprejulong-dated diced mind will say that there is no danger with a 25 per cent, gold reserve and a working margin above it . The only justification for the measure is that i an attempt to give effect to the statements of the Prime Minister and others that the As a note issue is in danger, and needs furthe r protection. Happily, the mass of the i m - people took no notice of that statement.",20
125,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL TERRITORY,How would you regulate the working margin?,20
126,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,It would vary between 33 and 25 per cent.,20
127,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,That is not provided for by law-.,20
128,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,I stated originally that there would be that margin.,20
129,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Anothe r Treasurer might keep only the bare reserve.,20
130,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"No Treasurer dare do that. No man of sense would do it . The words in the Act were carefully chosen. They are "" Not less than 25 per cent, in gold. "" The Treasurer could not let the reserve become lower than 25 per cent, without violating the law.",20
131,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,He would have to do the best he could.,20
132,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"And he would thus do the best for the citizens. The more you have for investment the greater will be your income, and the smaller the taxation. It is the people who are carrying this paper money. It is their confidence that enables us to earn at the present time about £200,000 ""a year from the note issue. The Treasurer is privileged in being able to dip into this f u n d , and to .borrow money from it at 3^ per cent. On the open market he would have to pay 4 per cent, or more. B y establishing a 3£ per cent, standard we prevented the Trust Fund from earning an additional J per cent, that could be got on the open market. The right honourable gentleman had the audacity to accuse me of tying up the money by lending it to the States at 4 per cent. The States were very glad to get it . We could not give them enough.",20
133,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,We shall have to pay a good deal to get it back. We cannot sell their bonds at par.,20
134,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"If the right honourable gentleman, with the security that he has l . to offer, cannot negotiate for a loan at u t 4 per cent., it is not a great compliment to his Government, seeing that private affects persons can do it .",20
135,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,What were the Bills issued to the States for ?,20
136,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"They were issued after I came back from South Africa , the in terest being as low as 3£ and 3f per cent. t is I had to take the market price of the day. We have given the Treasurer more money to use than there would been under his system of finance.",20
137,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,We shall lose a lot of money by negotiating the State securities.,21
138,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"That is a side issue, and the statement is not correct.",21
139,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"We shall probably £100,000 in discounting.",21
140,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,I hope that the Treasurer will go on the open market for the money rather than lose that.,21
141,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,We should not do eo well.,21
142,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,I have no doubt of that. The righ t honourable gentleman may thank his stars that he was left a good thing.,21
143,Sir JOHN FOBREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,You r will not come out well in. the end.,21
144,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Most Treasurers would like to begin with a £2,650,000 cash balance, and about £7,000,000 in Trust Funds. The liabilities of the note issue at the present time amount to about .£9,500,000, and there are £355,000 of assets in excess of liabilities. viding of machinery and the printing of the notes has been paid for, and eacb year will add to the accumulation from £170,000 to £200,000, so that, in a comparatively few years,, the accumulated in terest will more than equal the total face value of the note issue. I appeal to the Government to withdraw the Bill . It is not in the interests of the people.",21
145,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"In that case, the right honourable member must oppose it . We do not introduce measures without der. reason. In this instance we are 6n the side of great safety.",21
146,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"It is not safety to keep an excess of money in a strong room he must pay. gold for them. that will never be required"". Hon-"" orable members opposite are plaining of the excessive taxation, any time. and of the need for borrowing, but are giving away . £25,000 per annum without getting any increased security. Should the Bill pass, £25,000 per in interest will be lost, because of the extra amount of gold that will have to be kept in reserve above what is required, and for every £1,000,000 increase in the note circulation there will be a loss £40,000 a year. I have quoted highest official authority in ' Australia one of the banking journals-to show instance, that the banking community is perfectly satisfied with my scheme. This authority have held at one time a contrary opinion, but it is honest enough to say now that it is perfectly satisfied that I have provided ample security, and that if every one applied to the Treasury for gold, there would be £355,000 left after all the demands had been met. The honourable member for lose Werriwa, who is generally very sensible in these matters, committed a serious error in stating that the securities held were not as good as they were reported to be. I read a speech of his, published in Goulburn, that left that impression on my mind.",21
147,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,I have always objected . to the Government interfering with the paper currency.,21
148,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"I understand that posifinancing tion ; but the Treasurer is differently situated. He says that he is really the father of this scheme, and had intended to introduce it . But he is proposing to make it as little useful as possible. He is throwing away money, and I hope that the good sense of the House will not permit this to be done. The measure is not The pro- one of those which I regard as non-contentious.",21
149,Sir JOH NFORREST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,It is not a party measure.,21
150,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,It gives away the people's money without increasing the security of the paper currency. No person must accept Australian notes if he prefers gold. Ours is not a false currency.,21
151,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,The notes are legal ten,21
152,Mr FISHER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Betwee n private persons, but not in favour of the Treasurer. If you go to the Treasurer with notes, And any person holding notes can. demand from comthe Treasurer their payment in full at Behind the note issue, we they have not only the credit of the Commonwealth, but also the Consolidated Revenue, and an ample and sufficient annum gold reserve for the currency, which w i ll prevent all difficulties and earn £200,000 a year in interest, the earning increasing if the law is allowed to remain as it stands. It has been said that I promised of to keep a reserve of 40 per cent. I did the make that promise, and I think that it was a right promise to make in the first because there were t i m i d' people who were afraid of what we were doing; although in Queesland the experience of nineteen years has convinced the authorities that a reserve of not less than 25 per cent, is ample, and the people of the State use, perhaps, per capita, double the paper currency used in the other States. Further., a Conservative like Sir H u g h Nelson has stated that, in his opinion, a reserve of nob less than 25 per cent, is ample for all purposes. So that I have not only quoted modern authorities, but can quote the first honourable gentleman that introduced a measure of this kind. It was an eminent success in that State. I appeal again to the Government not to press this measure and deprive the taxpayers of an income that rightly belongs to them without in any way giving the holders of the notes greater security than they have at the present time. I oppose the Bill . - Mr CONROY (Werriwa.) [3.38] - I decidedly object to the introduction of paper money by any Government whatever, because if the citizens of a country earn anything they have a righ t to be paid in the form of coin, which is current all over the world. ment should, above all, see that the currency of a country is always kept at its strict face value so far as it is possible for it to do so. The reason why, in every sound Government throughout the world, the introduction of paper money has been given up is that the temptation in times of difficulty becomes too great. The experience has always been that Governments which have issued money have, in. order to keep themselves in existence, sought to obtain from the public money which they should not obtain. For instance, the Labour party, when they introduced this paper currency, actually borrowed £10,000,000 from the people of Australia -£10,000,000",21
153,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,E o r whom did they borrow it?,22
154,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"I am not concerned with the object of the policy at the present time. What they actually did was to. borrow £10.000,000 of capital from the banks. In other words, they destroyed the credit of the banks to that extent. Every one of us rightly makes use of the - amount of the credit that he has, and it must be remembered that the amount of the credit that there is in. the community is frequently what determines the production of wealth in a community. Credit is the factor of all in the production of wealth, and, therefore, anything which tends to injure or lessen it injures the whole community-no t the capitalist, as has been alleged, although he sometimes shares in the general downfall, but mostly that smaller section of the population who are unable to get along at all without credit.",22
155,Mr AHTHUB,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"That is all right, but where is the in j u r y in this case?",22
156,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"For instance, the honourable member will see at once t h at if credit was denied to every citizen of Bendigo, the pressure on them of ready money would be so great that it would mean the alteration of the whole of. their system of living for some considerable) time. What he does not see, however.} is that, while it is an in j u r y to each citizen to deprive him of his credit, it is a still greater in j u r y when a collection of individuals who call themselves a bank are deprived; of their credit,, because credit is one of the most valuable assets either of a bank or of a citizen. What the. Government unfortunately, did was to deprive the banks of practically A Govern- £10,000,000 of credit, which meant that the banks have had to call it together from all their customers. Worst of all-, wedestroyed the very elasticity of commerce. Another big evil happened in this way. The return on capital put to private use is,' roughly, 10 per cent., so that the return fro m that £10,000,000 when in private use was at least £1,000,000 per year. The amount paper expended on labour in producing that ret u r n amounts to upwards of two-thirds., the rough calculation being that, for every pound earned, two-thirds goes in wages. Therefore, we get a gross return of something like £3,000,000 for the benefit of the community upon the when used privately- a very bigi. factor in a country like Australia. The Government took that money and put it out on works which, at the most; represent a return of, say, 4 per cent.., or £400,000 per year; and, allowing that another two-thirds is expended in wagesj we get another £800,000. In other words, we get a return on this money, when brought under Government control, of £1;200,000 per year, instead of £3,000,000per year when under private control. If we carried that nlan far .enough, and absorbed all the private capital for the use of the Government, it would put capital greatest up to such a rate of interest as is undreamt of in any other community. Thisis not idle talk, because it has happened so far in every community that has tried it . Even in England itself there was at one time for nearly four years a discount of 4s. in the £ 1 on its Bank of England notes.",22
157,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL TERRITORY,How long ago?,23
158,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"A good while ago; but they learnt the lesson then, and they have not needed to learn it since. France learnt it to such an extent that her notes returned nothing at all, although her assignats were issued, not on the mere credit of the people, but, in the first in stance, on the security of all the confiscated land of the nobles. We know the in j u r y that was done to France. Russia tried the same thing, and its pound note fell to 2s., but its Government has learnt the lesson, and wisely adopted the advice of its financiers not to increase their paper issue, although they were engaged in the Japanese War, with the result that the country has recovered from that war infinitely quicker than it otherwise would. not learn the lesson, or, if it did, some big financiers were too interested in seeing 2>aper money issued in that way, because they knew that they could gain, to let the country profit by the lesson of other countries - Whether it was intended or not, the direct result was that the financiers of America benefited to such an extent that it made many of them great millionaires. stated by eminent economists that that issue of paper money, over issued as it was, cost the States probably £1,000,000,000 more than the cost of the war otherwise would have been. I need hardly refer to the various States of America that issued paper money, such as Virginia or Pennsylvania, but, in every case, the result was failure, so far as the masses of people were concerned. In France, England, Russia, Austria, Germany, Spain, Portugal, the United States, and the Argentine Republic, the result has always been to impoverish the poorer class of the community.",23
159,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,What has that to do with the Bill?,23
160,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"A great deal to do with it , in that, if this Bill is passed, it takes away from the Government the power to double the issue of the notes, or, if the Government does start on it , it has to keep a sovereign back to pay for every extra note so issued, if called upon to do so. That is one of the chief merits of the Bill . It is perfectly true it does not propose to re-establishon a sound gold basis the currency of the country.",23
161,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Will it cheapen the money to the man you speak of?,23
162,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"No , but it will prevent the rate of interest increasing against the poorer people to the extent it would have, had the past policy been persisted in. The Bill is not in the interests of financiers who dabble in finance every day, who are able to foresee every rise and fall in stocks, and buy and sell in advance, and so make a profit either way. What chance has the man in the country, engaged in daily work, though possessing exactly the same class of brains as the financier possesses, to compete with the financier ? For instance, if there should be a sudden rush on the banks, and on our own notes, if there should be a sudden demand for gold, who would fall in ? Would it be the wealthy banks ? Not at all. These America did institutions would be ready with the £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 worth of notes they hold to hand them in to the Treasury at 10 o'clock in the morning, and so get all the gold reserve there, leaving the public outside with their notes. I admit that at the present time there is quite enough gold on hand to meet even an unusual demand, but the system is wrong, and it was a wrong It is policy for the Labour Government to bring forward. I could quite understand a body of capitalists, or big banking men, who hope by trading in the value of notes to earn a profit, advocating this policy; it is manifest that they would be gainers by it ; and it is to the credit of some of the great leaders of finance in Australia that each one has pointed out the danger of the policy brought forward by the Labour party. These men know what is going on daily; they know what the rates of discount are all over the world ; they know the rates of transfer, and they know the prices of all the various stocks here and in London, and they have an advantage over the rest of the publio that cannot be over-estimated in matters like this, and it is precisely because we cannot thoroughly estimate such things that Governments anxious to take up such matters on behalf of the people have always resisted the introduction of paper money. The system introduced by the Labour party is a big .mistake, and they, above all, should not have introduced it .",23
163,Mr RILEV,FEDERAL TERRITORY,It has not affected the prosperity of the country.,24
164,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"If the member follows out the argument as to money used by a private individual in comparison with money used by Governments, he will see that there has been a difference in wages, plus profits, of something like £1,800,00 0 a year. And if we double that we immediately get a very large difference in the value of the production of the country. It is true that with the general prosperity of Australia we have been able to sustain an increase, but that increase in profits would have been still greater had there been no such call as that made by a measure r f this sort. Why prevent banks and other institutions from making use of their credit ? As far back as 2,000 years ago Demosthenes said that "" they who do not understand this-that credit is the greatest, factor of all in the production of wealth-ar e utterly ignorant of everything.""",24
165,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Every knows it .,24
166,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"The Australian Notes Act destroyed or limited the credit of all our great institutions; and, if it was right to so affect the credit of institutions, why was it not equally right to destroy the credit of every individual? In these days of co-operation, when we hope there will be more of the co-operative movement, why should we attempt to destroy the credit of corporate bodies? I cannot understand why those who profess Socialism should try to destroy the credit of such bodies. While safeguarding the in terests of the public, ""to consider these bodies fit subjects for taxation in exchange for the use of their credit may be a right course, but a policy of destroying the credit of every individual or association of individuals does great harm to the community, and the assumption of such control, as the late Government did, has sown the seeds of many evils yet to come. Accepting my figures as correct, the effect of this measure has been to make a difference as between private and public works of nearly £2,000,000 a year in the annual production of Australia.",24
167,Mr ABCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,That is all moonshine.,24
168,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Does the honourable member think that money spent in Government works is looked after so well as the money spent by himself, or by any other level-headed individual? honourable",24
169,Mr ABCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,What have Government works to do with notes?,24
170,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Does not the honourable member see that by the issue of these notes the Government borrowed £10,000,000 from private institutions and private individuals? The Labour party undoubtedly concealed fro m the mass of the public that it was a loan. Without desiring to be at all offensive, I say it was a political move- I sball not say dodgethat concealed from the public the fact that £10,000,000 was withdrawn from private use and put to Government use. That illustration should put the matter I in tend to convey as clearly as possible. Passing the Bill now before us will prevent any f u t u re Government having the power to so issue notes as to endanger their face value. The passing of the Bill will be a sound policy. It will not be within the power of any Government in .the future to use still more notes, because schoolboy after the issue of a certain sum they must retain a solid backing to meet every note issued, and if any demand is made upon the Treasurer he will be-as is right and proper-in a position to meet it .",24
171,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Honourable members do not think a demand will ever be made.,24
172,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"No ; of course, they do not. They did not think they would have a demand in the Argentine, yet the £ 1 note in the Argentine fell to 6s. 8d., and there was great in j u r y to a community even wealthier in land than ourselves, and closer to the world's markets.",24
173,Mr HANNAN,FEDERAL TERRITORY,What is the gold reserve in the Argentine?,24
174,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"The Argentine has not a proper gold reserve. If , under present circumstances, we. issued notes to the value of £10,000,000, and allowed the gold reserve to f all , what would be the position ? We have nearly £10,000,000 issued now, and yet we could not meet a demand suddenly made. The Labour Government concealed the fact that they took that money and spent if . I am not arguing whether they spent it wisely or not. I simply say that they took the loan, and disguised the fact fro m the mass of the people-the fact that they had borrowed so much under the political method of a Bank Notes Act . 1I have no objection to their borrowing the money if they spend it wisely, but I seriously object to their pretending that the money was not borrowed. There is a serious objection to leaving the note issue as it is at present. It is infinitely better for the sake of our credit that we should pass the Bill , and put it beyond the power of any Treasurer to make an issue qf paper money unless there is gold currency to meet it , if the people so desire. By this Bill , the Treasurer renders it impossible to issue notes without having the bullion at the back of him, and he is putting the gold reserve already in existence on a much sounder basis, which is above all things to be desired in' the in terests of the masses of the people, and in the interests of sound finance. It is more essential for the poorer man than for the richer man that we should pass this Bill . If the members of the Labour party rightly understood the position, they would, and should, be the very first to side with us in attempting to restore the currency of Australia to a really sound foundation. I do not say that this cannot be done up to the limi t of the present issue, but the trouble is that we do not know how far we can go, and witli a feeling of insecurity abroad we destroy that very confidence between man and man which 'is at the root of all credit, and of all production of wealth-the thing so greatly to be desired when we are considering the material prosperity of any community. I regret that the finances have been left in such a disorderly state that it is impossible to restore those millions which have been extracted from the pockets of the people under the disguise of a Bank Notes Act, which enabled the Labour party to conceal from the public how many millions they really borrowed, and the amount of waste that was in dulged in by them. I trust that the Bill will be passed in the form in which it has been submitted, though I wish it had gone still further. I accept it , however, because, as things go on from year to year, there will be less and less danger of there being such a thing as a run that will affect the security of our notes.",24
175,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"South Australia; [3.44] - I hope the Government will see their way clear to withdraw the Bill , because they must come to the conclusion that they have committed a very grave error of judgment. It is difficult to understand any Government with a clear idea of our finances being a party to a proposal of this character. Reference by the honourable member for Werriwa to the Argentine and to France during her revolution are all beside the question. Every schoolboy knows that paper money without gold backing behind it must depreciate. The Treasurer savs he desires that there shall be a gold reserve of 40 per cent. The existing Act requires that there shall be a gold reserve of not less than 25 per cent., but the practice is to have a working margin of 33 per cent. The question of what gold reserve ought to be retained is. after all, merely a matter of fancy. I asked the Treasurer : why he introduced this Bill , because, in my opinion, a gold backing of 50 per cent, gives no greater security than is afforded by a backing of 25 per'cent. The honourable member for Werriwa smiles, but he knows nothing about the question. A principle can be laid down. It is necessary to ask ourselves what currency really is. Currency at the present time consists of coined bullion as well as a silver and bronze coinage, and the note issue. But that is not the only currency of a country.",25
176,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,I should hope not.,25
177,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"I asked the honourable member what currency was, and he gave us a long yarn which no one could understand. The principal currency of a country consists of cheques and bills, and the cheque and bill system in Australia is similar to that prevailing in the Mother Country. That fact must be taken into consideration, and when we realise the extent of the currency of cheques and bills we must see that this talk about a gold backing is mere moonshine. That is the view of men standing high in the world of finance.",25
178,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,They would laugh at such a statement.,25
179,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"An y schoolboy knowing anything of finance will admit the t r u th of my statement. 1 think the Treasurer has committed a very grave error of judgment. He referred the House to the established customs of other countries, l t is remarkable that the only real system of currency and finance existing in the world today is to be found in the Mother Country. The Old Land, by virtue of her sound system of finance, is enabled, through the Bank of England, to carry on her tremendous and marvellous trade by means of a comparatively small amount of gold. The gold stored in the . vaults of the Bank of England is far less than that in the vaults of the Bank of Prance or the Bank of Germany. America aboslute financial chaos prevails. If any honourable member doubts that statement, I invite him to read an article published in the last issue of the North American Beview. Congress is trying at present to bring about some reasonable sort of system. They are utterly ashamed of that which now prevails, and I venture to say that they will make some improvement, because the present system stinks in the nostrils of the people. The Bill which will eventually be passed by Congress, however, will not be worth very much, because too much attention is being given to the views of bankers. nothing to say against bankers any more than I have against other professional - men, but it does not necessarilv follow that the interests of bankers are identical with the interests of the people. We have no right to set aside the opinions of experts, but we have to remember that they may be, aud very often are, biased by personal interests, and that the interests of bankers may be detrimental to the public good. If we thought of amending any law, would we consult the lawyers I",25
180,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Who m else would you consult ?,26
181,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"I would listen to what they had to say, and weigh it very carefully, but I would not lose sight of the fact that their opinions would necessarily be affected by their own interests. Private interests are not necessarily public interests; they are almost invariably opposed to the public interests. Treasurer told us that we ought to be guided by what is being done elsewhere. That is quite right so far as what'is being done in the Mother Country is concerned. Why should the Bank of Prance and the Bank of Germany hold so much more bullion than is held by the Bank of England?",26
182,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Because they tried the paper money, and the people fell in.",26
183,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"If the honourable member knew more of this question than does a child in the street he would know that the reason is that it has been found impossible to familiarize the people of Erance with the cheque system. Then, again, German bankers, according to reports coming to hand every day, are doing all that they can to familiarize the people of that country with the cheque system, and I think that they will do so. To the extent to which you familiarize the people of a country with the cheque system, you In can release a tremendous amount of gold. An honourable member who has a banking account knows that he is creating currency all day long. Cheques and bills are recognised as being just as much currency as notes are. Finance and currency have been for me an amusing study during the last forty years.",26
184,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"And only an amusing one, I should say.",26
185,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"What I meant to convey was that, while some people waste their leisure in following certain amuseI have ments, I have probably wasted my time in this connection.",26
186,Mr COJTROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,The honourable member has.,26
187,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"That is for the House and the country to decide. The honourable member practically said that we had been taking a forced loan from the banks. But what is the actual position? The currency created by cheques and bills is a currency created by the banks and the community, while coined bullion belongs to the State. With whom should a note issue rest ? For what is a note issue? Is it to suit the convenience of a man in business or trade ? Certainly not. Such a man does not bother about notes; he writes out a cheque, which, in his case, is the equivalent of a note. A bank note is a handy medium of circulation for those who have no banking accounts, and it is essential that such notes should be The in circulation. But who should issue them- a bank or the Government? What has a bank to do with such a currency? * The claim that the banks have a right to a note currency is a most arrogant one.",26
188,Mr COSTROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Has the honourable member a right to issue a promissory note?,26
189,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"That is where the credit of the banks comes in. In determining the currency of a country, we have to consider, not only its coined bullion and its notes in circulation, but the amount of cheques and bills cleared in its clearing-house. The Treasurer ought fo"" have given us the clearing-housefiguresof the Commonwealth, in respect of cheques and bills, for the last twelve months. There has been a tremendous increase this class of currency in the Mother Counthat try, as well as in the Commonwealth, honourable members opposite will tell that by virtue of that tremendous increase we are able to dispense with a very large note issue. The note issue w i l sorbed according to the requirements of - the country. Let me give honourable members the clearing-house figures for Mother Country. I take them from article, not by the honourable member f Werriwa, but by Mr Chiozza Money, who is recognised in the Old Country one of the ablest of financiers, as one of bank? the world's leading economists, although he is detested by those who belong to the school of politics which honourable, members opposite affect. When I am faced with an ugly fact that I cannot underI stand, I have to agree with it or oppose it ; and if honourable members wisb understand this question, they will rethe Treasurer would not be able to get luctantly have to agree with the conclugold, sion I am laying before them. The article appeared in the Contemporary Review last September, and in it is given a table showing the world's gold output, and the United Kingdom's gold imports compared with the London banking clearances for each year from 1895 to 1912. That table is as follows - <1) WOULD GOLD OUTPUT, AND (2) UK. GOLD IMPORTS COMPARED TOR (3) LONDON BAN KERS' CLEARANCES. World UK. Yoar. Gold Gold Output.

They show the banking clearances in the United and Kingdom have doubled themselves in us seventeen years; and that means that the currency-and let there be no mistake, for it is currency-in the Mother Counl be abtry has doubled itself without any in crease, in gold backing or the circulation of gold. Every banker, if he speaks the the truth , will say that those cheques and an bills are just the same as golden soveo r reigns or notes in the people's pocket. What is the question that naturally arises as when we talk of checking a run upon a Whether the Treasurer has a backing of 25 per cent, or 50 per cent., he will have no guarantee that there will not be a m u ; and if there is a run, he cannot meet it . It is no use permittingourselves to remain in a fool's paradise. do not quarrel with the view of the honourable member for Wide Bay or of to the Treasurer, but I am assuming that 0 as, indeed, I do not think he would. If we can do in Australia what the Bank of of England could not do, we are very clever. I favour the view that the Act should remain as it is, because I do not believe in a note circulation without a . gold backing. Nobody knows better than a Labour member that, if there be any interference with the currency, the whole of the loss falls on the shoulders of the working classes. This is a fact that h demonstrated by every financial panic in the Old Countrv and in America; and if London I had time to give the history of the Bankers' panics of the nineteenth century, I could Clearances. show that the brunt is always borne by that section of the community which we £ £ £ are supposed to represent only- a suppo7,575,000,000 sition, by the way, which has no founda7,491,000,000 tion in truth . Under the circumstances, we, of all men, should be the last to in terfere with the currency with a light heart. W hy should such a crash as we 10,029,000,000 had in 1893 not occur again? 10,120.000.000 10,564,000,000 Mr WEST - Not with a note issue 12,288,000,000 from a National Bank! 12,711,000,000 12,730,000,000 Mr ARCHIBALD - We must recog12,120,000.000 nise that the Commonwealth Bank is not 13,525,000,000 doing a large amount of business, com14,659,000.000 pared with the entire husine<& transacted 14,614,000,000 in the community. What are the banks 15,962,000,000 of Australia doing? Bankers are dealers in credit, and they must deal, not in dead of gold, securities, but in live securities. I have on former occasions asked whether the securities of the banks today are live dead. If they are live, they are all but if they are dead, a smash must come; and, as sure as the sun shines, a smash will come at some time. This is shown the history of banking from the Greeks the present time. The large financial sociations we have all over Australia in dead securities; and that is a perfectly legitimate, and, I believe, profitable ness, against which I have not a word say. But we must remember that those corporations are not banking institutions. Assuming that what occurred in 1893 curs again, what then? There will be a rush, and the banks will close their doors; and it is likely there will be a rush on the Treasury. If so, whether the reserve be 40 per cent, or 25 per cent., we not be able to allay it . There is only one way to allay a panic, and that is way adopted in 1893. Fortunately for New South Wales there was in that State, Mr Dibbs, who was Premier, who declared notes a legal tender; and America. this declaration stopped the rush. The Bank of England is the model which I Americashould like to seethe Gommonwealth Bank follow, not this year, or next year, or even in this generation, but, it may be, when we have all passed away, and there are other legislators in our places. discount The sooner we have a bank that will exer9 cise a steadying influence on the community the better for us all, and, especially, the better for the great mass of the workreduced ing classes. What has been the history the of the Bank of England ? That bank was and the securities at over ^30,000,000. started immediately after the revolution universal in 1688. That revolution was brought is about by the commercial people of Engever. land, because Charles II . stole all the money out of the Exchequer and out of firms the M in t, as he would have stolen any of thing he could lay his hands on. Monon tague, who was one of the ablest statestaken men of all England's great statesmen, and who had to do with the founding about of the Bank of England, gave the nnd Government's banking business to that the institution, and thisresulted in a notes certain charter being extended to the of bank. It is perfectly true that the bank had to suspend specie payment durissue ing the Peninsular War, but it is not to all the credit of any Englishman to cast any once reflection on the bank on that account. They were hard and troublesome days for Government our forefathers, but they managed to get through them.. In consequence of runs of Mr Archibald. or on the Bank of England from time to right, time, Sir Robert Peel amended the charter, giving power, in the event of a run, to suspend the charter with the by sanction of the British Government,, to and so make their notes a legal tender. as I wish now to refer to the great smash deal of 1857. I am in favour of a gold reserve ranging from 25 per cent, to 33 per busicent., but a reserve of 50 per cent, would to not guarantee the Commonwealth at all times and under all conditions. We must find out other ways of getting over the ocdifficulties caused by a panic. On page 79 of the Commercial Crises of the Nineteenth Century, by Hyndman, are a few sentences which show the state of trade shall in the Mother Country in 1857. We hear a great deal of America as the only the place where they know anything of banking, but the Bank of England has never had to appeal to the Government for and help, except because of a smash in The vibrations that cause trouble elsewhere have their origin in On the occurrence 'of a succession of bankruptcies, the Bank of England found itself exposed to a drain of its gold to Scotland, Ireland, and America, which rushed its rate of up in hot haste from 6 per cent, on the 8th October to 8 per cent, on the igth, to per cent, on the 5th of November, 10 per cent, on the 10th, and 12 per cent, on the i8th. On the n t h November the banking department was to ^1,462,153, and its securities held against advances amounted to ^26,113,453. On iSth its reserve fund stood at ^'1,552,686, The panic which set in at this juncture it needless to describe. All the now familiar features were reproduced on a larger scale than Money seemed likely to become unattainable at any price, and ruin stared even wealthy in the face. It is said that the great firm Overend, Gurney, and Company, of whom more will be heard later on, threatened failure their own part unless some steps were at once to give them immediate accommodation. Such a failure at such a time would have involved ruin to so many, and would have brought such widespread terror, that the governor directors prayed the Government to suspend Bank Act 1844, and permit the issue of bank in excess of the amount of bullion to support them. This was permitted on the evening 12th November, on condition lhat the bank rate was maintained at 10 per cent. An over of ^1,000,000 followed, and, in spite of gloomy foreoasts, the financial situation at began to improve. Thus, for the second lime since its enactment thirteen years before, had the Bank Act of 1844 to be suspended and securities to be transferred from the banking to the issue department of the Bank of England in order to forestall a total collapse : credit. Uiider exceptional circumstances like those of 1893, no gold reserve could prevent trouble. Should such a crisis recur, the Treasurer of the day, after consulting the leading bankers of Australia, and ascertaining the true 'financial position, should, I think, declare notes to be legal tender for a time, and thus prevent a rush on the banks. The currency that has been created by means of cheques and bills has to be reckoned with. wasting time in dealing with a proposal like that before us; it would be better to devote attention to the possibility of strengthening the Commonwealth Bank. The control of the note issue should.be a function of the Commonwealth Bank, which we should try to build up on the lines of the Bank of England. It may be said that a gold reserve of 40 per cent, would give a better guarantee against panics, but my reply is that, under normal trading conditions, there should be very little fluctuation.",26
190,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Our production fluctuate to the extent of £50,000.000 in a year. - Mr ARCHIBALD - O u r seasons, taking the Commonwealth as a whole, are regular. We have our wool, wheat, sugar, mineral, and other productions to rely on. In Canada, there is a big run on the banks each year to provide for the shifting of. the wheat crop, but there is no similar run on the banks here. It must membered, however, that we have to depend largely on ourselves for our supply of gold. In 1891, when the Bank of England was last in a tigh t corner, it did not apply to the Government for assistance, but got the Bank of Erance to send over bullion by the night m a i l ; and it is common for the Bank of England, the Bank of France, and the Bank at Berlin to help each other in this way. But in a time of emergency, where will Australia get its gold?",29
191,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,The Labour party drove gold out of the country by instituting paper money.,29
192,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"What is a note issue of £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 in comparison with the total trade of this community ? It is a mere nothing. The bankers made a fuss about it to deceive the public. They exaggerated the effect 'of the note issue for their own interests, and in the interest of the party opposite, .whose members are their allies and supporters.",29
193,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Then the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank was wrong when he said that the financial stringency had been increased by the driving out of gold.,29
194,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"If you took only Is. out of circulation it would affect the commerce of the country, but not to an extent that is worth taking into consideration. The creation of a big national bank is of more importance, and such a bank We are will be created when the Conservative party has become patriotic enough to see that currency "" and banking are matters too serious to be treated as ordinary party questions. The ' mercantile and commercial interests suffer at a time of financial trouble, but the working classes suffer more. Something should be done to provide for exceptional occurrences. In the Old Country, everything turns on the bank rate of discount. When the rate rises, the money market becomes tight. The same thing happens here. I find no faul t witli may the bankers as bankers, and their opinions on financial matters are entitled to our consideration and respect.",29
195,Mr BAMFORD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Onl y when they agree to overdrafts.,29
196,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"The granting of overdrafts is a matter of business, and if a banker does not properly secure his advances it is so much the worse for his bank. I have heard complaints against be rebankers for raising the discount rate, and calling in money. It is the business of a bank, when the gold is flowing out of a country, to attract it in again, and it can do so only by increasing the price it is asking for advances, and then the gold will come in and the security will flow out. There are some very curious features about' the currency business. As a matter of fact, a little while ago, there was more gold in Australia, relatively speaking, than there was in the Old Country. At that time, you could get a d r a ft on London practically at par, but you could not buy a d r a ft on Australia in London on the same terms. We hear, from in terested people who are very anxious to bolster up their own interests, statements about the country going to the dogs, but it is our business, as trustees for the people of the Commonwealth, to study the people's interests, and it is very seldom that public interests are the same as p r i - vate interests. We have a legitimate note currency backed by gold. It is of no use quoting any of the currencies of the world that are not so backed. issued £20,000,000 worth if notes without a gold backing we should then find that a depreciation of would naturally follow. must have an efficient gold ing, and it is our bounden duty to put our finances, our banking', and our currency on a sound basis. When we see the business that is done in Great by the Bank of England on the gold reserve that it has, we must admit margin of from 25 per cent, to 33 per cent, now established in Australia sound one, and warrants the confidence of every man and woman in the community. As the honourable member for Wide Bay showed, even the bankers themselves, when they found that "" this their craft"" was not in danger, ceased their cry of "" Great is Diana of the Ephesians."" When they found they could not block the legislation of the late Government, they began, as sensible and intelligent men, to admit that the reserves established today by law and practice, are sufficient to insure the welfare of the community. In these circumstances, the Bill will be ignominiously as quickly as possible. We in this House should be very careful of what we are doing. We have no right to allow any feeling of doubt to be created in the minds of the people of the Commonwealth; if this Bill means anything, it means that there is an element of doubt. strongly complain of the absence of information in the speeches made, on the Ministerial side in this debate. the loose, slipshod speeches that I ever heard, the speech of the Treasurer, his references to finance and was the worse. He ought to have given the House-and I hope he will do it before it is too late-the value of the clearances in the clearing-houses of the Commonwealth. He ought to have backed his Bill up with that information, and not have attempted to draw analogies circumstances that exist in Europe, which there is no analogy at all. only analogy in the cases that he 'referred to was that of the Mother Country, and then he carefully avoided any reference to the Bank Charter Act of Sir Robert; Peel. Let the Government play any political tricks they like in regard to preference to unionists, electoral reform, or other matters, but let us not create an element of doubt as to the soundness of Mr Archibald. If we our currency, or of the gold backing behind it , in the minds of the working men and women of Australia. To the comthe notes mercial man and the business man his The notes cheque-book represents his currency, but back- these notes are the currency of the mass of the people. They have every reason to feel the greatest confidence in the present note issue, and Britain that confidence must not be shaken. I challenge any one in the House, or oub that'the of it , to deny that the bank note of the Commonwealth of Australia is equal in is a security and in value to the bank note of the Bank of England.  be pleased to take up the last challenge thrown out by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. At present, about £9,247,179 worth of Australian bank notes are issued by the Treasury, and, of this amount, £4,835,997 worth is held by the banks. We have in circulation £4,411,182 worth. According to the honourable member for Hindmarsh £2,500,000 worth of gold is .quite suflicient reI hope serve to hold against that issue; but, kicked out if the banks turned round and presented the £4,835,997 worth of notes which they hold to the Treasury, and demanded gold for them, how would they be paid when the Treasury has only £2,500,000 worth but of gold to do it with? How, then, can the honourable member have the audacity 1 must to tell the country that these are the safest notes on the face of the earth ? Of course, the banks would not present the Of all notes in that way, because it is their business to keep the finances of the Commonwith wealth on a stable basis for their own currency, protection, and for the protection of trade generally. To show the wisdom of the Treasurer in introducing this Bill , he proposes to provide £3,997,000 worth of gold to protect the present issue of £9,247,000 worth of. notes. As the actual value of the notes in circulation from among the public is a little over with £4,000,000, the Treasurer will have a The gold reserve nearly equal to that amount. His suggestion is, therefore, a very prudent one, and the Treasury will be amply protected against any rush, provided, of course, that the banks hold back the amount of notes which they now keep in their tills. The honourable member for Hindmarsh said the currency of the country must have a certain amount of gold backing, and told us a good deal about the clearing-house system in the Old Country, but 'we have just as good a clearinghouse system here as they have at Home. In the Sydney or Melbourne' clearing house each of the banks put in £100,000 ingold in my time, and I presume the amount is about the same now. It is not the turnover that matters, but rather the gold held for the difference, which we call exchange. In other words, we do not require to hold a gold reserve for the turnover, but we require to hold it for the difference. ""We have not this gold reserve so far as the note issue is concerned. I followed this matter very closely, and remember that money was never so plentiful as it was just before the notes were issued, some, two years ago or, perhaps, more. People could get any amount of accommodation from the banks, and I recollect attending a big land sale in the Cowra district, and seeing a number of bankers from various parts' urging people to accept accommodation from their respective banks. Since these notes were issued, however, mpney seems to have been mopped up. We have never had a greater scarcity of money in Australia, especially in New South Wales, than has been the case since the Commonwealth notes were issued.",29
197,Mr WEST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"What rot!  statement, it is for me to give reasons for it. First of all, the banks had an average circulation of £4,000,000 worth of notes.",31
198,Mr WEST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"There is a stringency in Canada today.  in Australia, especially in New South Wales, and I can trace that tendency to the very month when the Commonwealth notes were issued. You caunot blind the eyes of the Australian public or of the farmers or others who want financing, because they know from actual experience that this has really occurred. The States drew in revenue, by means of a 2 per cent, tax on the old issue of bank notes, a sum of £80,000 a year. The Fisher Government compelled the banks to withdraw their notes in circulation under threat of a penalty of 10 per cent., with the result that they had to find gold in lieu of the £4,000,000 worth of notes. In addition, he forced about £6,000,000 worth of notes on to the banks. Therefore, they had to find something like £10,000^000 of gold out of their treasury, and that amount, consequently, was withdrawn from circulation. The banks were crippled, and the country was crippled as a consequence.",31
199,Mr WEST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"They had the notes on thecounter in place of the gold.  their own notes from circulation, and they had to hold a large amount of Commonwealth notes in addition.",31
200,Mr BAMFORD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"The scarcity of currency was merely a coincidence.  sioned by the withdrawal of money from circulation by the issue of the Australian notes. The banks were lending money at 5 per cent., and afterwards it was difficult to borrow it at 7 per cent, or 8 per cent. Money was never scarcer than subsequent to our note issue. I suggest to the honourable member for Hindmarsh that it would be a good plan to follow ou the lines of the Bank of England. I have the Banking Record, giving the latest figures, and they show that the Bank of England, while it has notes in circulation to the value of £28,628,000, has gold to the value of £35,566,000.",31
201,Mr BAMFORD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"That is also held against current accounts.  friends over and over again have told us that the Australian banks of issue had only 5s. behind every £ 1 note, whereas, as a matter of fact, the Australian banks have £32,788,278, and the New Zealand banks an additional £5,334,422; so that there would be £8 behind every note in circulation.",31
202,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"But there is nearly £60,000,000 deposited on current account in Australian banks.  because, so far as Victoria is concerned, the notes are a first charge on the assets of a bank.",31
203,Mr BAMFORD,FEDERAL TERRITORY,It was not so in 1893.,31
204,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"It was not so until the banks became insolvent in Victoria, and then the notes were made a first charge on assets, provided there were no mortgages or liens.  Victoria to make the bank notes a first charge, it was quite possible to have them made a first charge throughout Australia ; and if the Labour party are as earnest about the inatter as we are, it is possible for us to make that provision now. It should be done. Then for every note in circulation, there would be £ 8 in gold in the vaults of the banks, which would be far better than the 6s. 8d. now proposed. We have heard a great deal about the panic in 1893. I was in a bank in a' New South Wales town on that occasion, and there was not a single person who, to my knowledge, lost a shilling through not getting notes cashed. After about - A fortnight or tliree weeks the banks honoured their notes.",31
205,Mr WEST,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"You must have been in a, hollow log, or asleep.  was in a banking chamber at the time. Mr S. J. Clements, a well-known storekeeper of Blayney, came to me and said, '' The banks are closed, what about accepting bank notes at face value-d o you think I would be justified in doing so?'.' I assured him that he would, and he accepted all the notes at face value, selling goods for them.",32
206,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Did not the Premier of New South Wales go security for those notes?  that step taking place. These were the notes of the Australian Joint Stock Bank and the Commercial Bank, the only two doing business in Blayney. When the banks opened, Mr Clements paid in the notes he had to his credit, and he received 20s. in the £1 for them. The same thing might have taken place throughout the State. I admit some people were victimized, because they became frightened. A great statesman has said that any man who introduces a State paper currency does not bring lasting honour on himself, nor contribute to the stability of his country. We have the past experience of other nations to show the absurdity of introducing a State paper currency. During the French Revolution, assignats were issued to the value of 45,500 million francs; but Carlyle points out a number of instances, showing the real worth of these assignats. A gentleman, having hired a cab. and asked the cabby what the cab hire was, the cabby replied "" Two thousand livres."" In other words, assignats to the value of £100 represented an ordinary cab fare. In another instance, a man went into a cafe and ordered a cup of coffee, for which he was charged 1,600 livres. Notes to the value of £80 represented the price of a cup of coffee. We have, also, the history of the American States to guide us in the matter. The Leader of the Opposition has said, ""Have we not the resources of the whole of the Commonwealth to back up this note issue?"" The French people said the same thing; but, in the end, their notes were not worth printer's ink. . Mr Reymond, an old French gentleman living in Forbes, and an ex-member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, told me recently that, when he was a boy, he visited his grandfather in Paris, and in a lumber-room discovered a big packet of notes tied up in red-tape, and, thinking he had a tremendous haul, he rushed down to his grandfather, but the grandfather said, "" You can take them up again, or throw them in the fire; they are not worth the printer's ink."" These were the assignors that ruined thousands of people in France. The cruel part of the matter was that the French Republic actually passed a law by which a man could not discriminate against these assignats. He could not sell his wares cheaper for gold or paper; he had to charge a fixed price; and if he was found breaking the law in this regard, he was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for the first offence, twenty years for the second offence, and to the guillotine for the third offence. The notes were legal tender, and inconvertible. Our friends opposite say that the Australian notes are legal tender and inconvertible.",32
207,Mr ATKINSON,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"They are legal tender, but they are convertible.",32
208,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"If we do not keep enough in reserve, they are inconvertible.",32
209,Mr HOWE,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"But there is enough; that is the point.  drastic laws, and despite the' wealth of the nation, the assignats were not worth the paper they were printed on. America had a similar experience. They started on very solid ground, and actually had a sovereign for every note issued; bin;, in 1861, the reserve was reduced to 90 per cent.; in*1862, it stood at 40 per cent.; and in the following year it was down as low as 6 per cent.; and the value of the "" greenbacks,"" as they were called, was something like 6s. 8d. in the £ 1 . I now wish to call attention to what some political economists have to say on the matter of exchanges. Adam Smith has written largely on the subject, but I have a quotation from Ricardo which I think is very much to the point, and which, I understand, is repeated by M ill . as follows: If, by the general operations of commerce, io millions of pounds sterling, of a known weight and fineness of bullion, should be the portion of England, and io millions of paper pounds were substituted, no effect would be produced on the exchange; but if by the abuse of the power of issuing paper money, n millions of pounds should be employed in the circulation, the exchange would be g per cent, against England ; if 12 millions were employed, the exchange would be 16 per cent.; and if 20 millions, the exchange would be 50 per cent, against England. Thus, with 25 per cent, of gold behind our notes, the exchange against Australia would be something like 75 per cent. T have no desire to labour this question. I have ouly to say that I hope most sincerely that the Bill will be carried, and that the Opposition will join with us in voting for sound .finance in Australia.",32
210,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Melbourne) [5.21] I shall not occupy the attention of the House at any length, but some of the statements that have been made during this debate are really so extraordinary that I feel justified in answering them. Has' any honourable member any idea of the weight of the gold behind our present note issue? Our note issue weighs 10 tons ; there are 9 tons of bank notes in circulation, and we have in our Treasury 30 tons of gold behind them; yet the Treasurer greedily asks for more. should not object to such a demand if the Commonwealth had the liabilities of the private banks. The Commonwealth Bank at the present time, however, has no debits of any extent in respect of current accounts. The liability of the Government relates only to the note issue. When the Australian Notes Bill was before this House some time ago, a prominent member of the present Ministry saidAs to the proposed reserve, I think that 25 per cent, of gold should be sufficient, but it might be better to make it a little larger at first, as probably, as the public become used to Ihem. gold vvill be less in demand.",33
211,Mr FALKINER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Who wrote that prescription 1,33
212,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"I shall reply to the honourable member by saying that I know .of no chemist who could make it up. W it h a note issue of £7,000,000, and a gold reserve of 25 per cent., we would have in our safes gold amounting to £1,750,000, and weighing not less than 1.3.8 tons. W it h an issue of £10,000,000, It is our gold reserves under this proposal would amount to £4,775,000, or a higher percentage than any banking company in the world holds at the present time. The banks of a country may have in their vaults gold in excess of the face value of the notes issued by them, but that gold is held to secure, not only the note issue, but all their deposits. We know, from our experience in the terrible crash which followed the collapse of the boom, that the assets of a bank as shown on paper are largely in excess of the amount that can be realized. If we had a note issue of £15,000,000-and that would not be extraordinary, judging by the enormous expansion which has taken place in the note issue of the United States of America-w e would need 65 per cent, of gold, and with an issue of £20,000,000 it would be necessary to have a gold reserve of 73^ per cent. Can the Treasurer point to any bank or any community that requires a gold reserve of 73$ per cent, to secure a note issue of £20,000,000 ? The quotation that I read a few moments ago was from a speech delivered in this House on the 19 th August, 1910, and reported on page 1S43 of Hansard for that year, by the present Treasurer, and, in view of the statement which he then made, he will , no doubt, vote against the second reading of T. this Bill . I have tried again and again to nail down the misstatement so often made that the notes issued by the banks were a first charge upon their assets. That is an absolute fabrication.",33
213,Mr ATKTNSON,FEDERAL TERRITORY,They were for some years.,33
214,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"The honourable member for Calare made that statement this afternoon under a misapprehension. He could not have taken the trouble to read the Victorian Banks and Currency Act , from which I am about to make a quotation, or he would not have made such a statement. A dozen legal men of high standing in this city agree with the construction that I place upon the section of the Act that I am about to read. The present Warden of the University Senate agrees with my construction of it , and so does Mr Godfrey, a solicitor of standing in this city, who has been a bank director for many years, while the late member for Bendigo, Sir John Quick, wben I chalago, lenged him in this House some time ago, could not deny that it was correct. Secare tion 12 of the Victorian Banks and rency Act provides thatNotes payable to bearer at sight or on demand Australia. issued in Victoria by any banking company firm or individual banker in the hands bond fide holder - thereof for value who has received the same in the ordinary course of busiBank. ness without notice that the same have been issued or dealt with contrary to the provisions not. of this Act and has not subsequently dealt with the same otherwise than in the ordinary of business shall in the event and I come now to the important part of such company being wound up or such or banker being insolvent or bankrupt be charge on the assets in Victoria of such firm or banker not being the subject of mortgage pledge lien charge or other security in favour of any other creditor.",33
215,Mr ATKINSON,FEDERAL TERRITORY,Surely bullion would uot be mortgaged?,34
216,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"The honourable member, with the usual tenacity of lawyer, is trying tc raise a quibble. Could not bullion be made answerable to a lien or mortgage? This section was drawn up by legal men to make the position of banks secure, and it will be seen that i a farce to say that prior to the establishductive ment of the Commonwealth Bank the notes of the private banks in this State were a first charge on their assets. Again, are any one in Victoria could establish a and swindle the people out of thousands. Section 14 of this Act declared thatNo banking company firm or individual banker £980,000; shall issue notes payable to bearer at sight or on demand unless such company or firm has scribed capital of not less than Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds and a paid-up capital of not less than One hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds or unless such individual banker has a Capital of not less than hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds, anv company firm or banker issuing notes conment hold trary to the provisions of this section liable to a penalty amounting to Twenty-five pounds per centum bf the amount of the notes so issued, to be recoverable with f u l suit by any person who may sue for the same. That section allowed notes to be issued monwealth by any banking company or individual with assets worth presumably £125,000. Tliere was no limit t.o the issue of notes. They could have been issued in millions.",34
217,Mr FALKINER,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"The banks kept from 48 to 53 per cent, of gold reserves.",34
218,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"There was no requirement under the Victorian The words used by Henry Clay, in Congress nearly three-quarters of a century that never in the history of the world has a cent been lost in a National Bank, as true today as they were then. The CurCommonwealth Bank, is guaranteed by every hill, valley, dale, and river in",34
219,Mr CONROY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,But our note issue is not of any under the control of the Commonwealth,34
220,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"I am glad that it is It is under the control of the course Government of the Commonwealth, which is firmer and stronger than any bank. The record of the crisis to which I firm have referred was found in ruined a first homes and robbed widows and children; company and three friends of my own comany mitted suicide owing to the deb dele. We are told in Hyndman's Crises of the Nineteenth Century that booms occur, on the average, every fifteen years; and I believe that we here are on the way to a boom at the present time. Up to June a last, there were two and. a half times more buildings erected this year in the suburbs of Melbourne than there were in the same period at the boom time. All the the money that is lent out by the Comt is monwealth Government is spent on reproworks, and the security is undeniable. According to the Treasurer's statement, State Government securities represented by New South Wales funded stock, £1,000,000; and is there bank any honourable member who can point to any better security in the world I Victorian Government debentures represent Western Australian stock, a sub- £650,000; Western Australian Treasury bills, £100,000; inscribed stock of Tasmania-that .bonnie little island, blessed by God but cursed by man in its governOne ment in the past-£500,000 . On fixed and deposit, the New . South Wales Govern£800,000, £200,000, and shall be four sums of £100,000; Queensland, £840,000; the Brisbane Bank, £25,000; l costs of and the Launceston Bank, £25,000. These, with fixed deposits in the ComBank, amount to a total of £5,720,000 advanced on assets superior to those held by any. banking company in the world. Even the United States of America, with its £317,000,000 worth of gold and silver coinage,- cannot show superior assets. These advances bring in a revenue of £216,600, which is earsuch marked, and which, on the 30th Aet. June, 1913, will represent a sum of £365,107. I look forward in the early future, say, in ten years, to a currency of £20,000,000; and does the Treasurer think that his successor of that day will suggest that 73 per cent, of the note issue shall be backed by gold? Why, it would take 116 lorries, each drawing 1 ton of gold, to move the reserve from one .building to another. Where is the "" sink-hole"" of gold today? Every sbip which leaves this country for Hong Kong, Calcutta, Bombay, or Japan, takes away gold, either in sovereigns or bullion. The European steamers that go to the Homeland carry gold to Ceylon, where it is distributed; and the words are as true today as when they were uttered by . George Francis Train, in 1854-5, that the East is the "" sink-hole "" of gold. Only once in my reading have I seen it stated that gold has been exported from China to England, and that was when that country had to pay the terrible indemnity of £11,000,000 to Japan. The Treasurer has only to consult the Secretary to the Treasury to learn that the whole of the gold currency in the world would not pay for one month's transactions on the New York stock exchange alone. It was credit that for 600 years carried on the Bank of Venice-a h institution which failed only when the army of France took possession. Yet in these days, with securities superior to those of any bank, we' are asked to sanction this immense gold reserve in the case of the Commonwealth note issue. The Bank of England, which many think the richest in the world, is, after all, only a private company, and not nearly so rich as the Bank of France; but, in consequence of giving a loan to the Government, the Bank of England has the privilege of issuing the only note in London. The first banking community in the world is the Treasury of the United States of America, and the National Banks,- with close on £355,000,000 in gold and silver as a reserve. Next, as is shown in the New Dictionary of Statistics, is the Bank of France, with £162,900,000; and then come the Russian State £115,400,000; the Bank of Austria-Hungary, £60,600,000; the Imperial Bank of Germany, £51,600,000; the Bank of Spain, £42,600,000; the Bank of Italy-even poor, little Italy shows more gold and silver in its coffers than does the Bank of England-£40,300,000 ; and, last, the Bank of England, £39,400,000. The Bank of England, for twenty-two years, never paid its notes in gold. Three times was it on the verge of insolvency, and was >-aved by the Bank of France, the Imperial Bank of Germany, and the Imperial Bank of Eussia. The bank would have failed in the Baring crisis, when Lord Rothschild took the chair at a meeting, not caring, perhaps, whether or not the rival firm went to the wall so long as he saved his own great banking concern. However, that great banking concern has disappeared, and there is now no European combination to equal the Rothschilds. It is said that the financial policy of the Commonwealth Parliament has robbed the private bauKS. At one time in Australia there ->vere forty-two different banks of issue, each with their different currency of njtes, ranging from £1 to £100. The only alteration that has been made by the Commonwealth note issue is that represented by the 10s. note. Here I may say that it is very difficult to get those 10s. notes in any of the private banks; and, to my knowledge, on one occasion the note could only be secured by a client on his threatening to remove his account. I suggest that the central post-offices might be allowed to hold a few of those notes, so that the people might know where to get them. This would be a great advantage, because to register a 10s. note costs no more than would a 10s. postal order, and there are other advantages. With only one note issue we know that it is far easier to detect forgery, as is shown in the case of the Bank of England, which never re-issues its notes. When I was for five years in the Colonial Bank, sound, dirty, and smellful notes were issued and re-issued; and that is most undesirable. At the time of the boom in Victoria I suggested that there should be a State issue; and in collecting evidence on the point I one day stopped twelve men on the Block in Melbourne, all of whom had notes in their pockets, but not one of whom could say, without looking at them, which banks had issued them-. Indeed, Bank, on one occasion, when I sent a ten-dollar note of the Chinese Republic to the loadslady of one of the smart city hotels, in order to let her see what it was like, she, to my astonishment, changed it , and handed me ten sovereigns. To show how; careless people really are, I may say that the notes of the Provincial and Suburban Bank were in currency for twenty years or more after it had ceased to exist. The misfortunes of human beings should never benefit other human beings, and, in the case of burnt or lost notes, the advantage enough. should go to the community. If the Government have decided to push this measure to the extreme, there ought to be an honourable understanding that, until the note issue goes beyond £10,000,000, a serve of 30 per cent, shall be considered sufficient. To me, a gold reserve of 47 per cent, is ridiculous. What the Treasurer said when the note issue was first proposed is true today, but we are not now at the beginning of things in this matter. We have got over the first rough portion of the journey, and the note issue is now close upon £10,000,000. Those who go into the matter carefully will see that there is no need for the large reserve proposed. Can any honourable member point to any bank in the world that has such splendid assets as those behind our note issue ?  has all assets and no liabilities; its advances are not liberal enough. .",34
221,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"I agree with the honourable member. But I resent the statement that the Government has taken away opportunities from the banks. What we have done is to give the people a secure note. We insist now that every one who uses a note must pay in gold for it, so that no one may be robbed, as in the past. I join with the Treasurer in ment is so established. his good wishes for our system of banking and note issue, but I think that those who have studied the history of credit will not vote for such a foolish measure as I consider the Bill to be. > Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [5.56] The introduction of this Bill is an indication that the Liberal party has lost faith in the country; I cannot conceive of any other reason for proposing to increase the backing to our note issue. The honourable member for Melbourne has shown what the Treasurer thought about this matter in 1910. The Treasurer said then that a backing of 25 per cent, was sufficient, though at the commencement a - little more might be needed. But we have now had nearly three years', experience of the note issue. I said in the beginning that I considered the late Treasurer somewhat conservative. He instituted the note issue in 1910, but two years later introduced a Bill to reduce, the gold reserve behind the note issue to not less than 25 per cent. In making that proposal he had, no doubt, in mind the statement made by the present Treasurer that a reserve of 25 per cent, was There is no country ""in the world whose resources are so great, or whose people are so prosperous as .are those of Australia. What is needed in banking is confidence. If we have conre- fidence, our institutions, banking and other-, will go on swimminglv. It is the lack of confidence which creates panic.",36
222,Mr FLEMING,FEDERAL TERRITORY,That is when you want the coin.,36
223,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL TERRITORY,"Yes , but it has been shown in the history of Australia that the credit of a State is sufficient to restore public confidence when the Government announces its intention to stand behind the banks. It is useless to go far back into history to ascertain what was done by the French or by the early American Colonies, because our circumstances are entirely different from theirs. The government of the world was never so stable as it is today. The great countries of the world enjoy nowadays government much more stable than any government ever was before. Consequently a comparison between present-day conditions and those which existed when communities were in a formative stage are useless. The Government of the Argentine today is quite a different thing from the Government of the Argentine forty or fifty years ago. To-day it is on stable lines, and there can be no fear when a govern- The late Mr. G. B. Edwards was opposed to me in politics, but it will be generally admitted that there never was a member of this House so well qualified to speak on currency questions as he was. He supported the note issue at every stage, and I wish to make a short quotation from his remarks regarding it . He said I take it to be almost axiomatic that a paper currency, without an ounce of gold backing, made a definite legal tender, and not issued in excess of the requirements of the community for whose service it is issued, can never fail. There is a consensus of opinion that when Mr Edwards discussed questions or this character he was listened to With the closest attention, and that the words that fell from his lips were words of wisdom. I remember sitting with him on the Ministerial bench, when he pointed to the opposite side of the Chamber, where the metnbers of his party were seated, and said, "" I cannot conceive wliy those men. are opposed to such a fine national measure as this."" In the course of his remarks he quoted the opinion of Mr. Russell French, the general manager of the Bank of New South Wales, one of the most competent authorities on currency and banking, though one who, I should say-thoug h I know him only by repute-consistentl y opposes most of the measures of the Labour party. Mr. Edwards saidVery shortly after the big bank crisis, Mr. Russell French said, among otber thingsWhen abnormal conditions, such as periods of crisis, supervene, the Act of Parliament by which the issue is authorized has to be suspended in order to do away for the time being lations which prevent expansion. This indicates that, when a note issue or Currency is in the hands of a responsible Government, it is a wise thing to expand your paper currency to relieve financial stringency. A ll that is wanted is to re-establish the confidence of the people. I remember reading speeches by Mr Robert Harper in the State Parliament after the great collapse in the early nineties. One of the strong points that he made was the absolute necessity,, in a community like this, for a strong central institution. He said, "" It is not so much coin you want as confidence. When you have confidence you can give credit."" Mr Russell French went on to advocate the issue of Federal notes to become part of the securities held by the banks, and said, furtherSuch a note, having Federal sanction, and resting, apart from the coin basis, on the credit of the whole Federation That is the point many honourable members'seem to miss in discussing this question. The credit of the whole Federation is behind the note issue. If there was not a single gold coin behind it, I should have just as much confidence in it, so long as the Federal Government had charge of it. No matter what Government was in power, so far as internal trade was concerned, I would just as soon have a Federal Bank pound note as a sovereign. I have always said that, so long as the note was made legal tender and backed by the Government, it did not matter so much about the gold reserve. Mr Russell French continueswould be a wJiolly satisfactory circulatory medium in ordinary times and for ordinary purposes of business, and would serve as a bulwark of no insignificant strength to resist and overcome the results of panic. . . . as a practical consideration, it can scarcely be denied that a uniform note system common to the federated colonies would conduce in some degree to the convenience of the public, and would be much more cheaply administered in the matter of working expenses. Mr Edwards commented on thatThat is a big admission to get from one of the most prominent banking officials in Australia. The late Mr W. E. Gladstone, who, it was said, could make the dry subject of finance most attractive to his hearers, when speaking on the Bank Charter Act, as far back as 1866, saidA l l the profits of the bank note issue belong to the State, and what is more important than the profits, the responsibility of issue belongs to with the rigid regu- the State. Even the strongest critic of a State note issue cannot deny that Mr Gladstone was an authority upon finance. I should like to read to the House the views of Senator Aldrich, of the United States of America. He is one of the most eminent financial authorities of that country, and speaks strongly against the banking system as it exists there. All the leading men in banking in the United States of America are fighting for a strong, central, financial institution; their idea being to secure a system approximating to the British system, right in the centre of which stands the Bank of England. The following is the extract to which I referBanking circles in America are evincing increasing interest, it is stated, in the proposals by Senator Aldrich to establish a central bank for the United States. It is clearly recognised that some such drastic change in the monetary system of the country is imperative if the exceptional tension experienced every year at the period of crop moving is to be avoided. A .strong endorsement of Senator Aldrich's plan for monetary reform was given recently by Mr. MACVeagh, the secretary of the Treasury, in an address delivered before the Bankers' Association of Missouri and Kansas. The lecturer pointed out that the existing banking system of the United States was a disorganized mass, composed of 25,000 units, and that a central reserve association would bring them all into a workable organization. One of the things necessary to a proper banking system was a circulation always adequate and never superfluous, and another great desideratum was a reserve. The existing reserves had been established by-law with great exactitude, but they were simply fixed amounts of money in banks held in useless isolation, so that when accommodation was most needed financial facilities were not obtainable. What Senator Aldrich's scheme aims to do is to change the control of the volume of currency from thousands of separate and scattered banks to a central agency, which would represent the financial institutions as a whole, and at the same And time would protect the interests of the public"". This is infinitely preferable to dependence on the decision of over 7,000 boards of directors, who do not pretend to consider anything but the immediate orofit of their own bank. According to Brad-streets, the question of currency reform in the United States is fast approaching the region of practical politics. Nothing that I or any other honourable member could say with regard to banking and currency could be better expressed. Two of the greatest authorities in the United States of America hold that it is absolutely necessary to have a central institution to control the currency, in order to give that elasticity which is so essential, especially in times of stress. We are glad to know that the policy we have followed in Australia is endorsed by an up-to-date country like America. Perhaps the Commonwealth Bank does not meet with our approval in every particular, but it is a start, - and we shall be able to improve it as we go along. I am certain that the Commonwealth Bank, with our note issue, is going to be one of the greatest blessings that Australia ever had. The late Mr G. B. Edwards, who had studied the currency question from A to Z, advised men sitting on his own side of the House to vote for the Note Issue Bill. I hope we shall not do any more of this tinkering with good legislation. We are NA Argentine Austria-Hungary Belgium Brazil British EmpireAustralasia Canada India South Africa .. ' ..

We do not seem to think that anything we create ourselves is of any use, but must always go rushing off to copy some obher country. The man who says there is any danger in our note issue has very little faith in the Commonwealth. The Bank of England has a gold reserve of only about £40,000,000, and that includes the reserves of a great many other banks in Great Britain, yet the liabilities of those banks amount to £1,200,000,000. All the gigantic operations of commerce rest on the foundation of credit-simpl e trust and confidence, not coin. The Australian notes in circulation amount to about £4,000,000, the gold reserves in the banks throughout Australia amount to £33,000,000; yet the total liabilities of those banks are about £80,000,000. The whole of this banking business, as tliese figures show, is conducted practically on a system of credit. It is a matter of trust between bank and bank, and between the banks and the people. So long as that trust or faith is unimpaired, the course of business flows smoothly. Mr. Laughton, the Victorian Government Sta-' tist, in part V . , "" Accumulation,"" of the Victorian Year-Book for 1912-13, gives the following interesting information: NA AT THE CLOSE - OF 1910.

This table shows that there is £648,413,000 worth of uncovered paper in the world. Other countries besides our own are not particular about having a note currency without a very strong gold backing. The proposition in our Statute is perfectly safe, because the gold reserve will range between 25 per cent, and 33 per cent. If the State of Queensland could conduct a note issue for nineteen years, and no great harm come to the State, how can any great harm come to Australia in conducting its own note issue and circulation? We have to consider the great benefits that have accrued through our note issue. Owing to the wise investment of the money by the late Treasurer, the present Treasurer is in the happy position of being able to handle millions and spend them on desirable public works, and he has assured us that he intends to secure the money with which to carry out these public works from our Trust Funds, the best and most permanent of which is that associated with the note issue. ing the example of Queensland, and seeing what has been done in France and its 'semi-State institution, and also what is done in England, we should retain the measure already on our statute-book, and have f a it h and confidence in our country. W it h Australia behind the note issue, even though there were no gold reserve in the Treasury, I should have no fear, travelling anywhere with in the confines of Australia, that I should not get 20s. - i h the £ 1 for a Commonwealth note. We should not unnecessarily lock up a number of sovereigns in the Treasury safe. We should make of them - The Treasurer, however, proposes to lock away an extra million. I consider that we could at least release £1,000,000 from the 40 to 45 per cent, now lying in the gold reserve, and make some use of it . In fact, I would have no - qualms at seeing the reserve wiped out altogether, so long as the control of affairs was in the hands of a safe, honest Government. Of course, I could understand people being alarmed if we were likely to have in office a body of brigands, who would play ducks and drakes with the finances and the note issue, but when every one, independently of his politics, is interested in the stability our institutions there is no reason to fear. I do not wish to„ see the Bill before us passed. I know there is no chance of its being withdrawn, but I think the Senate will hardly spend any time considering it . The Treasurer seems to have some little scheme that he has thought of since 1910, but I trust his measure will not be passed, and that the gold reserve will remain as at present provided for, not less than 25 per cent., so that we may release some of the present reserve and make it of benefit in the construction of useful public works.",36
224,Unknown,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 745 p.m.,39
225,Mr WE ST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"East Sydney) [7.45] Having regard to the stage of the session we have reached, and to the anxiety of honourable members to return to their homes, there is not much encouragement to dilate at length upon the terms of the B i ll now before us. During the recent election campaign, I heard nothing of any intention on the part of the Liberal party, if returned to power, to mutilate the Australian Notes Act. The Treasurer, in in Followtroducing this measure, should have given us a clear indication of the intentions of the. Government. It seems, to me that they are trying to mislead the people, and, by a subterfuge, to do that which they dare not do in the open. The At torney-General today contradicted a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition, and said that, as he understood it , the Bill would not carry out what was said to be the declared intention of the Government. As it stands, it means, in my opinion, that our note issue will not be allowed to exceed £7,000,000. The Bill provides for a gold reserve of 40 per cent, up to an issue of £7,000,000, and use there is to be a sovereign in the Treasury safe for every note issued beyond that amount. I do not think that the Treasurer will be prepared to keep gold in his safes merely to be looked at. I understood that the country was satisfied with the action of the late Government in providing for a gold reserve of not less than 25 per cent., and investing all the gold held in excess of 40 per cent, of the note issue by lending it to the States, or devoting it to developmental works. So far as I and my party are concerned, there is no hope of this Bill being carried. It may pass this House, but once it leaves this Chamber, I feel sure that we shall of see it no more. I am at a loss to find any reason for the action of the Treasurer in introducing this Bill , unless it be his vanity. Most men of his age become somewhat vain, and perhaps he is anxious to have his name attached to a measure of this kind. I should have liked to see his name associated with some other Bill than one to emasculate the Notes Act. When I took an active part in the. Federal movement some years ago, I little thought that we should have in the National Parliament so many pessimists as we have in it today. plorable that there should be in House so many honourable members who have but. little faith in their own country. Anything that,, will tend to belittle tralia appears to meet with their solid support. I, on the other hand, have always had confidence in Australia, its resources, and its people, and am prepared to trust the people with a national note issue. I go further than do some of my party, since I look forward to the time wheu, with the advance of paper money will play a greater part than it does today in this island Honourable members opposite stantly referring to the history of other countries, but they seem to lose sight of the conditions prevailing in their own land. At no time in the world's history has there been more honest than exists today. The Government and their supporters appear to forget that Australia is a continent, that it has no frontier, and that it has practically no governmental transactions outside the Commonwealth. Our note issue is throughout the continent, and. I doubt whether the people worry very about the question of whether there is behind it a gold or a silver reserve. chief care is that they shall be able to get the full face value of the notes they hold or that the notes will pay their debts or obtain for them the commodities they require. We were led to believe that the Government were not anxious to introduce controversial measures, but I cannot conceive of a more contentious Bill than is this, designed, as it is, to turn down one of the best pieces of legislation ever passed by this Parliament, and recognised as well worthy of the party responsible for it. Honourable members opposite ferred again and again to what has taken place in connection with the note issues of other countries. I would remind that in Australia we have Governments conducting the public business of the people, and that if they do not conform Ur. West. to the will of the people, their political lives are but of short duration. That being so, there is no opportunity here for such . serious occurrences as honourable members opposite suggest may take place Australian in connection with a paper currency. Very little gold is used in connection with our trade. Indeed, the whole trade of Australia, like that of other parts of the world, is conducted upon credit, and as It is de- long as the credit of Australia remains this good her trade will be carried on upon credit. The value of our import trade is something like £70,000,000 per annum, Aus- but surely no one imagines that 70,000,000 sovereigns are required to conduct it . As a matter of fact, in connection with the whole of our oversea trade, not more than 500,000 sovereigns are shipped from Australia. It is true that some small shipments of gold are sent to the East, but that is in concivilization, nexion with trade done by John Chinaman - In China, as much as lOd. in excontinent. cess of the face value of the sovereign can are con- be obtained, and some of the Chinese do a nice little business in this way. A few years ago, some of the English banking institutions conducting business here used to send away small shipments of gold in government connection"" with the making up of their bank balances, but their exchanges did not amount to more than 1.00,000 sovereigns per year. That used to be the whole exchange that took place, and, therefore, there operative is actually no necessity to have a big gold reserve. I do not think that much there is any honourable member opposite who, during the whole of the Their election campaign, said anything to justify the introduction of this Bill . The notes are legal tender, and the credit of the country is behind them. We are here as directors to insure the public welfare, and we ought to see that everything is done to promote the prosperity of the country. We have been told about the wreckage that has occurred in other parts of the world where there are State note issues; but this affords no reason why we should depart from the policy laid down by the late Government. have re- There have been many great railway accidents, bub the people of Australia continue to travel on the railways. them We in Australia are establishing precedents, and our legislation, in many respects, is entirely different from that of. other nations. We are not a lot of school children. Honourable members are not, I think, so bereft of reason as not to be able to grasp and appreciate something new if it be practicable. It would appear, indeed, in the absence of any sound arguments, that nothing but vanity has prompted the Treasurer to bring up this measure. While the election campaign was in progress, the right honourable gentleman told the people of Perth that it was he who should have the credit for the note issue; and yet he now lays before us a proposal to murder it . It is this that leaves the impression on my mind that he is not serious, but that he is only giving us a little Falstaffian humour, and so endeavouring to attract the notice of the pres3. Now, however, that he has secured that notice, I hope he will put the Bill in the waste-paper basket. In his introductory speech, the Treasurer did not tell us what ""the Bill contained, but we find that it is somewhat different from what he then represented it to be. This, of course, may arise through tb"" fact that some one else drafted the Bill , and that he was in ignorance as to its provisions. When the Leader of the Opposition drew the attention of the Treasurer and the Attorney-General to certain points, neither of those gentlemen appeared to be seized of the facts. shall be traitors to the progress of our country if we pass a measure of this kind. Every State of the Commonwealth is thirsting for capital. We were told that, With the advent of the Fisher Government, capital would leave the country; but the present Government are endeavouring to prevent gold being put to ito proper use. I suppose that if I were to claim to be an authority on banking or finance, the Treasurer would tell me that I had had no experience, because I had not been the Treasurer of Australia; but however that may be, I tell the right honourable gentleman that by his proposal he would rob Australia of £120,000 a year. T.he Treasurer's first duty is to protect the revenue, and if the sum of £3,000,000 is not made to earn money, he, and those associated with him, are showing their incapacity as administrators. For three years we had men in power on whom we could rely to conduct the business of the country in a progressive way; and I am sure that the people of the country now realise the mistake they have made in returning to power, in the present Parliament, men of such weak administrative ability. During the discussion this afternoon, I feel satisfied that the Attorney-General left the chamber convinced that the Leader of the Opposition is better acquainted with this Bill than are the members of the Government, who father this very unhealthy baby. I know that this Bill will never see this Chamber again after it once leaves us, unless it comes back in a very different for m ; and, therefore, I shall try to assist to close the session by making my remarks as brief as possible. When I go back to New South Wales, where the people do understand business, I shall be able to explain the position to them more full y ; and I feel sure that the conclusions they will come to will be that there are no financial geniuses in the present Government. The note issue established by the late Government excited the admiration of the financial world, and the day is not far distant when paper currency will play a greater part than it does at present in the business world of Australia. If we could only remove the fear that people have of paper transactions in the commercial and industrial world, all that stringency which sometimes blocks progress would be removed. Future generations will realise We that there is no necessity for the doctrine that has been preached from the other side this afternoon. When that fear of which I have spoken has been removed, we shall be able to reduce poverty and secure greater happiness in the lives of our people. This, however, will require a process of education. When I , and others, some twenty-five years ago decided that we would enter Parliament, even if we had to wear our hob-nailed boots and bowyangs, we were laughed at, but, as a matter of fact, the ablest administrators of the country have been found in that class to which I myself belong. When the people realise this, many of their fears will be removed. Millions are transmitted between the Old Country and this new world in the southern seas without any movement of gold or other metal, and numberless financial transactions take place in the commercial world which depend wholly on paper. There are honourable members in this House who write out cheques for £500 or £600, and, perhaps, larger sums, and no gold passes at all, the whole transaction resting on credit. Thousands of pounds pass and repass in this way on what are practically IOTJ's. The hill system is merely a paper credit system.",39
226,Mr BOTD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"There was an Irishman who, when he gave a bill, used to say "" Thank God, that debt's paid! """,42
227,Mr WEST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Irishme n have said some very sensible things, and if my honourable friend had more of the Irishman in him he might be better. There seems to be too much anxiety on the part of honourable members opposite to decry Australia; but members of this Parliament should rise above that sort of thing. I hope that those who cannot do so will, on the next occasion, be rejected by the electors. More optimistic views should be taken of Australia's finances. I have always taken large views. As a representative of the people,-1 feel that is one's duty to instil confidence, into the community. We should not suggest that we have no confidence in the country. At the beginning, a 40 per cent, gold reserve was very rightly proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, but, personally, I should be willing to let the whole £10,000,000 received for the notes be used for the good of the State. The action of the Leader of the Opposition in keeping a large reserve until after the elections was wise, because it created confidence in the note issue. But now that the people understand what has been done, this large reserve is not necessary. At the present time about £1,750,000 worth of gold is lying idle in the Treasury vaults, although one of the State Governments has had to borrow money at 4f per cent, to meet its obligations. No doubt the Treasurer swells with pride when he walks into his office, and thinks that he has control of so much money, but it is not the act of a statesman to lock up money in this way. The members of this National Parliament should be men of broader views and of larger calibre. They should realise their position. To be elected a member of the Australian Parliament is one of the greatest honours that can be conferred on a man. I am certain that these views will meet with the approbation of all true lovers of Australia, and will be endorsed by all who have any knowledge of finance. The Government are acting falsely towards the public interest in proposing this measure, and I ask the Treasurer, for the sake of the reputation which he has won by his long connection with public affairs, especially in Western Australia, to withdraw the Bill. It is not disgraceful to admit that one has made a mistake, and for him to do so now would be the easiest way out of the difficulty in which he finds himself.",42
228,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"South Sydney) [8.24]. - The proposal of the Government is, in effect, to keep £3,000,000 of gold unused in the Treasury as a reserve against a probable note issue of £10,000,000. I understand that this Government is at present keeping a reserve of about 40 per cent., and it is at liberty to continue to do so. Why, then, has it introduced this Bill? Is it afraid that it will be tempted to reduce the reserve? Do Ministers wish it to be protected against themselves?",42
229,Mr BOTD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,The Bill will give greater confidence to the people.,42
230,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"If Ministers think that a reserve of 40 per cent, is necessary to give confidence to the people, they can keep that reserve; it is not necessary to pass an Act of Parliament to authorize it. The currency of - a country is like the blood that courses through the veins of the body. If you lessen the supply of blood, you lessen the vigour of the body, and, similarly, by lessening the currency you reduce the power of commerce, and restrict the avenues of investment.",42
231,Mr AOAB WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,But it does not do to let one's blood become too poor.,42
232,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The Government will get no return from the £3,000,000 which it proposes to hold in reserve; but the money might be usefully employed. If it were lent to the States, we should have a security as good as the gold itself, and the lending of the money would increase employment, and benefit the community generally. As a member of the Opposition, I ought, perhaps, not to object to the measure, because it will increase the reserves at the disposal of the next Ministry. This Government, however, wishes to borrow money, and what better could it do, if it is in a tight corner, than borrow from the Trust Eunds, as the Fisher Government did, paying interest on the loan as it would to a foreign creditor? Honourable members opposite seem to forget that an Act of Parliament can always be repealed or amended.",42
233,Mr ATKINSON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Then , why object to the Bill?",43
234,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I object to it because is absurd for Ministers to pass an Act to protect them from themselves. They need not take the money from the strong-room. But they cannot prevent their successors from doing as they like in the matter. The Labour party, when it came into power, repealed the Loan Bill that had been passed at the instance of the Fusion Government. We are wasting time with this Bill. The other Chamber will not pass it.",43
235,Mr BOYD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,We have nothing to do with the other Chamber.,43
236,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The other Chamber will have a great deal to say in regard to this Bill, and the measure will not become law. It is really only a placard.",43
237,Mr BOYD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"If the banks presented at the Treasury all the notes that they hold, and demanded gold for them, what would become of the reserve?",43
238,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"If the banks demanded sovereigns for their notes, what would happen ? The Government have an income, in the shape of revenue, of over £21,000,000 a year. We have always a large amount to our credit at the bank, and we have lent between six and seven million pounds to the States, for which we have the best of security.",43
239,Mr BOYD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,But you cannot get the cash.,43
240,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"We have better than that. If the banks did demand a sovereign for every note in circulation, there would be no difficulty in finding the money. The States have Savings Banks of their own, and, if necessary, as they owe us money, we could get accommodation from them. To put a case on the other side, if all the people who have deposits in the private banks presented their bank books, and claimed their money from the banks at the same time, would the banks be able to pay them* The whole success of banking depends upon confidence. The greater the confidence which the people have in the Commonwealth Bank, the greater will be its stability. No private bank can have a greater stability than the Commonwealth Government. This Parliament controls all currency, and represents the whole of the people and institutions of the Commonwealth. If the Government want to keep ""nearly £3,000,000 out of circulation and earn no interest on it , the people [147] will say, "" These men are not business men; they are keeping a lot of money it lying in the strong-room earning nothing."" I see no advantage in or necessity for this Bill. If all the banks took the precautions which the Treasurer wants to take, they would not make half their present profits. The whole system of finance depends on healthy circulation, but this Bill is an attempt to stifle that circulation. It will be of no nse to the country, and will certainly deprive the Government of a good deal of revenue; but seeing that Ministers are not going to be long in power, I have no objection to helping them to pass it.

241,Mr FISHER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Wide Bay) [8.42] Why does the Treasurer desire this measure to be brought into effect by proclamation? He made no reference to the fact in. his speech.,44
242,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,It is not unusual.,44
243,Mr FISHER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,It is quite unusual in b. matter of this kind.,44
244,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,We may not have the gold there to start with.,44
245,Mr FISHER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"If this legislation is part of the Government's policy, it ought to be so framed as to operate as soon as it receives the Governor General's assent. Otherwise, it may or may not be proclaimed.",44
246,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"If it proclaimed, it would suit you.",44
247,Mr FISHER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Then the Government want to have this string to their bow-to use or not to use?,44
248,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"What doing is perfectly genuine. 43 per cent, reserve now.",44
249,Mr FISHER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"If it is perfectly genuine, the Government, of course, will be quite prepared to protect the public interest, from their point of view, by bringing the enactment into operation once. The basis of this legislation, from the Treasurer's point of view, is that is necessary to have the larger amount of gold in reserve for the safety of the public, wbo hold the notes. by the Treasurer that the people who are holding Australian notes will have their credit endangered because of the amount of gold in the Treasury.",44
250,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,I said the opposite. It was not on that ground at all. It was the future that I was thinking of.,44
251,Mr FISHER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Then, apparently, there is no need for the Bill ; but, even iidmitting it is necessary, then the measure should come into operation so soon us it is assented to, and it should not be laft to any Goverinnent to proclaim or not proclaim it . The law now provides (hat the Treasurer shall at all times keep a reserve of not less than 25 per cent, of the issue, but the right honourable gentleman insinuates that, if another Governmenit were in power, the Act would be maladministered, and the credit of the Commonwealth, and those holding our notes, endangered. He clearly tries to convey the impression that the present Act does not give sufficient security to the people who hold our notes. He has brought down a Bill to make it statutorily impossible for a Treasurer to hold less gold in reserve against an issue of £7,000,000 than £1,750,000, and a sovereign for every £ 1 note issued in excess of £7,000,000.",44
252,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,That was provided in your first Act.,44
253,Mr FISHER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Certainly , our first Act was on those lines. The many bankers who came into conference with me before the matter was brought on at all were in favour of limiting the issue to £6,000,000. They were kind enough to give their opinions to that effect. were not Mr MATHEWS - That was in order to defend themselves.",44

255,Mr FISHER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I pay them the courtesy and justice of saying that they gave me, honestly and fairly, every information in their possession. Their idea was uot to have a 'large State issue of paper. at They thought that for some years the Commonwealth would not have an issue of it more than £6,000,000 or £7,000,000.",44
256,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Tlier e was not more than £4,000,000 in circulation then. It is said Mr FISHER - There was a very limited issue of paper, and it is to the credit of the Australian Notes Act that the issue of paper money doubled within a couple of years. very Mr MATHEWS - On l y apparently; because previously there were notes in existence to the value of £9,000,000. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There was £4,000,000 in the tills and £4,000,000 in actual circulation.",44
257,Mr FISHER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"As the only reason f o i passing a financial Bill is that it is urgently necessary to protect the interests of the public, I would like the Treasurer to explain why he proposes that this measure shall not come into operation at once ? If the Government have made up their minds that the Bill is necessary, they should taketbe steps to make it an enactment, and throw the responsibility on every future Treasurer to carry out their views upon the matter until Parliament expresses its will otherwise. Certainly, it is not proper for Parliament to express its will in definite terms and leave it to Ministers to proclaim a measure as they think fit.",44
258,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Swan-Trea surer) [8.53] - The Bill must be carried out in its entirety when it is passed, but a little time will be needed in order to prepare for it, I think we have just about enough gold to comply with the provisions laid down; but if the Bill became law immediately upon its being assented to we might not have enough gold in reserve. A little time is necessary to enable us to see that we are thoroughly prepared. It is quite a usual thing for an Act to come into force by proclamation. At a circulation of £7,000,000, the present law provides for a gold reserve of not less than £1,750,000; but, if it were necessary to hold the proposed reserve, we would need to hold £3,750,000 on a circulation of £9,000,000.",45
259,Mr FISHER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"On an issue of £10,000,000, you would need to hold £4,750,000.",45
260,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"It is not supposed that the circulation will increase beyond £10,000,000, and, with a reserve of 33^ per cent., we should need to hold £3,333,000; but, under the proposal in the Bill, we should need to hold £4,750,000, whereas under the 40 per cent, plan, to which we are at present adhering, the amount would be £4,000,000. As a matter of fact, in accordance with the practice actually carried out by my predecessor, and followed by myself, it might be £4,200,000.",45

264,Mr WEBSTER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Do you think that £4,000,000 is absolutely necessary as a reserve against a circulation £10,000,000?",45
265,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I am inclined to think so. In times of peace, I do not think anything is necessary by way of reserve, but what we have to think of is the future, and times of difficulty. [147]- 2",45

I said clearly, in moving the second reading, that we intended to reinstate the Original Act as passed by our predecessors, not because it was considered that the present issue is unsafe, but in order to provide proper safeguards for the future. I am not considering the party to which a Ministry may belong-Ministrie s will come and go long after we have departed - bu t I consider it is the duty of a Government, if it has any ideas on a subject, to try to place them on the statute book.

The Treasurer is dressing the political shop window, with the - object of making the people believe that the present Government are placing the note issue on a firmer basis.

They will not tell the public, however, that that they have locked up a l ot of gold, and by doing so have practically deprived - the country of a revenue amounting to I have always objected to Acts being brought into k that the operation by proclamation.",46
293,Mr CONROY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,What about the Excise I have it was Sugar Act and the Sugar Bounty Act?,46
294,Mr MCDONALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,I was just about to say that there are occasions when it is impossible to do otherwise than to proview vide that a Bill shall come into operaa gold tion on a date to be proclaimed. Treasurer already has a gold reserve sufficient to comply with the provisions of this measure.,46
295,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"We have not. - Mr MCDONALD - We are getting nearer the facts. The late Government 25 really maintained the gold reserve at the level for which this Bill provides, but the present Government have allowed it to f all below it .",46
296,Mr GROOM,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,That is incorrect. The Treasurer gave the Committee the exact figures.,47
297,Mr MCDONALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,He could not tell us the exact amount of the note issue.,47
298,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,I have the figures here.,47
299,Mr MCDONALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,The Treasurer has the figures in his typewritten-speech. He told us a little while ago that he could only give us an approximate estimate.,47
300,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"On the 9th September the note issue amounted to £9,266,000, and it is something like that amount now. The figures are published every week.",47
301,Mr MCDONALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,The Treasurer should be prepared to give us the exact information.,47
302,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"It is near enough,I think.",47
303,The CHAIRMAN,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Order ! The matter now being discussed is really outside the scope of the clause.,47
304,Mr MCDONALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The clause provides that the Bill shall come into operation on a date to be proclaimed, and we have been told by the Treasurer that this is because he desires to prepare the way, and to bring the gold reserve up to the required level. In these circumstances we wish to know exactly how the reserve - stands ?",47
305,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The gold at present is £1,785,000 in excess of the ""25 per cent. It is 42.85 per cent, of the note issue.",47
306,Mr MCDONALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,That is more than the reserve required by this Bill .,47
307,Sir JOHN FOBREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,No .,47
308,Mr MCDONALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Why should it be necessary to wait some time before proclaiming the Bill ? The late Government left in the Treasury a gold reserve suflicient to comply with the provisions of this Bill , and the ex-Prime Minister promised - to keep the reserve at a certain level.",47
309,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,We have a bigger reserve than the late Government left .,47
310,Mr MCDONALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,When will the reserve be suflicient to enable the Bill to be proclaimed ?,47
311,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,In - a very time.,47
312,Mr MCDONALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,The Bill may never be proclaimed.,47
313,Sir JOHNFORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,It will claimed in a very little time.,47
314,Mr MCDONALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I think we ought to have the fullest information, and that the Treasurer should be prepared to supply it . In the face of the Treasurer's previous statement that he believed 25 per cent, a sufficient reserve, we are quite justified in taking exception to the proposal. I trust that the Treasurer will give us some additional information.",47
315,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,What about?,47
316,Mr MCDONALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"When the Treasurer introduces an important Bill like this, he should be able to tell us his exact financial position. He should inform us as to the number of notes in circulation and the percentage of gold reserve, and, if there is any shortage, the amount that will be required. He should also give us some idea as to how long it will be before he makes up the necessary amount, in order to proclaim the Act .",47
317,Mr CONROY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Werriwa) [9.16] - I am surprised at honourable members opposite objecting to the Bill being brought into operation by proclamation. In their own Act of 1910 it was provided that it should commence on a day to be fixed .by proclamation, and so with the Act of 1911; and these Acts came into operation by proclamation for exactly the same reason that the Treasurer now advances. Surely what was right when the Labour Government were in power is right now? The question is whether the course is the right one; and it does not matter which reserve party introduces the measure. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it is objectionable, as a rule, to proclaim Acts; but there are certain measures, such as those connected with Excise, in which the practice is desirable; and I think that the Bill before us comes within that category. It would be impossible for the Treasurer from day to day to know what the amounts are, and he has, perhaps, to look a week ahead; and, under the circumstances, it may be impossible for him to say now at what date the measure should come into operation. The honourable member for Gwydir, in an in terjection, said that the Government were acting at the dictate of the banks. The honourable member did not understand that the gold paid by the banks is going little into the Treasury to be kept there, which is the very purpose of the Bill . However, we can understand the honourable member becoming muddled, because this is a finanbe pro- cial matter. This Bill is promoted in the interests of the poorer people, because, if there was a run, the banks would present their notes first, and the other holders, who would be mostly the poorer portions of the community, would be left lamenting for a while, because, of course, all mands would eventually be met. If the banks part with their gold to the Treasury, they will, of course, desire to see confidence maintained, because, as large holders, they would naturally not like to see any depreciation in value. I admit that, in one way, it is to the interest the banks to have gold kept to meet the notes, but otherwise it is immaterial to them.",47
318,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"South Sydney) [9.25] I understand that, when this Bill is brought into operation by proclamation, the Government, from that day forward, will make no profit on the issue over £7,000,000, but that over that amount pound for pound will be kept in the strong room. What interest have the Government in allowing notes to be issued up to £10,000,000, seeing that they are to have no profit on the issue over £7,000,000 ? It costs something to print, circulate, and otherwise deal with the notes; and to keep the balance over £7,000,000 for the convenience of the banks",48
319,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Not for the convenience of the banks, but for the convenience of the people of the country. The fiduciary issue will be only £5,250,000.",48
320,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The expenses to which I have referred will reduce the profit on the £7,000,000.",48
321,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"We are not thinking of profit, but of the convenience of the public, and of a stable currency.",48
322,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The Government ought to be recouped for the expense of printing and circulating the notes. Would the Government be prepared to issue up to £15,000,000 or £20,000,000 in notes and receive no compensation for the expense incurred over £7,000,000? I suggest that the Treasurer should consider the advisability of not issuing more than £7,000,000 of notes.",48
323,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,The country cannot lose by it.,48
324,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The country must lose by it , and the banks must profit.",48
325,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Mak e a profit, then, and ruin the currency !",48
326,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,That is not a statesmanlike answer.,48
327,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,It is not a statesmanlike question.,48
328,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Would a private firm issue more notes than they could make a deprofit on ? I understand that this is a business transaction.,48
329,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I have answered the question already. The fiduciary issue will be only £5,250,000.",48
330,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I must conclude that the .of Treasurer has not considered this phase of the matter, and, that being so, hia irritation is understandable. I leave it to the country to say whether the Government are doing right in providing for an unlimited note issue for the convenience of the banks, from which the country will get no profit beyond the first £7,000,000 issued. We should deal with the banks as with other institutions, and in giving them the right to use our notes, we should make them pay us for the convenience. But the Government are providing that the note issue may go to £15,000,000 or £20,000,000 without the country making any profit except on the first £7,000,000. Ministers might as well go a little further, and provide that no profit shall be made on any part of the note issue.",48
331,Mr WEBSTER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Gwydir) [9.35] I am sorry, on my return after a few weeks' absence, to miss familiar faces from the chamber, and express my regret at what has occurred during my absence. The Leader of the Opposition has done right in trying to ascertain from the Treasurer why he proposes that the Act shall come into force on a day to be fixed by proclamation instead of immediately the Governor General has assented to it. The honourable member for Werriwa, as usual, has been looking up Hansard in the attempt to prove that what is now proposed is in keeping with what was done by the Labour party when in power. He argues that, because the original Act came into force upon the issue of a proclamation, this Bill, when passed, should also be brought into force in the same way. He fails to see that the position of things today is very different from that in 1910. When new legislation has to be brought into force, there are a great many preliminaries to be attended to. A great many things had to be done before the Government note issue could be arranged. There is not all that preliminary work to be done in connection with this measure. One would imagine, too, that the Bill, having been introduced at this stage of the session, is an emergency Bill, and should come into force at once. To show that it is not urgent, I draw attention to the fact that the percentage of gold held in reserve against the present note issue is 42.8 per cent., or £4,150,000. Practically the same amount would be held in reserve if the Bill were law today.",48
332,Mr COIS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"ROY - But suppose that the note issue suddenly increased next year by £3,000,000.",49
333,Mr WEBSTER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I take it that it there were a sudden expansion of the note issue, it could be met by the law as it stands, which requires a gold reserve of not less than 25 per cent., with, as the Leader of the Opposition has explained, a margin going up to 33 per cent. Such a reserve is regarded all over the world as sufficient for any note issue, and a national note issue so protected would, therefore, be doubly safe. The honourable member for Werriwa wanted to know how the Bill will benefit the banks. It will benefit them in this way: On a note issue of £9,500,000 the Treasurer will be compelled to hold in reserve £1,875,000 worth of gold more than he need hold under the law as it stands. That money will be useless to him. He will not be able to lend it out or use it himself, and, as he is short of money, he will have to go into the market and borrow from the banks, which means that they will be able to get a return of about £40,000 a year on their advance. Instead of the State making £40,000 a year by lending out the money, it will make nothing, and will have to pay £40,000 a year for borrowing a similar sum. A proposal like this does not indicate the possession of great financial ability. The Treasurer has not told us why he wishes to provide that the Bill shall come into operation on the issue of a proclamation. What is the hidden reason for this proposal? I wish to know from him, in addition, why he holds au opinion now, in regard to the reserve that is necessary, differing from that which he held when a Commonwealth note issue was first proposed? He then said that a gold reserve of not less than 25 per cent, would be suflicient. But now he proposes to keep a reserve of 25 per cent, for the first £7,000,000, and £1 for £ 1 over that amount. That is thepoint the Treasurer has to explain away if he can. Surely he, whom I always looked upon as the acme of consistency in days gone by, has not so far fallen from grace in the short time that he has been in his present company as to change his opinions to that extent! What is the reason for his change of front? It is unwise for the Government to throw away their borrowing power. They cannot borrow on the open market so cheaply as they can from the bank-note fund, where they have no brokerage to pay, and less interest; yet they are wilfully throwing themselves into the hands of the private financial institutions to the extent of £1,250,000 on the present note issue; while, if the issue goes up to £10,000,000 or £12,000,000, as it may easily do, they will be crippling themselves to a proportionately greater degree. In trying to show that they know more than the Labour party, they are taking a retrograde step, one against the best interests of the country. This kind of financing is not creditable to the Treasurer, or to the party to which he belongs. The Treasurer says that he is only reverting to the first Bill that was introduced by the Labour party. That is what the Government did with the postal vote. They do not seem to be able to frame aBill of their own. They have to dig in the waste-paper basket and drag out some old piece of legislation that the Labour party threw away years ago. They are plagiarists of the worse kind. Because the Labour party found it necessary to introduce the first Bill on this subject by proclamation, when the conditions were totally different, the Government slavishly follow suit on this occasion, when there is not the slightest necessity to proceed by proclamation. It is of no use for the Treasurer to say that the object of the Bill is to safeguard the note issue. Its effect will be to limit his_ power to borrow money in the cheapest market, and drive him into the dearest. This is a borrowing Government. "" Borrow, and the results be blowed,"" is the Treasurer's policy. If the Government go on as they have been going, they will involve us in the payment of thousands of pounds every year in interest. If the Treasurer could show us, by the experience of other countries, that 25 per cent, is not a safe margin, there would be some logic in his 4088 Australian, [REPRESENTATIVES.] reasoning, but he has never done so. Surely, if he did not know the conditions prevailing in other countries, he could get his officials to look up the facts for him, so that he could present them to the House. With that information before him, he would be able to judge what was a safe margin for a national institution, and what was safe for a private banking institution. While 25 per cent, would be absolutely safe for a Commonwealth Bank, 50 per cent, might be unsafe for an ordinary financial institution. The Treasurer does not seem to realise the strength of this bank. He does not seem to know that the people, and the credit, and all the resources of Australia, and all the taxing powers of the Government, are behind it . The right honourable gentleman has such a high opinion of Australia that he openly declares that we cannot safely issue £9,500,000 worth of notes unless we put in the Treasury strong-room £ 1 for £ 1 for all notes issued over £7,000,000. When another honourable member was speaking, the Treasurer interjected, "" Make profit and ruin your currency."" This meant that if we kept a reserve of only 25 per cent, against the whole of the note issue, and made an additional profit on the amount of the issue over £7,000,000, the country would be ruined, because to ruin the national currency must ruin the country. The Treasurer knows better, because, in the speech from which I have already quoted, he deliberately saidAs to the proposed reserve, I think 25 per cent, of gold should be sufficient. It might be better to make it a little larger at first, bably, as the public become used to them, gold will be less in demand. That sentence ought to be printed as a headline to this Bill. There is no necessity for the measure, because there is as much gold in the reserve now as the Bill requires, on the present basis of an issue of £9,500,000. The measure is only a make-believe, and need not be put into force' by proclamation, or in any other way; but the Government have to fill up the session with something. Every Bill they bring in is proved to be absolutely unnecessary and useless. This measure will not make us more solvent than we are today, and the only reason the Treasurer can possibly have for introducing it is that he is favoring the private banks, by refusing to hold a fund which he might safely hold, and from which he could Mr Webster. Notes Bill. borrow on the most legitimate and easy terms for the benefit of the Common-' wealth. He will be forced to borrow nearly £2,000,000 from private institutions, paying more interest, and all the brokerage and other expenses incidental to loans, and at the same time be unable to regulate to his own liking the terms of the loan! As there is no need for the Bill, and no virtue in it, it ought to be withdrawn as quickly as possible.",49
334,The CHAIRMAN,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Order 1 The honourable member is now discussing the Bill as a whole.,50
335,Mr WEBSTER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Instea d of being proclaimed, the Bill ought to be withdrawn. It is simply another evidence of the lack of ability, the futility, and the barrenness of the Government. It brings forward only make-believe, useless legislation.",50
336,Mr MATHEWS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Melbourne Ports) [10.0] - It is not creditable to the Government to attempt to bring this measure into force in the way they are proposing. If there is need for the Bill at all, there is immediate necessity for it. If there is no immediate necessity for it , there is no need to have the Bill in order to carry out what it proposes, because by administration the Treasurer can keep his reserve as high as he wishes. During the recent elections we were told that the Labour party had restricted currency by the note issue, and that the banks had been robbed of their till money, but I would point out that, if this Bill passes, it will still further restrict the circulation of gold, and the banks will be able to charge the authors as pro- of this legislation with having restricted the currency. If the Government immediately proclaim the measure, they will receive the blame for further restricting the circulation, but they do not intend to issue any proclamation until they feel the Government benches slipping away from them. Then they will proclaim the Act in order to make it necessary for future Governments to bring in fresh legislation so that they may enjoy what the present Ministers are enjoying through the limitation imposed by the existing Statute. The Leader of the Opposition has spoken to-night of certain information that was given to him by the Associated Banks, and he has told us that they considered it would be sufficient to have notes in circulation to the value of £6,000,000. But they must have known it would not be sufficient.",50
337,Sir JOHN FOBREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"There was less than £4,000,000 in circulation, but they did not reckon on the till money it would be necessary for them to keep.",51
338,Mr MATHEWS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The Treasurer has struck the point. The banks were really operating on £9,000,000 in notes, but paying duty on £4,500,000. They used the sovereigns they received for the ,£4,500,000 in circulation to replace the .£4,500,000 in the shape of notes held in their vaults, and thus evaded paying duty on the latter amount. That is why, when the Australian note issue came into existence, there was double the previous apparent note issue in circulation. I consider that the Government are not playing fairly by leaving this measure to be proclaimed. They will only issue the proclamation when they find the legislation they propose will have the effect of restraining somo other Government from operating on the funds that they can now utilize. Unwittingly, perhaps, they are not giving the people of Australia a fair deal by this legislation, because they seek to retain for themselves certain rights which they will not concede to any Government that may follow them. Clause agreed to. Clause 3Section g of the Australian Notes Act 1910i g n is amended by omitting sub-section (1.) thereof, and by inserting in its stead the following sub-section :"" (1.) The Treasurer shall hold in gold coin a reserve as follows :(<z) an amount not less than one-fourth of the amount of Australian Notes issued up to Seven million pounds; and (4) an amount equal to the amount of Australian Notes issued in excess of Seven million pounds.""",51
339,Mr CHAHLTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Hunter) [10.6] - I move That all the words after ""issued,"" line 9, be left out. If this amendment be agreed to, the subsection will provide that the Treasurer shall hold in reserve an amount not less than one-fourth of the amount of Ausare. tralian notes issued.",51
340,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,That would be present law. Why not reject the Bill,51
341,Mr CHARLTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The present law quite satisfactory. If the Treasurer siders it insufficient to hold a 25 per reserve, which really means 33 per cent because no Treasurer can cut it down 55 per cent - h e can keep the reserve high as he likes. Therefore, the Bill quite unnecessary. I move the amendment because I believe it will be in the interests of the people, and because the Bill, as framed, will deprive the taxpayers of a large amount of interest. I take an issue of £10,000,000 on which to base my figures. Under the provisions of the Bill, there must be a reserve of 25 per' cent, for the first £7,000,000; that is, the Treasurer must hold a reserve of £1,750,000, leaving £5,250,000 to invest, which, at 3J per cent., would earn in interest, per annum, the sum of £183,750. But the Treasurer would not invest every penny of that £5,250,000. As he must have a working margin, he would retain a reserve of, say, 33$ per cent. By amending the clause as I suggest, and still working on the basis of an issue of £10,000,000, and retaining a margin of 40 per cent., which is 15 per cent, more than the Treasurer provides for up to £7,000,000, there would be £6,000,000 left for investment, which at 3J per cent, would earn £210,000 per annum, or £26,250 per annum more than could be earned under the provisions of the clause, provided the Treasurer would invest every penny above 25 per cent. Therefore, by the Bill, the taxpayers will be deprived of £26,250 per annum. We are not justified in passing a Bill that will do this.",51
342,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Why not have no gold at all in reserve?,51
343,Mr CHARLTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The right honourable gentleman is talking on the ridiculous side. Will the Treasurer contend that 40 per cent, is not a good reserve against a note issue? By passing this measure, we shall deprive the taxpayers of £26,250 per annum, and the Treasurer will put himself in a difficult position, because, if he remains in office long enough, he may find he will need money to carry on public works.",51
344,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,There is no doubt about it. It shows how self-denying we,51
345,Mr CHARLTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"But the right hon the orable gentleman will tie the Common? wealth down so that Ministers can only is use a limited sum of £5,250,000 for Comconmonwealth purposes, and at the same time cent, the balance between that amount and £10,000,000 will lie idle in the Treasury. to If we wish to borrow £5.000,000 with as which to build big national works, though is we have this money lying in the Treasury, we shall have to go elsewhere for it , and pay interest to other people.",51
346,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"On an issue of £10,000,000, you would not have much more to.invest than we propose.",52
347,Mr CHARLTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"We would earn least £26,250 per annum in interest on the money which the Treasurer proposes to lock up in the Treasury; and the people of Australia would be paying that interest to themselves, taking it out of one pocket and paying into anothei. The Treasurer need not be afraid of any difficulties with a reserve of 40 per cent, behind the notes. He need not be afraid of a panic. The thing that would cause a panic in Ausrailway, tralia would be in consequence of private banks having control of the note issue. In the case of private concerns, people are afraid. The least thing that comes along, and shakes their confidence private financial institutions causes a upon those institutions, but when they know that the Commonwealth, with all resources, is behind the note issue, who will rush us?",52
348,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,What about our vernment first brought in . being at war?,52
349,Mr CHARLTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I am not afraid then right? of that. When that times comes, the note issue will make good. people will know that they always get 20s. in the £ 1 . During the banking crisis of 1893-and there was war at that time-the people were rushsary ing the private banks, withdrawing their deposits and demanding gold in exchange for their notes. What saved the situaand tion? The Premier of New South Wales, Sir George Dibbs, announced that the credit of the Government was behind the tralian note issues, aud that at once to the panic. In that case the State saved the situation, and surely the Treasurer will not contend that there will be any scare in regard to the national note issue when the whole of the resources of the Commonwealth are behind it . at the start."" When the note issue was controlled by the private banks, they did not keep sovereign for every pound note issued. They made money out of the issue. They promised to pay on demand a sovereign justified for every note, out they kept in their tills only a reasonable amount in gold to meet any sudden demand. I venture to say not on many occasions there was not a gold reserve of more than 30 per cent, behind their note issue. If my amendment carried, it will leave the law as it stands today. I regard this Bill as a fatal mistake. It is quite unnecessary. The Treasurer says that it is necessary to protect the public. My answer is, that as long at as he is Treasurer he may keep the reserve as high as he pleases. He will, of course, have to answer to the people; but there is really no necessity to maintain such a reserve as he now proposes. We have the security of the States in respect of any money that we lend them from the Notes Fund, and there is no danger in that direction. If , later on, we have to borrow only money to construct the transcontinental as well as railway lines in the Northern Territory and in the Federal Territory, surely it is not reasonable that we should have to go into the open money market for it , and pay interest to private in money lenders, when we could, borrow rush from the Notes Fund, and so pay the in terest to the people themselves. There is its no justification for the Bill . Mr W . H . IRVINE - It is exactly the same as the measure that the Labour GoWhat has happened since to make wrong what was",52
350,Mr CHARLTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The Labour Go-The vernment showed their prudence in acting 1 will as they did. We did not want to go too far, and we were very careful. But when no experience showed that it was not necesto maintain such a gold reserve as that for which we first provided-that we could invest a portion of the Notes Fund earn interest, which could be added to the f u n d itself, we decided to do so. The present Treasurer, in discussing the AusNotes Bill , said that a 25 per cent, put a stop reserve was sufficient.",52
351,Mr GROOM,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,There was a qualificaever tion attached to that statement.,52
352,Mr FENTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The only qualification was that "" we should have a little more",52
353,Mr CHARLTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Quite so. My a amendment will enable the Government to keep a reserve of 80 per cent, or 90 per cent., if they like, but we should not be in passing the clause as it stands. We may find it necessary to borrow money from our own Trust Funds, and we should pass a Bill that would tie us down in this way. I therefore submit this amendment, in what I believe to be the best be interests of the country.",52
354,Dr MALONEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Melbourne) [10.22]. - The Treasurer, by way of interjection, referred to the position of the reserves in the Dnited States of America, and I replied at once that his statement was incorrect. I had before me at the time an authority on the subject, and I have verified my statement By a reference to Webb's New Dictionary of Statistics, in which it is said that the ratio the reserves to the deposits is 21 per cent. The Treasurer was under the impression that the reserves in the United States of America were very high, having regard to the notes issued. In 1903 the ratio of reserve to deposits there was 22 per cent., but in 1907 it was only 21.3 per cent.",53
355,Mr WH IRVINE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,I think that is the proportion to the whole of the deposits of the banks.,53
356,Dr MALONEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"It includes the whole of the gold reserves and the whole of the liquid assets. The New Encyclopaedia of Social Reform refers to the fabulously large individual deposits in the banks of the United States of Americawhich amounted to £2,357,000,000 in 1905-and states that in 1897 the ratio of reserves to deposits was 31 per cent., whereas in 1905 it had been reduced to 21.7 per cent.",53
357,Mr WH IRVINE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Does not that include all fixed deposits?,53
358,Dr MALONEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"It includes the whole of the fluid assets. The Attorney General will remember that in the boom time here the assets of ourbanks, on paper, were far more than their liabilities, but that when they attempted to realise on them a different tale was told.",53
359,Mr WEBSTER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,They vanished into thin air.,53
360,Dr MALONEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The assets were still in existencej but confidence had been destroyed, credit had been lost, and the debacle followed. If this amendment be carried, the Treasurer will have power to invest a portion of our gold reserve over and above a certain percentage. It seems absurd that we should keep locked up such a large gold reserve as that which the Government now propose to hold. Great expense is incurred in guarding it . and in providing for the note issue. Our present note issue represents 10 tons of paper, and the cost of this paper, and the printing of the notes; is very heavy. What private banking company would print notes at its own expense, unless by doing so it knew that it would make a profit? Our present note circulation is £9,500,000, so that, if the clause as it stands became law, we should have to maintain a gold reserve of 44.7 per cent. There is no country in. the world where there is a note issue like that of the Commonwealth. There are neither current acof count deposits nor fixed deposits against our national issue. It is a purely Government issue, and when we lend any portion of the Notes Fund to the States, we have their gilt-edged securities behind those loans. With a £10,000,000 issue we should have, under this Bill, a gold reserve of £4,750,000, or 47 per cent.; with a note issue of £15,000,000, we should have a gold reserve of £9,750,000, or 65 per cent.; and with a note issue of £20,000,000, as we might have ten or twenty years hence, we would need to keep, under this Bill, a gold reserve of £14,000,000, or 73$ per cent. Mr W. H . IBVINE - We are not providing against all future time; we are simply providing a reasonable safeguard for the immediate future.",53
361,Mr WEBSTER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The Government want to have some gold to save the banks when they go "" bung.""",53
362,Dr MALONEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The Attorney-General knows very well that our system is very different from that of any private bank. Under the Victorian Act, any company or individual with assets amounting to £125,000 could have a note issue of millions. There was no limitation to the issue,, and, as I have already shown, it was all moonshine to say that the notes of the private banks were a first charge on their assets. There are 30 tons of gold locked up in the Treasury, and it belongs-, not to the banks, but to the people. Thirty lorries would be needed to move such a reserve, and it is proposed to add more, simply because this is a borrowing Government who like to go to the ""three-balls"" in England begging for money. As the Bulletin says, however, "" Cohensfcein "" will surely get tired. Is there any private person who would be so foolish as to put his gold in a locker and make no use of it? I remember when the unemployed in Victoria were sought to be made use of by a certain gentleman who wished to "" smash "" a bank-; but I had the honour to prevent this,and to receive the thanks of the directors for doing so. The idea was that these men should rush with their notes to the bank; and we can quite understand how every little depositor with a little current count would have been madly nervous. In the present case, however, there are current accounts and no deposits; and we present the first instance in the world where the Government have made the currency gold, silver, copper, and paper. The Treasurer actually did not understand the increase of the ratio of the centage, when he was corrected by the Leader of the Opposition, and he became so muddled that I was sorry for him. The statement that the Treasurer has made here to-night is so ridiculous that I had better not further refer to it, in case I say something harsh. I look forward to the time when keen financial brains, not warped within the narrow limit of the present banking system, will be prepared, with a clearer view, to face what the century must face. If the Government, by strength of numbers, defeat the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter, I hope it will be made in another place, so that we may have a further opportunity of voting for it. If we had the referendum and initiative, I am confident that the people would say they were quite content with the guarantee of the Commonwealth, backed up by 25 per cent, of gold.",53
363,Mr FENTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Maribyrnong) [10.35] - I do not know why the Treasurer and the Government are so insistent on this clause, which will practically mean at least a 50 per cent, gold reserve. Experience shows.that a reserve of ""not less than 25 per cent."" means really a serve of about 30 per cent., and the proposal of the Government will, therefore, mean, as I say, at least 50 per cent., be- 60 per cent. cause, in order to be perfectly safe, there must always be a margin to work on. The Savings Banks returns show that hundreds of thousands of pounds are deposited there, without interest, by the timid people of the country; and this is because those people know that the Savings Banks are guaranteed by the various Governments, and that their money is perfectly safe. If people have this confidence in the Savings Banks, they will have quite as much confidence in a note issue backed by the Commonwealth. The Government and their supporters, in insisting on an excessive gold reserve, are practically expressing a lack of confidence ac- in the country in which they live. The Treasurer, in introducing the Loan Bill , no complained that the late Government had so invested the Trust Funds that he could not lay his hands on money which he needed; and yet we find him now proposing a restrictive measure, and thus preventing himself from earning money for perthe people by locking up hundreds of thousands of good golden sovereigns. In this I cannot see any consistency on the part of the Treasurer. The proposal of the Government is neither more nor less than a pretence to make the people believe that the note issue is not quite safe.",54
364,Mr WH IRVINE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Is that the pretence the late Government made when they increased the reserve?,54
365,Mr FENTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The Treasurer, when the Bill of 1910 was under discussion, said he believed that 25 per cent., was sufficient, but that, in the initial stages, it might be advisable to have a little more. The Leader of the Opposition, when, as Treasurer, he introduced the second Bill dealing with the note issue, bringing down the reserve to 25 per cent., gave a pledge, in order to - allay any fears, that, until after the general elections, at least 40 per cent, would be held.",54
366,Mr FISHER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"In the first instance, I said that I was never in favour of more than 25 per cent.",54
367,Mr FENTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"When the present Government came into office the Treasurer said that his predecessor had been true to the pledge, so that the interjection, re- of the Attorney-General does not apply.",54
368,Mr RODGERS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,What is the average reserve throughout the world? It is over,54
369,Mr FENTON,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The banks of the world do not hold more than 50 per cent., on the average, against the whole of their liabilities, so I do not, therefore, see how there can be 50 per cent, against the note issues. No country in the world except Queensland has ever adopted a note issue such as we have, and yet Queensland, as a single State, conducted that note issue for nineteen years with a very low reserve. Where the credit of the country is behind the note issue, everybody knows that it is safe. It is a foolish thing to lock money. We might just as well follow example of the natives of India, who hide their savings in a hole in the ground. The Treasurer, and those who support him, seem to be doing much the same thing. I am afraid that this little baby of his will never come to maturity, and that it will get very short shrift in another place. To discuss the measure is merely a waste of time. The Bill should withdrawn. To amend the existing would be very foolish, and the Government ought to be content to let well alone.",54
370,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Hindmarsh) [10.47] - I shall support the amendment, because it provides asound basis for the note issue, backed with a gold reserve, discount rate. and I am surprised that the Treasurer, or some other Minister, has not made a increases rapidly. reply to my statement earlier in the noon that, in dealing with currency, you the Bank of England. cannot ignore the cheques and bills which form part of it , just as do coin and notes. I expected from the learned and distinthe guished financiers on the Treasury bench some recognition of the big alteration currency, which is increasing every year, and which was such a marked feature of currency of Australia. the last years of the nineteenth century. The honourable member for Wannon spoke of the relation of coin and bullion to rency in other places, and wished to pare it with the relation here. I have already pointed out, any one who tries to compare our own with the finanthing cial conditions of France or Germany, any other country in which cheques and bills are not used to the extent to which currency. they are used in Great Britain , and i the Commonwealth, is either ignorant, or wishes to cause confusion.",55
371,Mr RODGERS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The more you increase that kind of currency, the greater the cessity for gold reserves.",55
372,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"That is not borne out by experience. London is mow the financial centre of the world, because of its sound banking system. Ten or twenty years ago, it was a common thing for meetings of leading bankers there to declare that a biggev gold backing to the Bank of England was essential; but that opinion is .not so often expressed now, because the clearing-houses of the banks show a tremendous expansion of the currency by the use of cheques and bills.",55
373,Mr RODGERS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Every banker and up financier will say that the increase in the the note currency indicates danger.,55
374,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"That may be so with an increase in the note issue of a private bank, but with that I have nothing to do now. I do not say that there is any bank in Australia which is not solvent. The position of a bank depends entirely upon the nature ol its securities, which may be dead or alive, and managers and be directors who know their business see that law their bank's securities are alive.",55

The Treasurer is proposing to disturb the The average citizen who has not made a study of these questions will naturally suppose that the curbasis of the note issue determined by the comlast Government is not a sound one.

It is a very small measure, and deals with two matters only. Some time ago the NOES. London Post Office submitted to the Department a proposal to admit to the benefit of the English newspaper rate of Jd. per copy in the United Kingdom copies of any publication published in any part of the Empire. The Department took up this proposal, and I think the matter was in hand at the time that my predecessor was in office. It means that by a reciprocal arrangement the Australian papers, after being registered in England within the PAIRS. meaning of the English Act , can be transmitted from place to place there for Jd., F. W. instead of paying the existing rates of l j d . and 2d. At present, if a paper like the Sydney Daily Telegraph is sent from one part of England to another, the postal rate is l j d . , and, for the larger edition, 2d. If this Bill is passed, the British Post Office has arranged to reciprocate with Australia, we transmitting British newspapers from one part of Australia to another for Jd. apiece, the same rate as reour own papers pay, while our papers, such as the Australasian, Argus, Sydney Morning Herald, and Daily Telegraph, will be transmitted from one part of the United Kingdom to the other for the",56
379,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,What is the cost of regisprotration for newspapers at Home ?,56
380,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,There is no cost for registration. They simply have registered there to satisfy Department of their bona fides. There of opinion is no expense at all.,56
381,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Then this is only a Bill to If this assist the newspaper companies ?,56
382,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"There are a large number of Australians who visit the Mother Country from time to time, and we have a number of immigrants out here, at present have to pay the higher rates f they send newspapers to one another. Bill is certainly a benefit to the newspapers, but it is also a benefit to people who like to receive papers. the immigrants who come here like to get the English papers, and transmit them from one family to another.",56
383,Mr RILEY,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Will there be any loss to the Department?,57
384,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"We shall probably make a profit on it , as a larger number of papers will go through the post. If we can afford to transmit our own papers at Jd. apiece, we can afford to transmit papers like The Times at the same rate.",57
385,Mr WEBSTER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Can we afford to transmit our own papers at Jd. apiece?,57
386,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"U p to the present we have done so, and I presume that we can continue'to do it .",57
387,Mr WEBSTER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Hav e we done it profitably ?,57
388,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I have never had a separate return made out, but we have done it for years. And the more the public have opportunities of reading newspapers the better will be their knowledge of what is going on. the public appreciate these facilities, and it is very wise that we should give them. The second clause deals with what we call letter-telegrams or lettergrams. have a large number of telegraph offices open after 6 o'clock at night for the purpose of receiving telegrams for newspapers-som e remain open until 2 o'clock in the morning-bu t as there is not much work in connection with receiving these telegrams for newspapers we propose that if a telegram is lodged after 6 o'clock at night forty words may be transmitted at a cost of Is., and the message will be delivered by post in the morning. missing the mail to Sydney or Brisbane, or to any part of the Commonwealth, even from State to State, can send a telegram containing forty words for ls. The system has been tried, and found a great success in the United States of America and Canada. Every telegram, so sent will be a profit to the Department. Geelong recently I asked the postmaster if he kept his office open at night, and he informed me that it was kept open until 2 o'clock in the morning to receive a few press telegrams. I asked him whether the operator could also put through 20, 30, or 40 telegrams, and he said that the operator would be rather pleased to do it , because it was difficult to pass the time from the hour at which he commenced duty until 2 o'clock in the mornNo doubt ing waiting to deal with these press messages. Thus every telegram we get will be a profit to us. Twenty telegrams sent in the night will mean a revenue of £1. 8",57
389,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"A business man might wait until night, and send forty words, and thus make a saving.",57
390,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I do not know that even then the messages will not be profitable. I doubt whether the present telegrams pay at 9d., but these lettergrams will be'sent at a time when the telegraph offices are comparatively idle. Let me compare this proposal with the operations of an electric light company. Electric light companies sell power at a very cheap rate in the day time, because they must keep their plant going, and all they get in the shape of revenue from power is "" found "" money. All we shall get from these lettergrams will be "" found "" money to the Department.",57
391,Mr WEBSTER,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Excep t where it undermines your present patronage. I am sure Mr AGAR WYNNE - I do not tliink it will do that. As a rule, business people who send telegrams send them at the moment, because the matters are urgent. We If a business man wishes to save money he will not telegraph; he will send a letter. These lettergrams will be delivered as letters in the morning. They will be used in a great many cases where people have missed the lato delivery. The Department consider that they will be profitable, and certainly they will prove of considerable advantage to the general public. People Mr THOMAS (Barrier) [11.15] - Is the Postmaster-General prepared to adjourn the debate?",57
392,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I did not thin k the B i ll would be debated. As the Senate are waiting for work, let us dispose of this Bill before adjourning.",57
393,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The first proposal is At that newspapers coming from England or Canada, or any other place willing tn reciprocate with us, shall be sent through our post-offices at our rates, when our newspapers going to those countries will be sent through their post-offices at their rates. But it seems to me that so far as England is concerned, we are giving considerably more than they will give us. Newspapers in Australia go through the post at the rate of 20 ounces for I d . , whereas in England the rate for newspapers is Jd. for every 2 ounces. It appears to me from reading the Bill that English newspapers will go through our post-offices at our rates.",57
394,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,When they arrive here.,58
395,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I do not object to it very much. When the Postal Bill was going through the House in 1901, I advocated the reciprocity for which the Postmaster-General is now asking. present Prime Minister was on the same side with me at that particular time, but the protectionist sentiment of this House threw out the proposal because it would not protect the newspapers of Australia, and it was decided that only newspapers printed and published in Australia should go through Australian post-offices at our rates. That idea has been carried out, not only in regard to newspapers, but also in regard to magazines, and, later on, in regard to books. At the present time a magazine, printed and published in England, cannot go through our post offices as cheaply as an Australian magazine.",58
396,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,And they will not under this Bill .,58
397,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"But if we are going to provide these new rates for newspapers, why not also for magazines?",58
398,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Because the lish Act provides that they must be weekly or daily papers.,58
399,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,B y the Bill English newspapers can be brought here and posted from Melbourne or Sydney at the same rates as Australian newspapers. 1 raise no particular objection to that.,58
400,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,At present they are delivered by hand on account of the high rates.,58
401,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"But if we are to take away the protection that was given to Australian newspapers, it seems to me we should go a little further and allow Australian rates to apply to English magazines.",58
402,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"In England they will not take our magazines, so we should not take theirs.",58
403,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"That is a very fair argument. The Postmaster-General referred to Australian newspapers going through English post-offices at Jd. The rate in England is Jd. for 2 ounces, whereas our rate is l d . for 20 ounces; but here in Australia eighty newspapers need not weigh 20 ounces. newspapers weighing 20 ounces can be handed in and sent all over Australia for ld. That could not be done in England where only one newspaper, no matter what its weight, can be posted for Jd. I think that we have been too liberal to the newspapers. The reason why the very cheap rate we charge was adopted in 1901 was because the Federal Parliament had to recognise that, in New South Wales, The newspapers were carried free through the post. We had to arrive at some compromise, aud so a postage, rate of l d . per 20 ounces was decided upon. It is one of the difficulties of the Department that so large a number of newspapers of light weight can go through the post for I d . Another difficulty that has arisen has been to decide what a newspaper is. I have no doubt that the present Postmaster General has, several times since he has been in office, been called upon to decide whether a particular publication was a newspaper. In England it does not matter much what is called a newspaper, because postage at the rate of Jd. must be paid on every 2 ounces, or upon each newspaper. If we had imposed the rate of Jd. for each newspaper, there would be very little to object to in this proposal.",58
404,Mr FLEMING,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,The quack medicine publication is the trouble here. EngMr THOMAS - I believe that is so. I have heard the honourable member for Riverina mention the fact that his mailbag is filled with quack medicine publications. I take it that newspapers sent here fro m England wil l have to be accepted here.,58

406,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"It seems to me that the honourable member is not quite clear as to the meaning of the Bill . I asked him whether English newspapers were to be delivered here after their arrival in the Commonwealth, at the rates charged here, and I understood him to say that that would be so. I do not profess to be a lawyer, but it appears to me that that is what the Bill means, and that that would be a reasonable proposal. What the people of England say, as I understand the matter, is, "" If you allow our newspapers to go through the post in Australia after their arrival in the Commonwealth, at your rate, we will allow your newspapers to go through the post in Eighty England, at our rate."" That would be a reasonable proposal; but,- if that be so, an English newspaper would not have to pay postage in Australia at Jd. for 2 ounces.",58
407,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The honourable member will see that the matter is dealt with in clause 2 of this Bill, in which is provided thatThe Governor General may, by proclamation, agree to that. declare that the provisions of this section extend to any part of the King's Dominions which permits newspapers printed and published in Australia and posted in that part, to be mitted through the post at same rates of as newspapers printed and published in jvart.",59

If in Australia we had not decided upon the rate of 20 ounces for I d . , and had charged l d . for each newspaper, as we to have done, there would be no difficulty at all. Passing from that subject to the second portion of the Bill, 1 think there can be no objection to the concession proposed to be granted.

430,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Ye t they send sixty words for ls.,60
431,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,That is after a certhe tain time.,60
432,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,We only propose to send forty words.,60
433,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"I can quite understand that in America a number of perber sons who cannot afford to send at the high charge during the day are prepared quite to send, in the evening at a much lower rate. In Australia one can send to its uttermost parts sixteen words for ls. up to 6 o'clock. The Postmaster-General ferred to a number of post-offices that are business kept open for a number of hours after 6 o'clock in connection with press messages. I take it that he is not going to limit the lettergrams simply to those offices.",60
434,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"To the principal cities virtually, and some of the larger towns where there are big newspapers.",60
435,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"If a lettergram put in after 6 o'clock it may be sent mediately, and may be delivered by the letter-carrier. I must confess that I rather amazed when I heard that this system is only to be limited to postspent offices that are open after 6 o'clock. Broken Hill and Deniliquin.",60
436,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Thos e two places have open post-offices because they newspapers.,60
437,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"In those two places the telegraph office is open, and, quently, it is all right. I venture to that most of those who will send a wire of forty words from Broken H i ll for ls. limited. will be business men.",60
438,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,I doubt it.,60
439,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"Some time ago I closed practically all the small post-offices in Australia at 6 o'clock. I believe it was one of the best things that were done while I was at the Post Office. Although there was a little flutter in two or three newspapers, I do not notice that the present Minister has re'-opeued the offices, because it would be simply. a waste of money to do so. A very keen business man here, whose name I am prepared to give to the Minister privately, told me more that it did not make much difference to his firm. He said that prior to the post offices being closed at 6 o'clock they used to allow the telegrams to accumulate, and give them to the boy at 6 o'clock when he was going home to be handed in at the General Post Office. He said that after small post-offices were closed at 6 o'clock, as soon as a wire was ready it was sent off by the boy to be despatched. If that is so, in the case of a man running a big business here there will be a numof telegrams which there is no need to send for two or three hours. I think that a number of the business men in my constituency do not care particularly whether they get an ordinary telegram at 6 o'clock in the evening or at 9 o'clock in rethe morning. My opinion is that if a man here realizes at 5 o'clock that he has to send a telegram which will take more than sixteen words, and that it will cost 3d. or fld. over the Is., he will postkeep it back until 6 o'clock, and then send it along, and his business representative will get it in his letter-box at 9 o'clock next morning, which will be quite soon enough for him. Business men will . look at every 3d. or fld. I was very much is amused one day when a person who was imthen connected with Reuters' agency told me that a very able, keen, business man, was who is known to every honourable member, drove up in a magnificent motor car, and a quarter of an hour in haggling Take over one word in a message, because it would have made a difference of 3s. I do not think that many persons will have bother about using forty words for a lettergram. The ordinary individual, who wants to send a letter, will pay the conseld. to do so rather than pay ls. to say write out forty words. This great reform of the Postmaster-General is to be",60
440,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,I do not say that it is a great reform. I say that we are copying places where it has been a great success.,60
441,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,It is to be limited to a very few places.,61
442,Mr AGAR WYNITE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"No , it will available to a fair number.",61
443,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,How many?,61
444,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"A b o u t 33 per cent, authorize its construction. of the post-offices probably receive telegrams for the press.",61
445,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Does the Postmaster General mean to say that one-third of the post-offices of Australia receive press messages ?,61
446,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,V e r y nearly.,61
447,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"If that be so, the matter ought to be taken very seriously into consideration. The Postmaster-General admits that in most cases these offices are open t ill 1 or 2 o'clock.",61
448,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,The only one of which I have had experience is Geelong.,61
449,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,"The people want the news, that is why the offices are kept open.",61
450,Mr THOMAS,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,Then why should not the people pay for the news?,61
451,Mr BENNETT,THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES OP THE WORLD,They are not often kept open t ill 1 o'clock.,61

NA BIVER RAILWAY BILLI n Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message): Motion (by Mr Glynn) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue and moneys be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to provide for the construction of a railway in the Northern Territory, from Pine Creek to the Katherine River, the appointment of officers, the making of charges, and the appropriation of money in connection with such railway. Resolution reported and adopted. SECOND READING .",61
453,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Angas-Minister of External Affairs) f l 1.451 - I take it that it is the desire of the Opposition as well as the Government that we should get this B i ll through as quickly a i possible. If it were a b it earlier in the session, I might say something about the Territory, but I know that the occasion is not opportune. Last year, the honourable member for Barrier introduced a Bill for the purpose of a survey of about 54 miles of railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. That survey is now be complete, and I think the honourable member's opinion is that we might almost pro- . ceed with the work without a Bil l to But, as a matter of courtesy to the House, I thought it better to submit this proposition in the form of a Bill . The Loan Bill , as honourable members know, makes provision for the construction of the line. I ask the House to formally sanction the work. When the occasion offers to go a little more in to ' the railway policy which the Government have in view in the Northern Territory, I shall be happy to give to honourable members all the information that is in my possession. ' I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative.. Bill read a second time, and reported without amendment; report adopted. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill read at h i r d time. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.
