That is not good enough. People have known Darling Basin for years-indeed, for decades. and I recall that in that year the first Australian minister, brought to the cabinet some papers ple were concerned about this 30 years ago, some more consultation and that we need worse; delay will only cause the problems arising to get worse. I do not support the calls for Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council. A federal Labor government would be committed river, by increasing the environmental flows-not first term, not only by delivering 1,500 gigalitres river, but also by taking action to prevent the that flows into the system in the first place. step to an effective global response to climate change. We really do have a serious situation here. otic species and algal blooms, native fish floodplains are dying of thirst because no floodwaters threatens to affect around six million hectares simply taking too much water out of the Murray, put more water back in. That is what Labor will in the first term of a Crean Labor government. There is no doubt that this is a substantial for those irrigators and farmers who have been we can achieve that target of 1,500 gigalitres stand that that involves putting back about year period, that represents a two per cent change get, I believe it is achievable without impacting fail to act, that will impact on our agricultural course of the next 10 years. It is an ambitious Labor is prepared to provide that leadership. The government is going around in circles, has put this decision on the backburner, as needed to protect our environment, allowing that we can go on trashing the river system the past 15 years. If we do not recognise that, South Australia in particular.
