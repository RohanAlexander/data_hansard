Mr ROBINSON;- I wish to ask the Postmaster-General, without whether his attention has been directed to the following paragraph in the Hamilton Spectator ? MOTOR v. TELEGRAPH - A striking instance of motor bicycle outstripping a telegram was afforded here on Monday. A gentleman left Casterton Hamilton on a motor at 10.30 that morning, leaving behind him a, telegram for despatch to office. That message was lodged a few minutes after his departure, but it did not reach the party a majority. to whom it was addressed till 12.35 p.m., an hour after the sender had arrived in Hamilton on his bicycle. In justice to the Telegraph Department, it should be added that the distance covered by the cyclist, 40 miles, was accomplished in 1 hour 40 minutes, which, considering heavy state of the roads, was remarkably travelling. Can the Postmaster-General explain why the telegram arrived so soon after the cyclist ?",12

SYDNEY - Thursday - In the Legislative bly to-night, Mr Anderson, member for Balmain, asked the Premier the following question :"" la view of the statement made by the monwealth Prime Minister, that it is unfortunment? ately true that Australia is losing her population through the defective state of the laws, and seeing that the State laws were passed State members, who are now members Federal Parliament, will the Premier submit motion to this House, so that we will be able to discuss it, and give an expression of as to the effect the Commonwealth laws, have had as a means towards the depopulation Australia?"" Mr Carruthers replied that in order to a safety-valve for the feelings-of State members in regard to Federal legislation, he would have to. call a special session of PaTliament, viewed with apprehension the prospects of on this subject, knowing as be did the strong ings of members of the House and of the of New South Wales with regard to the effects of Federal legislation. In view of that statement, is 'the honourable and learned gentleman still of opinion that of the reflections which he recently made in this Chamber on. the laws of the States are likely to conduce to proper relations between the' States and the Commonwealth? Is if not a fact, as alleged by Mr Andernotice, son, that members of this House are mainly responsible for the land laws pf the States ?",13

The Governor General may by proclamation prohibit the exportation of in the proclamation, unless there is applied to them a trade description of such character, relating to such matters, and applied in such manner, as prescribed by the proclamation or by the regulations. (2.) All such goods to which the prescribed trade description is not applied, which are exported or entered for export or put on board any ship or posedboat for export or brought to any wharf or place for export, shall be forfeited to the King. (3.) Subject to the regulations the Comptroller General, or on appeal from him the Minister, may permit any goods which are liable to be been seized as forfeited under this section delivered to the owner or exporter, upon security being given to the satisfaction of the Comptroller General that the goods shall not be exported contravention of the proclamation. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) pro-, posedThat the words "" Governor General may by proclamation,"" line 1, be left out, with the view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""regulations may.""",14
10,Mr LONSDALE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I wish to know if exporters will be given fair notice of the intended change in our law? There should be the fullest publicity in these matters. The mere laying of regulations on the table is of little use, because practically no one looks at them, and, if published only in the Government Gazette, they will be buried away from sight. Everv man is supposed to know what the law is, but new legislation should ,be brought prominently under the attention of the public. If this is not done in the present case, honest exporters may find themselves in difficulty through lack of knowledge of the requirements of our laws. I do not object to the substitution of regulations for proclamations, but I desire to know how exporters and importers are to be informed as to what is required of them.",14
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," Apar t from the publication of the regulations in the Commonwealth Gazette, there will be no means of giving publicity, except by advertising in the leading daily newspapers. I am afraid that that would involve too much expense. The regulations will be printed in pamphlet form, and notices will be published in all the leading newspapers with regard to them. I will take care to send copies of the regulations to the principal bodies interested, and if too much cost is not involved I shall be quite prepared to advertise them in the newspapers. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) any goods specified agreed toThat after the word "" any,"" line 2, the word is "" specified"" be inserted, and that the words ""specified in the proclamation,"" lines 2 and 3, be left out. Amendment (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) proThat the word "" true"" be inserted before the word "" trade,"" line 4.",14
12,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," If the amend to be ment be agreed to, the wording of this clause will be different from that adopted in in clause 7, and I must oppose it. I have already promised to bring the words ""of such character"" under the notice of the draftsman with a view to the adoption, if possible, of other words which will be free from the objections raised by some honourable members. I am prepared to make a similar promise with regard to this clause.",14
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I shall press my amendment, mainly on account of the remarks made by the Attorney-General last night, to the effect that the Minister must have reserved power beyond the mere authority to require a true indication of the character of the goods. He pointed out that a trade description might be true, and yet not as prescribed. If an importer or an exporter mark his goods with a true - trade description, what more should we require? According to the Attorney-General, however, the trade description must be as prescribed, and of such character as the regulations require. For instance, the manager of a butter factory might be compelled to mark his produce as coming from a particular factory, or a particular district, or through a particular agency, and the regulations might prove harassing to the last degree. Moreover, if a word were omitted, or a word were added, to a trade description, it might be held that the law had been contravened, and that the goods were liable to forfeiture. All weneed concern, ourselves about is that goods shall be in accordance with the description attached to them. That was declared to be the real object of the measure, and if a true trade description is applied to goods, there should be no necessity for the Minister to prescribe the very words that shall be used in such description. The Minister might prescribe that butter should be marked as coming from the North Coast, or the South Coast of New South Wales, or elsewhere, or he might insist that even the name of the particular dairy in which it originated be indicated. The provision in the clause, as it stands, appears to be quite unnecessary, and therefore I shall press the amendment.",14
14,Mr LONSDALE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," If we allow the Bill to pass in its present form, our exporters and importers will be seriously harassed. The States Governments are doing all that is required, and the powers proposed to be conferred under this Bill are not necessary in the interests of our export or our import trade. Wherever possible we should avoid legislation by regulation, and abstain from conferring large powers upon Ministers and officials. We have fallen, into the habit of passing skeleton Bills, and leaving almost everything to be provided for by regulation. The honourable member for Franklin recently mentioned the case of apples being exported from Tasmania before they were thoroughly matured in order to catch the London market at a time when high prices were ruling. I should like to know what the Minister would do in such a case. Would he insist upon marking the apples as unripe? I do not think that he would be called upon to do anything of the kind. The question whether such' apples - are fit or unfit for use should rest entirely upon the decision of the consumer, and if he chooses to purchase them well and good. Every producer and manufacturer should put his own brand on the goods he sends to market, and should stand upon his own reputation. If he sends articles of good quality to market his reputation will insure him good prices, whereas if he forwards articles of bad quality he will have to put up with Jpw prices. We know that goods are sold on the strength of the reputation of the brands applied to them. Why should consumers be denied the opportunity to purchase goods of low quality, when they cannot afford to pay the prices asked for the superior article? We know that so-called shoddy goods are manufactured, not necessarily with the object of deceiving the public, but in order to supply a. low-priced article to meet the requirements of persons of small means. So long as every producer places his own brand on his goods and stands by it, we can do no more for the consumers of our produce beyond the Commonwealth. I should not object to grant the Minister extensive reserve powers if the right were conceded to persons charged with contravening the law to appeal to a Court of Justice. I endeavoured to induce an honourable and learned member to drafta clause which would make provision in thaidirection, but he represented that the provisions of the Bill were so complex that it would be difficult to meet the case. This Parliament, which regards itself as occupying a position of superiority to the States Legislatures, should be the last to strip citizens of their right to betried by judicial authorities when they are charged with evading the law. It may be urged that if one exporter sends out goods of bad quality he will injure the reputationof our products. There mav be a few cases of that kind, but T do hot think that they will have any appreciable influence upon our markets. If , on the other hand, an importer brings goods into the country under a wrong description, he alone will be the sufferer. MrDavidson , a large buyer in London, who was 1 examined before the Butter Commission the other day, distinctly stated that Australian butter was not purchased upon the strength of a Government brand, but upon its quality. Will' any man: of common sense purchase butter at an auction sale in England without - first having a sample box opened? That would, indeed, be a foolish proceeding. The same remark is applicable to apples. They are not purchased in the London market in sealed. cases. It is absolutely foolish to talk about men buying goods with their eyes closed. They have to use their own judgment in matters of this sort. All that we should do under this Bill is to compel a man to put his own name and that of his factory upon his goods. If we do that, every articlewithin a very short time-wil l receive its proper price. I do trust that the Minister will make the Bill very much less drastic.",15
15,Mr LEE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I think that the Minister might very well accept the amendment. There is no person who is better qualified to give a true trade description of goods than is their owner. I do not believe that we should leave it to the Minister to declare by regulation what shall constitute a true trade description. The owner of any goods should be held responsible for placing such a description upon (hem. To my mind, we are' asked to trust 1 the Minister and the Department altogether Too much. I am entirely opposed to the imposition of undue restrictions upon exporters. The onus should be upon the exporter himself to give a true trade description of his goods. My experience has been that the judgment of practical men is infinitely preferable to that of so called experts. The exporters of apples or of butter will take every care to see that their brands are not injured by any trade description which' they may put upon them. A* man would not, for example, place his best brand upon goods of inferior quality.",16
16,Mr HUGHES,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"He will put a different brand on, and, if he can dispose of the butter as being of the best quality, he will do so.",16
17,Mr LEE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The honourable and learned member for West Sydney knows very little about the matter.,16
18,Mr HUGHES,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,But I can read of the condition of affairs which was disclosed by the Butter Commission.,16
19,Mr LEE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I am speaking of the men who are engaged in the trade, and who are exporting their own goods. At the present time, two-thirds of the butter exported from New South Wales is being shipped by the farmers themselves. They have had to cut their owrr pathway to success, and in doing so, they have been severely torn by thorns and brambles. Despite the disabilities under which they laboured, they have achieved their object. I trust that the Minister will agree to the amendment. Mr KENNEDY ""(Moira) - It is rather amusing to hear the honourable member for Cowper insisting that the words "" a true trade description"" should be embodied in the Bill. He has altogether overlooked the fact that the words "" trade description"" are already defined in the measure, as will be seen by reference to clause 3. Honourable members opposite were parties to the acceptance of that definition.",16
20,Mr BATCHELOR,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"We do not require the words ""of such character.""",16
21,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,A trade description must give the information required by the Minister.,16
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,We object to the Minister being allowed to determine the precise form of any trade description.,16
23,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Honourable members opposite wish to embody in the Bill a provision which may have the effect of obscuring the origin of certain goods. We know what the words "" of such character"" imply. We do not want a repetition of the condition of affairs which was disclosed by the Butter Commission.",16
24,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Some of the worse butter that was sent to London had the Government brand upon it.,16
25,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The factory brand had been removed by the shippers at their own sweet will,16
26,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Will not the phrase ""true trade description"" overcome the difficulty ?",16
27,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I prefer to rely upon the definition which is contained in clause 3. Honourable members should not assume that the sole object of the Bill is to harass the honest trader. It rather constitutes"" an attempt to bring the dishonest trader into line with the honest one.",16
28,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,This clause deals exclusively with exporters.,16
29,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The provision will not harass the honest exporter in the slightest degree.,16
30,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"What is the objection to the insertion of the word "" true "" ?",16
31,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"To my mind, a trade description is all that is required. If we attempt to supersede the definition of "" trade description,"" which is contained in clause 3, we shall inevitably create confusion. That is my objection to the amendment.",16
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Parramatta) The honourable member for Moira appears to Be under a curious misapprehension as to the object which we have in view. There is nothing in the amendment that would interfere with the right of the Minister to prescribe a trade description in any way he thought fit, so far as its substantial accuracy was concerned. The definition of ""trade description"" in the interpretation clause, is wide and vague, and under it the Minister may prescribe that goods shall be so branded as to show the country of origin and the country of destination, their nature, measure, quality, gauge, and every other particular. The point is, however, that under the clause, as it stands, a man might accurately describe his goods in all these respects, but if the description contained a word different from the verbiage dictated by the Minister, his goods would be liable to forfeiture. If that be permitted, we shall make the Minister a despot of a kind who ought not to be tolerated. I do not wish it to be the law of the land that if a man happens to place a description on his goods which is not exactly in accordance with the words dictated by the Minister in relation to a matter about which there is really! no dispute, he may be liable to have those goods held up and forfeited. The Attorney-General argued last night that it was not sufficient that a trade description should be true. He urged that it should be given in the exact words prescribed by the Minister. That would be an injustice to honest traders who have nothing to gain by hiding the truth. It would leave them liable to the risk of having their goods confiscated simply because some one who i\ad been told to brand them omitted from tl:e description a word that it ought to have contained. I think the Minister should instantl)"" accept the amendment"".",16
33,Mr BATCHELOR,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I am opposed to the clause altogether, and am therefore prepared to support any amendment that will limit it, or at least make its terms definite. It seems to me that the words "" of such a character "" are not only indefinite, but unnecessary. I approve of the word "" true "" being inserted in their stead, so that a true trade description will be all that is reduired. If the clause be nassed ns it stands, it will frive the Minister power to provide for any description thflt he pleases.",17
34,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I am astonished at the attitude of many honourable members in regard to this amendment. The ostensible object of the Bill is to provide that our imports and exports shall be true to name, but when an amendment is proposed that will more effectually carry out that object, we find honourable members declaring that what is needed is not a true description but a description to be prescribed by the Minister of Trade and Customs for the time being. During the last twelve months, we have had three different Ministers in charge of the Department of Trade and Customs, and each of those honourable gentlemen might have issued different regulations. Our object should be to make this measure as clear and as definite as possible; but we are now proposing to pass what is really a skeleton Bill , which will place very wide power in the hands of the Minister. I protest against the Minister being given power to say what shall be a true description. The clause, as it stands, does not provide that goods imported or exported shall be true to the labels they bear.",17
35,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The Bill gives a definition of "" trade description,"" and the regulations cannot go beyond that definition.",17
36,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The proposal to eliminate the words "" of such a character"" must be considered in connection with the proposition to insert the word "" t r u e "" in their stead. What we desire to do is to provide that a trade description shall bea true one. If a man exports or imports-, goods bearing what is an absolutelv truedescription, nothing more should be required of him. The Attorney-General said"" last night that the Minister must have some reserve power over and above that provided"" in the Act itself. I do not think that it would be wise to give the Minister such apower, and I shall support the amendment, so that all regulations framed under the Bill will require that goods imported orexported shall bear a truthful description.",17
37,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," The honourable member for Moira, whose opposition to the amendment is, I am sure, based on a misconception, should be one of the first to support a proposal to insure a fair deal' to the producers of Australia.",17
38,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,That is what I have been looking for. . Mr KELLY - The honourable member will not insure a fair deal to the producers if he allows the clause to pass in its present form.,17
39,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,I am not going to support any proposal that would really nullifv the object of the Bill .,17
40,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The honourable member has laid stress on the definition of "" trade description"" given in clause 3, but I would point out to him that under this clause a landing waiter-would have a right to say whether the description placed on any goods was not merely true, but "" of the character"" prescribed in the regulations. He would have the right to say, not only whether it was substantially correct, but also whether the statement of the technical details was in the order and sequence required under the regulations. Let me give my honourable friend an illustration of what I mean. Butter, for instance, would certainly require to bear the factory brand, and a description showing whether it was factory, creamerv, or dairy butter. Then perhaps the place of origin, and the State from which the butter had come, would also be required. But unless the clause be amended in the way proposed, a landing waiter will be able to say, simply because any one of these essential items of information has not been given in the order prescribed by regulation, that the butter shall be seized, and in the end it might be forfeited. Surely that is not a position in which the honourable member would like to see the producers of his constituency placed. If the departmental regulations said that the particulars of a trade description were to be set forth in the following order: Brand of factory, description of butter, place of origin, and State of origin, and the producer placed on his packages a description in which the particulars ran : State of origin, place of origin, brand of factory, description of butter, thus transposing the order, a landing waiter could refuse to allow the goods to pass.",18
41,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The officers of the partment are men of common sense.,18
42,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Not all of them. If the intelligence of the Department were so extremely high as to enable us to trust to the judicial intelligence of every officer drawing £ 2 0 r £ 3 per week, it would not be necessary to propose the amendment, because the administration of the 'Act would be as we wish to insure it. In view of the inconvenience which may be caused to his constituents if the clause remains unaltered, the honourable member should be only too anxious to assist those who are supporting the amendment. We ask for a "" true "" trade description; and surelv insistence upon a true trade description will prevent roguery. But the honourable member objects. He says that the clause as it stands will not affect any honest exporter. That being his position, I cannot understand how he can contend that the insertion of the word "" t r u e "" would affect any honest exporter. The Minister tells us that the words which we propose to omit should remain in the clause because they are in the clauses which deal with imports. That is an extraordinary remark for the representative 'of a producing constituency, to make. Although the contention of the minority, that the Bill should seek to protect only our consumers, has been overborne, and we are being asked to deal with exports as well as imports, I should like to know if the health of the people of the countries to which we export should be of more consideration to us than the welfare of our producing classes.",18
43,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,We have our reputation to study.,18
44,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Is it not often stated that the manufacturers of Great Britain are losing ground because they consider their own tastes in the methods of their manufacture rather than the tastes of those for whom they are making!' Are they not blamed because they make their goods, not for their markets, but according to the methods which they think best, without consulting the wishes of those for whom they are intended ? And yet the Government is now asking us to commit the same fault. We must consider the markets to which we send our produce.",18
45,Mr HUGHES,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"In the matter of the size and get-up of packages, and so forth.",18
46,Mr HARPER,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Unde r the Customs Act the size of packages mav be prescribed.,18
47,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The Minister asks for De- still further powers. Packages may be refused for export unless they bear.'a trade description setting forth particulars in a certain sequence.,18
48,Mr HARPER,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The clause deals only with the description.,18
49,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The whole controversy centres in the words "" of such character.'""' We wish to provide simplv that the trade description shall be a ""true"" one, and leave it to the Minister to decide whether it is "" true."" Surely that would give him power to prevent fraud, and to maintain the .quality level of our exports.",18
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The question is: Should the Minister have power to forfeit goods merely because the words of a trade description are misplaced?,18
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I had a consultation with the Comptroller-General on the subject this morning, and he has written the following memorandum:In cases where an Act provides for forfeiture the Department takes the view that forfeiture is not complete unless as the result of action in a Court or in cases where no claim has been made. In any action^ in Court the defendant has his defence, and it is his own fault if he makes no claim for the goods when seized. In all cases of forfeiture there is a case at law, and the forfeiture is hot held by the Department to be complete until the Court has decided that the action of the Department was right.",19
52,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,That explanation gives us the strongest reason for insisting on the amendment. Is a box of fruit to be permitted to miss a steamer because a landing waiter or other Customs official objects to the sequence of the wording of the description upon it ?,19
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Forfeitur e intended to apply to such cases.,19
54,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Seizur e involves forfeiture.,19
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Forfeitur e proceedings must commence with seizure.,19
56,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"We wish to remove this dangerous provision, as it may interfere with our growing exportation of perishable commodities. Although the Comptroller General may not consider the forfeiture complete until the Court has held that the Department were right, if the goods are held back pending inquiry, injury is done to the person who wishes to export them. We have been informed by honourable members who have special knowledge on the subject that sometimes fruit is hanging on the trees within twenty-four hours of its departure in the mail steamers in which it is shipped.",19
57,Mr HARPER,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Will the clause apply to fruit? We do not brand fruit,19
58,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"We do not brand jam, but we brand the packages in which it is put up, and it is the same in regard to fruit. All perishable products are to be branded. If that is not to be done, why has there been all this talk about grading? In view of the fact that we are trying to protect the export trade of Australia, I ask the Minister to allow this reasonable amendment to Dass.",19
59,Mr HUGHES,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I do not know whether the clause will have the effect of enabling the Department to prevent the export of produce in certain packages or boxes, but I do not think that an attempt should be made at absolute uniformity in this matter. It may be most desirable that the butter sent to England shall be packed in a certain way, and that sent to other markets in another way. I was very much struck on reading the report of a British Consul on the Continent of Europe by the statement that the English manufacturer has failed utterly to take the advantages which belong to him, and has lost his market by declining to pack his goods in the manner considered to be most suitable by those who wish to purchase such goods. I expect that before long we shall become large exporters of fruits, dried and otherwise, and the question of capturing markets will depend upon the most delicate details, such as the particular mode of packing adopted, the labels affixed to the goods; whether, for instance, prunes are packed in thin syrup or thick syrup, or without is not syrup at all, and so on. It is neither necessary nor desirable that the Department should interfere with the packing of the goods. All that they can say is that they are advised by their agents in other countries that such and such methods of preparation and packing are most likely to find favour in the markets! The exporter must be as- sumed to be thoroughly advised from all sources as to the-best methods of preparing his goods. If he is not so advised, he will have to pay a very heavy penalty in the shape of losses on his shipments. Therefore it should be sufficient for the Customs authorities to satisfy themselves that the goods bear a full, true, and particular description. For instance, an exporter of jam ought to include in the description on the label a statement that the contents weigh 16 ozs. gross, or net, as the case may be. He ought not to deceive the consumer as""to the actual weight of the contents, but at the same time he should be free to pack his goods in such a way as to cater for the public taste. He should be permitted to amx to his goods any label he pleases, so long as he does not misrepresent their character by making false statements, or telling only a part of the truth. We should He careful to avoid imposing conditions which would have the effect of harassing our exporters. We are already an exporting country, and within a few years almost the whole of our profitable trade will be carried on with people outside. We cannot hope to find a rehonorable munerative home market for one-fiftieth part of what we can produce, and we must look to the world's markets. If an exporter described butter as first-class, or secondthe clause. class, as the case might be, and stated that it contained preservatives in the form of many grains ""of salicylic or boric acid, take it that he would comply with all reawould sonable requirements.",19
60,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The point is that, under the regulations, the exporter might be quired by a landing waiter to give the ticulars in their proper sequence, according to the prescribed description.",20
61,Mr HARPER,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," At first I was inclined to think that the amendment would effect an improvement in the clause; but upon looking into the matter more closely I do not think it is desirable to alter the clause in the direction proposed. If the honourable member for Wentworth had had any practical experience, he would know that a question such as he has reAll ferred to would not be decided by a ing waiter. Such an officer, if he thought that certain articles should be stopped, would refer the question to head-quarters, where the whole matter would be speedily the Minister. dealt with. I can quite conceive of a trade description which would be technitend cally true, and at the same time misbeen leading. I have known of many cases in which only part of the tralia truth has been told, or statements of have been made in such a form as to be leading. The intention is to authorities to insist that the trade descriptions shall not only be true, but definite and did that. clear. Where the Department is satisfied that mistakes have been made through advertence, they will allow the descriptions their wine. to be altered; but if they think that fraud has been attempted, they will visit punishthe ment upon the guilty parties. As a rule, the departmental officers deal reasonably with those as to whose bona fides they satisfied. I do not think that the provision in the clause will prejudicially affect ports such as fruit. If a case of oranges, for instance, were marked as containing fruits, whereas it contained only 100 fruits, the departmental officers might insist the mark being altered in accordance with' the truth, or being obliterated altogether. do not think the clause will affect primary products to the same extent as manufactured articles. I am doubtful as to the necessity of the Bill, and I commend the efforts members to prevent unrestricted power being conferred upon either the Minister or his officers. I do not think, however, that the amendment would improve",20
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I so am disinclined to press the amendment if I the Minister sets his face against it. But I direct the attention of the honourable member for Mernda to the fact that he has dealt with the amendment only from the repoint of view of the Department ; whereas parI am approaching the subject from the stand-point of the exporter. As the honourable member has said, a trade description might be technically true, and yet misleading. But such cases are already provided for in clause 3, which enacts that a false trade description may mean a trade description which, by reason of anything contained therein or omitted therefrom, is likely to mislead. Therefore the Minister would have reserved to him all the necessary power. I am contending for is that in cases landwhere a man may happen to omit from a trade description a word which does not detract from the truth of that description, his goods shall not be liable to seizure by",20
63,Mr BATCHELOR,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I into support the amendment. It has contended by experts in Victoria that wine grown in certain parts of South Aushas been "" salted,"" when as a matter fact its saline properties are derived from misthe soil. No sensible man would delibeenable the rately salt his wines.",20
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,I know a man who,20
65,Mr MALONEY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,They do worse than that. inSome of them add methylated spirits to,20
66,Mr BATCHELOR,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I am speaking of product of the pure juice of the grape. Experts in Victoria have declared that the wine in question has been ""salted."" I are mention this matter because the Minister is seeking to acquire power to compel exexporters to furnish a trade description of the materials or ingredients of which their 120 goods are composed. Under this provision, if the wine to which I have referred were upon exported, its owners would require to include in its trade description a declaration I of its salt ingredients, and that declaration would injuriously affect its sale in the London market. The adoption of the amendment of the honourable member for of Parramatta would overcome that difficulty.",20
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,If the wine contained salt its trade description would not be true if it did not state that fact.,21
68,Mr BATCHELOR,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Not only would its trade description be true in the absence of such a disclosure, but the wine would be perfectly wholesome.",21
69,Mr HUTCHISON,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,It is not necessary to include in a trade description any natural constituent.,21
70,Mr BATCHELOR,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"But analysts differ as to whether the salt contained in the wine to which I refer is a natural constituent. It is very difficult to determine whether it has been derived from the soil or whether it has been added to the wine. The circumstance emphasizes the danger of intrusting to men who cannot possibly be fitted to adjudicate upon all the varieties of exports which will come under their notice the power of prohibiting the export of certain goods. If we provide that a true trade description of all exports shall be given, that ought to be sufficient.",21
71,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," In this discussion we are really "" traversing the same ground that was covered last night in debating the provision relating to imports. If these particular words were objectionable in a clause dealing with imports, which affect our own people, surely they are doubly objectionable in a provision relating to exports. I admit that it is very desirable that we should raise the standard of our exports as much as possible, so as to encourage their consumption. It seems to me, however, that we shall unnecessarily interfere with the development of that trade if we apply to it the arbitrary restrictions which are imposed by this clause. I shall support any amendment which will have the effect of making it less objectionable than it is. Question-That the word "" true"" proposed to be inserted be inserted-put . The Committee divided.

74,Mr LONSDALE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Then the honourable gentleman ought to accept the amendment. He assures us that he has no intention of endeavouring to go beyond the definitions we have prescribed, but he wishes to have the power to do so. No one can say that my proposal is an unfair one. It recognises that Parliament, and not the Minister, is the controlling authority, and if the honourable gentleman does not wish to go outside the scope of the Bill itself in framing the regulations",21

81,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Does the Attorney-GeneComptroller-General ral agree with that view?,22
82,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I have had conversation with the Attorney-General with reference to this subject, and know Australian makers and producers. that there is a difference of opinion as to the law relating to it. We have used the sub-clause word ""knowingly"" in clause 11.",22
83,Mr LONSDALE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,What did the Attorney General sav?,22

85,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,And yet the honorseize able gentleman asks us to accept ances of the Comptroller-General that it is the law. It is ridiculous.,22
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"It is not ridiculous. The Comptroller-General referred words to the custom of the Department, and he Compstates that goods are not actually confisMincated until certain processes have been ob",22
87,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"That is the practice under It the Customs Act, which is different from",22

The Comptrollerthe General, however, spoke of what would be It was contended last night that when goods came within the provisions of sub-clause 2 of clause 7, they alwould be absolutely forfeited unless the were amended as proposed. The reply to this was that under sub-clause 3 be they could be delivered to the owner, and from a conversation which I had this morning with the Comptroller-General and the the Attorney-General, it would appear that is no doubt that if goods were held to up under sub-clause 2, the Comptrollerhad General could allow those goods to be brought in on their description being amended.",22
89,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,That was admitted last night.,22
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,No ; it was am said that the clause would have to be the Deamended to enable that to be done.,22
91,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The object was to make in such circumstances a right inof the Compstead of a privilege.,22
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"In sub-clause 3 of clause 10, we have a similar power revested in the Comptroller-General, or, on from him, the Minister, and I therethat fore think the amendment is unnecessary.",22
93,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE, The view of the legal position taken by the may produce a remarkable state of affairs in rea gard to our exports. It must be remembered that we are dealing now with The Minister tells us that goods seized under 2 will not be forfeited until they are declared by the Court to have been forfeited.,22
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,I said that the forfeiture will not be complete until then.,22
95,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"But the Department may the goods, and hold them until the the assurowner brings a lawsuit.",22
96,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,They are not forfeited when seized.,22
97,Mr MCGAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"A consignment of 1,000 cases of apples may be seized, because the owner, through some accident or oversight, has not had placed on them the exact brand required by the Department. According to the Comptroller-General of Customs, they will not be declared forfeited until the Court has declared that they shall be forfeited; but I would like to know what will be the condition of the fruit when the matter is settled, even if the owner issues his writ on the day of seizure ?",23
98,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The honourable and learned member is stating an impossible case.,23
99,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I am not. Let us suppose that the Department may prescribe that no apples which do not come up to a certain standard shall be exported. That is a reasonable supposition, and the object of such a prescription would be an excellent one. Apples may be brought to a wharf for export, and the officials in charge may say that they are not up to the prescribed standard, or are not branded with the proper description. . Mr STORRER - Le t us divide.",23
100,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Whateve r the rights or wrongs of these proposals may be, the Minister and his friends have a majority behind them, and so they say, "" What is the good of contending for the right view when the decision is predetermined?"" Even though the view which I am expressing may be quite wrong, it is one which is entitled to be put, and which should be considered by the Committee, instead of being voted against mechanically. All that the honourable member for Parramatta proposes, adopting the words which I moved last night in regard to importers, is that the exporter who satisfies the Comptroller General or the Minister that the nonapplication or inaccurate application of a trade description has been the result of an accident, or, at any rate, was not an attempt to defraud or to break the law, shall have his goods returned to him. As the clause stands, goods which have been seized will not be released unless the Minister or Comptroller-General chooses to release them.",23
101,Mr HUTCHISON,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Would either choose otherwise ? ',23
102,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The establishment of the fact that there has been no intent to defraud should give the owner the right to receive back his goods. Their return should not be left entirely to the discretion of the Department. But the Minister refuses to give that right to the man who proves that his violation of the law has been accidental. The reasons for that refusal are beyond my comprehension.,23
103,Mr BAMFORD,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Does the honourable and learned member think that a standard for apples will be prescribed?,23
104,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Yes . The Bill applies to the export of foods, medicines, and manures. Are we going to export medicines? We may before long export manures, because of certain recent developments in the trade; and we are already exporters of foodstuffs. Those of us who have taken an interest in the export of fruit know that harm may be done by the export of fruit of poor quality, and the Bill will be a dead letter unless it is applied to all our staple exports of foodstuffs. I am appealing to the Minister, not in the interests of the importing class, but in the interests of the producers, as a protectionist to a protectionist. If a man proves to the satisfaction of the Minister that his violation of the law is accidental and a mere error, he should have the right to get back his goods.",23
105,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Suppos e the Minister is not satisfied.,23
106,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"If the Minister refused to accept the statement of facts laid before him he could, under the amendment, be charged with maladministration, and the merits of the case would then be thrashed out. Under the clause as it stands, however, he could allege a thousand reasons for refusing to return the goods, none of - which could be challenged. If the exporter places before the Minister in justification of, or excuse for, what has occurred, statements which any reasonable man would believe, and the Minister or his officials refuse to deliver up goods which have been seized, it should be possible to make them responsible for their action. But under the Bill as it stands the return of goods which have been seized will be entirely a matter for the discretion of the Minister. We are entitled to ask for this protection of the producers, no matter how implicitly the present Minister may be trusted by both importers and exporters. Are the producers to be unable to challenge departmental action, when they have proved beyond reasonable doubt that they are entitled to the return of their goods? If the Minister will not accept the amendment, the producers of Australia will know that he is determined that, even where a man proves his innocence to the satisfaction of the Minister or the Comptroller-General, the Department shall have uncontrolled and unlimited discretion to refuse to return the goods. Such a provision is a monstrous one.",23
107,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I hope that the Minister will reconsider this matter. I am quite in favour of conferring upon the Minister power to prohibit the exportation of products if they f all below certain standards, and I would not vote for any amendment that would have the effect of curtailing the Minister's authority in that direction. At the same time, we should not impose any unnecessary disabilities upon our producers. The amendment does not seek to limit the Minister's power to prohibit exports that do not reach the prescribed standard, but it fixes the responsibility for any decision that may be arrived at upon him. If the original wording of the clause be adhered to, it will permit of the white-washing of those who may be guiltv of lax administration, and I do not think we should lend ourselves to anything of that, kind. I am sure that the Minister does not wish to avail himself of any such power, and I trust that he will see his way to accept the amendment.",24
108,Mr HUTCHISON,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," The amendment will not alter the effect of the clause, because it will still rest with the Comptroller-General or the Minister to decide whether or not the goods shall be confiscated.",24
109,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The amendment will make the Minister slower to be careless.,24
110,Mr HUTCHISON,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"We would, not tolerate any Minister or any Comptroller General who confiscated goods without just cause. It is not to be supposed that the Customs authorities would confiscate goods without satisfying themselves beyond all doubt that fraud had been attempted.",24
111,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," In view of the difficulties experienced in the early stages of the administration of the Customs Act, we should be verycareful to insure that all matters involving the forfeiture of goods, or the infliction of heavy penalties, shall receive the prompt attention of the Minister. Under the Bill as it stands all kinds of obstacles will be placed in the way of our producers. Not only will merchants be obstructed, but those who are working on the farm, in the orchard, or in the dairy factory will find themselves hampered at every turn. I do not suggest that the officials of the Customs Department will deliberately inflict injury upon our producing interests, but our experience in the past is sufficient to justify us in insisting that the fullest safeguards shall 'be provided against harsh treatment being meted out to those who may innocently contravene the law. We have no desire whatever to facilitate the operations of dishonest traders or producers, but we should protect by every means in our power the interests of those who make honest mistakes. Those who are supporting the Government in this matter are deliberately acting in a manner inimical to the best interests of the producers and manufacturers of Australia.",24
112,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Nonsense . That is absolutely unfair.,24
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,It is absolutely true.,24
114,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"If we go on piling up regulation after regulation which will impose unnecessary burdens upon and seriously obstruct our trade, we shall inflict great injury upon those classes of the community who, deserve most consideration. We want to get rid of the dishonest trader, and at the same time to interfere as little as possible with legitimate trade and commerce. It was pointed out by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney that our export trade is steadily expanding, but an effort is being made by means of this Bil l to impose all kinds of undesirable^ restrictions upon it. Apparently, honourable members opposite regard every man as a rogue, but I have not such a poor opinion of the people of Australia. I believe that we have in the Commonwealth an overwhelming majority of honest people, whom we should encourage and protect by every means in our power. The object of the amendment is to conserve the interests of the honest producer and manufacturer, but the Minister seems to desire that the Bill should be framed in such a way as to expose our primary producers to the gravest injustice.",24
115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I am very sorry that the honourable member has expressed himself in terms which were quite uncalled for with regard to honourable members who are supporting the Government. If the honourable member looks after the interests of the producer as well as do the honourable members to whom he has referred he will perform very good work. He seems to think that we are endeavouring to hamper our export trade by imposing all sorts of unnecessary restrictions, but I would direct his attention to an article which was recently published in the Review of Reviews, according to which the majority of producers in New Zealand are submitting to restrictive measures, such as those provided for in the Bill, with a view to placing their export trade upon a sound and satisfactory footing. An article recently published in the Sydney Morning Herald reads as follows :As State supervision and the grading of dairy products extends, the unqualified success which marks its progress is causing its opponents more anxiety.",24
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I rise to a point of order. We are not discussing the question of grading or branding of produce for export, and we have nothing whatever to do with what has taken place in New Zealand. Therefore I submit that the Minister is out of order.",25
117,The CHAIRMAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I understood the Minister to be replying to the general remarks of the honourable member for-Koovong. As the Minister was specially attacked, I do not consider that he is overstepping the bounds of order.",25
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"-The quotation which I was making when I was interrupted readsAs State, supervision and the grading of dairy products extends, the unqualified success which marks its progress is causing its opponents more anxiety. The improvement in Queensland butter which followed the introduction of Mr Denham's measure of legislation, is now making serious demnnds upon the ingenuity and imagination of the anti-graders. What is the nature of that legislation? contains"" this provisionIt shall not be lawful to export beyond the monwealth any dairy produce, the produce of State, until the same has been inspected, graded, and marked, under this Act, and no butter be shipped at a higher temperature than 40 degrees. Dairy produce, requiring to be inspected and graded, shall be graded according to quality, and shall be marked by the inspector, according taken, not only by New Zealand to the classes into which it has been graded, accordance with the prescribed mark. That is the legislation which has been operative in Queensland during the past four months, and the quotation I have made is taken from an article which was pubwhere lished in the Sydney Morning Herald on gent. 18th September, of the present year, dealing with the result of the compulsory grading and marking. '",25
119,Mr ROBINSON,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Do the Government favour compulsory grading?,25
120,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I am replying to the remarks made by the honourable member for Kooyong in regard to the attitude taken up by Ministers and their supporters towards the compulsory provisions of this Bill. I claim that the legislation which is operative in Queensland is practically identical with the Government proposals in this measure. I hold in my hand a copy, of the Review of Reviews for the present month, which contains an article upon the New Zealand grading system. In that country the Government have adopted even more stringent measures than we propose to take with regard to the grading and general treatment of produce which is intended for export. The article statesIrom this searching investigation, and complete form of instruction, New Zealand butter has risen in value beyond the most sanguine expectations. You will understand that when I tell you that the supervision has been able to raise the standard of our exports to such an extent that 07 per cent, of the butter is first grade.",25
121,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Who savs that?,25
122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The author of the article is Mr John Holmes. He continuesIndeed, I might go further, and tell you that the confidence which this grading has secured is established by the fact that produce merchants in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Bristol, and other places in the United Kingdom, regularly purchase for cash the whole six months' output (a season's shipment) at fixed price, f.o.b., shipping port in New Zealand. No evidence could be stronger of the efficacy of the giading.",25
123,The CHAIRMAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,I scarcely think that the matter which the Minister is disIt cussing is before the Chair.,25
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I haw made the Comabove quotations 'with a view to rebutting a the statements of the honourable member for Kooyong with respect to the probable effect shall of imposing restrictions upon the exports of Australia. I could cite a great many more authorities, showing that the action and in Queensland, but also by Victoria and South Australia, has had the effect of insuring the landing of their produce in the markets of the world in a better condition than has characterized the products of other States the supervision exercised is less strin",25
125,Mr LEE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Does the Minister make that statement seriously ?,26
126,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"For a considerable time the price commanded by New Zealand produce has been higher than that realized by New South Wales . exports. However, I shall not pursue that aspect of the subject any further. I have simply made these remarks with a view to rebutting the statements of the honourable member for Kooyong. It has been declared that the object of the amendment, which is a very similar one to that which was proposed in clause 7, is to prevent the Department from acting in a way which' might prove injurious to the exporter. But does anybody suppose that the Department would in any way restrict the export of the produce of Australia? It is simply absurd to imagine that either the officers of the Department or the Minister would lend themselves to anything of the kind. In spite of all that has been said in regard to my administration, I say that there is nobody who b prepared to do more to assist in developing the export of the natural and manufactured products of Australia than I am. An attempt has been made by some honourable members to place a fanciful interpretation upon the words of this clause. The Customs Department will meet the exporters in every possible way. clause is designed to protect the producers generally from the injurious consequences of acts committed by persons who do not care whether they destroy our commerce or not. As was stated by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, the object of the amendment is to prevent the Department from seizing any goods for export, if the Minister or his officers-eithe r one or both-ar e satisfied that the owner of the goods has unwittingly allowed a false trade description to be placed upon them. Does anybody suppose that the Minister or the Department-if they were convinced that there was no intention to deceive-woul d attempt to detain perishable goods?",26
127,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Then why does not the Minister agree to the amendment?,26
128,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,It is the duty of the Minister in charge of any Bill to see that it is not manipulated in such a way as to render it unworkable.,26
129,Mr ROBINSON,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,How would the amendment make the measure unworkable?,26
130,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,It might not make it absolutely unworkable.,26
131,Mr ROBINSON,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,It would minimize the chances of oppression.,26
132,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"No oppression is likely to be resorted to. At the same time, the - Minister has a right to say whether the law has been complied with. So long as it is complied with, there is not the slightest danger of any restrictions of an arbitrary character being imposed upon our export trade. Only a year or two ago I had to deal with the marking of certain packages or tins which were imported into Australia by one or two tobacco firms. Those firms complied with the provisions of the Customs Act, but they did so ini such a way that it was necessary to use a microscope in order to discover the letters upon the tins. If the Department had not possessed power to compel them to mark those tins in a proper way, theywould have complied with the law; but the public would not have been protected.",26
133,Mr HUTCHISON,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,That shows the necessity for the Bill.,26
134,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"On e of thesefirms was a large one, and its memberswere very angry with me because I compelled them to alter their labels upon the tins so that the public could see them. All that the Department desire is that our exports shall be of a standard quality, so Ths that no injury may accrue to the trade. I am just as strong as is the honourable member for Gippsland in my desire to do nothing to hamper the business of the exporters. If the Committee will agree to the clause in its present form, and I subsequently find that, without injuring its effectiveness, we can alter its wording insuch a way as to dissipate the dread which is in the minds of some honourable members, I shall be pleased to recommit it. It has been said that the Bill puts great power intothe hands of the Customs officials-. But I would ask honourable members to bear in mind that, if effect were given to all the powers conferred by the Licensing Act, it would be impossible'for anybodv to conduct an hotel. In the same way, nobody imagines that if the provisions of the Customs Act were carried out in their entirety the commerce of the country would not be terribly hampered. When honourable members cast aspersions on my administration of the Customs Department, I may tell them that I have received from the commercial community of Australia, and from the Chambers of Commerce; the most flattering references to my administration. . Mr KNOX - Hear , Hear. ^ Mr LONSDALE - The Minister can also obtain the reverse testimony.",26
135,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"In connection with the regulations which will be framed under this Bill, and which will require to be submitted to Parliament for its approval, I merely desire to say that the toms officials will not have an opportunity of dealing harshly with the exporters-reven if they were so inclined.",27
136,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I venture to say that the Minister has wholly misconceived the object that I have in view in supporting the amendment. I am as strongly convinced as he is of the necessity to fix proper standards for exports. In that respect I may differ from manv of my honourable friends of the Opposition: but had I not been thoroughly convinced of the necessity to fix standards of purity and excellence for exports, I should not have given instructions for the drafting of this Bill. I believe that I am really more convinced than is the Minister himself of the need to take action in this regard, because in certain respects he has already weakened the measure in a way that I should not have clone had I remained in office. My intention was that the Bill should provide the nucleus of a Department of Agriculture; but my honourable friend has transformed it into something of the nature of a Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill. I would point out to him that if the amendment be carried, he will still be the supreme judge of whether the goods in question comply with the regulations. speaking from personal experience of the working of the Department.",27
137,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,And I pay greatest respect to the honourable member's opinions.,27
138,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"My honourable friend knows that, although the Comptroller General is named in the clause, the administration of the measure will have to be intrusted to officers at the various ports from which exports are made. While I was Acting Minister of External Affairs, a case came under my notice, in which the Commonwealth had been brought into disrepute in the eyes of the world, owing to an error of judgment on the part of an officer stationed at a distant port. I refer to the case of the blind man, Mcintosh. The matter never came under my notice until the harm had been done, and the consequence was that, owing to this slight error of judgment-a n error into which an officer might naturally) fall-grea t harm was done to the reputation of the Commonwealth. In the same way, trouble might arise under this clause. A producer might send his products to a port for export, and an officer of the Department, either Cus- from mistaken zeal or because the goods did not strictly comply with the requirements of the law, might proceed to forfeit them, leaving the exporter no opportunity to put his case before the Minister. Such an incident would be quite possible under the clause as it stands. The amendment, however, proposes that the Minister shall give the owner of products which are threatened with confiscation the right to put his case before the Department. The Department is still to be the supreme judge. If the Minister considered there had been an evasion of the law, he would naturally support the action of the officer; but in that event he would act with full knowledge of the case, and would accept the responsibility for his action. If the clause were allowed to remain as_it stands, an officer at a distant port might forfeit, say, perishable goods without bringing the case under the notice of the Minister, and it might subsequently be found that a serious mistake had been made, with the result that an individual had perhaps been ruined. The Minister would then come down to Parliament, and say, "" I never knew anything about the forfeiture,"" and Parliament would whitewash him. That should not be possible. I desire to protect the producer, I am as far as he can be protected, consistently with strict compliance with the law, as the Minister wishes it to be administered. I simplv wish to give the producer a right the to state his case in such a way that it must come before the Minister, so that the latter will have a full knowledge of the circumstances, , and accept the responsibility of any action he may take with regard to it. ' If he considered there was an evasion of the law, he could proceed to confiscate the goods, while if , on the other hand, he was satisfied that an error had been innocently committed he would save the party concerned from the loss of his goods. The amendment is a reasonable one, which will insure proper inquiry before drastic action is taken. My honourable friend should not object to such a safeguard in the interests of the producer, seeing that his power and that of his Department wiil not be weakened. His opposition to. the amendment suggests that he is afraid of the responsibility which it would impose upon him; but I think he is too strong a man to be influenced by such considerations. He must remember that it is a very serious matter that a producer should run the risk of having his goods confiscated without being heard, and perhaps in the absence of a valid reason for their confiscation. I confess that, although the equities may be the same, I feel much more strongly with regard to this amendment than I did in reference to that proposed in the clause relating to imports. It may be that I am more familiar with the position of our exporters : but I know how they will regard such a clause as this. It is the imposition of unnecessary restrictions that frightens the producers, and causes many of them to be opposed to supervision of any kind. I am strongly in favour of Government supervision over exports and the fixing of standards, for I know that the system has raised the reputation of the products of the United States of America in the markets of the world to such an extent as to more than justify the application of a very stringent law. Such laws, indeed, have been more than iustified, wherever they have been brought into operation; but let us, in mercy's name, refrain from encumbering a Bill providing for Government supervision with oppressive provisions that are not essential to its per administration.",27
139,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I know that the honourable member for Gippsland is in full sympathy with the producers, and I should like to meet him as far as I possibly can. At 'the present moment I do not feel 'disposed to accept the amendment; but in view of the honourable member's statement, and because, like him, I am anxious ducers shall not be unduly alarmed at the provisions of the Bill, I shall have the matter thoroughly investigated, and shall probably submit an amendment calculated to remove all fears in this regard, if such an amendment can be drafted. I shall be quite prepared to recommit this part of the clause, so that after I have inquired whether it can be modified to meet the views of honourable members, they will have another opportunity to vote upon it, provided that we cannot come to an agreement.",28
140,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," Judgin g from some remarks made this afternoon by the Minister, the honourable gentleman is under the impression that certain observations which I made this morning with reference to the administration of his Department had a personal application.",28
141,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,I did not think so.,28
142,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I wish to assure the honourable gentleman that I did not intend in any way to reflect upon him. He was quite justified in saying that the Chambers of Commerce recognise that his first accession to office as Minister of Trade and Customs was followed by a moderate, rational, and business-like administration of the Department. I do not make that statement with' any desire to cast reflections on his predecessor ; but I do say that the mercantile community recognise that he has administered the Department on equitable lines. They also recognise that he showed a desire to meet the wishes of the deputation from the Chambers of Commerce, which recently waited upon him. I wished to make it thoroughly clear that the remarks which I made this morning had no personal application.",28
143,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I accept the honourable member's assurance; as a matter of fact, I was not referring to him.",28
144,Mr CROUCH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE, I think that the Minister should agree to postpone the clause.,28
145,The CHAIRMAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"As the clause has pro- been amended, it cannot be postponed.",28
146,Mr CROUCH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I understand that the honourable member, for Kooyong will in any event ask that it be recommitted.",28
147,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I have already said that if I can secure the framing of an amendment that will allay the fears of the producers, I shall be glad to submit it to the Committee. In any case, if requested, I shall recommit this portion cf the clause, in order that we may deal with that the prothis particular question.",28
148,Mr CROUCH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I desire an amendment of this kind to be made, as much in the interests of the Department as in those of the produceYs themselves. It seems to me that the only circumstances in which the Minister will be able to avoid forfeiting goods coming within the provisions of this clause are those set out in sub-clause 3; but if the word "" s h all "" were substituted for the word "" may,"" the position would be altogether different. There is a great difference between the amendment now before the Chair and that which it was proposed last night to make in clause 7.",28
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I am satisfied with the assurance given by the Minister. I wish' him to understand that there are no such provisions as these in any Acts of the States. Fines and other penalties are provided for, but there is no such drastic provision as is contained here. I am sure that when the Minister looks into the matter he will ccme to the same opinion that we hold. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM agreed toThat the word "" proclamation,"" line 20, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" regulations.""",29
150,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," As the Minister proposes to redraft the clause, I would direct his attention to the inconsistency between the mode of procedure here provided for in regard to exports, and that provided for in regard to imports.",29
151,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I will look into the matter. I think that there is a reason for the difference. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 11 (Penalty for applying false trade description to exports).",29
152,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," The penalty provided for in the clause is to be imposed, not only for knowingly applying any false trade description, but also for knowingly exporting, or entering for export, or putting on any ship for export, goods to which a false trade description is applied. Does the word ""knowingly "" in paragraph b apply to each of these actions or only to knowingly exporting goods to which a false trade description is applied?",29
153,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,To each of these actions. Clause agreed to. Clause 12 (Exportation of falsely marked goods).,29
154,Mr ROBINSON,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I hope that the Minister will consider the promise he made in regard to clause 10 in connection with this clause also. Clause agreed to. Clause 13Any goods intended for export, which have been inspected in pursuance of this Act, may in manner prescribed be marked with any word, figure, or mark, for the purpose of indicating the quality, class, or grade of the goods.",29
155,Mr ROBINSON,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I hope that there will be some debate, and a division, on this clause. On the second reading the Government were asked as to whether it was intended by the Bill to provide for the Commonwealth grading of exports. One Minister denied that the Bill would have any such effect, and others said that it would have that effect, while the Attorney-General said both that it would and would not have that effect. This clause provides beyond all manner of doubt that goods intended for export may, in rrianner prescribed, be graded. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in speaking of-this matter, is reported to have saidLYNE) page 1035 of HansardIs there anything in tfie Bill which can be construed by a sane man as a provision for the compulsory grading of butter. . '. . No sane man out of Parliament would'think that such a thing is possible. It is plain, however, that the clause gives the Government power to grade. The constituents whom I represent get their livelihood wholly from the soil. They do not believe in the grading of produce, and they expect me to voice their feeling on the subject. I did sd. in the State Parliament, and I intend to do so here. I shall divide the Committee against the clause. It does not seem to me that the branding of exports with the Commonwealth, brand will enable a higher price to be obtained for our produce, and the system of grading may cause a goodi deal of trouble.",29
156,Mr LEE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I understood the Minister to say that there was to be no Commonwealth grading, but the clause provides for grading, and the Minister some time ago read a number of articles and letters to prove that the grading of our exports is the proper thing to provide for. In Victoria, I believe, grading is done by officials of 'the State, though I do not know that it is compulsory; but in Queensland State grading is compulsory, and the - Minister read an extract from a letter published in a newspaper, in which the writer tried to show that beneficial results are obtained from it. In South Australia, too, there is State grading, and the people seem to be satisfied with the system. In New South Wales, however, there is no Government interference - There is a system in vogue there which is far before any system of Government interference, co-operative companies taking the work of distribution into their hands, appointing their own salesmen, and sending their butter to the markets of the world themselves. On the 4th August last, at the most representative conference of butter factory delegates yet held, the following resolution was unanimously carried, and signed by the delegates for subland, mission by deputation to the Premier of the State:That, while this representative gathering of delegates from thirty-one co-operative butter tories approves of any legislation for safeguardister ing the health of the people, it considers that compulsory grading of butter by Government officials is unnecessary, and an undue interference with an important industry. Those delegates represent factories which produce over 10,000 tons of butter a year, that the approximate value of which at 9^d. per lb. exceeds £900,000.",29
157,Mr TUDOR,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,They have not grading in Victoria.,30
158,Mr LEE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The Minister tried to prove that the superior quality of New Zealand butter is owing to the Government grading there, and that 90 per cent, of that butter is now first-class because of that grading; but at Earl's Court, London, as the result of a test, butter from a New South Wales factory beat the New Zealand and Victoindorsement, rian butter which was exhibited. In order that grading may be efficient, every churnvernment ing should be graded. That is what done in New Zealand. But how would it be possible for a Commonwealth official to grade 4,000 or 5,000 boxes of butter which had been brought to a wharf for export? The provisions of the measure would be unworkable, unless the Department took the guarantee of the factories or the ping companies that the butter was of good quality - My experience is that many of the Government experts are incompetent tb fix a standard ? properly grade. A dairy expert who says that it is sufficient to send cream to a tory twice a week proves that he is incomI petent. So opposed are the people of New South Wales to grading that the State vernment has not dared to bring in a Dairy Bill to provide for grading, and the Comclasses, monwealth would be acting unfairly if by this back-door method, interfered with the business methods of that State against the wishes of its people. Those in the dairying industry there have built it up without Government coddling or assistance. The State has not voted them even sixpence. Why, then, should the Commonmeaning wealth now try to take the control of the industry out of their hands? Is this protrade posal made to provide billets for officials? Several of the States have already made arrangements for grading.",30
159,Mr TUDOR,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Whic h ""States?",30
160,Mr LEE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,South Australia and Queensand there is a Bill before the Victorian Parliament to provide for grading.,30
161,Mr TUDOR,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,No .,30
162,Mr LEE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Suc n ""a Bill is to be introfacduced. In providing for grading, the Minis entering upon a task which he will the be unable to carry into effect, and is acting unjustly ""towards those who are carrying on their industry in their own way.",30
163,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," The clause is somewhat difficult to understand. It savs Goods intended for export, which have been inspected in pursuance of this Act, may in manner compulsory prescribed be marked. I wish to know ""by whom the goods are to be .marked. Is the owner to be permitted to attach his own mark in accordance with the regulations, or is it intended that the Department shall place a Government grading mark upon the goods? If it is intended that the owners shall grade their own goods, without any Government the clause will become inoperative. If , on the other hand, the Goare to be entitled to place their is grading mark on the goods, a system of grading pure and simple will be introduced.",30
164,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," The intention is to arrive at some understanding with exporters as to the trade description to be adopted, but the Government will have the shipright to say what that mark shall be.",30
165,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Is it intended to grade the goods in different classes, or merely to",30
166,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"It is intended facto attach to the goods a trade description. have always held that the system we propose to adopt will, to a certain extent, inGovolve grading. Possibly the Bill confers power to grade the goods into different but it is not proposed to carry out it, that system at present. The intention is to adhere to the trade descriptions that may be agreed upon after consultation with engaged the persons interested.",30
167,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I contend that the provision as It stands conveys no such as the Minister has indicated. I understand that the intention is to attach descriptions which will indicate not only the kind of goods but the class to which they belong. For instance, butter would be branded as butter class 1 or class '2, as the case might be. I have always agreed with the view that a minimum standard should be fixed, and that goods falling below that standard should ndt be exported. As the clause stands, goods of any quality may be exported, provided they are properly marked. I am quite prepared to empower the Minister to fix a minimum standard, but once that standard is complied with, sellers should be allowed to determine how far they would go above that standard. If exports are graded, buyers will never pay more than a certain price for a particular grade, no matter how high the quality, but if goods fall below the grade they will pay less for them. Therefore the seller will never gain, but may be subjected to serious loss. The clause as it stands does not convey what the Minister desires. It means something which neither the Minister nor the country want. I would urge the Minister to abandon the clause, and substitute a provision for fixing a minimum standard. No one can determine what the clause means until the High Court has given its decision, and that tribunal will know only because it will be the last to speak. Will the Minister accept an amendment providing for a minimum standard?",30
168,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,No .,31
169,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"If the Minister desires to pass the clause as it stands, honourable bers are entftled to know what it means. At present it is so vague that it is impossible to ascertain what is intended by it, how it will be interpreted, how the officers of the Department will construe it, or what will be done. In one aspect of the clause it would be possible to do anything in the way of grading goods. The Government might establish ten or twenty grades of butter. The Minister must know from his experiences of grading how expert opinions vary. There is no difficulty, however, in determining whether an article is, or is not, good enough for export. The Minister has, on the whole, been very reasonable, and I ask him not to spoil a good record by taking up an attitude of obstinacy in this matter. Will he undertake to recommit the clause for the consideration of amendments ?",31
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I would point that out to the honourable and learned member to make it. for Corinella that grading is in operation at the present moment in Victoria. Accordsent ing to the statement. I read the other day, a number of products are being systematiducers ? cally graded. In regard to mutton and lamb it is statedMutton and lamb : prime, good', and plain. In each of these qualities there are the following distinctions of weight :"" A"" 28 to 35 lbs. "" B"" 36 to 42 lbs. "" H"" Over 42 lbs. "" L"" Under 28 lbs. Then again in the case of rabbits the grading is carried out as follows :Rabbits are branded in Black, signifying "" best,"" and in Red, signifying "" seconds,"" and words ""second grade."" Each quality is divided according to weight, into"" L a r g e "" ... ... Over 2^ lbs. "" Y o u n g "" ... ... 2 to 24 lbs. "" Small"" i± to 2 lbs. But in ""seconds,"" instead of ""large,"" etc., they are numbered size 1, 2, or 3.",31
171,Mr ROBINSON,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Is not that voluntary grading ? - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I do not see that that makes any difference. It only shows that . the. producers are voluntarily submitting to the grading of their goods. I cannot see the force of the arguments of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. The clause reads as follows: Any goods intended for export, which have been inspected in pursuance to this Act, may in manner mem- prescribed be marked",31
172,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,B v whom?,31
173,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"B y the Government, of course, after consultation with the producers. . Mr LEE - Some producers may be hundreds of miles awav.",31
174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Honourable members are raising the silliest of objections. The clause proceedswith any word, figure, or mark, for the purpose of indicating the quality, class, or grade of the goods. Any one of three things may be done, or both the quality and class of the same goods may be indicated. In regard to some classes of goods the quality only would be indicated, in others the weight only would be given, and under the clause we should have power to vary the marks as circumstances might suggest. It appears to me the clause is as definite as it is possible",31
175,Mr CROUCH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Would the Minister conto provide that the marks should be applied with the concurrence of the pro,31
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,No ; I could not consent to the insertion of any words that would give the producers control over the Government.,32
177,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The Government is to control the producer?,32
178,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The Government is to control the marks placed upon the goods.,32
179,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Coul d the producer refuse to have his goods marked?,32
180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,No .,32
181,Mr LEE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Then the gf*ading would be compulsory.,32
182,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I did not say anything to the contrary. I would remind honourable members that the Government are assuming a grave responsibility in this matter. If the Government 'brand were affixed to inferior, deleterious, or impure goods, the Government would be held blameworthy, and therefore they must exercise some control apart from any dictation on the part of the producers. The regulations will be framed in the fairest possible manner, and will be submitted to Parliament for its approval. Therefore, I do not think that the producers will be exposed to any danger. I would ask why it is that six months' supplies are ordered in New Zealand by London buyers? It is because the quality of the goods exported is guaranteed by the Government brand. If the Government did not take the responsibility in connection with the marking of the goods, the purchasers would not be so ready to order supplies for long periods ahead.",32
183,Mr LEE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I can make contracts covering twelve months for the supply of butter bearing New South Wales brands, which are not supplemented by, any Government mark.",32
184,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The honourable aware of that. member may be a superior person. With regard to the request for recommittal, I not intend 'to recommit every clause. have met those who have made suggestions in the fairest possible way, and I shall presently meet the deputy leader of the Opposition by agreeing to the insertion a new clause. But, seeing that there can is effected. be no misconception as to the meaning of this provision, I do not think I should asked to consent to its recommittal. Its intention is as clear as possible, and is an absolute necessity to have such a vision in the Bill .",32
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Parramatta) The .Minister of Trade and Customs is perfectly right. The meaning of this clause is absolutely plain. It is clear that it goes a great deal further than any State Acts attempt to go. It is a great pity that the Minister did not read to the Committee the report which his departmental officers have placed in his hands. Instead of doing so, he merely read a few sentences in reference to the matter of grading. I have here the full report of his officers. In regard to South Australia, that document states that, when asked for by the shipper, grading takes place, and certain things are done. In Victoria an Act was passed in 1898, called the Exporters' Produce Act. Compulsory inspection under this Act takes place in the case of butter and cheese intended for export, but there is no provision for compulsory grading. There is an inspection for the purpose of ascertaining that the food which is intended for export is of good quality. The Minister has quoted figures with a view to showing what are the weights of certain kinds of lamb. I am informed that lamb of the lighter weights is very much superior to lamb of the heavier weight. Consequently it does not follow that the grading of lamb in this way indicates the quality of the produce. The Minister, however, proposes to stamp the qualitv of the produce upon the packages in which it is shipped. The report goes on to say that grading is not undertaken in Victoria except at the request of the shippers. It , is not compulsory.",32
186,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,I never said that it was. Mr JOSE PH COOK - But the Minister is seeking power in this Bill to make it compulsory.,32
187,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,I am perfectly well,32
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Then the Minisdo ister should not say that he is merely seekI ing to acquire the same powers which are already operative in some of the States.,32
189,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"As the result of the of operation of the Victorian law, a grading",32
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"But the Minisbe ter proposes to grade goods in respect of size, quality, &c. That involves something there more than a mere marking of goods. He proproposes to establish standards, and to have those standards marked upon the goods 2700 Commerce [REPRESENTATIVES.] themselves. With regard to Queensland, the report statesNothing in this Act shall oblige any person to cause any dairy produce to be graded, but if required to be inspected and graded, it shall be ject to this Act. It will thus be seen that in all these cases the grading of goods is a voluntary act on the part of the exporters.",32
191,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,In New it is compulsory.,33
192,Mr TOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I congratulate the Minister upon having discovered that it is compulsory in that colony. In all the States of the Commonwealth it is optional. It is unwise to arm ourselves with these drastic powers, and I am perfectly certain that our action will be bitterly resented by the States. In Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia, matters are progressing satisfactorily enough; why, then, should we impose upon the Slates additional legislation of a much more stringent character? If the Minister can show that these further and drastic powers are necessary, honourable members upon this side of the Chamber might be prepared to meet him. But the weight of testimony is that the grading which already takes place in the States is quite sufficient and quite satisfactorv.",33
193,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I 'sympathize very much with the position of the Minister. He was not responsible for the drafting of the Bill, and he has had it placed in his hands without any knowledge of the original intention of its authors. I think that this clause goes much further than there is any real necessity to go. It appears to me that what the Commonwealth should do is to establish a standard below which the export of produce should not be permitted, or, if permitted, we should clearly indicate that the produce is not exported as fit for human consumption. Having fixed that standard, we should be going out of our way if we attempted to establish the different grades of commodities which were fit for human consumption, and the export of which was permitted. Any such attempt would throw upon the Commonwealth Government the responsibility of fixing 'the exact, value of every commodity exported. That would be going a great deal further? than there is any real necessity for, and much further than we have power to go. Besides, it would in many respects result in discrediting the judgment of the Commonwealth inspectors, because, as the honourable member for Moira Bill (No. 2). is aware, some, of these commodities would deteriorate after they had been marked. If they were branded first, second, third, or fourth grade, and some of them subsesubquently fell to a still lower grade, that fact would be discovered, and the judgment of the .Commonwealth classifiers would consequently be brought into disrepute. All that it is necessary for us to do is fo establish a' standard of excellence with which all foodZealand stuffs must comply, and to provide that if anything is exported below that standard, it must bear a discrediting mark upon it.",33
194,Mr CROUCH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Was there any provision of that sort in the Bill which was prepared at the instance of the honourable member?,33
195,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I gave rough instructions to have a Bill drafted. When that measure came into my hands, it did not comply with my intentions by a very long way. Accordingly, I intended to thoroughly revise it before submitting it to my colleagues for approval, but I was denied the opportunity of so doing. As a result, it was put into the hands of the present Minister in a very crude form. He did not know my intentions in the matter, and consequently I sympathize with his poj sition. I am anxious to assist him to make the Bill effective for the purposes for which it was intended. I desire to insure that no Australian products shall be sent abroad which are likely to bring discredit upon our export trade, and to lower the value of our products in the outside markets. I wish to maintain a reasonably high standard for all the produce that we export. But having fixed that standard, and having forbidden the export of any product which falls below it, except under certain conditions, I think that we ought not to be asked to go further.",33
196,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," The honourable member has disclaimed that he"", at any time revised the Bill from which a good many of these clauses have been taken. He declares that he gave instructions to his officers to prepare that measure. For the information of honourable members, I shall again read one of the clauses which the original Bill contained. It is as follows :Any goods intended for export which have been inspected in pursuance of this Act may in manner prescribed be marked with any word, figure, or mark for the purpose of indicating the quality or grade of the goods.",33
197,Mr FISHER,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,That in no way affects the honourable member.,33
198,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"But the honourable member for Gippsland instructed his officeis to prepare that Bill. I do not for a moment impugn his statement that he had no opportunity of revising it. The New Zealand Act contains the following provision: No product sha'l be shipped or placed on board any ship for exportation to any place beyond New Zealand unless it bears the prescribed stamp or mark, or the certificate in writing as to quality or condition, signed by the officer duly authorized in that behalf under this Act.",34
199,Mr WILKS,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,They grade at the factories there.,34
200,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"It may be that the Department will take the opportunity to have the grading carried out at the factories. I have quoted this section to show that the grading and marking provisions of the law which have accomplished so much good in the case of New Zealand products are of a compulsory character. I will not promise at the present time to recommit the clause under consideration, but when I move to recommit the two clauses to which I am already pledged, it will be within the power of any honourable member to take action in that direction. That will give honourable members an opportunity to test an amendment in the clause.",34
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The gentleman might say, in the event of the amendment being carried, "" I will surrender the Bill . """,34
202,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I shall say nothing of the kind, but shall be prepared to accept the decision of the House. I. do not promise to agree to an alteration of the clause, but I shall be prepared in any reasonable way to accept the decision of the House, and subsequently the decision of the Committee, in reference to - it. I do not think I should be asked to do more than that.",34
203,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I quite agree that the wording of the clause may give rise to some alarm on the part of the producers and exporters of goods. I therefore suggest that it would be desirable to amend it so that it would readAny goods intended for export, which have been inspected in pursuance of this Act, shall have a trade description attached, as may be prescribed.",34
204,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,That is what is provided in the clause as it stands.,34
205,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"It is practically the wording of the New Zealand Act. It is the verbiage of the clause that suggests, that the Government propose to attempt fo grade these goods for export. I do not think, however, that the Department could, of its own volition, attempt to grade goods in the literal sense of the word.",34
206,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Is the honourable member in favour of the Commonwealth grading exports into different classes?,34
207,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,No . I favour grading only so far as the inspection of exports must necessarily lead to their classification.,34
208,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,This clause means either what is feared or nothing.,34
209,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"That is why I wish our intention to be clearly stated. It has been said that grading is carried on under the Victorian Act. As a matter of fact, however, we have no compulsory grading. The grading that takes place is the result of the inspection, and is simply a classification of the goods. Take, for instance, the classification of Iambs for export.",34
210,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,That classification refers only to the weight and the age of the lambs.,34
211,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"But we cannot get away from the fact that it leads to grading, although it is grading that is not compulsory.",34
212,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"It is not a grading as to quality. honourable Mr KENNEDY - That is the point"". The objection to the wording of the clause is that it might lead to the belief that Government grading was intended. All that we need to provide is that goods of Australian origin intended for export shall bear a true trade description.",34
213,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Clause 10 already provides for that.,34
214,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,But it is not stated with sufficient clearness.,34
215,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,I am quite prepared to consider the honourable member's suggestion. At present it seems to me that his proposed amendment differs very slightly from the clause itself. The only point is that it might allay the fears that have arisen.,34
216,Mr KENNEDY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"That is my object. I make the suggestion in all earnestness, because I think it is to be regretted that we should differ on non-essentials. It is fair to assume that we are doing our best to make the Bill a workable one, and I think that all we need to provide in this clause is that exports shall bear a trade description conveying an intimation of what they really purport to be. I hold, however, that inspection is absolutely necessary. In the early days of the frozen meat industry of Victoria our reputation was seriously affected by the action of those who, in an effort to make money, shipped inferior meat to London. Under the present system of inspection, however, we are once more building up a reputation for our meat, butter, and other food products, and it would be a pity if we allowed anything to be done that would damage that reputation. The object of the Bill is to prevent inferior goods of Australian origin being sent into the markets of the world, but we ought not to draw fine lines of distinction as to quality. I trust that the Minister will carefully consider the clause, and see whether an amendment cannot be made that will meet the wishes of the Committee.",34
217,Mr BATCHELOR,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"- I would point out to the honourable member for Moira that, whilst it is true that the reputation of Australian commodities on the markets of the world hus probably been injured by the export of inferior goods, there is nothing in the Bill that would put an end to such practices. All that it provides is that our exports shall bear labels showing what their classification is. Once they leave our shores, however, the labels may be removed. We have no guarantee that when they are placed on the markets of England they will bear the brands that they had at the port of shipment. It must, therefore, be recognised that the proposed system of inspection will not promote the interests of the producers in the smallest degree. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then how is the position to be met?",35
218,Mr BATCHELOR,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"It cannot be met, except by the action of the Legislatures of the countries to which our exports are consigned. The developments that have taken place during the consideration of the Bill have certainly surprised me. We were told at the outset that it did not provide for Government grading; but now we find that this clause could have been inserted for no other purpose. After the goods have been inspected they are to have marks or labels placed upon them, indicating that they belong to certain grades. After the explanation made by the honourable member for Gippsland, one can understand how this ill-digested measure came to be introduced. I am not casting any blame on the Minister. Probably he imagined when he took office that the draft Bill had been well considered, but his views regarding its scope and intention have very materially changed since its introduction. I must confess that my own opinions with regard to it have also undergone a considerable change. The more we consider it the more must we be convinced that it is not likely to serve a useful purpose. It cannot be too strongly impressed upon honourable members that the. excellent provisions with respect to grading that have been adopted in the States are purely voluntary. Any one who exports through the agency of the Export Department of South Australia must submit to certain conditions as to grading; but an exporter is not compelled to avail himself of the services of that Department. The fact that many consigments are sent direct to London without passing through the Government Dep6t keeps the Government graders up to the mark, because they know that the goods passing through their hands will have to compete with those sent through other agencies. Under this Bill, however, it is proposed that all our exports shall be graded, and there will be no competition to stimulate the Government graders to perform their work efficiently. I am convinced that the conditions at present prevailing in, at least, some of the States, are infinitely better than any likely to be brought about by the passing of this Bill.",35
219,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," It is necessary that the Minister should consider this question from the point of view of the tremendous responsibility which the Government are proposing to take upon themselves. The deputation from the Chambers of Commerce which recently waited upon the honourable gentleman pointed out the objections to Government grading, and the Minister then replied that he was not in favour of such a system.",35
220,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,I did not.,35
221,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The honourable gentleman said that the desire was to have goods so marked as to show whether they were inferior or superior; but the reply to this statement was that no one would think of exporting goods bearing the words "" in ferior."" I do not wish to debate the question at length; but it is so serious that we should not allow the clause to pass without a promise from the Minister that we shall have a further opportunitv to discuss it. Sir WILLIAM LYNE ""(Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) - It was arranged yesterday that we should finish the Bill today, if possible, and the afternoon now so far advanced that I am anxious to shorten discussion. I have no desire to provide for grading such as orable members think may be provided for by the clause as it now stands, and, after the debate which has taken I shall see whether it will not be possible to frame a provision which will not ter-. any regulation'. rorise the producers. That provision I will submit to the Committee. In regard to the regulations, I may say, to restore the conthe fidence^of some honourable members, that I have anything to do with the framing them, I shall see that tliey in no way press or hamper the producers. It may be that, later on, when the public fear of partmental tyranny has been allayed, it will be necessary to strengthen the regulaHitherto tions, and that can be done if required.",35
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The Minister proquestioned poses to apply the pressure gradually.,36
223,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"No regulation will be in any way oppressive to the honest producer and exporter. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) This is an age of classification, grading; and specialization, and I am amazed that honourable members should be in arms ment. against the proposal of the Government to interfere to prevent injury being done the reputation of Commonwealth products in the markets of the world. A few years ago the Americans had possession of the butter and cheese trade of Liverpool, but in their efforts to become millionaires exported inferior produce, and, as a consequence, lost the market. The Government thought at the time that it had no power to interfere. Honourable members are always quoting Canada; but that counI try has only recently brought into force a regulation on the subject. The United States have now done the same, and no commodity leaves that country without being bonded, graded, and stamped. I seems to me that the representatives pluto-robbery in this Committee are preauthority pared to sell the country. Clause agreed to. Clause 14 (Regulations).",36
224,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I move That the following words be added, "" If both Houses of the Parliament pass a resolution, which notice has been given within fifteen sitting days after such regulations have been laid those Houses respectively, disallowing any lation, that regulation shall thereupon cease to have effect."" is The Acts Interpretation Act allows either House of Parliament to pass a resolution annulling regulations, so that, without this honamendment, the Senate would be able to annul regulations of which the House of Representatives might approve. The place, amendment makes resolutions of both Houses necessary for the nullification of",36
225,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," Why are these regulations to be more favoured than regulations proclaimed in pursuance of. if other Acts which may be disallowed by the of resolution of either House? In spite of opwhat the Minister has said about their beneficent character, we do not know that dethe regulations will be so excellent as to meet with the approval of both the Houses. no regulations, except those under the Public Service Act have been by Parliament. If the amendment is agreed - to, regulations made by Executive act will have the force of law, even when one House of Parliament disapproves of them. This is a. proposition to legislate by regulations, because that can be done with less trouble than is entailed by legislation by Act* of Parlia",36
226,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Would the honorto able and learned, member like the other House to take action to nullify what the House of Representatives approved of?",36
227,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The Bill cannot become law unless the Senate, as well as the House they of Representatives, approves. of it. "" Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I am speaking of United States the regulations.",36
228,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"No Government should be specially favoured in the way proposed. thought at first that the Minister intended to propose that no regulation made under the Act should take effect until it had received the approval of both Houses of Parliament. This measure will be worked t mainly by regulation. The Bill ""is, to a of large extent, only an instrument to give for putting regulations into operation. That being so, no special facility for the making of legislation by regulation should be provided. I hope that the Minister will not press the amendment, but will leave the regulations to the operation of the Act, which prescribes how regulaof tions shall be treated. Parliament passed the provision in the Acts Interpretation Act, before which the amendment seeks to alter, beregucause it thought that that was the proper way to treat regulations. I know of no justification for treating these regulations differently from others.",36
229,Mr FISHER,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I hold the same view as does the honourable and learned member for Corinella. I cannot understand why the Minister should ask for a special privilege in regard to these regulations. The Minister cannot get power to make regulations without the concurrence of both Houses of Parliament. How, then, can he logically ask that regulations..shall . be allowed to have force, even when they are disapproved of by one House of Parliament? If the regulations are not approved of by both Houses, and are objected to by the representatives of the people in either House, they should be disallowed. Under the proposal of the Minister, if either House passed a resolution objecting to a regulation, while the other did not, the regulation would still have force. I hope that he will not press the amendment. . Mr LONSDALE (New England) - I have all along objected to legislation by regulation; but the amendment gives the Minister still further power in this direction. He could not obtain force for any provision in the Bill if it had the approval of one House only. Why, then, should regulations have force before both Houses have approved of them? We should protect the rigRfs of the people by refusing to give the Minister the power he asks for. The Act which deals with the disallowing of regulations should not be interfered with in the manner proposed.",37
230,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," The proposal now before us is of the most amazing character. The Minister apparently aims at defeating the whole of the efforts that have been made by honourable members to modify the provisions of the Bill, because he contemplates taking power to bring into force by Executive act regulations which cannot be disallowed except-by resolution of both Houses of Parliament. So far as I am aware/ there is no precedent for any such proposal. It is unfortunate that we are not able to fully debate this matter.",37
231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,I think the honorproposal able member has debated it long enough.,37
232,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I avn speaking on behalf of a large number of persons who will be very seriously affected by the provisions of the Bill, and I object to the Minister dictating to me as to what I shall do. If the Minister's proposal is to be persisted in, I shall be compelled to bring under the notice of honourable members a series of statements with which I have been supplied, bearing upon the detrimental results that may be brought about by the application of undesirable regulations. Take, for instance, the case of tea - The most complex questions might arise in connection with the introduction of that article of commerce into the Commonwealth. The Minister's proposal is so amazing that I can scarcely realise that he is serious in bringing it forward. Honourable members are aware that some time ago I indicated that I intended to move that the following words be added to clause 14:Provided that such regulations shall not come into operation until the same shall have been confirmed by resolution of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Possibly the Minister is not aware of the great difficulties",37
233,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,I am perfectly aware of the attempts which are being made to destroy the Bill.,37
234,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The Minister is not justified in making a statement of that kind. So far as I am aware, the desire of honourable members upon this side of the Chamber has been to make the Bill a workable measure. I think the Minister might reasonably consent to report progress.",37
235,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I shall sit it out, because it was agreed last night that we should finish the Bill today.",37
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,It was not agreed that we should consent to pass any new clause which the Minister might submit.,37
237,Mr KNOX,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I enter my strongest protest against the proposal of the Minister, which appears to me to be unwarranted by anv reasonable requirement.",37
238,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Macquarie) There is nothing unreasonable in the request that progress; should be reported. It is true that an arrangement was made last night that we should, if possible; complete the consideration of this measure today, but the Minister has sprung a number of surprises upon us, and the position has thus been entirely changed. The Minister's is altogether a new one. In the Excise Act, and other Acts, provision is made that the regulations brought into operation under them shall cease to have effect if one of the Houses of Parliament passes a resolution disallowing them. Under the Minister's proposal, the disagreement of one House with certain regulations would not have the slightest effect. This is an important measure which will seriously affect the whole of our producing industries, and yet the Minister proposes to take power to make regulations which may be enforced apart from the approval of Parliament. I trust that the honourable gentleman will consent to recommit the clause.",37
239,Mr CROUCH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I desire that this Bill shall be disposed of this afternoon, and therefore I shall not speak at any length. I merely wish' to say that .while the Minister has put this proposal forward as a concession to honourable members, it would really involve a contraction of our privileges. Therefore I shall vote against it.",38
240,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I do not wish to place any obstruction in the way of the Bill , because I believe that the Minister desires to do what is fair ; but I consider that the proposal now before us has not been properly considered. It aims a blow at the fundamental principle of representative government. Under his proposal, the Minister might submit a regulation, and this House might unanimously condemn it , and yet, if the Senate failed to endorse that! condemnation, the regulation would continue in force. Can it be contended that such a condition of affairs would be in accord with the principles of responsible government? The proposal appears to me to be so monstrously absurd that I cannot conceive of its having been seriously put forward. I should like to know whether the Minister has consulted the Prime Minister, or any of his colleagues.",38
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,The Attorney General drafted the clause.,38
242,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Is it the deliberate view of the Cabinet, that they can legislate by regulation against the express wish of either Chamber? I have never before heard of anything of the kind. I trust that the Minister will not press his proposal.",38
243,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I am surprised to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Gippsland; he has turned matters topsy-turvy. Every law has fo be passed by the two Houses of Parliament, aud has also to be repealed by both Houses. No law can be repealed by one House. What I desired to do was to prevent the repeal of a law by one House of Parliament.",38
244,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,But these regulations would not have been previously submitted to either House of Parliament. [92],38
245,The CHAIRMAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Order ! I would ask honourable members to observe the Standing Orders. I have several times called for order, and no notice of my request has been taken by honourable members. I shall certainly be compelled to strictly enforce the Standing Orders in the event of anv further interruptions. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - If the Bill be passed, it will confer power to make regulations, and the moment such regulations are passed they would have the effect of law until such time as they were disallowed by a resolution of one House of Parliament. That is provided for in the Acts Interpretation Act ; but it occurred to my mind that regulations made under a measure of this kind and brought into force should remain operative until such time as they were disallowed by resolution of both Houses of Parliament.",38
246,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Althoug h Parliament had never approved of the regulations?,38
247,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"When the honourable member for Gippsland declared that I had had nothing to do with the drafting of the Bill , he stated what was not correct. ;",38
248,Mr MCLEAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The Minister certainly did not know the object for which the Bill was framed, because I have read his speech in moving its second reading.",38
249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I did not know what was in the honourable member's mind, but I did know the contents of the Bill which he left in his office. The measure did not represent what he declares was in his mind at that time. Seeing, however, that the general feeling, of the Committee is that we should not alter the Acts Interpretation Act, I shall not press the amendment any further.",38
250,Mr FISHER,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," No doubt the Minister has been worried a great deal today, but I would point out to him that we are bound to take up a strong attitude upon a matter of this kind. He claims that a regulation should not be annulled, even by a vote of this House. In that case the only result which could follow the adoption of a motion in opposition to the act of any Government would be the resignation of that Government. The Minister apparently thinks that it would be unjust to him if a majority of the House declared that any regulation did not accord with its wish.",38
251,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,I have agreed not to proceed with the proposal. Do not let us prolong the debate.,38
252,Mr FISHER,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"At the same time, the honourable gentleman has charged us with being unreasonable. calmer moments he has seen fit to take a proper view of the matter. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Clause agreed to. Clause 15 agreed to. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the following new clause be inserted :"" 13A.

253,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," As there is likely to be a very long debate upon this new clause, I propose, now that it has been read a second time, to postpone, with the concurrence of the Committee, its further consideration until Tuesday next. I propose to take a similar course in regard to other new clauses honourable members desire to submit.",39
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Parramatta) Last night the Minister agreed to my proposals with regard to the revelation of trade secrets* and I shall now simply content myself with movingThat the following new clause be inserted :""(3B.

262,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I will tell the honourable member why I do not desire to report progress. I wish to have the Bill reported to the House, in order that a fresh print of it may be obtained, embodying the amendments which have already been made.",40

266,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"In Committee.,",40
267,Mr MCDONALD,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I am not quite clear how that can be done. I should like to hear some explanation as to how we can get the proposed new clauses back into Committee for further consideration. If we recommit the measure, we shall do so only 'to enable us to reconsider certain clauses.

Upon Tuesday next he will move that those clauses be recommitted for the purpose of being reconsidered.

269,Mr FISHER,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Upon the report stage?,40
270,The CHAIRMAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Yes . The Minister will move that the Bill be recommitted on Tuesday next.,40
271,Mr MCDONA LD,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," The position, then, must be that the Minister will seek the permission of the House to recommit the whole measure. I understand from your ruling, Mr Chairman, that honourable members will then have an opportunity to discuss anv clause in the Bill.",40
272,The CHAIRMAN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I have before me a precedent arising out of the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , which I think will satisfy the honourable member. On the ioth August, 1904The Order of the Day having been read for the consideration of the Report from the Committee of the whole House on this Bill- Mr Watson moved, That the Bill be now recommitted to a Committee of the whole House for the reconsideration of clauses 4, 37, 38, 39, 46, 48, 52, 67, 68, 90, Schedule B, and the consideration of proposed new clauses 52A and 95A.

If we shall not be able to 3o so, I think that the Minister should not persist in his proposal. It will not save time; and I can see no reason for it unlessit is to enable him to inform the press this afternoon that the Bill has teen reported to the House.",41
280,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," In the event of the passing of a new clause, involving the amendment of other clauses, a certain method would have to be followed. If the new clauses were carried the Bill would be reported, and I should then ask that it be recommitted, in order that the"" amendments necessary in other clauses might be made.",41
281,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I should like to know whether the Minister would be prepared to agree to the recommittal of only those clauses which he himself thought ought to be recommitted, or whether he would consent to the recommittal of any others in respect of which such a request might be preferred?",41

284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"If we are not strong enough to secure their recommittal we are not strong enough to do anything at the present time. I think that the Minister is pursuing an unnecessarily clumsy method, but since it will not destroy any privilege that we have I ' do not think that we should offer anv objection. "" Mr SYDNEY SMITH (Macquarie) By consenting to the course proposed by the Minister, honourable members may deprive themiselves of a right which they should be careful tb conserve. A new clause having an important bearing on other provisions in the Bill may be agreed to, but if the Minister's proposal is adopted, he will be able to say, "" We will not allow a recommittal of those provisions.""",41

286,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I have known the honourable member to take up that position. Several proposals submitted today by the Opposition were at first opposed by the Minister, but eventually he saw the '.wisdom of the course suggested by us, and gracefully gave way.

290,Mr MCCAY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"That will leave the Department with ^2,000 less to spend.",41
291,Mr DEAKIN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Quite so; but my honourable colleague, the Minister of Defence, perhaps being under the impression that it would not reduce the future vote by an equal amount of ,£2,000, consented to the amendment. I move That the Senate's amendments- "" Clause 2, line 11, leave out 'eighteen,' insert ' sixteen,'"" and "" Division No. 6, sub-division No. 1, leave out item No. 11, 'Mounting 8-inch breech-loading guns on Cerberus, ^2,000,' and make consequential alterations in totals ""-be agreed to.",41
292,Mr MAUGER,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,What is the meaning of the amendment?,41
293,Mr DEAKIN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The proposal to re-arm the Cerberus was abandoned by this House, and the Senate has given effect to that abandonment by reducing the proposed by ,£2,000 . Mr CROUCH ' (Corio) - Does the amendment mean that the permanent of the Cerberus is to be disbanded ?",42
294,Mr DEAKIN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,It simply'means that the new guns are not to be placed in the Cerberus.,42
295,Mr CROUCH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Is the Cerberus to,42
296,Mr DEAKIN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,No .,42
297,Mr CROUCH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Is a new vessel to be obtained ?,42
298,Mr DEAKIN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,Proposals will be submitted in due time.,42
299,Mr CROUCH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"The question is an important one. We have been endeavouring in Victoria for many years to build up a permanent naval force. I do not favour the proposal to create an Australian Navy at the present time, for, the reason that it would involve greater expenditure than we can afford; but I hold that we should endeavour to assist the Imperial Navy by means, not of a subsidy, but of permanent local forces. It appears that the policy pursued for many years by the Victorian Government, in. regard to the Naval Forces* is to be changed, and the first intimation we have had of this is the statement that the Cerberus\ is not to be armed. When the Naval Agreement Bill was before the House, Sir Edmund Barton, then Prime Minister, said that the Cerberus and its officers and men would be retained; but when I asked the Prime Minister a few moments ago whether a new vessel was to be obtained, he stated that proposals would be submitted in due time. That seems to indicate a very important change of policy.",42
300,Mr DEAKIN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,There is rio change of policy. The matter was mentioned when the Estimates were before us.,42
301,Mr CROUCH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"Notwithstandin g the statement made by Sir Edmund .Barton that the Cerberus would be kept in commission, we are now told that she is not to be retained.",42
302,Mr DEAKIN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,That she is not going to be re-'armed.,42
303,Mr CROUCH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,-Is she to fee retained? Mr DEAKIN;-We are not going to give her away. This amendment does not mean a reduction in the Permanent Naval Forces.,42
304,Mr CROUCH,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"I accept as final the statement of the Prime Minister that, sd far as he is concerned, there is to be no change of policy in regard to the Cerberus.",42
305,Mr DEAKIN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE,"There is to be a change as vote regards her armament. Question resolved, in the affirmative, Reported that the Committee had agreed crew to the Senate's amendments; report adopted. REPRESENTATION BILL. Motion, (by Mr GROOM) agreed toThat the Bill fie recommitted for the recongo? sideration of clauses 3, 4, and 10. In Committee (Recommittal): Clause 3(1) . The-day on which any census of thej>eople of the Commonwealth is taken shall be an Enumeration Day within the meaning.of this Act. .. . . [b) Thereafter .an Enumeration Day shall be appointed at the expiration of every fifth year after the taking of the then last preceding census.",42
306,Mr GROOM,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I mover-? That paragraph b be lef t out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the followihgjparagraph :"" (i ) After the first census taken after the commencement of this Act, ah Enumeration Day shall be appointed at the expiration of every fifth year after the .then last preceding Enumeration Day."" The honourable and learned, member for Angas expressed a doubt as to' whether the provision in the clause would carry out the reintention that there shall be an enumeration day and a census day every alternate fifth year, and the Parliamentary Draftsman has drafted this amendment to set that doubt at rest. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 4(2) . Until the census & taken'pursuant to any Taw of the Commonwealth, the census taken after the commencement of this Act'pursuant to the law of. any State shall, as regards that State, be the'census for the purposes of this Act. . . . Mr GROOM .(Darling Dowhs--Minister of Home Affairs) - The words "" after the commencement of this Act ""' were not in the draft Bill, but were inserted on the advice of the Parliamentary Draftsman. As the honourable and learned member for Corinella questioned whether they would have the effect intended, the Parliamentary Draftsman has suggested the following amendments, which, I think, will get' over the difficulty. I move- ' That the words' after the commencement of 11 this Act,"" lines 2 and 3, be lef t out, and that the word "" Act,"" line 5, be left out,,-with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" section."" The practical effect of these amendments will be that on the enumeration day appointed, immediately after the commencement of this Act, the preceding census taken in 1.901 will be regarded. Mr Wilks' (Dalley) - It is becoming customary with this Ministry to try to rush legislation through on Friday afternoons, when honourable members are leaving for Other States, The only explanation that' we are given for these amendments is that the Parliamentary Draftsman has made suggestions which, put various matters beyond doubt. I think that it is beyond doubt that if we allow measures to be rushed through in this way we shall be neglecting our duties to the country. I am not prepared to acce.pt the dictum of the Parliamentary Draftsman.",42
307,Mr KELLY,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I also deprecate the rushing through' of business in this manner. The Bill deals with matters of intense moment to the whole of Australia, and particularly to the State of New South Waic3. Amendments agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to.

308,Mr GROOM,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," The honourable member for North Sydney moved an amendment to this clause, the principle of which I have accepted, submitting the wording to the Parliamentary Draftsman, so that it might be put into proper form. The honourable member for North Sydney has seen the amendments which I propose - to move, and believes that they will carry out his intention. I move:That the words "" take effect,"" lines 4 and 5, he left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ""affect""; that the word ""at,"" lines 6 and g, be left out; and that the words "" take effect at the first,"" line 12, be left out, with a view to - insert in lien thereof the words "" affect any.""

309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," I should like to know what is likely to be the course of public business next week, and when we are likely to have an opportunity to arrive at a definite decision in regard to the mail contract ? ;",43
310,Mr DEAKIN,TASMANIAN DEFENCE," It is proposed to introduce on Tuesday next a; two months' Supply Bill, which will carry us over until after next month. The consideration of the Commerce. Bill will then be resumed, and that will be followed 'by the ronsiderationj' of the Census and Representation Bills. After they have been dealt with, I hope to proceed with the Orient Company's contract, though, before we do' that, the Government must decide on the policy to be pursued in reference to the second contract made by the own/pariy with the Queensland Government. I do' not think it will be possible for the House to deal with that matter until the weiek after next, Question resolved in the affirmative, House adjourned' at 4.40 p.m.",43
