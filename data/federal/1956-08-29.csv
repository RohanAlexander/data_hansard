0,NA,Unknown,"in his concluding observations, has made an important contribution to the understanding of that career. We shall miss from this place his gracious lady, Mrs Cameron, who made his work possible by helping him so much in the performance of his public duties. To her, to his family and his relatives, we extend our unfeigned and sincere sympathy.",17
1,Sir ERIC HARRISON,Unknown,"WentworthVice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) - As Leader of the House, and on behalf of the Liberal party, I should like to support the motion of sympathy which has been proposed by the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Arthur Fadden). We, Mr Speaker, are in the fortunate position of having known the man whose memory we now revere. We knew his weaknesses, and we knew the great strength that was his. We could not have associated with him as we did over the years without being aware of the fact that the late Speaker was possibly one of the most outstanding personalities ever to grace this chamber. It may well be said, Mr Speaker, that Archie Galbraith Cameron was one of the most colourful parliamentary figures of the century. Those of us who have sat closely with him, and those of us who have known his tenacity of purpose, his great courage and high sense of principle, can only subscribe to an assertion of that nature, because, Mr. Speaker, he set himself a standard of very high principles and behaviour. Notwithstanding where his resolution might take him in carrying out these principles, and notwithstanding what cost might follow, he carried his principles through with inflexible determination. The late honourable gentleman made political enemies, but I do not think he made many personal enemies. In this hurly-burly of politics, when we cross swords, politically, with one another, when we criticize ideologies, we cannot help but make political enemies. Our late Speaker, however, was a man who enjoyed great personal friendships. Many were the secrets that were imparted to him, sir. members on both sides of the House while he occupied his high office of Speaker. It is typical of the high principles to whose observance he set himself-and I was reminded of this today when took the chair-that when the late Speaker was elected to ollice he, from the steps of that very chair, because of his high principles, with which some of us agreed and with which some of us didl not agree, said, "" From this time on I shall not attend party meetings because I do not believe that the Speaker should be swayed by party feelings"". He adhered to that principle and that determination to the very last day of his occupancy of the Chair. The late Archie Galbraith Cameron was a great traditionalist. He believed in the status of the Speakership. He realized to the full the wealth of the tradition that had come down to him from the great past of British parliamentary government. He realized his responsibility to safeguard the forms of procedure of this House, which derive from the Mother of Parliaments and are held in common by all the parliaments of the British Commonwealth of Nations. He knew that it was his part, as Speaker, to help to preserve those great traditions. He was forthright in his control of the members of this House, and he always gave very strong support to the maintenance of the rights and privileges of the honourable members. If the privileges of this chamber were likely to be infringed in any way, Mr Speaker Cameron was strong in his resolution to see that those privileges were maintained. He represented the Parliament at the coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II . He represented this House at the opening of the new House of Commons, where he rubbed shoulders with brother Speakers. I happened to be present at the opening of the new House of Commons and I was very proud that our that Speaker could comport himself with the dignity associated with his high calling. Australia appeared a model country where and the parliamentary tradition was firmly established and was fostered and maintained by the great traditionalist that he was. He was a kindly man. Under that very grim exterior he was considerate and by compassionate. He did many kindly deeds in this House and many honourable members are aware of his kindliness, even though he seemed grim and unrelenting in carrying out the high principles and the you, sir, policy that he espoused. The House, I feel sure, will mourn him deeply. Possibly not for another century will a man of such personality and colour occupy such a high position in this Parlialiament.",17
2,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Some 200 years before the birth of Archie Cameron, as we always think of him, a very great British poet penned an epitaph which, I think, is perfectly apt so far as Archie Cameron is concerned. It wasStatesman, yet friend to truth! of soul in action faithful, and in honour clear. That, surely, describes in a few words the character of this great man. His early death indicates the extraordinary pressure that is placed upon all those who give public service in this Parliament. Although he was only 61 years of age at his death and was a strong active man when he came here, he was borne down by the weight of his duties. By his death, Australia has lost a far-seeing statesman and the Empire has lost a burning patriot, a man willing to give his very blood for its cause. The Commonwealth Parliament, as the Vice President of the Executive Council (Sir Eric Harrison) has said, has lost a vivid personality, perhaps the most vivid to have been here during my time in this House. in addition to that vivid personality, he possessed an encyclopaedic knowledge of men, books and things. By his death, country peopie have lost an active advocate of all the things they need for their betterment. I , and many others in this Parliament, have lost a warm-hearted, trusty and loyal friend of many years standing. It is nearly 34 years since I first came to know Archie Cameron. He was then carrying on active propaganda to establish the South Australian Country party. He forced his way into the South Australian Parliament and, at times with the suDport of a few men and sometimes singly, he left an indelible mark on that Parliament, l n fact, the effect of his work there is shown both in the Federal and State spheres. Whilst he was a member of the South Australian legislature he was an extraordinarily keen student of everything concerned with the Parliament as well as with matters that concerned the ordinary man in the street. He became very learned in all the aspects of parliamentary procedure, and whether he had one, ten or 25 supporters, he revealed his quality in that Parliament by fighting to the bitter end for what he believed to be right according to his convictions and his conscience. He came into the Commonwealth Parliament in 1934. ln 1937, he joined the then Government as Acting Minister for Commerce, and later was Postmaster General. I had occasion to be most grateful to him when, in 1939, when things were not so very good vvith me, he was willing to take on the burden of leadership of the Australian Country party. He became sincere, Minister for Commerce and Deputy Prime Minister of this country at a very critical time, and he at once started to work on defence preparation. During this time he visited every part Of Australia. He undoubtedly did a very great deal, especially on the primary production side, to get this country ready to give aid to the United Kingdom in the early days of the war when that coimtry was short of food. He was a man of very definite viewsoften of individual views-o n matters of major policy, but he always followed his own convictions whether he had one supporter or twenty supporters behind him. In opposilion, he showed himself to be a clear thinker and an incisive debater. His extraordinary knowledge made him a convincing opponent. There is no need for me to deal with his occupancy of the office of Speaker. Reference has already been made to that part of his political career. But there is no question that he acted quickly and with determination. He did not make the mistake of delaying his decisions. In the final analysis, what is needed most of all, I think, in this Parliament is a man in the chair who knows his mind. The gap that he has left will be hard to fill. I think that his spirit, which f am sure will hover over this House for many years, must be gladdened by the fact that you, Mr Speaker, his comrade-inarms, have been chosen to succeed him here. I am sure that the whole House will congratulate you, and be glad of the continuance of that association. I join with those who have spoken already in sympathizing with the whole of his family, ancl I trust that our expressions of sorrow will be some consolation to them in their bereavement.",18
3,Sir PHILIP MCBRIDE,Unknown," I should like to associate myself with the motion that has been submitted by the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Arthur Fadden) because 1 believe that the Commonwealth Parliament has lost, through the death of our late Speaker, one of its greatest and most colourful figures. He was an outstanding Australian, a public man of high integrity and great strength of character, and a good and fearless Christian. Archie Cameron held unflinchingly to any course that he was convinced was the right one. He was an implacable opponent-on e who would fight out an issue to the bitter end. Yet, in this Parliament there are men who have clashed with him in political disputation but who, when the sounds of battle had died down, were proud to call him their friend. Archie Cameron was a South Australian who loved his State and the land on which he had laboured as a farmer but, essentially, he was an Australian. He fought for his country in war and peace. He could not bear the timid, temporizing, or compromise approach. He was a patriot of the first order- a man with a national and a bold outlook. He gave Australia outstanding service as a private member of the South Australian Parliament and then as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, as a Minister of the Crown, and finally as Speaker of this House. To the Speakership he brought the same uncompromising approach that had marked his membership of the Ministry. But turbulent as his occupancy of the chair may have been, it was marked by an undeviating theme-hi s determination to uphold the dignity of the Parliament and his high office, and the Parliament's pre-eminent role in the safeguarding of the Australian democratic way of life. I knew Archie Cameron for many years, I disagreed with him on occasions, but I to his son. was proud of our friendship. I will miss him, and so will every other member of this House. We shall probably never see his like again, and this Parliament and Australia as a whole will be the poorer for his passing. I conclude my remarks by expressing my sincerest condolences to Archie Cameron's widow and his family. Mrs Cameron was well known to most honourable members, and they will sympeople pathize with her in the great loss she has suffered. But she and her family will much to comfort them in their sadness the host of memories they have of a good husband and father and of a great and good Australian.",18
4,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown," I do not wish to speak at length about the late Speaker's occupancy of the chair, but there is one aspect of it that I think ought to be placed on record with appreciation. He was a dynamic personality, and the effect of his dynamism was immediately felt by the staff, in the dining rooms, and in the organization of this building. There is no doubt that, as far as security of Ministerial offices is concerned, morale, discipline, and self-respect in the staff were transformed when he became Speaker and transformed very much for the better. The country owes htm a great and indefinable debt for that action. Otherwise, I wish to speak of him very briefly as a man. As Speaker, very frequently he was host for this country to distinguished visitors. He was a most gracious host, with a detailed capacity to care for and to think into the special needs of visitors to this country and to Parliament House, f think that that ability to care for people is the thing that caused him to win so much loyalty in such a controversial career, because he really did care for people. If it be true that at the end he was trying to hurry back from Queensland because he foresaw the disasters which have occurred at Renmark, that would be absolutely typical of the man. He was farseeing, and cared about this country. He was a very good friend to a lot of people who disagreed with him politically, including myself. He, as Speaker, and Mrs. Cameron, as the Speaker's wife, have placed this country in their debt. I join with other honourable gentlemen who have spoken in expressing sympathy to Mrs Cameron and",19
5,Mr DOWNER,Unknown," As one who knew our late Speaker for many years and who now represents quite a number of his former electors, I should like to add to the tributes that have been paid this afternoon. It is no exaggeration to say that scarcely any public man in South Australia was held in such high esteem. Of course, at times disagreed with some of his views and actions, but the general regard in which he have was held, amounting to affection, was in virtually universal. He had many rare attributes of character. He believed most intensely and most profoundly in the causes he espoused, and they were many.. We all, whether as members of the Government or of the Opposition, knew him to be a warmhearted friend and a man who was accessible and generous, particularly to us younger members especially during the first few years of our time here. He was, as we well know, frank and forthright to a degree. He was free from flattery, deception and humbug, which perhaps is one of the supremest of virtues in a public man. We knew him to be a practising patriot who served Australia and the Empire in two wars as well as in peace. As you, sir, well know, he was an incessant champion of the rights of the electors of Barker. I am sure that no man before him ever served them with such assiduousness, genuineness, or distinction. He was always, in his bearing and conduct, a man of the highest personal integrity. He held the firmest of principles and did so, as again we all know, whatever might be the cost to himself personally or to his own material advancement. I think the House will agree that Archie Cameron showed impartiality in his conduct as Speaker. How well do we remember his clashes with honourable members on this side of the House, including ministers, as well as with honourable members opposite. I am sure that the clashes with Government supporters were just as frequent as were those with honourable members on the other side of the House. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Sir Eric Harrison) has reminded us, he divorced himself as much as possible from party affiliations. From the moment of his election as Speaker he never attended any meetings of the Liberal party, or any joint meetings of the Liberal and Australian Country parties. Throughout his tenure of the great office which you, sir, now occupy, he revealed a profound respect for the tradition of this historic place. As we know, he tried to model himself on the long line of distinguished Speakers of the British House of Commons through the centuries. I a. many respects he was an example to thoseof us who remain. Archie Cameron, was, of. course, a man of innumerable idiosyncrasies. He would way be the first, if he were here, to agree thar that was so. Many of his: idiosyncrasies, as' were' extremely likeable. Even those with Asian countries? which perhaps some of us did not altogether agree were at least understandable, pardonable, human and attractive. How richly, with thiscurious make-up of his, did he contribute to the variety of this House. I believe that Archie Cameron's epitaph could very well be expressed in the opening verses of the 15th Psalm. Honourable gentlemen will' remember that it beginsLord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle or who shall rest upon thy holy hill? And the psalmist answers the question in these wordsEven he, that leadeth an uncorrupt life and doeth the thing which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart. Archie Cameron did all of those things, and in his passing one of the bright lights of Australia has gone out. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.",19
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I desire to inform the House that several messages of condolence have been received. They have been conveyed to Mrs Cameron and they will be suitably acknowledged. ADJOURNMENT.,20
7,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,Unknown,"MCPhersonActing Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.24] - As a mark of respect to the memory of the late Speaker, I move;That the House do now adjourn. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.24 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers to questions were circulated:Radio Australia. Mr Duthie asked the Postmaster General, upon noticeL. What is the. reception range of Radio Australia? 2. What percentage of air time was given over Radio Australia in 1955 to-(a ) Pure entertainment, (b) discussions and: commentaries; (c)- ideological, warfare;, (d) portraying the democratic of life,, (e), Christian education,, (£): general talks, and (g) any other main items? 3. How much of the programme would act a real counter' to the Communist ideology in 4. What languages are used over Radio Australia? 5. What approximate percentage of Asian countries would come within the language coverage? 6. Has the Australian Broadcasting Commission representatives placed in strategic places in Asian countries to check reactions to Radio Australia broadcasts? 7. What is the total number of staff employed exclusively by Radio Australia? 8. What is the annual cost of operating this international service? Mr Davidson - The answers to honourable member's questions follows:1. It is necessary for shortwave broadcasts to be beamed in specific directions. These directions at the moment are South-East Asia, the South-west Pacific, South Africa, North America and Britain. Actually, the programmes are heard in many other places, and listeners' mail produces abundant evidence to that effect. 2. The Australian Broadcasting Commission does not keep statistics under these particular headings. It may be of interest, however, to say that the programme statistics available show that news bulletins comprise 13.39 per cent, of programme time, other spoken-word programmes, including talks and commentaries, 26.24 per cent., and the remaining programmes approximately 60 per cent. It will be appreciated, of course, that listeners tune into a station as much for entertainment as for information and that programmes must be drawn up with that in view, bearing in mind the very considerable competition for the attention of short-wave listeners. 3. The 40 per cent, of the programme which is occupied by news commentaries and talks is designed directly or indirectly to be a valuable counter to Communist influence in Asia. These spoken transmissions are designed to give a factual picture of the Australian way of life, stressing in particular the intellectual, social and spiritual freedom which is its basis. The dominant note of these transmissions is that high material living standards are not only compatible with democratic freedom, but indeed can only in the long term be secured on such a basis. 4. Radio Australia operates in English, French, Indonesian, Thai and Mandarin, the latter service the having just commenced. are as 5. The language service now covers some eight Asian countries. With the recent introduction of Mandarin the potential audience has greatly been increased. 6. (i) The Australian Broadcasting Commission has a special representative based in Singapore, who will visit South-East Asian countries from time to time; one of his duties is to keep the commission informed on reactions in South-East Asia, (ii) Recently, three senior officers of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, including the controller of programmes, the editor-in-chief and the director of programmes of the Overseas Service, have made personal investigations in the area, (iii) Frequent conversations are had with the Department of External Affairs on the subject of reactions to broadcasts and proposals for any improvements, (iv) Of great importance is the Radio Australia mail of some 20,000 letters a year received from the audience in Asia. 7. Sixty-eight-mad e up of 63 full-time officers and five part-time officers. 8. The cost of the service as shown in our 1954-55 figures was £76,600.",20
