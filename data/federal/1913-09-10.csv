1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I take this opportunity of setting right a little matter in regard to which I was in error yesterday. The honourable member for West Sydney rose, as he said, to make a personal explanation, and was reading the report of a speech referring to several matters, but in which it did not appear that there was any reference to him. I thereupon stopped him, and explained that that could not be the subject of a personal explanation. The hum of conversation which was proceeding prevented me from hearing him say that he had been mentioned, and that it was in regard to that personal mention that he wished to make a personal explanation. I thought that he desired to make a general statement to the House regarding the matter of the reported speech, and, therefore, I sought the leave of the House for that to be done, so that his remarks might be in order. I take this opportunity to make my apologies to the honourable member for having interrupted him under a misapprehension.",12
2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"May I refer again to this matter, Mr Speaker?",12
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member desire to make a personal explanation ?,12
4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yes , arising out of a report of Friday's proceedings, published in yesterday's Argus, which reads as followsThe Audit Bill was to provide that in any year they could get supply without waiting for Parliament, so as to tide over the first few weeks. Mr Hughes said that it was a far-reaching reform, and it was not allowed to pass. The Agricultural Bureau Bill was a measure to assist the farmers and others. But these two bills were talked about the whole day, and when the House rose on Friday they were no further forward than when it began. The Opposition was not out to do business, and all the talk about non-contentious measures was just so much dust thrown in the eyes of the people, for the purpose of helping in a systematic process of political obstruction.. Whatever was done on Friday was the result of an arrangement between the Prime Minister and myself, which was fairly and honourably kept by me, and hy honourable members on this side. The House adjourned shortly after 3 o'clock, although there was no reason why the sitting should not have continued for another hour and a half. Mr JOSE PH COOK - B y way of personal explanation, let me say that, although the honourable member for West Sydney claims that what was done on F r i day was done under an arrangement between us, there was no arrangement; there was only the intimation from the honourable member that the Opposition did not intend to allow the A u d it Bill to go - through until the ex-Treasurer returned.",12
5,Mr HUCHES,Unknown,Naturall y we would not allow a Bill to pass which we had never seen before.,13
6,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"As a matter of privilege. An article appears in the Age newspaper this morning, in which the writer accuses me of having read in the debate yesterday one of the two important rules affecting general retainers, ignoring or suppressing the other, which, according to him, would have put a different complexion on the case. He saysEverybody will deplore that Mr Irvine did not think it necessary to be quite frank with the House in this matter. A more serious charge could not be made against any member of Parliament, especially one occupying the position which I happen to occupy at the present time. The statement in the Age is a deliberate and audacious falsehood; audacious because, as honourable members will recollect, the text of both rules was read by me, and appears in the galley proofs which were supplied to me this morning by the 'Hansard Department. The rules are these, and every honourable member who was present yesterday will remember that I read the whole of each of them. Rule 5, which the writer in the Age says that I read, is as followsIf the counsel who has accepted a general retainer from one party should be offered a special retainer or brief by another party, the general retainer entitles the party who has given it to reasonable notice before the offered special retainer or brief is accepted. Rule 8, which according to the writer in the Age I suppressed, but which appears in the report of my speech immediately after rule 5, and which honourable members will remember that I read, is in these wordsIn case a special retainer or brief is to counsel by a party other than the party whom he has accepted a general retainer, counsel, after giving notice to the party from whom he has accepted the general retainer uf the offer of the special retainer or brief, is at liberty to accept the special retainer or brief of the other party, unless a special retainer or brief be given within a reasonable time by the party from whom he has accepted the general retainer. I absolutely repudiate and give the lie to the defamatory and obviously false statement which appears in the Age.",13
7,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I take the point of order that the Attorney-General, haviug risen to a question of privilege, must, understanding order 285, conclude with a motion. That standing order says thatAny honourable member complaining to the House of a statement in a newspaper as a breach of privilege, shall produce a copy of the paper containing the statement in question, and be prepared to give the name of the printer or publisher, and also submit a substantive motion declaring the person in question to have been guilty of contempt.",13
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Althoug h the honourable the Attorney-General said he desired to speak on a matter of privilege, he was really making what was more properly a personal explanation.",13
9,Mr WEBSTEH,Unknown,He said privilege.,13
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I know that is what he said. He rose to call attention to what he conceived to be a breach of privilege, and made a personal explanation in reference thereto. Under the Standing Orders his proper method as one of privilege was to produce a copy of the newspaper containing the words complained of, and to conclude with a motion. The standing order says: All questions of order and matters of privilege at any time arising shall, until decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every other question. To arrive at a decision it is the practice to conclude with a motion affecting any matter of privilege.",13
11,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"In bringing the inatter forward under the cover of privi lege, I thought that I was following the practice usually adopted. If I was wrong in doing so without concluding with a motion, the mistake was mine, and I ask you, Mr Speaker, and the House to permit what I have said to be regarded as in the nature of a personal explanation.",13
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is it the pleasure of the House that that course be adopted ? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",13
13,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I do not know, Mr . offered Speaker, whether I shall be permitted to f:«ra bring before the House by way of perthe sonal explanation a matter to which I desire to refer, but to which I cannot allude as a matter of privilege under the ruling just given by you. I refer to a statement in this morning's issue of the Age newspaper in reference to myself. By way of personal explanation I should like to put it right, because it is grossly inaccurate. The statement isMr Hughes tried to demonstrate that the Attorney-General ought to absent himself from the House when the division should be taken. So far as I am concerned, that statement is absolutely without foundation. Nothing that I said in the least degree bears out. I had no such thought in my mind, and certainly did not make any such remark. I take exception to the statement, because it is grossly inaccurate, and places the Attorney-General and myself in unfair light.  sonal explanation. In this morning's issue of the Argus, under the heading of question? ""Question of Pairs,"" "" Mr Carr Sacriof ficed,"" the following statement appears: Early in Ihe session it was announced that Labour caucus had decided that no pairs sliould afforded. be given except in connection with the visit of the British legislators. Private members of the party explained then that the new rule was designed to keep members of the Opposition in their places rather than embarrass Ministerialists, and some colour lent to this view last night when no pair secured for Mr Carr, although the Liberal whip (Mr Greene) stated th,it he was willing to make the necessary arrangements if sired. That report is entirely without tion. The Government Whip at no time wished to make any arrangement with me to provide a pair for the honourable ber for Macquarie. As a inatter of fact, I asked him to give me a pair, aud reply was, "" No possible hope.""",13
14,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I desire, by way of personal explanation, to refer to tion which you, sir, brought forward this afternoon. I objected to leave being granted to the honourable member for West Sydney yesterday afternoon because I felt at the time that the situation was misunderstood by yourself. I objected honourable members being allowed to prosteps ceed only by leave of the House when they had a perfect right to the course they were taking. not, and has never been, any difference opinion between the honourable member for West Sydney and myself in reference and, to this or any other subject. POST AL MECHANICS .",14
15,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Following up a question which I put to the Minister of Home Affairs yesterday, I desire to draw his attention to the following telegram, published in this morning's issue of the Argus, uuder the heading of "" Importing Mechanics "" PERTH, Tuesday - Mr MCCallum, Labour Federation secretary, declares that there is no excuse for the Public Service Commissioner importing postal mechanics from England for Perth. He says that plenty of good men could be engaged, but the Federal authorities never pay more than ^144 a year, whereas now they it are offering £iy6 for men from England. The question I desire to ask the Minister is whether, before any attempt is made to import mechanics from England, or elsewhere, he will see that an offer of £ 1 76 an a year or more, for this class of work, is made to our local jjeople.",14
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,May I reply by asking the honourable member another Will he send along the names the local men whose services he says are available? If they are fit they shall the be put on at the highest rates that can be  barred them by the education test.,14

66,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The answers to the orable member's questions follow: t. No. The road tractor has been laid up for repairs and because of inefficient running. a. The total load for the tractor was to be 21 tons, and the petrol consumption one gallon per mile full load. 3. The tractor was taken in use on trial from the 19th June, 1911. It was undergoing repairs from the 28th June to the 9th July, and again from the 15th July to the 19th. During the period from 19th to 28th June it travelled 162^ miles. The average was n miles, and the average load per journey 7 1/5 tons. Average petrol consumption 2.4 gallons per mile. In relation to the payment of driver, the Director-General of Works reported, on the 27th January, 1912, that on the 15th July, 1911, the company wrote, saying that they were willing to extend the period of trial to demonstrate that the machine was suited for the work. A trial of the machine was conducted on the 28th August, and it was reported as not being capable of the work which the company undertook it would perform. The machine was taken over on the 19th September, 1911, and since then "" part of the undergear has broken again and been repaired."" On the 16th July, 1912, it was reported that for the two months ended n t h June, 1912, the tractor had travelled 442 miles (half going and half coming); the average journey was 8 miles; average load, 4 tons-carryin g in all 106 tons net; running costs ^87 19s. 6d.; average cost per ton mile, 2s. The average cost per ton mile with steam tractor is under 4d. The Director-General of Works then instructed that, under the circumstances, the tractor should not be used except on emergency, when any other form of transport could not be obtained. On the 14th August, 1913, the Director General of Works reported that the engine was delivered on trial subject to certain conditions, and was taken into use for that trial, but did not give satisfactory running results. On one occasion it broke down af the Molongo River (fractured gear casing of carden shaft drive). The broken casting was replaced by the makers, who, however, claimed that the fracture was due to a defective casting fractured in cold water. A trial was made in the Director General's presence, under conditions agreed upon by the representative of the firm, and the results of the trial were unsatisfactory. On the 26th Julv, 1911, however, the engine performed a trial satisfactory to the late Minister, and at his direction the purchase was completed. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT.

74,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"It is considered necessary, before replying to the specific questions asked, to quote Commonwealth M i l i tary Regulation 225, which deals with the redress of wrongsIf any soldier thinks himself wronged in any matter by any officer other than his captain, or by any soldier, he may complain thereof to his captain, and if he thinks himself wronged by his captain, either in respect of his complaint not being redressed or in respect of any other matter, he may complain thereof to his commanding officer, and if he thinks himself wronged by his commanding officer either in respect of his complaint not being redressed, or in respect of any other matter, he may complain thereof to the District Commandant where the soldier is serving; and every officer to whom a complaint is made in pursuance of this section, shall cause such complaint to be inquired into,_ and shall, if on inquiry he is satisfied of the justice of the complaint so made, take such steps as may be necessary for giving full redress to the complainant in respect of the matter complained of. If he thinks himself wronged by the District Commandant, either in respect of his complaint not being redressed or in respect of any other matter, he may complain thereof, through the proper channel, to the Military Board. A soldier may, if he so desire, submit his complaint in writing. The answers to the questions are : 1. Yes. While the Minister is. at all times ready to investigate the complaint of any soldier who thinks himself wronged in any matter, it is obvious that there must be some channel through which such complaint should be forhigh warded. The regulation above quoted seems to meet all reasonable requirements, and to be such as will insure the redress of any actual wrongs. The recommendation of the Military Board on any complaint submitted to that body is, prior to action being taken on such recommendation, submitted to the Minister for final decision. 2. Yes. The orders of the Department require applications from soldiers to be made, whether personally or in writing, through the officers commanding their companies, Sc., to the commanding officer of the unit.",19

I have no doubt the At torney-General thought that a very smart reply, and i would recommend him to again read Chesterfield's Letters to his Son, for then he would not be so impertinent. The reply was thought to be so witty that Honorary Minister said he was entirely accord with it .

I do not deem it necessary to say it, nor do I consider it necessary pear so egotistical and boastful before the community as to say I know a lot. The older I grow, I discover, the but I do know that Oxford has succeeded in turning out an Oxford larrikin in the person of the honourable member who demay scribes me as vulgar without any cause.",20
84,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,It seems almost profanity to describe the honourable member as division vulgar.,20
85,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I have the greatest fear of the capitalistic party opposite.

87,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I am old enough to know that I would not have another opportunity of speaking on this motion if I did sit down. I believe that they have designs on the people of Australia who for an are supporters of this party. The repreAct sentatives of capitalism in the Federal Convention builded better than they e knew. The Australian Labour party suci n electing only one representative he to the Convention- Mr Trenwith; ten Labour candidates who put up in New South Wales being defeated. The representatives of the capitalists who composed the Convention, therefore, thought that are nothing was to be feared from the adop- tion of the principle of one man one vote. "" These Labour agitators,"" they said, "" will never be elected to the Federal Parliament, and therefore it will be perfectly safe for us to put that provision into the the Constitution."" I understand that the in honourable member for Parkes once said I have not the exact words, and I dread to misquote him-somethin g to the effect that the representatives of the hob-nailed community would never find a place in this Parliament.",20

90,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I have heard nothto aping worth answering.,20
91,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I ask honourable members to read section 29 of the Constituless I know; tion, which says thatUntil the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the Parliament of any State make laws for determining the divisions in each State for which members of the House of Representatives may be chosen, and the number of members to be chosen for each division. A shall not be formed out of parts of d if ferent States. In the absence of other provisions, each State shall be one electorate. t is, therefore, within the power of this to make laws determining the divisions of the States, and even to declare that each State shall constitute only one electorate. Do Ministers intend to propose that that shall be done? We ought to know. If the secrecy on their part is w i l f u l , we have a right to administer sometliing in the nature of a reprimand. Section 30 of the Constitution saysUntil the Parliament otherwise provides, the qualification of electors of members of the House of Representatives shall be in each State that which is prescribed by the law of the State as the qualification of electors of the more numerous House of Parliament of the State; but in the choosing of members each elector shall vote only once. Honourable members opposite cannot remove the prohibition of plural voting, but it is within their power to so restrict electoral privileges as to practically strike thousands of electors off the rolls. deed, the Attorney-General said, in his hasteWe propose to allow the political organizations to assist the electoral officers of the Commonwealth in purifying the rolls. We wish to know whether the Bill provides for political organizations assisting the electoral omcers in striking names off the rolls. Mr W . H . IRVINE - How can able members know what the Bill provides until they have given leave for its introduction ?",20
92,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I am trying to administer a little castigation to the honourable member for his objectionable reply to me the other day, when he had a full opportunity to indicate his intentions, and should have done so. It is a common practice, when a Minister proposes to in troduce a Bill , for him to outline its main features.",21
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,It has never been the practice here.,21
94,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Perhaps the honourable member, when in Opposition, did not know of the standing order, but I remember the circulation of memoranda in this Chamber stating the intentions of Bills.",21
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,They culated upon the introduction of the Bills.,21
96,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Are we not entitled to information? I have read in the press the statement that it is intended to introduce a Bill of one clause to amend the electoral law.,21
97,Mr SAMPSON,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"If the honourable member will allow us the opportunity of seeing the Bill , he can judge what is in it .",21
98,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Thes e interpolations do not assist, though they occupy a little of my time. Government members, by their interruptions, are trying to delay business. If they continue, I shall come to think that there is something in what the Prime Minister said when he asked, ' ' What is the matter with Australia ? What do we want any more laws for ? "" All this talk about trying to pass legislation may be so much bluff. The political game of the Government is to introduce a Bill of one clause reestablishing the postal vote. On such a measure discussion would be restricted, and the game of honourable members opposite would be successfully played if they could get the measure on to the Senate, and bring about the failure of the Senate In- to pass it after it had been twice sent within three months, because that would make a double dissolution possible. If that is what is in the minds of honourable members, I ask them to read the two articles which were published in the Melbourne Age yesterday and the preceding day, dealing with the subject of a single and a double dissolution, and showing that in all probability their last state will honor- be worse than their first. I deem it my public duty at every opportunity to put a sprag into the destructive wheel of the Ministry. The Attorney-General has said that he wants the political organizations to assist the electoral officers in purifyin g the rolls. He surely does not know the political abuses which occurred in Queensland under that system. Surely this great Commonwealth is wealthy enough to pay the electoral officers, police, canvassers, and all other persons necessary for the compilation of a good and pure electoral roll. Mr W . H . IRVINE - What I said was that objections to names on the roll would be invited from political associations. These would be considered by the Department, and investigated with a view to purifyin g the roll.",21
99,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"That correction does not were cirimprove matters. All that the political association did in Queensland was to f u r nish objections to names on the roll, which were thereupon struck off by the electoral officers. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That was wrong, surely! It was not suggested that the electoral oflicers should strike names off the roll on the ipse dixit of political associations, but that these associations should furnish information which would permit investigation to be made.",21
100,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The Attorney-General must see the objection to that. The capitalist party has an organizer in every electorate, and in many of the large towus. In Rockhampton, for example, a man is kept permanently employed looking after the rolls and after the political organization for which he works, the capitalist party paying him . The Attorney General is going to ask tliese paid servants of the capitalist party to make objections to names on the roll. Is it likely thab they will object to the names of persons thought to vote for the capitalist candidates ? But is it not likely that an overzealous servant of the capitalist partyand these persons are generally overzealous--wil l make objection to names of men who have every right to vote? far as I can glean, there is to be no provision for publicity in regard to these representations. Bad as the Queensland system was, it had this to recommend it , that publicity was given to objections. On pages 1 and 2 of the Mo wit Morgan Argus of 4th September, which came by the last mail .",22
101,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Is the honourable member going to lay the paper on the table?,22
102,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"If necessary. casual glance, I should on these pages there the names of full y a thousand persons which have been struck off the roll for Mount Morgan. These names were advertised in accordance with the State electoral law, and before each there appears either the word "" left "" or ""dead."" .For the most part the word "" left "" appears. There is also published in this issue of the Mount Morgan Argus the following warning on the .part of the editorWe would urge every one to look up the list for his own or friends' names. The work of revising the rolls has been done by the police. Many names have been left on for Mount Morgan which should have been on the ""Normanby list, and vice vend. The present attempt to adjust matters entails plenty of work on the new Clerk of Petty Sessions, Mr R. Power, but he has tackled the job, and will now have to stand the many calls of "" left "" voters. In other words the editor suggests that people whose names have been struck off the roll on the ground that they have left the district will be calling on the clerk of petty sessions in their tens, twenties, and forties to explain that they are still resident in the district. One advantage of the Queensland electoral law is that notice has to be given in the newspapers when any name is to be struck off the roll , so that the person concerned, or his friends, may see the advertisement, and be able to take action. The Attorney-General's proposal is, however, to allow political organizations to furnish objections, and that the electoral officer shall have the power to strike off the names of persons objected to without publishing the fact that he intends to do so. Such a procedure is extremely dangerous.",22
103,Mr MATHEWS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Eve n a published notice is not always seen.,22
104,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Quite , so. The Attorney-General may say, "" We shall send notice to the elector i u each case."" There are many thousands of people in the ComSo monwealth who might not receive such a notice, and who fail very often to get a uotice eveu when it is sent through the post. Then, again, many men when they received such a notice might be busily engaged at their daily work, and would say, "" Why should we bother about spending half a day or a day in waiting on the clerk of petty sessions to request that our names be left on the r o l l ? """,22

The present electoral law is about as perfect a system as has so fa r been devised.,22
106,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I know cases where people had to send in cards two or three times before they could' secure enrolment.,22
107,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Notwithstandin g the faults in the system to which the honourable member may be able to point, I contend that the scheme under which an elector desiring ""to be enrolled must sign a card, which is kept in the office for reference, is the best that has yet been devised. Then, again, in the Act , as it stands, there are a number of sections relating to the purification of the rolls. In Mount Morgan, for instance, at the end of 1912, 800 names were struck off the roll for Capricornia.",22

A new manager, who had been appointed by the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, proceeded to make a reduction in the staff with the result that 700 or 800 men were discharged. Many of these found their way to various parts of Australia, and of the 800 names objected to there might have been 500 or 600 that should legitimately be left off. There are several questions which I wish to ask, if honourable members will bear with me, before I vote to give the Honorary Minister leave to bring in this Bill .",22

Mr Howie, a Liberal secretary working in the Batman electorate, has under investigation a case of a woman who appears to have voted three times in that constituency. . . . The alleged appointment of partisan political persons as officials within the polling booths is not the least important subject to be sifted. What I complain of is that men like the Treasurer have evidently read all this scandalous talk, and accepted gospel, thus doing much harm to the reputation of the people of From my reading of statistics, the people here are, if anything, more honest than the people in other parts of the world. That may be due to the more general prosperity in this country; but, whatever the cause, it is possible for a man to go from one end of Australia to the otlierover immense distances, sufficient to embrace Spain, France, Italy, and Germany - absolutely unarmed. This high standard of honesty is continually rising, as crime statistics show us; and our educational system, too, has doubtless thing to do with this. Much has been said about the last general election, but I should like to tell honourable an experience of my own about years ago, when I was a candidate for Parliament. A committeeman ponent gave £1 each for votes, and it is interesting to know the way in which the money was earned. This gave a mau a blank slip of paper, and told this man that, on going into the polling booth, he had to put the paper into the ballot-box and bring out with him his untouched ballot-paper. the man did, and received his reward. When the next voter came along he was given the ballot-paper-by filled up in favour of my opponent-and instructed that he had to put it into the box and bring out his own untouched ballot-paper.

If honourable members opposite have a scheme whereby the secrecy of the ballot may be retained, let them explain it . I do not think that they have anything of the sort. They are a wicked, designing set of men, who want to rob the great majority of the people of the right to vote.",26
167,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Herbert) [4.10] - I desire to make a few suggestions to the Minister in charge of the Bill . during the discussion of a second reading, or at preliminary stages when there is an exhaustive debate, many valuable suggestions for amendment are made which cannot be dealt with at the Committee stage. At that stage, the M i nister in charge of the Bill may move amendments which have been agreed to in Cabinet, but the Bill may not be amended entirely in accordance with the desires of honourable members generally. On previous occasions I have made suggestions for the amendment of the electoral law when an amending Bill was being discussed, but have not been able to give effect to them. Apparently the Bill which is to be introduced will be of such a character that only matters with which the Ministry desire to deal will be covered by it . What I desire is that the Bill shall be so framed that other amendments of the electoral law besides those proposed by the Ministry may be made,- should there be a majority i u favour of them.",27
168,Mr FENTON,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Does the honourable member say we shall be debarred from inserting new clauses ?,27
169,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,We shall not be allowed to insert clauses going beyond the order of leave. That has been ruled over and over again by Chairmen of Committees. I wish the order of leave to be made as wide as possible.,27
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,It could wider.,27
171,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I have suggestions to make for the alteration of the electoral law, which I am sure will commend themselves to the Prime Minister and to the Minister in charge of the Bill , and I hope that the order of leave will be made wide enough to enable effect to be given to them in Committee. To mention one matter, I wish to do away with the monetary deposit that candidates are now required to make. There should not 'be a deposit. It is unfair to ask candidates to lay £ 2 5 to nothing that they will secure a certain number of votes. To do so is to encourage the gambling instinct, and to that, I am sure, the Prime Minister is opposed. There are other alterations of the law which, in my opinion, should be made, and I ask that favourable consideration may be given to my request for an opportunity to propose them.",27
172,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Hindmarsh) Usually, [4.16] - We might have expected from the Minister ' in charge of the Bill for which leave to introduce is asked an explanation of the lines on which it is constructed. I may be told that it is not usual at this stage to make such an explanation. That may be so, but the House has the right under the Standing Orders to demand an explanation at any stage. We are quite justified, therefore, in not treating the present motion as a formal one, and in asking for an explanation of the proposed Bill . The M in ister in charge of the measure might have met us by furnishing information. We are entitled to know what the proposals of the Government for the alteration of the electoral law are. Having a majority, the Government can, of course, ultimately obtain leave to introduce the Bill . All Oppositions are handicapped in not having the power to extend the scope of a Bill . That can be done by getting leave to amend the title to cover amendments not provided for, but obviously a Government that did not wish further amendments to be made would use its majority to prevent such an alteration. There is very little hope, therefore, of succeeding in an attempt of that kind. I do not object to the provision of our electoral law which requires candidates to make a inonetary deposit. It may be a handicap to some would be candidates that £ 2 5 must be deposited on nominanot be tion, but there are two sides to the question. In my opinion, no man or woman ought to be nominated who cannot count upou substantial support. To be poor is always a misfortune, but I have known very few poor persons to be candidates for Parliament, and to have a fair chance of success, who could not find supporters prepared to subscribe their deposit money. When a candidate has a chance of succeeding, there is no risk in doing this. B n t ""why should the Commonwealth he put to the expense and trouble of an election when there are only two candidates, and one of them has not the least chance in the world of getting even the small number of votes now required to prevent the forfeiture of the deposit?",27
173,Mr DANKEL,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I know of a case in South Australia in which a perfect idiot was nominated by way of a joke.,28
174,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"That thing has not happened often in South Australia, but were the provisions regarding deposits eliminated from the law, interested persons would occasionally run candidates who had no chance of success. They would do this for the sake of the few pounds which they could thus get into their nets. I always believed in the deposit system, even before I entered the State House. Every man or woman contesting a constituency should give prima facie evidence of the belief that reasonably sufficient support would be obtained. Candidates sliould not be nominated in a manner that would abuse our electoral law and bring elections into contempt. I do not ask that Ministers should practically read the provisions of the proposed Bill , but I think that they should tell us how they propose to alter 'the electoral law. This is a matter of exceptional in terest. No one believes more strongly than I do that we should, where possible, adhere to the forms and practices of Parliament, recognising the principles underlying them, but the present case is exceptional. The Government had two lines of policy which it might have pursued. It might have interpreted the recent election as an expression by the people of the desire that during the next three years there should be rest and respite from the reforming zeal of the Labour party. A patriotic Australian Government would have assumed that that was the interpretation to be given to the verdict of the people. But instead of adopting such a policy, this Government determined to proceed along a reactionary line, and to reverse, as far as possible, the work done by their predecessors.  apply to the work of the late Government-migh t it not be said that it was reactionary ?",28
175,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I think we are entitled to expect on the part of the honourable member some acquaintance with the political history of the country to which he belongs.  mation.,28
176,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The question is so stupid that I am surprised that the honourable member should ask it . It is recognised by every thinking man of the Empire, as well as in the Republic of America, that the community is divided into two sections. One section is bent sort of upon reform, believing that existing conditions, and more particularly the distribution of wealth, cannot be said to be satisfactory; while the other- I will not say that it is a reactionary party, because to say that the Conservative party consists solely of reactionaries would be to do them an injustice-take s up the position that, although things are bad, the granting of the reforms demanded by the other side would serve only to intensify the trouble. They, therefore, say, "" We prefer to stand where we are.""",28
177,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"--But this is an electoral measure, and the honourable member will see its provisions when we are given leave to introduce it .",28
178,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The honourable member should have outlined the provisions of the Bill when he moved for leave to introduce it .,28
179,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,It has never been neces- sary in the history of this Parliament to explain the scope of a measure on a motion for leave to introduce it .,28
180,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The people do not expect from the Conservative party anything in the nature of reform""; but they do expect reforms from a Labour or a Radical Administration. As to the statement just made by the Honorary Minister that it is not the practice to challenge a Bill on the motion for leave to introduce it , I am not prepared to say that the custom is altogether satisfactory. I am not prepared to admit that honourable members should cease to use on all occasions the right they possess to challenge a Government on a motion for leave to introduce a Bill .",28
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The honourable member is quite r i g h t ; it is only right to treat a motion for leave as a formal matter when one is on this side of the House.,28
182,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I am glad that the Prime Minister agrees with me that when things are different they are not the same. I do not think that the honourable gentleman can complain when we ask for information as to the lines on which the measure is framed, so that we may either debate it , or allow it to pass on to a further stage. The Government, instead of interpreting the verdict of the country in the way to - which I have referred, have declared war on the working people of the community. When war is declared, you do not expect your opponents to help you to gain possession of all the strong positions, or to move your troops wherever you like.",28
183,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Is the honourable member afraid to have the provisions of this Bill , published ?",29
184,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The commercial press have already told us that it is a Bill of one clause, but they indulge i u so much fiction that one cannot depend very much on their statements. that we have in power a reactionary Government with a reactionary policy, and that from the date of the last general election until recently the whole of the people of Australia were defamed, charged with double voting, and all sorts of malpractices",29
185,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Especiall y in connection with the postal vote. Does the honourable member recollect what his party used to say about the postal vote a few years ago?,29
186,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,If the honourable member had given us the fullest information when he submitted this motion,29
187,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I will give the honourable member the information as soon as he sits down.,29
188,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"T l i e whole of the electors of Australia have been slandered. I do not say that they were slandered by the members of the Government, but they were certainly slandered by their organizations, their hacks, their jackals, and their commercial press. If they possessed the slightest measure of common sense, they would have realized what actually occurred. Tliey would have remembered that we altered the law by providing for compulsory enrolment, and I believe that at least one-third of the electors at the last general election believed that they would be imprisoned if they did not vote.",29
189,Mr KING OMALLEY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,They made the farmers in my district believe that.,29
190,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"And they did the same with many people in my electorate. Many women voters in the electorate of Hindmarsh asked me, "" Sball we be imprisoned if we do not vote?"" I told them to vote by all means, but to have no fear about being sent to prison if they did not vote.",29
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Did the honourable member's constituents ask that question ?,29
192,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Yes , and the same question was asked all over South Australia.",29
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Now we begin to understand why Labour won in South Australia.,29
194,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"What the Government are beginning to understand is what every schoolboy knew from the first would happen-that because of the compulsory enrolment, and the belief held by many that they would be punished if they did not vote, there was a very heavy poll. The conclusion to which honourable Knowing members opposite came, however, was that because the men and women of Australia woke up and recorded their votes in large numbers, corrupt practices had occurred.",29
195,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Corrup t practices?,29
196,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"S u r e l y it is a corrupt practice to vote twice. The suggestion that double voting was indulged in came, I shall not say, from the Government personally",29
197,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,They fathered it .,29
198,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I do not say that, but the Government heard these statements being made, and had not the manliness to utter one word in defence of the people of their country, who were being defamed in this way. Twenty years ago the taunt often used to be hurled at politicians-althoug h we do not hear it so often nowadays-that they were professional politicians, living on the game. If we are professional politicians, we have a perfect right to be jealous of the honour of our profession. I am not anxious to see growing up in Australia a race of professional politicians, who are conspicuous by the fact that tliey can never speak the truth , even by accident. There is a tendency in that direction, and it should be mercilessly suppressed.",29
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Hear , hear! That is very rough on the honourable member's side.",29
200,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I do not know so much about that. If we are to hand over, under this Bill , the purifying of the rolls- I believe that is the cant phrase used by the other side-to political organizations, what are we to expect? We may expect what I have known to be done here, and what has been scandalously done in the Old Country. I refer to the practice of selecting from the rolls the names of those known to be too busy to object if they are struck off-the names of people who are so busy that they will not go before the Eevision Court. These organizations would not think of picking out a member of this House or a candidate, because they would say at once, "" That man knows too much. We will let him alone."" They lodge objections by the score, and men and women, even if they receive notice, in many cases are too busy to take action, and when an election comes round they find that their names are not on the roll. This is a Conservative trick which is as old as the hills. It is part of the game of the party which believes in the power of wealth and privi lege, and in keeping down the working man. They say, "" Give him a vote,"" and next day they proceed in this way to rob him of the righ t to vote. No doubt, that is part of the arrangement to be followed in connection with this measure. The organizations of the Conservative party will set to work to get as many names as possible off the roll in the shortest space of time.",29
201,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Does not the honourable member think that he had better see the Bill before he makes foolish statements ?,30
202,Mr ARCHIBALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The Honorary Minister should have told the House, in submitting this motion, the lines on which the Bil l is drafted. The Minister has no one to blame but himself for the criticism that we have heard this afternoon. It would be a very good practice for the Government, in introducing Bills, to give some indication of their contents and of the principles on which they are based. This is a practice that has been repeatedly followed in the past, and might well be generally adopted. We are told by the press friends of the Government that the great object is to purif y the rolls. But we know what that means whenever the brigade opposite touch the electoral laws. Their policy does not mean the purification or the rolls, but their attenuation as much as possible in the interests of their party. There is nothing very original in such a policy. It has b:en made a fiue art in the Old Country, where the electors are robbed of their rights to the utmost possible extent. If a man moves even into the next house he is struck off the rollsnay, if a lodger moves from the ground floor to au upper floor he is disfranchised, aud has to wait, perhaps for twelve months, or until the next August, before he can be placed on the roll again. This is done by the august allies of our friends opposite, and with the old object of oppressing the people, and robbing them of their votes systematically on every available occasion. I m mediately after the general election we find this Government, even with a majority of one, foaming at the mouth in their anxiety to carry out their reactionary measures. I rise simply to .protest against the Government introducing Bills of this character; and I have in timated what I think their policy should be in view of the present state of parties. If they intend to proceed on their reactionary way, they must expect every inch of the ground to be fought. The Government and their press friends are both inquiring why we should not proceed with non-contentious legislation; but I suppose that, if we did so, it would only mean that some non-contentious measure would be placed in front of the Electoral Bill and hurriedly disposed of. This would once more bring us up against contentious matter; and, as I have said, the Government have no one to blame but themselves for the position this afternoon. It is a logical conclusion of their policy of declaring war against all the measures of reform passed by their predecessors. The ablest statesmen in the Old Country have laid it down that the Government should not attempt to reverse the measures of those who have gone before them, but should proceed with a steadying class of legislation until their countrymen give a dicision in another direction.",30
203,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I should like to give honourable members opposite some information now.,30

207,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I am glad the honourable member admits that his desire is to close the debate and prevent discussion.,30

215,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"In that, the orable member is on firm ground, and has, struck the key-note of the position. If there is one thing that should not dealt with from a party point of view, is the electoral law.

As I say, there was a spiracy set afoot to try to make the people believe that something very wrong had taken place during the elections. justify themselves in slandering the people of the country, the Government and their supporters have thought fit to come with some kind of Bill , though what kind of Bill it is we do not know, and the Minister refuses to give any information. The Bill was merely thrown on the table like a bone to a number of dogs, and solely we were invited to worry it .",31

219,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Quite true. At , any rate, the motion was thrown on the On an occasion like this, some of the measure should be given.",31
220,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Let me have a chance to,31
221,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member will probably get a chance in corthe morning. Supporters of the Governat ment, and many members of the Government, took part in the conspiracy to to slander the people, and they endeavoured to justify their position by holding a It was only by chance that one of the newspaper reporters ferout the fact that an inquiry was to held; and when the question was raised in the House, the Government were forced comto accede to the request of the Leader of rethe Opposition to allow the presence of scrutineers. What has been the result of the inquiry? Out of the thousands of n - alleged cases of double voting, we have a not heard of one solitary conviction. It only shows the lengths to which honourable members opposite were prepared to We had the Treasurer producing a telegram from a defeated candidate in honFremantle, to the effect that there had been 2,800 double votes in that constituency; but, as a matter of fact, the be scrutiny showed that there were only 150 it odd who were alleged to have voted twice. Then, as the honourable meinber Capricornia has told us, the Treasurer the was simply amazed to think that the be people of his own State were so honest. The surprise on my part is that the Trea! surer should have taken up such a position, and no doubt that surprise is shared by those who read the honourable gentleman's remarks. There is much in what the honourable member for Herbert said about the scope of this motion being made as wide as possible; but the scope of the conB ill does not depend on that of the motion, but on what the Bill contains, and on the second reading. We have no To information from the Minister as to what the Bill contains, and we have a righ t to the information, if only by way of in down terjection. The only method by which we can ascertain what the Government in tend to do is to take the statements made by supporters of the Government, whose votes, I suppose, have an influence on Ministers. The honourable member for Grampians takes up a certain stand.",31
222,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I draw attention the state of the House. formed.],32
223,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The member for Grampians delivered a speech at Avoca a little while ago, and stated that, in his opinion, the only persons who should be permitted to vote at elections were tliose on the ratepayers' rolls. Is it part of the policy of the Government in the Bill they are about to introduce to make the ratepayers' rolls the basis of enrolment? A f t e r the first Federal election there was an inquiry held, and there was an effort made to have all voting done by post. All who gave evidence on those lines belonged to the Conservative party, and they desired that voting should be by post, because they claimed that it would save expense and a considerable amount of trouble for the voter. They alluded to the loss of time in voting in the ordinary way at the polling booths. So we can see in this instance a desire not to extend or liberalize the franchise. If we take this case, there is the desire to restrict it as much as possible.",32
224,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Y o u will find that this Bill actually liberalizes it .,32
225,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,- I am glad to have that interjection. The honourable member will now see the error of his ways. He will see that it is not the correct course to merely come down and ask for leave to introduce a Bill without giving the smallest details as to the outlines of the measure.,32
226,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I shall do penance if the honourable member will sit down.,32
227,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"In addition to the honourable member for Grampians desiring that we should have only the ratepayers' roll, there was another honourable member sitting behind him who desired to considerably limit the franchise. I can go further. Let us go to the recent Bill introduced in Queensland by the same party, who are part ancl parcel, and supporters, of the organization to which members of the Government belong.",32
228,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"If it will pacify the honourable member, I can assure him that the Queensland Government had absolutely nothing to do with the preparation of our Bill.",32
229,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"They may not have had anything to do with the preparation of the Bill , but the honourable member has seen the Queensland Bill , to and has probably copied some of its most [Quorum Conservative provisions.",32
230,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I have not seen it , and honourable I have not copied it .",32
231,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"There has never been, in the last twenty years, a more Conservative measure in relation to the franchise introduced in any Parliament of Australia than the Queensland Bill . It will disfranchise, at least, 50,000 people if it becomes law, and this will be done in a very simple way. There is a clause in the Bill which says that people may not have their names on the roll unless they have bond fide residences. Until the time that I left the Queensland State Parliament to come to the Federal Parliament, that had never clearly been defined, but the provision was used by those who support the present Government to disfranchise people bytens of thousands throughout Queensland. In those days in the western part of Queensland, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the borders of New Soutli Wales, very few had votes. It seemed almost impossible to keep a name on the roll, and when an election came round we found, in all the small towns in the back country, only those had votes who had permanent residences in the towns. ",32
232,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"And , as has been said by the honourable member for H in d marsh, if a man crossed from one side of the street to the other he was disfranchised, or if he changed from one address to another he was disfranchised. If people could not prove to the Electoral Registrar, wheu he held his Revision Court, that they had bond fide residences in particular spots they were disfranchised. That law in Queensland was abolished by a subsequent Government, and eventually they brought in adult suffrage, but now we find the reactionary party that has been in power in Queenslaud for a year or two coming to the rescue, and enacting the same state of affairs that was in existence twenty years ago. When we see these things taking place, when we know that they are brought about by the very men who are supporting honourable members opposite, when we know that the very man responsible for the introduction of the Bill in Queensland was trustee of the secret f u n d in connection with the organization of the Liberal party, it is reasonable for us'to be very suspicious in relation to the matter now before us. What was the postal vote about which honourable members say so much, and which they are also anxious to restore? Do they mean to say that all who were sick at the last general elections-al l thesick and crippled who were in hospitals and could not record their votes, were Liberal supporters ? Considering the exposure and risk to in j u r y that are likely to occur to the masses of the workers, I do not hesitate to say that there was just as large a proportion of the sick and crippled at the last election who were supporters of the Labour party, as there was in relation to the other side. Yet when we tried to give the people in the institutions an opportunity to record their votes, a number of the same individuals supporting our friends opposite refused to allow us to make polling booths in certain hospitals.",32
233,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,This Bill will give all those people a chance of voting - th,33
234,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The postal vote is open to fraud, and corruption, and deceit of every kind. It opens the way to the violation of the secrecy of the ballot, and I shall, therefore, use every endeavour to prevent any return to the postal-vote system.",33
235,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,That is a serious reflection on the honesty of the Australian voting public.,33
236,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member is a great authority on the honesty of the voting public of Australia. Let me say that those who do dishonest things are not to be found on this side of the House. I have listened to the Prime Minister denying having slandered the people of Australia in regard to the vote at the last elections, although at the time he made the denial he had in his pocket a letter with the name of the writer who had defamed the people of Australia, and he was not manly or honest enough to tell the people who had done it . I say again, that I believe there is greater opportunity for fraud under the postal-vote than under any other system I know of, and if the Honorary Minister chooses to say that that statement is libelling the electors, he may say it to his heart's content, for what he says does not trouble me. Prom what I [39] have seen of the postal vote, it has certainly opened a means of violating the secrecy of the ballot. To mention again the matter to which I am about to refer may seem almost tedious repetition; but I do not think that it can be spoken of too often in this connection. I have not with me at present figures relating to the whole of Queensland, but I know that in Charters Towers alone at one election 2,700 postal votes were recorded, many of them in the names of persons who were dead, and others in the names of absentees, some of whom returned on election clay only to find that they could not vote, because they had been personated. The Government of the day appointed 300 justices of the peace, of whom somewhere about twenty were for the Charters Towers district, to go round witnessing and collecting postal votes. So far as these 2,700 votes were concerned, the voting was practically open and without secrecy. A few persons using the postal vote might have recorded their votes secretly; but the vote generally was manipulated practically by two organizations e Progressive League and the Labour organization. I do not claim more credit for my party than' for the other party. I witnessed some hundreds of these votes, and, had I desired, I could have known for what candidates they were cast. To say that that cannot be known under the postal-voting system is to try to deceive. The wholesale corruption that occurred at the election of which I speak was unparalleled, and the new Parliament had hardly met before a Bill was introduced to abolish the postal-voting system.",33
237,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The Queensland postalvoting system differed from ours.,33
238,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The same thing could have happened under our system. To get the right to vote by post under the Commonwealth system, one had only to say that he had reason to believe that he would not be within 5 miles of a polling booth on election day, and any one could say that.",33

240,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"All we ask now-is leave to introduce a Bill to amend the Electoral Act. If the honourable member thinks that the Act is perfect, he should vote against the motion. - Mr MCDONALD - Excep t for one or two minor matters, in respect to which it might be altered, there has never been a better electoral law in Australia. I do not claim that because our electoral law is practically perfect now, it will always be so.",33
241,Sir JOHN FOKREST,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Unde r it , personation is easy. - Mr MCDONALD - The right honourable gentleman should be the last to speak of personation. Did he not, in the Parliament of Western Australia, represent a constituency whose electors numbered only forty-five.",34
242,Sir JOHN FORREST,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,That is not,34
243,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The right honourable gentleman had those forty-five men practically in his pocket.,34
244,Sir JOHN FORREST,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Is the n: ember to be permitted to make incorrect statements? I never had a constituency of only forty-five. My constituency was the town of Bunbury, which always had a population of at least 1,000.",34
245,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The honourable member for Kennedy must withdraw what he said.,34
246,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I shall not withdraw anything.. The Treasurer had no right to interrupt my speech.,34
247,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Is the honourable member for Kennedy in order in saying that he will not withdraw a statement which - he has been directed to withdraw?,34
248,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I have asked the honourable member to withdraw his statement, because it is offensive to the Treasurer. It is the usual practice to require such statements to be withdrawn.",34
249,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I think that I am being badly treated. If this sort of thing is to continue, we shall have chaos, and it will be impossible to conduct the business of Parliament. It is outrageous for one honourable member to interrupt the speech of another.",34
250,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The honourable member has not yet withdrawn his statement.,34
251,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Is the Honorary Minister running the Chair?,34
252,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I am waiting for the statement to be withdrawn.,34
253,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I withdraw it .,34
254,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,It was a gross reflection on the Chair to ask if I was running the Chair. I request that that remark be withdrawn.,34
255,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I did not intend disrespect to the Chair, but the Honorary Minister has no right to put leading questions to the Chair. The Treasurer published a statement to the effect that 2,800 persons voted twice in Western Australia during the recent election.",34
256,Sir JOHN FORREST,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I only sent on a telegram which I had received,, and which I believed to be true.",34
257,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member gave that telegram to the press, but when an inquiry took place, and it was found that only 156 persons were alleged to have voted twice, he expressed true. surprise; in fact, he was disgusted that there were not 2,800 cases of double voting.",34
258,Sir JOHN FORKEST,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I said from whom honourable I got the telegram.,34
259,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,But the honourable gentleman said that he believed it .,34
260,Sir JOHN FORREST,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,So I did.,34
261,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable meinber believed that the people of Fremantle were so corrupt that 2,800 of them voted twice. When it was found that only 156 votes were recorded twice, it was the duty of the honourable member, especially in view of his high and responsible position, to apologize to these people for the slander he had cast upon them. The Bill may contain some extraordinary provisions. I should like to know whether it provides for the adoption of mechanical voting contrivances. We have all heard of machine politics, but there is something to be said for machine voting. If provision is to be made for the use of voting machines, I should like to kuow what make of machine will be used ? A number of voting machines have been exhibited in this building, and one invented by a Mr Harding, watchmaker and jeweller, of Grafton, seems to me best suited for the purpose, and most convenient, though, of course, I have not been able to thoroughly test it . The .machine is small, being only 8 or 10 inches square, and could be operated for elections affecting two or three candidates. .Another machine, at r u l y wonderful contrivance, has been invented by some one else, whose name I forget, for recording the voting in Senate elections. The use of machines would save much expense in printing ballot-papers and other documents, and the machines could be used effectively on a very simple plan. Each machine would be in a booth, in front of which would hang a curtain, and the elector, having obtained from the presiding officer permission to vote, would pass behind the curtain, and, seeing the names of the candidates exhibited in large letters in the booth, would vote for the man of his choice.",34
262,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,A photograph could be taken of each voter.,35
263,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"And the Honorary Minister, who is fond of posing in this House, would have yet another opportunity to pose. The elector records his vote by simply turning a handle. of the advantages of the machine is that it does away with the necessity for counting the votes, each individual vote being recorded by it . It has already been used largely and with very considerable success in America, and I trust that the Government will take into consideration the desirableness of introducing some such system. I recognise that such an innovation would be viewed with - a certain amount of suspicion; but in America, as I have said, it has been adopted with success. Some time ago a Bill was introduced providing for the use of postage stamp machines in the Commonwealth. These machines, it was proposed, should be sent out by the Department to responsible firms, and it was shown that a very considerable saving would be secured by their use.",35
264,Mr AGAR WYNNE,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The Senate rejected cannot be serious. the Bill .,35
265,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The General will admit that the machine, to which I refer only by way of illustration, is a very useful one, and would save much expense in the printing of stamps. or later voting machines will be introduced, and should prove of much value. At the last general election there was a very marked increase in the percentage of electors who recorded tl\eir votes. gratulate the people of Australia the interest they evinced on that occasion in the doings of the National Parliament. In my own electorate, for instance, 76 per cent, of the electors on the roll recorded their votes. These tors were scattered over an area of 330,000 square miles, my electorate being nearly four times the size of Victoria; and when we remember that many of the people had to travel long distances in order to record their votes, we must all appreciate the self-sacrifice shown by them. cases, electors journeyed 50 miles in order [39]- 2 to vote, and I have had letters from men who travelled an even greater distance. One can have nothing but admiration for the people who are prepared to go to such trouble in order to exercise the franchise. Another reason for the large increase in the percentage of voters at the recent elections was the fact that the Electoral Act had been considerably liberalized. The absent voting system had more to do with the increase than had anything else of which I know; but, judging by th© utterances of their supporters, the GoOne vernment now propose to destroy that system. It is only a little while ago that honourable members opposite used to say that only 40 or 50 per cent, of the electors had recorded their votes, and that with a bigger poll they would have been returned to power. We now find that it was only when a comparatively small percentage of the electors of the Commonwealth took the trouble to vote that the'y secured a majority in this House. They propose now to destroy the system under which every elector is given ample opportunity to record his vote. The Honorary Minister told me just now that a question of this kind should be above party. Seeing that he holds that view, why should he ask for leave to introduce a Bill that is going to destroy a system that facilitates the exercise of the franchise?",35
266,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member He has not seen the Bill. Postmaster- Mr MCDONALD - I am merely judging from the utterances of supporters of the Government. It is true that I have not seen the Bill , but the Sooner Minister should have let us have it before'. Does he not know that the standing orderwliich makes it necessary to move for leave to introduce a Bill is designed to protect the minority i u this Parliament? I conI have heard him in this House use Ihe upon very words I have just uttered. No honourable member has been more desirous than he has been of eliciting the fullest information regarding the scope of a measure on the motion for leave to introelec- duce it . The same remark will apply to the Treasurer.",35
267,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,H as the honourable member another quarter of an hour to go ?,35
268,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Yes .,35
269,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Let us make it twenty In some minutes. I wish to hear in full his objections to the Bill .,35
270,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I am merely raising a preliminary objection. The honourable gentleman will hear my objections to the Bill when it is submitted to us. I had no intention, when I rose, of speaking for more than a few minutes. As a matter of fact, I came here prepared to speak, on the A u d it Bill , as I understood an arrangement had been made that we should proceed with the consideration of that as a non-contentious measure.",36
271,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,We could not possibly foresee that the Opposition would object to leave being granted to introduce this Bill.,36
272,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"We object to the way in which the motion was practically thrown on the table. I can well imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, what a strong protest you would have entered against the course now being taken by the Government had you been on the floor of the House, and sitting in Opposition.",36
273,Sir JOHN FORREST,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I thin k this is first time we have had objection raised on a motion for leave to introduce a Bill.,36
274,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The whole object of the standing order requiring that leave shall be obtained to introduce a Bill is to enable information to be secured regarding the scope of the measure. right honourable gentleman, who asked the electors of Western Australia to return him again to Parliament so that he might complete his political jubilee, could not have been in this Chamber during the last thirteen years if he has never heard objection raised before to a motion for leave to introduce a Bill . If he has not heard such a motion discussed on a previous occasion, I can only say that he has not been paying attention to his parliamentary duties.",36
275,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The honourable member knows that we never obstructed at this stage.,36
276,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"That is a distinct imputation that I am obstructing this measure, and I ask that it be withdrawn ?",36
277,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"If the Honorary Minister made such an imputation, he must withdraw it .",36
278,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I made, not an imputation, but a statement of fact. I said that we had never obstructed a Bill at this stage.",36
279,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I accept the honourable gentleman's apology. If the honourable member meant the statement to apply to his own party, and their obstructive tactics at various times, it is a different matter. Of course, the honourable member knows more about obstruction than we do on this side, for we have not had much experience, while he is a past-master in the art. Repeatedly during the past three years, at this stage of Bills, information has been sought by honourable members opposite.",36
280,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I am willing to give the information as soon as the honourable member sits down.,36
281,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member refused the original request for information, and only now, when there is a b it of a fuss, he expresses his willingness to give it .",36
282,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I am willing to give it .,36
283,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"This is one of the cunning little dodges for which the honourable member is famous. If we, in our simplicity, were to allow him to make an the explanation, he would be taken to have replied on the debate, and there could be no further discussion.",36
284,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I at first thought honourable members opposite really wished for information, but now I think that they do not.",36
285,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable The member is imputing unworthy motives, and going altogether beyond parliamentary procedure. He is taking a course which certainly is not creditable to him as an Honorary Minister.",36
286,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,And he is bringing discredit on the Ministry.,36
287,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Of course; but the Honorary Minister is not very much concerned about that. We desire the fullest information; and, had it been given, I should not have spoken. I am afraid, liowever, that the Government are going to introduce a Bill for the express purpose of disfranchising many people-that , as in Queensland, they will propose a residential qualification. Just after the first elections we were told that there were thousands, and tens of thousands, of electors who had not been placed on the r o l l ; but now it is said that there are too many names on the rolls. It is evidently a most difficult matter to satisfy honourable members opposite. They know as well as we do that it is not possible under our present system to avoid having more names on the roll than there are people entitled to vote at a particular time; but I point out that, in my own electorate, for instance, while there are 39,000 electors on the supplementary and original rolls, there are only about 34,000 on the official roll. facts that honourable members opposite do not take into consideration. were told that in the Oxley electorate there were 50 per cent, more votes than there were electors; and yet I understand that' the Prime Minister has in his possession a letter from the gentleman who made that assertion, though that letter the Prime Minister has refused to deal with. Under all the circumstances, it is about time the Government and their supporters abandoued all this nonsense about dual voting. The Honorary M in ister has, I may say, earned a reputation as an eminent detective in the Department over which he presides, and has engaged a number of "" Pinkertons "" to gather information as to double voting. However, no case of double voting has been brought to light, although two or three months have elapsed since the elections, and the Government have had unlimited money and the full power of the Commonwealth behind them. There are organizations which are prepared to go any length in swearing to almost any statement calculated to bring discredit on the Labour party. My own experience of - politics is that crooked voting is very rarely found amongst the working classes, but usually amongst that portion of the community who are prepared to pay very liberally for it .",36
288,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,This is a gross calumny.,37

296,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I took the observation as a reflection on a certain section of Parliament. If it is not such a reflection, I suppose it may be allowed to pass. I wish to have the honourable member's assurance that it was not made as a reflection on any section of Parliament.",37
297,Mr MCDONALD,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I unreservedly withdraw anything that may be taken as a reflection on any section of this Parliament. What I was pointing out was that the corruption complained of in connection with the double voting is not found amongst the workers, but amongst those who are prepared to pay for such corruption. The Honorary Minister, in a disorderly interjection, tried to attribute some statement to me that I never used or intended to use.",37

I , for one, do not admit the soft impeachment that we on this side are "" out for "" obstruction. It has been suggested that the Government should allow one of the members of their party to go away, so that there could be a new election on the old roll, and I suggest that, preferably, the honourable member for Grampians, who is very anxious to go to the country on a ratepayers' roll, be that one. There is no doubt that the honourable member is in favour of such a roll, and that a majority of honourable members opposite agree with him. As a matter of fact, I do not believe that any honourable member opposite, witl i the exception of the Prime Minister, believes, in his heart of hearts, that there ought to be manhood and womanhood suffrage. I know that manhood suffrage had to be dragged out of members of the State Parliaments.",37
305,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Manhoo d suffrage has in variably been granted by Liberals in the past.  rals had no alternative but to vote for it , in order to save their political skins.",38

307,Mr MATHEWS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"We have not got it in Victoria now.  it was New South Wales or South Australia that led the van in this connection; but I do know that, up to the time of Federation, South Australia was one of the most democratic, if not the most democratic, of the States in the Union . At that time we used to point to South Australia with gladsome finger, and look with gladsome eye on the legislation passed in its Parliament. But it was like the rest of the States, it got. back again to the old Conservative groove, and reactionaries, as Mr Deakin called them at one time, of every party have got together, and are trying to excel in seeing how far they can put the clock back. According to a speech reported in the press, the Attorney-General desires outside political bodies to assistassist, mark you-the officials of the Department in purging the rolls and keeping them clean. Is that - the Attorney General's idea? Mr W . H . IRVINE - The idea was to have them assist in a particular way by supplying for investigation the names of persons they think ought not to be on the rolls.  was framed, it was the desire of members in every part of the House, because of their experience in the different States, to do away with political bodies having any connection with the electoral administration under Federation. I can. speak for Queensland only, because the whole of my Australian life, until I came to Victoria, was spent there. At the time of the shearers' strike, in 1891, we were told not to strike, not to rebel, not to conspire, not to go about in armed bodies, but to put members of our party into Parliament.",38
308,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Who told you that?  ment, with Sir Thomas M c l l w r a it h at the head. We set about doing t h is; we put our own men into Parliament, and the first man we put in was in the Barcoodistrict), where I live, and that was Thomas J . Ryan-the first pledged Labour man returned to the Queensland. Parliament. Then what did they do ? A political organization, led by Sir ThomasMcllwraith, sprang up, called theNational party; and there was also the' Pastoralists Union. Some people wonder why we have such a set on the squatters. If they only knew one-half of what thesquatters did to us in Western Queensland, they would not wonder, for thesquatters not only robbed us of the f r u it s of our toil, but they robbed us of our franchise. They made things so difficult, and put so many obstacles in the way of men leading nomadic lives getting on therolls, that it is a wonder that any Labour members were returned to the State Parliament of Queensland. They told us to get on the roll and put our own men into Parliament; but directly we did so, they started purging the roll by the use of the word ""residence."" The population of Western Queensland is nomadic. Very fewpeople live in towns, unless they are conmected with trade or have their homes in - the towns. The vast proportion live a nomadic life, going from place to place, sometimes living on the borders of New - South Wales, often across the border, in New South Wales, and then in a few months, perhaps, moving from four or :five hundred to six or seven hundred miles - away to another part of the interior.",38
309,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"They are the backbone - of Queensland.  we started manoeuvring to put these men o n the rolls and return Labour members to Parliament, the organizations of which I have spoken sprang up, particularly the Pastoralists Union. They objected to any man being on the roll unless he had a - fixed place of abode. Fancy a man who had to hawk his labour from shed to shed, from station to station, having a fixed place of abode! There are many men in Western Queensland today who have no homes. The consequence was - that they used to strike these men off the roll, not by ones and twos, but by - hundreds, and the practice became so bad that at last the Australian Workers Union had to take a case to the Supreme Court. It was one in which men had been deliberately thrown off the roll on the "" residence"" qualification, and we secured a ruling from Mr Justice Chubb that it did not matter where a man was, if he was up a tree or at the foot of a tree, or under a bridge, or in the bush, wherever he - camped when travelling on the road must be held to be his residence. Consequently, we got a few men 'back on the roll under that decision of the Supreme Court. But, what happened afterwards ? The Pastoralists Union had their paid secretaries and paid - organizers, and if there was anybody on the roll whom they thought had Labour tendencies, or if there was anybody on ihe roll described as a labourer, they sent in an objection. There was nothing to .pay; they simply had to object to the names being .on the roll on the ground of some disqualification or other. The objection was sent to the Registrar, and then posted to the man's last known address, or to the address given when the person got on the - roll. Then, if the letter was returned - to the Electoral Registrar, it was taken - as primd facie evidence that the person objected to had lef t his residence; and so, without any more ado, the name of that person was struck off the r o l l ; and, when he went to vote, thinking he was on the roll, he found he was not on the roll at all. There was a gentleman named Marshall, the pastoralists' agent at Barcaldine, who objected to every known Labourite on the roll, and said he would make them all go to the Revision Court and prove their claims for inclusion. ' Honourable members know what it means to have to go, perhaps, 30 or 40 miles to a Revision Court to prove the bona fides of a claim for enrolment, and it is not surprising that 90 per cent, of those objected to would not attend the Revision Court. But, in the Queensland Act at that time, there was one provision which this gentleman had forgotten, and two or three of us who used to look after the rolls at that particular time put our heads together. Our opponents got all the law they could possibly secure in Longreach, Barcaldine, and Blackall, so that we could not retain any lawyers; and two of us had to stand at the Revision Court and fight the gentlemen of the law, who laughed at the idea of our objection. But we had the joker up our sleeves. There was one provision in the Act which said that any person objecting to any names on the roll must himself be on the roll. We hunted through the Barcoo roll to see whether this gentleman's name was on it , and as we found it was not there, we let them have their f u n for about seven or eight hours, and when 400 or 500 names had been struck off, we objected to this gentleman appearing as objector, seeing that his name was not on the roll. There was, of course, a great flutter in the dovecote amongst the horse-hair gentlemen, and they tried to bluff us; but the acting police magistrate, who was the Registrar at that time, had to adjourn the Court while he telegraphed to Brisbane to get the advice of the Home Secretary as to what he should do; and next morning, at  tion is f at a l; every one of those names must stop on the r o l l . "" The election came off in three months, and we romped in. From that time out we have been fighting the squatters. We are fighting them to this day. The same people are supporting honourable gentlemen opposite, finding their money for them. I know this, because I happened to get a cheque that was sent from a station when I was at Cunnamulla. It was at the referendum before the last. They taxed themselves so much per 1,000 head of sheep, and the cheque was for £ 7 10s. from one station. It was given to me because I was the only politician there. I am sorry I did not stick to it . At any rate, I sent it back and told them it was of no use to me, but that it proved they were supplying money with which to fight the referendum. People in the south caunot realise what the squatters in the north do. At Isisford they had a packed Bench of squatters, and an old, imbecile postmaster as chairman of the Bench sitting like a stuffed monkey, saying, "" Yes , Mr .

They had been persons on stations, with the names written in pencil where the signatures were to be put in ink. I often think of the words of the first member for Adelaide-the late Mr C. C. Kingston-who speaking in this chamber on the first Electoral Bill , said that the only way secure a true reflex of the views of the people, and a fair and square deal for every candidate, was to bring the voters to the polling booth, and make them vote there. I am more than satisfied that that is the ouly way to prevent abuses. A lot has been said about the way i which the last election was conducted; and I candidly confess that when I saw all the reports in the newspapers from various parts of Australia, including little Tasmania, where the people are posed to be incorruptible, I thought that there must be something in the howl about double voting and personation. Indeed, I was afraid that so many seats would challenged that there would not be enough members to make a House. Judge of my dismay when I heard, on the first day of meeting, that the Government had got to work to find out all about this double voting. But, after they had checked all. the rolls again, what was discovered Like the Treasurer, I was surprised.",41

H ad matters been left with the Postmaster-General, he would not have , sent out detectives. Like me, he is a sport.

No one is out to lose unless he is merely fighting a forlorn hope for the benefit of his party. It is those who do -.that who deserve most n credit. Why should detectives be sent out at the behest of any union or league 1 If fraud has been perpetrated, let things be done in the light of day. Those who even have been guilty of personation should supbe brought to justice. The honourable member for Ballarat is not afraid of this investigation. If the Minister knew anything, he could not keep it secret for five be minutes. If anything was discovered to be crooked in conuexion with the Ballarat election, the world would know of it within five minutes, though, of course, Ministers are not going to prosecute any one of their political colour. But should the detectives discover anything crooked ? which might be attributed to the other side, the Minister could not keep the inno formation secret for five minutes. The first interviewer would get it from him .",41
326,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I thought the honourable difmember meant that the honourable member for Ballarat would learn Departat mental secrets even before I could, cr within five minutes of my knowing them.

"" Here is something against the Labour party; something they are suspected of doing."" We should not only have prosecutions, but if the persons suspected were thought to be Labour supporters there would be persecution too.

The honourable member is reckless.  less. I am pleased to have the assurance of the Minister that he does not interfere with the Chief Electoral Officer. I should like to ask whether the Chief Electoral Officer sent the detectives to Ballarat of his own volition, or whether they were sent with the consent of the Minister ?",42
330,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I answered that question this afternoon. The Chief Electoral Officer took all the steps concerned.,42

I am satisfied that he does not interfere with the Chief Electoral Officer, and that what has been done by that officer has been done of his own volition. But is he allowed to incur expenditure off his own bat in this way?",42
333,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I think it right that he, as the guardian of the Act , should have some discretion. I wish that the lateAdministration had taken that view, and. left to the Chief Electoral Officer a lot of matters concerning which he should have exercised his own discretion, instead of interfering with presiding officers aud so forth.  interjection reminds me of another matter to which I desire to refer. My experience of presiding officers and returning, officers is that they are a very mixed lob. In one part of my electorate a presidingofficer, if he thought that an elector had' Labour tendencies, had no ballot-papers-, to spare.",42

Hewas thus able to say, when his ballot-box. was opened, that there were so many Tory votes as against so many Labour votes, and he hoped in that way to gainr the encomiums of the squatter "" push "" of the district.

The general run of those who officiate as returning and presiding officers are just as honest as the rest of the people of Australia; and Z know that it has heen the desire of every - Government to secure the services of as many public servants as could be spared to conduct the elections. The Honorary Minister has not told us anything of the scope of this Bill .",42
336,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I am burning with anxiety to tell the Opposition of its scope.  is in this Bill a clause that will deprive many of my constituents who take part in strikes-and sometimes a strike is a day's outing for some of them-of the right to vote. There may be in the Bill a clause depriving all unionists of the right of enrolment. This may seem rather farfetched; but such a proposal was actually advocated a few weeks ago by the Age newspaper, which has been supporting the Government through thick and t h in . An honourable member opposite has said that the rural workers have not asked for a union. I would say, in reply, that, so far as I am aware, there has been no demand on the part of the people for electoral reform. I am satisfied with the electoral law as it stands, and do not think honourable members opposite have mucb cause to complain. The Government have come here with a vast majority , and are using it i u such a brutal fashion that they sometimes keep us here until midnight. If the Honorary Minister is, as he says, consumed with a burning anxiety to supply us with information regarding the scope of this Bill , why did he not avail himself of the opportunity to give us that information when he submitted the motion? Why did not the Government introduce this Bill in the Senate? The members of another place have nothing to do. They are simply marking time. They have done only three or four days' work, while we have been labouring here for the last three or four weeks.",43
337,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Surely the honourable member is not in order in reflecting on the Senate.  the Senate, but on the Ministry, which does not give that House something to do. The Government say they are anxious to do something.",43
338,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"They pretend thab they are.  events, that they are very anxious to push on with business. Why do they not withr draw the Bill , and send it to another place ? If they did, I am sure they would get it back in due course. Meantime, we could go on with the consideration of the A u d it Bill , and that great national measure which is going to do so much for the people on the land-the Bureau of A g r i culture Bill . I have also an idea that this Bill may provide for the introduction of the novel and dangerous system of voting by machinery-that it may provide for the use of machines to register votes. They might do very well in big centres of population, where the ordinary system could be reverted to if the machine sud^ denly went wrong; but what would be the position in the country? The best of machines in every industry are liable to get out of order. What a fix we should be in if such machines were used at the next Federal election-which , I hope, will take place within the next few weeks and the honourable member for Wentworth, whilst instructing some ladies at the Paddington booth how to vote, got locked up with one of them, and no one could open the door. I should like to know whether the honourable gentleman proposes to supplement or to do away with the card sysbem.",43

The Honorary Minister has been giving interviews to the press regarding the enormities of the card system. He has told the press that dummy cards have been used; and, that being so, surely he will have something to say as to the steps which the Government intend to take to perfect the system.",43
340,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Honourable members opposite will not give me a chance.  will have a chance to explain about 11 o'clock. He will get his motion through to-night. We are all interested in this Bill , because it means either political death or salvation for many honourable members on both sides. It is a singular fact that, even when a general election follows another within a few months, some of those who think they are perfectly secure f all by the wayside. Is it any wonder that men fight so strenuously to secure seats in this Parliament ? I admit that the cushions are very soft and the company most agreeable... But the elections come around too soon, and, in my opinion, Parliament ought to he elected for a longer Senate for seven years and House of Representatives We desire to know what the Bill contains, and its scope; but the Honorary Minister simply threw a sheet of paper on the table for us to worry, and we have been worrying it ever since about 3 o'clock without making any advance. I have a vague idea that the Bill will provide for compulsory voting, and also preferential voting. However, any system would be good enough for the Government and their supporters, so long as it was sufficiently new and complicated; but I am game to bet that there will not be a clause which will make the law more effective than the present Act. If there is compulsory enrolment, the natural corollary is compulsory voting. If a vote is worth having it ought to be used, but we are told by opponents of compulsory voting that although we may take a horse to the trough we cannot make it drink. My experience is that once a voter is got to the polling-booth, he or she is affected by the prevailing feeling, and takes sides just as much' as do those who have been previously bitten by the political microbe. I should like to see compulsory voting tried, because I think it is a very good idea. Of course, all this is conjecture on my part, not having seen the Bill ; but a reporter whispered to me that when I saw the measure I would conclude, as he has done, that it is a perfect "" snorter.""",43

343,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I do not believe a pressman could have told an untruth like that.  Honorary Minister doubts; there is nothing of the Carey in me, and I am not going to tur n informer. I am satisfied that the reporter knew something, because he has been borne out in part by words which have fallen from honourable members opposite; and it is evident that he period-the has either seen the Bill himself, or seen the somebody who has. for five.

354,Mr JENSEN,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Bass) [8.10] - As a quiet, young, inoffensive, and very unassuming member, I am a little alarmed at the proposed introduction of this Bill , because of the utterances of delegates at a Liberal Conference, held at Launceston since the general election, and composed of about 150 delegates from the Liberal leagues of Tasmania. I have been wondering whether the Government have been taking instructions from that Conference. I have noticed that a Liberal or Fusion Conference was also held in Melbourne two weeks ago, and that the head of the Liberal or Fusion Conference in Tasmania has since returned and told his people in Tasmania that he was informed by the Prime Minister thab bhere would be an early dissolution of Parliamenb, and that the electors of Tasmania must be prepared; also that the Liberal party were going to the electors on two specific things only-the postal vote aud an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Conference in Launceston was held on 19th August last, and some of the richest men in Tasmania and some of the best canvassers among the ladies of Tasmania in the Liberal interests attended. I believe some of these ladies, at the last election, were not too particular as to what they said regarding certain candidates. The honourable member for Frankl in may nod his head as he likes.",45
355,Mr KING OMALLEY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,They said that I stole thousands out of the Home Affairs Department.,45

357,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The besb way to find out is to allow the motion to pass.,45
358,Mr JENSEN,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I shall take my own way. At the Liberal or Fusion Conference held in Launceston on the 19th August last, the first matber on the ageuda-paper for discussion was compulsory voting. Nine branches of the Liberal or f u s i o n leagues had that subject on the agenda-paper with a view to its discussion and to having it as a plank of the Liberal party; and Dr Botbrell, of North Hobart, made some startling statements with regard to what he would do, and what ought to be done in Australia. I believe that many who spoke did not approve of his statements, but I know that there are certain gentlemen sitting on the Government benches who do approve of them. might expect from them, because now they are dictated to by these leagues outside Parliament. They have accused us pf taking orders from the Trades H all and from the workers' leagues. admit that whatever the workers' leagues decide at their Inter-State Conferences every three years we obey if we subscribe to it ; but honourable members opposite take their orders from bodies outside Parliament, and it is what these outside bodies wil l compel them to do that causes 'a certain amount of alarm in regard to this Bill . I suppose Dr Bottrell has a certain following in Tasmania. He was representing the North Hobart branch of the Liberal League, and, according to the Launceston Examiner, he saidVoting should be regarded as He thought that at present they had got the vote too low down. The franchise was in the hands of those who were not qualified to it. It would be better if there were voters on the roll.",45

Those are the expressions of delegates to a Fusion Conference held in Tasmania three weeks ago. When analyzed, they mean that every old-age pensioner in Australia should not have a vote.",46

He says that no person getting Sbate assisbance should be allowed the privilege of vobing. He says the vobe has gob boo low down. This is the expression of opinion from people elected as delegates to the Launceston Liberal Conference.,46
363,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Did the conference carry that ?,46
364,Mr JENSEN,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,How often have honourable members on this side of the House been charged with responsibility for statements of delegates attending our conferences?

In his former years he was in business, but now he relies practically on what he can do as a justice of the peace, and he is associated with the Liberal League, having uo other means of earning a livelihood. He canvassed Launceston three years ago with regard to the postal votes. What I am most alarmed about in regard to the introduction of this postal voting system is the terrible authority men and women have over their servants. Take a lady who has two or three maids whose names are on the electoral roll.

383,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Would it not be better for the honourable member to wait for the introduction of the Bill ? If the things that he fears are not provided for by it, he will have been merely beating the air.",47

388,Mr TUDOR,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Yes , easily.",47
389,Mr SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I have had, I think, every day since the session opened, to remind honourable members that when the Speaker has repeatedly called the House to order it is grossly disall orderly to immediately interject, and if conduct of this kind is persisted in , I must have recourse to a standing order which I shall be very sorry to have to resort to. It ought not to be necessary for rue to make this statement every day. Regarding the incessant conversation and interjections which accompany speeches, I would like to say fcliafc it has been represented to me that members of the Hansard stair, experienced and trained as they are in the following of speakers, find it increasingly difficult to carry on tlieir work. I sincerely trust honourable members will not strain my forbearance to an extent which will compel me to take decisive action to maintain the rules of debate and preserve orderly procedure.",47
390,Mr JENSEN,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,It is rumoured that the Government intends to provide for the appointment of scrutineers.,47
391,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,That would not be a bad thing if they were paid.,47
392,Mr JENSEN,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I do not know that I am quite opposed to that, but I doubt if it would be right for the Minister to have the sole power to say who should be » appointed. I am convinced that the Bill members is to be introduced to do in j u r y to the workers of Australia. This Administration, which contains five or six barristers, will try to make the method of voting a difficulty to the workers. It has been suggested, too, that preferential voting is to be provided for, but on that subject. I shall reserve my remarks until I see the Bill . I trust that many of the rumours concerning the Bill are without foundation. Personally, I am not opposed to the sick having the vote, but I am opposed to the methods under which their votes were taken in the past. Mr W . H . IRVINE - What method would the honourable member suggest?",47
393,Mr JENSEN,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"- I suggest that every sick person should be allowed to vote providing that a doctor's certificate is obtained; and a doctor, justice of the peace, and a presiding officer or other oflicial should be present at the recording of the vote. Our opponents have tried to make it appear that we are against the sick having a vote, but we are not. Our objection is to the methods under which, during the election of 1910, and the referenda of 1911, canvassing for postal votes was indulged in .",48
394,Mr SAMPSON,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The Labour party disfranchised the sick.,48
395,Mr JENSEN,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"We may have disfranchised some whose votes would have been properly recorded, but we have disfranchised many more whose votes would have been subject to the exercise of undue influence.",48
396,Mr DANKEL,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Boothby) [8.34] - I look upon it as the solemn and almost the religious duty of every member on this side to speak to this motion. Tn days gone by there have been so many attempts by Conservative Governments to take away rights that had been won by centuries of persistent effort, that we cannot be too ready to defend our liberties. Only last week the Conservative Government of South Australia introduced a Bill to gerrymander the electoral districts of that State. As that Government has a majority in both Houses of the South Australian Legislature, the Bill will probably be carried, and although at the last Commonwealth election Labour candidates for the Senate had a majority of nearty 12,000, it will be impossible for the Labour party or any reform party to get the government of the State into its hands again for many years to come. What is proposed by this Government may be even worse. In any case, so many valuable suggestions have fallen from honourable members during this debate that we must be regarded as conferring a benefit on the Government. The Minister charge of the Bill may, perhaps, profit by the discussion, and be able to adopt them .for the improvement of the Bill . honourable members opposite would be willing to vote for a proposal similar to thai; moved at a Liberal-or , to speak correctly, a Fusion-conference , by the doctor referred to by the honourable member for Bass. The honourable member for Grampians has seriously proposed that the parliamentary franchise should be based on the ratepayers' roll. I do not know the details of the Victorian system of municipal and district council elections, but I know, to my sorrow, the details of the South Australian law. Woe betide the people of Australia if their parliamentary franchise ever becomes like the municipal franchise of South Australia. I do not think that it ever will , because we on this side are the champions and defenders of the people's rights, the watchdogs of political liberty. We shall oppose even the most subtle attempts to in terfere with these rights. In South Australia, a man possessing a large number of houses in a ward may practically monopolize the voting power of that ward. The owner of property has a vote for it, or he may give the right to vote to his agents, but not more than three votes may be cast in respect to one property. Sometimes a firm of solicitors goes into the house agency business, and an owner can make such a firm his agents. He can, moreover, appoint different agents for each property, and I know an owner who must have at least fifty houses in a ward of one of the eastern suburbs. Honourable members may imagine the enormous voting power that can be exercised by such a man.",48
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Surely some of the old members of the Opposition should do this; it ouglit not to be put upon the young members!,48
398,Mr DANKEL,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The Prime Minister is to be excused for the interjection, because he was not here when you, Mr Speaker,appealed for order a few minutes ago. We have had plural voting with a vengeauce- a system that is seriously proposed by the honourable member for Franklin-and this Bill may provide for its reiutroduction. We know that it is the desire of the Conservatives to introduce any system that will enable them to retain their position and secure an even larger measure of political power than in they now have in this Parliament. The last chance that they have of gaining a bigger majority is to do something of Many that description. I would remind them, liowever, that the Labour party has been returned by nearly one-half of the elecfor tors of Australia to see that no such legisto lation is passed. Coming to the questhe tion of absent voting, I would be prepared to support a proposal that all electors living more than, say, 10 miles from the nearest polling booth should have the right to vote in some way other than that present open to them. It is very diffisome cult for all the members of a family so situated to record their votes. A licensed victualler, for instance, might be 10 miles distant from the nearest polling booth, and since the law, in South Australia, all events, requires him to keep open during certain hours, all the members of his family would not be able to get away to vote. I would also be pleased to assist in devising some means of ento abling sick people to vote, but I shall most emphatically oppose the reintroduction of the postal voting system. Durmember ing the last twenty-two years I have had a great deal of experience in connection with electioneering. I was one of the foundation members of the Labour party in South Australia, and did a great deal of canvassing for others long before took a seat in the South Australian lature. As the result of my experience is canvassing. I know that any individual who would so lower himself as to t r induce people to vote by post when they were able to go to a polling booth could easily lead a large number to vote for particular party by which he was emto ployed. Between the date of the issue of the w r it and the time in which postal votes must be sent in , any ordinary indiAs vidual would be able to get 200 postal votes "" up his sleeve,"" so to speak, ready for counting when the poll closed. know how easily this could be done i the course of a house-to-house canvass. An unscrupulous canvasser could induce manv electors, especially women, to vote by post, particularly if he had a motor car at hand to drive them to the nearest post-office or to the residence of a justice - of the peace. Then, again, very people know until a short time before general election, the' names of al l the candidates who are offering themselves.. In the case of the Senate, the great of the people do not know the names of all the candidates and the parties to they belong. Should there be a double dissolution, and that, of course, is - unlikely, we might have from twelve to twenty candidates standing in each State election to the Senate, and it is not be expected in such circumstances that people generally would know all their names, or the parties to which they belonged. Many electors, when they were proceeding to vote by post,"" would say, "" Who are the Fusion candidates?"" or at "" Who are the Labour candidates?"" and men might be dastardly enough to mislead them. It is the easiest thing in the world to induce hundreds of people to vote according to your own sweet will .",48
399,Mr SAMPSON,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The honourable member at must have a very poor opinion of the in his house telligence of the electors.,49
400,Mr DANKEL,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"T h a n k God, the rising generation, are not quite the fools that their grandmothers and grandfathers used be in the matter of politics, but still there is a great deal of ignorance.",49
401,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The honourable should speak for his own party.,49
402,Mr DANKEL,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I am speaking for tli9 honourable member's party. If I were a candidate with plenty of money of my own, or with the funds of some political organization at my disposal, I would r-o I able, if I so desired, to secure the Legisservices of dozens of canvassers - as the Conservative party have done over and over again - and some of the y to more unscrupulous would find it an easy matter to have a large number or postal votes ready for counting when the the poll closed. I should not object so mu-sh the postal voting system in the case of women, if we could be sure that it would be used only in the case of illness. the law stood, liowever, it was merely necessary for . a woman to say that she "" t h o u g h t "" she would be prevented by We illness from attending at the pollingn booth in order to be allowed to vote by postr We could think whatever we pleased, and it was an easy matter for any one to say, "" I think I will be ill on polling-day, and I therefore propose to make use of the postal voting system."" I repeat that I would give those living more few than a certain distance from a pollinga booth the right to take advantage of the absent voting provisions of the Act , because, in the larger States, many peopio bulk in the back-blocks live so far from a polling-booth that it is almost impossible which for them to attend. It has been saidand I believe that even the electoral offivery cers have the scheme in view-that political organizations should be allowed to co-operate with the Government what is descrihed as the work of purifying the rolls. I know from what this so-called purifying of the roils might mean in the case of some duals. Prior to the last general elections the political party opposed to me, in o;;e of the eastern suburbs of Adelaide, >ugaged the services of a certain who openly boasted--indeed, members of my own family-that going to the local post-office to inspect the letter-carriers' lists in order to find out the names of those who had left the immediate locality with a view to having their names removed from the Many of these people, perhaps, moved only from one street to anotherthey had not left the division-and proposed to use the information which he obtained in this way to have their names struck oil the roll. Fortunately, of his intention in time to take and I believe that the electoral officer at once put a stop to this system, which necessarily put the people concerned to a great deal of inconvenience. name can be struck off the roll, must be given to the person concerned.; but many people are negligent in these matters, and do not take the trouble to answer such notices. Furthermore, people have been receiving so many notices under the Electoral Act that quite a number are sick of answering whilst others are so illiterate that are unable to grasp tlieir true significance. I am aware that the law permits a person who has changed his place of residence to notify the electoral oflicer, but people often change their places of abode, and it would be inconvenient whenever they moved from one street to another to send along the required notice. It is not the intention of the Act* that such people should be struck off the roll. I think it better that all political parties should be left out of consideration in connection with this work. Compulsory registration is a very good system, and I think it would be wise to follow it up with compulsory voting. members opposite may say, "" Since you say that many people do not know much about politics, why compel them to vote in ignorancel"" My answer is that it is only the burnt child who dreads the fire, and that, if people make a mistake at one election, they take care to rectify it on the next occasion. The casting of this elecMr Dankel. in toral responsibility on the shoulder's of the people would make them experieice take an interest in political matters. They would see that they gained some indi/i- knowledge of the politics of their country, and tried to use their franchise in an intelligent manner. It might be that the party or Government who introduced individual compulsory voting would come in for the he told vengeance of the electors at first; but we he vas know that people have to be compelled to do many things for their own benefit. For instance, some people have to be compelled to keep their back yards clean, not only for their own sakes, but for the roll. benefit of their fellow citizens. Again, had if you drive along Bourke-street, you must keep to your right trying to avoid he accident. Still another instance is found in compulsory education, to which, nodoubt, some people could be found to I heard object. action,",49
403,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,What has this to do with the motion?,50
404,Mr DANKEL,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I am showing how, in Before a. some cases, it is necessary to use compulnotify sion, and it is possible we may find in the Bill a provision for compulsory voting.",50

406,Mr DANKEL,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"In my opinion, this discussion is conferring a benefit on the them, Honorary Minister. The words of wisthey dom which fall from honourable members on this side may enable him to put the Bill in better shape than it probably is at the present time. I u any Electoral many Bill I should like to see a clause providing that the scrutineers appointed by the for thsm candidates shall be paid by the community. In country districts, wliere Labour candidates, on account of their poverty, cannot afford scrutineers, all kinds of hanky-panky tricks are played. The ex-Minister o.f Home Affairs sought to preclude as far as possible the employment of political partisans in the pollingbooth, but that, of course, is almost an impossibility, in view of the fact that all Honourable people who are intelligent enough for such positions hold political opinions of some .description. Of course, we might exclude those who take a very prominent part on one side or the other; but to exclude all political partisans is, as I say, impossible. When party feeling runs high, people often do things that in their calmer moments they would regret, and for that reason I think that scrutineers ought to be paid.",50

Of course, we should not be able to prevent everybody from canvassing, because there are always people willing to take risks, especially if they are paid by somebody high. to do so. Again, it is possible that in the Bill there may be proposed strictions on the right of public meeting, for this is not an "" u n k n o w n q u a n t even in Australia.

424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,That is precisely witwhat they did not want to do.,51
425,Mr DANKEL,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The Minister of External Affairs said all he needed to say, and almost all he wished to say, in a tactful manner, and did not offend anybody. My own experience is that a most hostile audience in any part of Australia always has the common sense and decency not to interject too freely, and give very little trouble, if they are tactf u l l y approached. To have a dozen policemen at a meeting is to set every person at the meeting on edge. The M in ister claims that the Bill will liberalize the existing Act , yet that Act is the most liberal on the face of the earth. In Australia we have the proud distinction of being the only people who have a full voice in the management of public business. This is due to the good old real Liberals who sat in the Federal Conventions, and drafted the Constitution which was approved by the people. So where liberalization comes in regarding this measure, I fail to see. Maybe it is the intention of the Minister to introduce the initiative, the referendum, and the recall. If so, I would welcome the measure. If I have read rightly, some honourable members representing Victorian districts have been advocating the initiative and the referendum, if not the recall.",51
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,As k the honourable member for Adelaide if he agrees with that.,52
427,Mr ROBERTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,And then I will ask the' Prime Minister whether he agrees with Councillor Webber.,52
428,Mr DANKEL,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"To introduce the initiative, referendum, and recall would be a liberalization that would, practically, put the apex on our political liberties and rights. The people of Australia would at all times have power over their representatives in Parliament, and it is absolutely necessary that they should have that power. They would not have to wait for a general election where personal factors step in , but at all times they would have the power in their hands to pull up their representatives on short terms. The rising generation, on account of the schoolmaster having been abroad, and on account of the high schools established throughout Australia-mainl y through the instrumentality of the Labour party-is advanced enough to follow and intelligently use such an instrument of legislation as the initiative, referendum, and recall. What greater glories could the people of Australia have? I hope the Honorary Minister has included in his Bill the power to initiate legislation, and also the power to recall any legislation objectionable to the majority of the people. No more glorious piece of legislation could be enacted; and if it is the intention of the Ministry to include that in this Bill I . would hail it with delight. It is a system that has been in vogue in other parts of the world. Switzerland has it , and in Switzerland they have State Parliaments as well as a Federal Parliament; each of the twenty-two cantons of Switzerland has its own Parliament. Despite four different nationalities livin g in the one country, they have had the institution of the initiative, referendum, and recall for a goodly number of years, and they use it very effectively. The people of Switzerland are the only people who truly govern themselves. Whether at all times they have used their power intelligently or not I cannot say, because many things require righting in Switzerland-the y are not such a happy community as many of the people living in Australia, that being mainly due to the fact that the natural resources of Switzerland are not nearly so abundant as ours--bu t it is singular that even in Switzerland it is very rarely that on the first time of asking the people have agreed to adopt by the referendum what the Government for the time being have advised them. It is generally at the second o r third time of asking that they do so; and, I am living in hope that our referenda defeated at the last general election wilL be carried at the next time of asking. I do not look upon this as a waste of time. I believe it is a good thing for the Government, even before they submit the. Bill , to know what is in the minds of-' members on this side. If they can bring forward a method by which the really; sick can vote, and an amendment whereby people living beyond a certain number of miles from a polling booth can vote, I shall be pleased to vote with them. It-, will show that we of the Labour partyare not bound hand and foot to everything. I voluntarily signed-and I have done it again and again before an election, - a platform I helped to make, and to that platform I am honourably bound. Of course, I use my own discretionon it , but outside that platform I may differ from other members on this side. While I was in the South Australian. Parliament I voted against the majority of my own party on dozens of occasionsat times I have been the only one votingwith the other party-but , of course, on questions not affecting the Labour platform. This shows we are not nearly so tied down by the dreadful. Caucus we hear so much of as are members opposite. If the Bill is a good one, I hope it will pass not only this House but the other House. If , however, the idea is to introduce that nefarious system, the postal vote, without the safeguards of doing away with canvassing from house to house, making it easy for people to persuade others, and for others to be persuaded how to vote, or if it is intended to introduce such a provision that if a person only thinks he is going to be ill or away on the day of election he may vote by post, I shall set my face against it , and I know it will not be accepted by members of another Chamber.",52
429,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Ballarat) [9.17] - I am very anxious that the Honorary M in ister shall have the opportunity of making the statement he refused to make earlier in the day.,53
430,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,That statement is most accurate. I did not refuse to make any explanation.,53
431,Mr ROBERTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The Honorary Minister did not refuse; he merely refrained from making an explanation.,53
432,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I have been corrected. I should have said that the Honorary Minister refrained from making a statement when he had the opportunity. It would have prevented all this discussion had he made the explanation. admit it is somewhat unusual to discuss a Bill when leave is being asked to introduce it , but the circumstances are somewhat unusual. Have we any reason to be dissatisfied with the electoral law ? Has it suited the requirements of the majority of the people ? We can only answer thati by making an analysis of the number of people voting at the last election, and comparing the percentage with that at the previous election. In Victoria, election day was the wettest polling day we have ever had, and yet the percentage of people voting was 75, while in Ballarat we had an 83 per cent, vote, the highest recorded in any part of Victoria. So, in that respect, I think there is little or no need for alteration of the law. The Prime Minister has been accused of making some very defamatory statements concerning the people of Australia in that famous interview with the reporter of the London Morning Post. These statements have been circulated throughout Australia. Irregularities are alleged to have taken place in connection with the elections, and detectives have been sent to Ballarat. The Liberal party handed a listi- I do not know whether it was to the actual Minister of Home Affairs or to the Chief Electoral Officer, but detectives were supplied with this list by the Liberal party, and I understand that as a result of their investigation, the detectives have found nothing wrong at Ballarat in connection with the elections. However, if there has been any abuse in any part of Australia we should have an investigation into the alleged irregularities before any Bill is submitted to the House. If it can be proved that under the absentee voting system there has been any form of corruption, duplicate voting, or personation, I am prepared to vote for the abolition of the absent vote, that is, if the evil can be proved to be at all general. If it can be demonstrated that the Act , which contained some startling innovations, opened the door for corruption, or for in - people voting for dead persons, I am prepared to support a stringent alteration. A little while ago the Ministry were very anxious for an investigation, and now they are bringing down a Bill before an investigation is held.",53
433,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,We are only asking for leave to bring it in .,53
434,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member intends to follow up this motion with I a Bill , but why does he do it before an investigation is made?",53
435,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I thought you were complaining of an investigation at the start.,53
436,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I am complaining of a partisan investigation.,53
437,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,That is a pretty rough thing to say about the Chief Electoral Officer; it is absolutely unwarranted.,53
438,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"When detectives are supplied with lists made out by the Liberal party, and no notice is given to the other side, the inquiry must be regarded as of a partisan character. I feel that there should be an investigation; but, if Ministers want honest voting, as we do, let them agree to the appointment of a Committee such as an honourable member opposite has given notice of his intention to move for, to make a full investigation. We shall be ready to afford every assistance for the securing of clean elections. I do not desire that the door shall be open to men to vote nineteen times, as it is said in Melbourne one elector did for me during the last election. But if Ministers wish to get on with business, why do they not introduce their Conciliation and Arbitration Bill? They have told the farmers that they are going to take from the rural workers the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court, and they should carry out their promise, although they know full well that before they can pass any measure into law the rural workers will have come before the Arbitration Court, and will have got an award. The exemption of rural workers from the arbitration legislation was practically the only questiou on which the Liberal party went before the country. Liberal candidates may have said a few words about the re-establishment of the postal vote; but, after what has taken place here in Victoria recently, no one should be anxious for that. When Mr Abbott and Mr. Clarke were candidates for a seat in the Legislative Council of Victoria recently, Mr Abbott was defeated by something like twenty-eight votes, and obtained a recount. It must be remembered that the electors of the Council have a property qualification, and are supposed to be better educated than ordinary electors. But this is the report of a Committee of the Council on the operation of the postalvoting system: With regard to the postal votes, 67 postal ballot-papers were issued. Six were disallowed by the Returning Officer, but one of these was afterwards allowed by the Committee on the recount. The Committee found themselves compelled by the Act to reject 22 additional papers, so that there were 27 rejected, or 40 per cent, of the 67 postal ballot-papers issued. So that 40 per cent, of those who voted by post at that election were disfranchised; many through no fault of their own, but because of a mistake on the part of the witness, and for other reasons. Had there been a similar investigation of the absentee voting, the percentage of voters disfranchised would have been found to be much less than 40 per cent. Most of the absent votes that were rejected were due to the casting of votes by persons who believed that their names were on the roll of some other electorate, but whose names had been removed prior to the election; very few votes were declared informal because of any wrong act on the part of the voter. The absent vote is easier and simpler than the postal vote. The system may need slight alterations. I think that the Returning Omcers should have the right to count the abMr MCGRATH. sentee votes cast within a division instead of having to send them to the head office to be counted, thus delaying the declaration of the poll. I speak feelingly on the subject, because I was fourteen votes behind my opponent when the direct votes had been counted, and something like three weeks were needed to count 2,600 absent votes that were sent in, pretty well half of which could have been counted on the night of the election had the Returning Officers in the respective divisions had the right to open them. The delay in ascertaining the results of the election caused an outburst of feeling against the absent vote; but the carrying out of my suggestion would have made that delay much less. I do not expect that the Bill will increase voting facilities other than by re-establishing the postal vote^a thing to which I am opposed, because I have seen a great deal of corruption in connection with that system. I do not say that that corruption is chargeable wholly to one party. So long as the door is left open to corrupt practices they will creep in.",53
439,Mr DANKEL,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Corruptio n is easy with the postal vote.,54
440,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Yes . A postal ballot-paper can be filled in in Melbourne, and sent to Ballarat, and only one person need know anything about it.. The name of a witness can be safely forged, because no inquiry is made as to his existence. I do not wish to tell too much, but I have seen enough of the postal vote to determine me never to vote for its adoption again. The postal vote is unfair, because it means that the party with most money and most canvassers must succeedI do not speak as one who has suffered, because, although I contested four or five State elections under the postal system, I knew how to organize it as well as the others did, recognising that it had to be looked after. It has been said that the Labour party abolished the postal vote because its members suffered from it, but I do not think that that is so. I believe that in 1910 a majority of the postal votes were cast for Labour Ministers and members. The honourable member for Boothby has pointed out that the exercise of the postal vote was allowed, not because persons were ill , but because they thought they might be ill , or might, on polling day, be five miles from a polling booth. The postal vote is a dangerous weapon to place in the hands of the employing classes. There is nothing to prevent them from asking their employees to sign applications for postal ballot-papers.",54
441,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,They have done it .,55
442,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I have no knowledge of it being done in Victoria, but there is. nothing to prevent it . The political fight is becoming very keen and bitter. At the last election we saw that the wealthy classes would stoop to anything to secure control of the Treasury bench. Having command of capital, and being able to employ armies of canvassers, they could prevent the Democrats from ever regaining possession of office if the postal vote system were in force. It is hard that those who are sick should not be able to vote, and if means could be found to enable them to do so secretly I should be ready to vote for them.",55
443,Mr WH IRVINE,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,What method does the honourable member suggest?,55
444,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I think that it would be necessary to send the Divisional Officer with the ballot-box to every sick voter.,55
445,Mr MATHEWS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,W it h a scrutineer.,55
446,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I know of no other way of conserving the secrecy of the ballot. We had to fight too hard to obtain the secrecy of the ballot to be able to afford to lightly forego it. had no chance of being represented in Parliament so long as the workers were compelled to vote openly. The honourable member for Wilmot has said that the Labour party is the only political party that has voted to disfranchise electors, but we know that only three years ago the Liberal party in Victoria took from the inmates of benevolent asylums the right to vote. Moreover, only one person in three in the State of Victoria can vote at an election for a Legislative Councillor, and there are only 20,000 in the State who possess the qualifications required of a candidate for the Council. Such a candidate must hold £1,000 worth of freehold property with unencumbered title deeds. Yet the honourable member for Grampians, who is so anxious that the sick woman should have the right to vote, would restrict the exercise of the Commonwealth franchise to those persons whose names are on the ratepayers' rolls. Do we find honourable members opposite fighting to enfranchise the Victorian citizens who are disfranchised, to restore the right to vote to the inmates of our Denevolent asylums ?",55
447,Mr TUDOR,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Not one of them has said a word in favour of that.,55
448,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Not a word. One gentleman- a doctor of law, I believedeclared in Tasmania that old-age pensioners should lose their right to vote. If such a statement were made in a moment of excitement by some of our leaders in the trade union movement, it would be quoted against us, but honourable members opposite go to their conferences and declare that they are going to deny various people the right to vote in this way with out any blame being attached to them. The party opposite profess to be anxious that every man and woman should be given an opportunity to vote, yet one of their members, the honourable member for Calare, told us that one rural electorate in Great Britain , comprising only 1,500 people, returned a member to the House of Commons, whereas a city electorate, comprising 49,000 electors, had only ones representative, and that he would like to see the same principle applied in Australia. These are the people who talk of extending the right to vote!  party elect their representatives to the Hobart Conference? They give one man ten votes. Labour Mr HANNAN - The delegates from V i c toria represented 150,000 unionists.",55
449,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,We have nothing to be ashamed of in connection with our representatives at the Hobart Conference. Our delegates were elected on the preferential system.,55
450,Mr SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member is not in order in referring to that, inatter.",55
451,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I thought the in formation would be interesting to the honourable member, who seems to knowvery little about the subject. How absurd it is for the Government and the ir supporters to declare that the sick should have the right to vote, when, during the present session one of their number has said that he would give 1,500 people in a country constituency as much votingpower as is possessed by 49,000 residents in a city electorate.  one Tasmanian has the same voting-' power as ten New South Welshmen.",55
452,Mr SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Order ! The honourable member for Calare must cease in terjecting.,55
453,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Perhaps the Ministry - will propose some' alteration in that regard. We cannot deny that the Senate is not elected on a Democratic basis, since the smaller States have equal power with the larger States; but the Labour party had nothing to do with the determination of the basis of representation. I was very young when the Convention sat, but I took some small part in the opposition to the Constitution Bill , because it provided for the very principle to which the honourable member refers. If the Government will propose an amendment of the Constitution, giving representation to the States in proportion to their population, we shall not offer much objection, but I should object to a scheme to divide each State into electorates for the Senate.",56
454,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,That could not be done without the consent of the States.,56
455,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I am glad to hear that that is so. The basis upon which the Senate should be elected was decided by the Convention, in which we were not represented. The system worked all right so long as the Conservative party were in the majority in this House. Now, however, they talk about class representation in the Senate, although they make no complaint concerning the representation of only one class in the Legislative Councils of the States, in which they have always had a majority. The Senate, at least, is elected by the men and women of Australia. In the case of that House, meu and women count for more than bricks and mortar. In respect of municipalities in Victoria, some people have three votes, while others have none. In some instances, where a shire is divided into four ridings, some people have as many as twelve - votes each, and certain families cast as many as fifty or sixty votes, although they do not reside in the At a recent shire election in my constituency the defeated candidate received the votes of two out of every three persons who went bo the poll. There, however, ib was nob the number of men and women who wenb bo the poll, bub the number of votes appearing opposite their names on the rolls, that counted. Are the Liberal party urging any alterabion of the electoral system in relation to our municipalities ? Ib is quibe possible that some startling propositions will be found in this B The Atborney-General has already made the alarming proposal that political organizations should be given power to object to any name being on the roll. If thab power were given, the Liberal organizations in Ballarab would have 20,000 names removed within a day. We, I suppose, would also be active, and practically every one in the division, with the exception of the candidates, would be objected to. This would be a very dangerous power bo give bo any polibical organization. The presenb method is simple, and, I think, fairly accurate. I wish to impress upon the Attorney-General, who, I am sure, is broad-minded and reasonable enough to be impressed with the arguments advanced by the Opposition, the danger of the power that he proposes to give to political organizations. I am certain that if we could get him bo realise whab could be done by polibical organizations on bobh sides if bhis power were given bo them, he would alber his decision. His time is so much baken up wibh his work in the Law Courbs and his Ministerial duties thab, perhaps, he has not been able bo make himself acquainted with the mebhod bhat has to be followed to secure the removal from the roll of the names of those who have lef t the district. The procedure is quite simple, the work being lef t practically to the postmasters in the various electorates. Who has a better knowledge of the changes of residence made from time to time than have the various postmasters ? The letter-carriers make a note practically every day of those who have removed, and they report to bheir superior officer. That officer then sends a notification bo the lasb address of the person concerned, and if no proper reply is received, his or her name is struck off the rolls. The system is quite fair ; it purifies the rolls, aud that is all thab we desire. Much capibal has been made out of the allegation that the Federal rolls district. contain more names than there are electors in the Commonwealth. That statement may be quibe brue. We were anxious that every one should be enrolled, and there was published throughout the Commonwealth a notice that those whose names were not on the roll for the subdivision in which they had resided for not less than one month, were liable to be prosecuted and fined. Many people who had changed their place of residence, in filling in their cards, stated that they had ill . not been enrolled, forgetting for the moment that they were on the rolls in respect of the division in which they had. previously lived, with the result that their names appeared on two different rolls. ] t does not necessarily follow, however, that they voted twice. They voted in respect of the division or subdivision for which they were last enrolled. Whilst it is said that there are more names on the rolls than there are electors in Australia, it cannot be asserted that at the last general election the number of votes recorded was in excess of the number of people enrolled. In the interview which Mr Myers published in ' the Morning Post, it was said that in the electorate of Oxley one and a half votes were cast for every person on the rolls.",56
456,Mr HIGGS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Absurd !,57
457,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"It is absurd. Statements such as these regarding the conduct of the elections at Oxley, Fremantle, larat, and certain other electorates ought to be cleared up. We are anxious there should be an investigation; that officials should be put in the box and crossthere examined. We court the fullest inquiry, and I am surprised that the first act of the Government, after the censure motion had been disposed of, was not to provid-3 for the fullest inquiry.",57

Once the Bill is introduced, with such a provision included, honourable members opposite stand committed to it , no matter what the result of an investigation might be. It is generally admitted that the Government have little or no chance of passing such a Bill through both Houses of Parliament, and, therefore, ' it is only wasting time to introduce it . It is unfair to accuse the Labour party of wasti-ig time, because we have declared that we are ready to go on with measures of a non-party character.",57

Personally, I do not think that were fifty cases of personation and duplication throughout Australia at the last election. It was a remarkable occasion. Never was interest so keen, or feeling so bitter, and never, in Victoria, was the weather worse. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, at Ballarat, the Labour party quite satisfied that they were badly beaten. Our opponents had all the so. That is motor-cars and private vehicles; but after investigation 4 o'clock thousands of our supporters, lo As whom the Labour movement does give party some inspiration, and who had been waitto it, ing in the hope of better weather, rushed it would be the polling booths.

463,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Not only the Attorney-General, but, I am sure, the honourable member for Henty would support such a proposal, for the latter was a strong advocate of signed articles when he was in the State Parliament.",58

466,Mr HANNAN,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The honourable member for Henty has nothing to thank the press for.,58
467,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Quite so; the Age has fought him all along, and, I think, perhaps with some justification. If the honourable member for Henty votes with the Labour party on this matter, then, of - course, the Ministry cannot carry the measure, even in this Chamber. I am surprised that pressmen should object to signed articles. We who go on the public platform have to take the responsibility - of everything we say, and I think it is - only fair that those engaged on the press should put their names to articles. Certainly, the present provision in the Electoral Act has had a great effect on the community. At one time, when a leading article appeared editorial "" we,"" many people thought that it was a production of many persons, whereas today they know it simply means the work of Tom Jones or Jack Brown, and they attach to it the i m portance it deserves. I assume that press writers say what they believe to be right and truth f u l , and they ought not to be ashamed of theirwork. I should not have spoken to-night if I had not thought it necessary to make my position clear. I feel that a great injustice is done to us by this investigation not being held in the first place; .and honourable members opposite must realise that we have deep cause of complaint. An investigation of the kind could be completed in about a month, when both sides, supplied with the fullest information, would be prepared to discuss whatever electoral reform measure might be introduced.",58

What right have the Government to ask for leave to introduce a Bill which might go to the extent of upsetting some of the vital principles of the electoral law? The Government have no mandate fro m the people to repeal any of the basic principles of existing legislation. They have been returned with the smallest margin of votes, and I doubt whetiier any Ministry in the history of responsible government has been returned with a smaller. If this indicates anything, it indicates that the people desire a cessation of legislation; at any rate, it gives no mandate to repeal existing with the measures. There are plenty of measures of a non-party character upon which both parties can agree.",58
473,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Is not this a non-party measure ?,58
474,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I do not think that any electoral amending Bill which could be introduced by the honourable gentleman could be of a non-party character.,58

CATTS - The present Government have no authority whatever to introduce legislation for the repeal of Has existing laws. They have been returned by the narrowest of majorities. In an waste-paper exceedingly well-written article in the Age of yesterday, 9th September, dealing with the political situation, I find an analysis of the party figures affecting the recent election. The result shows that the Liberal votes numbered 928,152, whilst the Labour votes numbered 919,737, and that the independent votes were 41,850. A f t e r referring to the votes cast for the Independent candidates, and pointing out those which might be claimed by the two parties, the article shows that the Labour votes in the country numbered 929,737, whilst the Liberal votes totalled 928,152. He has These figures show that, although the Government have a majority of one in a be- total of seventy-five members, a slightly greater vote was cast for Labour than for Liberal candidates. Due allowance is made for the uncontested electorates. In these circumstances, I submit, the Government have no authority to introduce repealing legislation. It is merely an accident, from the way the electoral boundaries are defined, that votes are distributed as they are in the various constituencies, and that the one party or the other secured the odd number. That is absolutely clear from the figures.",59
480,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Would not that always apply?,59
481,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I do not know whether it would always apply; but I venture to say that if it applied at any time when a Government obtained actually a minority of the votes cast, although by an accident they secured a narrow majority of members returned, it would rightly be claimed that that Government had no authority to repeal existing legislation, or to interfere with established vital principles. Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament, we seem to have had a new Electoral Bill every session. finding In these circumstances, we might almost say ' ' Give us this session our sessional Electoral Bill . "" The principal Act was introduced about eleven years ago by gentlemen who had spent their life-time as representatives of the people in our State Parliaments. One would have [Quorum thought that, with their wealth of knowledge, we should have secured an Electoral Act which would be almost perfect. Yet the ink was scarcely dry upon that measure before there was a proposal to> amend it . Session after session we have our electoral machinery upset and innovations introduced. As fast as we adopt oue proposal to cure some defect, it is found that that proposal itself contains an inherent weakness and defect. As a matter of fact, we shall never obtain an Electoral Act which will be free from im perfections. The Statute has to be framed by representatives of the people who have all the imperfections of humanity; and when it bas to stand the stress and strain of an election, we find the keenest minds in the community contesting one against the .other in an effort to obtain the political mastery. So that whatever the ingenuity of man may invent in the way of electoral provisions, the ingenuity of man will circumvent when a contest takes place to determine which political party shall obtain the upper hand. The Minister has not told us what alterations it is proposed to make in our electoral law, and, consequently, we must look elsewhere for the information. Turning to the policy speech of the Prime Minister, which is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 4th A p r i l of the present year, I find the following: We propose to repeal all this legislation, to restore to invalids the opportunity of voting through the post, to strike the shackles off the press of this country, to leave parties and organizations reasonably free to conduct their electioneering, and to re-shape our electoral laws so that they wil l not only reflect the principles of Democracy, but also the wisdom and good sense of the community.

Why should we not know where the money comes from with which these electoral battles are fought? If the Colonial Sugar Refining Company contributed £50,000 to defeat the referenda proposals of the late Government, why should we not know it? Surely it would tend to the political enlightenment of the people! Here we have a great combine, which can buy a full page in the Sydney Morning Herald or the Daily Telegraph for the purpose of misleading the people. Yet we are not told where this money comes from.

483,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member's party gave them £100,000 last year.",60
484,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member is wrong, but he reminds me that the present Government have given them £150,000 this year through ineptitude in administering the public revenues.

486,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"It is quite apparent that the Prime Minister proposes to remove the restrictions which have been placed upon these wealthy corporations, and to abolish the provisions of our Electoral Act which require them to submit a statement of their expenditure in connection with elections.

Where is the need for all this secrecy, if something is not being done to the detriment of the public? Surely these persons who claim to be patriotic, ought to have no objection to telling us what money they have expended in helping the political party opposite. During one of the recent debates in That is the this Chamber the statement was made that our trade unions spent large sums of money for political purposes. Of course, if organizations are to be called upon to submit an account of their expenditure for political purposes, it should be made to apply all round.

Has the Bill been before the Fusion caucus? He must know that once it is brought in he must support it , whether he agrees with its provisions or not. If there is something in it to which he objects and an effort is made to eliminate it , he will be compelled, should the Minister say that the Government regards the matter as vital , to vote against his convictions. 1 anticipate that the Government intends to abolish the provision requiring returns of election expenditure from the great capitalist organizations of Australia that elecpour their wealth into the lap of the Fusion party to secure legislation in their own interests, enabling them to further exploit the masses of the people. These organizations are really only advancing these sums of money, knowing full well that they have the power of taxation over The the people, and can simply increase the price of goods, and scoop the money back with an added amount when their friends are in power. Honourable members opposite, apparently from the Prime M in ister's speech at Parramatta, propose to remove this obligation from the capitalist organizations to let us know the destination and the amount of funds they are contributing in this process of interfering with the legislative power.",61
503,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,How Honorary Minister give to that f u n d ?,62
504,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member for Wentworth is very fortunate in having inherited a considerable amount of wealth, so we are led to believe.",62
505,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,That is not quite the game.,62
506,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I am making no reflection on the Minister.,62
507,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I only wish it was true.,62
508,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,It has been suggested that the strong financial position of the honourable gentleman had something to do with the. present position that he occupies.,62
509,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,What do you mean by that statement?,62
510,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Order ! I am waiting for the honourable member to connect his remarks with the question before the Chair.,62
511,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I rise to order. A statement has just been made by the honourable member that my ""strong financial position "" has had something to do with the position I am at present occupying. I think it will be clear to you, sir, and to the House that an indefinite reflection of that kind is not worthy of an honourable member.",62
512,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,You are stretching it . What is the point of order?,62
513,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The point of order is that that remark, if it is intended to be seriously made, is not only a gross reflection upon myself, but a very gross reflection on the Government and honourable members generally. that the honourable member be required, not only to withdraw the statement, but to apologize for it . It is a very serious thing for an honourable member to say that a man owes his position in the M i nistry to some "" financial position "" which he occupies outside the House. honourable member does not withdraw the statement and apologize, I shall move that the words be taken down.",62
514,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I request the honourable member to withdraw the observation he made.,62
515,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Do you, sir, rule that my observation is an offensive re",62
516,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The M i ni t ister regards the remark as offensive, and it is a rule of the House that when request of that kind is made the remark is withdrawn. much did the Mr JH CATTS - In deference to you, sir, I withdraw the remark, but I must say that the honourable member is posing and attitudinizing here, and trying to make out that there is something in the remark, when there is absolutely nothing in it .",62
517,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,In what?,62
518,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,In the statement. I made.,62
519,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Judg e Heydon made that remark in regard to the honourable member's statements several times.,62
520,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The honourable gentleman is stating what is absolutely untrue.,62
521,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Is that in order, sir?",62
522,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member makes an untrue statement, and then objects to the retort.",62
523,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Order I The honourable member must know thab he is saying what is grossly disorderly. I ask him to withdraw the statement.,62
524,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I do withdraw the remark, sir, and I ask you to require the Minister to keep silent while I am speaking.",62
525,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I am doing my best to preserve order, but it is a hard job.",62
526,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable gentleman stands up and appears to take a point of order seriously, and then laughs like an as or a grinning idiot.",62
527,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member must not make use of expressions of that kind. I ask him to I ask, sir, withdraw the expression.",62
528,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I do withdraw the expression, sir, but I ask you to take a note of the general attitude of the Honorary Minister. If his peculiar grin could be photographed into Hansard those who read the record of the debate If the would see the point of the remarks I have made within the last few minutes. The Government, we are told in the speech of the Prime Minister, propose to restore to invalids the opportunity of voting by post. I do not think there is an honourable member who does not desire that the fullest opportunity should be given to every person to record a vote. There is a difference of opinion as to how can be most satisfactorily accomplished. There are some persons, I venture to say, a who do not want to vote. Why should a man on his death-bed, for instance, be worried by an electoral agent asking him how he is going to record his vote? Why should a man who is within five minutes - of Eternitv be worried as to how he is going to record his vote, or propped up to sign his name to a paper to be sent to the Returning Officer? I have known - cases where the invalids have died before the postal vote could be sent back, and therefore could not use them. Will any one tell me that in a case of that kind there is a very great desire on the part of an invalid to have the right to vote? Surely not.",62
529,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,That apply to all .,63
530,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"It does not apply to all, bu t it does apply to some. There are some invalids who, we can all agree, do not reouire the right to vote. There are some persons of course, who are porarily incapacitated. stance, a person who has a broken leg, although possessing the mental capacity to take part in the politics of the I agree if it is possible to give an opportunit y of voting to that person, without greater opportunity for corruption, ought to be given, but we all know what has occurred. Is it possible to so surround the postal vote with safeguards as to prevent corruption ?",63
531,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"We can have fair try . Mr j . H . CATTS - Does the honorthan able member want a system of postal voting surrounded with safeguards that will prevent such corruption as took place, or does he want the old kind of postal vote ?",63
532,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"So far as Tasmania is concerned, I do not think there any corruption.",63
533,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Unde r the vious law, a man was entitled to a postal vote if he declared that he had reason believe that in three weeks he would indisposed. H a d I made such a declarabooths, tion, who could prove that I had not that belief in my mind ? It would have been taken. impossible to prove that. former system tens of thousands of postal votes were cast which were never consystem templated by the law. I have known of cases. I know that if I had been wealthy man, and had divided my elecplace. torate into districts and put clerks in charge with instructions under the postal voting provisions I could have got 10,000 postal votes.",63
534,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,If you started out for corrupt purposes you could do that under any Act .,63
535,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"No . Tell me how the present system is open to corruption in the same way as is the postal voting system. A man with sufficient wealth to be able to introduce a thorough system of organization would have no trouble, if he desired to do so, in obtaining 10,000 postal votes in any electorate in Australia under the previously-existing postal voting system. In the little does not metropolitan electorate of Kooyong, in the State of Victoria, more postal votes were cast at the elections of 1910 than were recorded for the whole of the State of New South Wales. In that electorate there was a tram running practically from the end of every street to a polling tembooth, yet that is what took place. Take, for in ",63
536,Mr TUDOR,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Te n times as many postal votes were recorded as were cast in my country. electorate across the river.,63
537,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Quite so.,63
538,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The r e are a lot of it cripples down there.,63
539,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The honourable member says that there are a lot of "" crook ones "" down there. As the seat is a Liberal one, I leave the honourable a member to speak for it , since he knows more about the Liberal side of politics I do. It must be patent to the honourable member that all those who voted by post on that occasion did not do so bond fide according to the law. But how are we to police such a law ? In respect of the 2,000 or 3,000 electors who voted by post, an inspector would be rewas quired to make an investigation. We should need to have some machine to enable us to put their consciences under a premicroscope, to find out what they thought. No doubt they all "" thought "" to two or three weeks before polling day that be they would be unable to go to the polling but probably 2,500 out of 2,600 found on polling day that they were misHow could we prove, however, Under the that they d id not act bond fide? This shows that we must either eliminate the altogether, or surround it with such safeguards as will prevent a repetia tion of the corruption that has taken",63
540,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I think the honourable member voted for the voting-by-post provision of the Act .,63
541,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I do not remember. I may have been prepared to give it at r i a l. Personally, the matter does not concern me very much. If the Government re-introduced the postal voting system it could not be operated in my electorate without my knowledge, and if I found that tactics were being adopted that left me no alternative but to adopt the same tactics, I should probably resort to them, and I am sure that I could get as many postal votes as could any one whom the Liberal party saw fit to put up against me. I have no complaint to make so far as I am personally concerned against postal voting. In every case I have always had a majority of the postal and absent votes recorded in my electorate. The number of postal votes, however, was comparatively small - a couple of hundred for myself and something less for my opponent.",64
542,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,There much wrong there.,64
543,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"No . But in the case of the Ballarat electorate a reputed millionaire stood in the Liberal interest, and put in what he described as up-todate business organization. If he so desired it would be absolutely impossible for a Labour man to win that seat whilst the postal voting system was in vogue. I do not suggest that he would operate the system; I merely say that he could take advantage of it if he chose to do so.",64
544,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,This is putting a poor estimate on the electors.,64
545,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"My estimate is not of the electors, but of the capitalists who take part in the elections. AB ill having been passed providing for the imposition of a land tax, which takes a million and a half a year out of the pockets of the great landed proprietors, and adds it to the revenues of the Commonwealth, what more natural than that those great landed proprietors should say, "" Would it not be better for us to put half a million of money into the next Federal elections, secure the return of our own nominees, and obtain the repeal of this legislation. Why should we not transfer the burden of government from our shoulders to the shoulders of the toiling masses?"" From the point of veiw of their personal interest, it would be better for them to spend half a million in that way, and so obtain the repeal of the legislation to which they objected. And so with the Sugar Refining Company. When they found that they were not to be allowed to exploit the community as they were doing, it would be a very good investment for them to contribute £50,000 to defeat certain candidates in order that they might work their own sweet will upon the community. It is quite apparent that it is not possible so to restrict and l i m it postal voting as to provide for the purity of our elections. A f t e r all, how many people are affected by it ? Surely, if these great risks are to be undertaken there must be some adequate number of persons involved. Under every law some one suffers. No doubt every piece of legislation imposing taxation inflicts some hardship upon individuals, but we cannot frame our legislation on the basis of saving these units out of some hundreds of thousands of people. We have so to frame our was not legislation as to safeguard the interests of the great majority. We have no information before us as to how many people have been disfranchised because of the amendment of the postal-voting provisions made by the last Parliament. We certainly eliminated postal voting, but we introduced absent voting provisions of the most favourable kind.",64
546,Mr MCGRATH,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,W h i c h the Prime M in ister said were as good as the postal voting system.,64
547,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I am reminded that the Prime Minister said, when the Bill was before the last Parliament, that the absent voting system was as good as the postal voting system.",64
548,Mr JOSEPH COOE,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I do not thin k I said so.,64
549,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"When a statement made by the honourable member is challenged, he finds some way of wriggling out of it . We shall have to turn up the Hansard report and quote it for his benefit. Mr W . H . IHVINE - Why does not the honourable member turn it up before he makes these statements ?",64
550,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,It has been looked up.,64
551,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The statement is in Hansard. It was an interjection.,64
552,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I am glad that the honourable mtember admits having made it . Will the Attorney-General accept the admission made by his own Prime Minister. One would think that the Prime Minister was not competent to take care of himself without the honourable gentleman's assistance. The absent voting provisions alford an opportunity for everybody away on holiday or business to record tlieir votes at any polling booth. A great mauy of the people affected are, no doubt, on sick beds, and in pain, and do not wisli to be bothered by electiou agents; and I am sure that the number of votes at stake in a bond fide way would not justify us in letting loose, or, ns I was going to say, opening the flood gates to the corruption that has taken place in the past, and, no doubt, would recur in the future. The Government have no mandate to interfere with the vital ciples of the existing Act without inquiry; and, further, we are told by the Prime Miuister that he proposes to seek a double dissolution. debate on the amendment to the Addressin-Reply, the Attorney-General stated that the Government proposed to in troduce certain measures when the political situation would permit, thus admitting that some questions could not be dealt with now with any hope of carrying them. Then the Prime Minister, in the Sydney daily press of Monday week, stated that the Government are simply taking steps to bring about a double dissolution at the earliest possible time. Apparently the introduction of Bills is only for the purpose of finding an opportunity for that double dissolution; and, with that idea in his mind, the honourable gentleman proposes an alteration of the electoral law. Dnder such circumstances the Government are not justified in interfering with the Electoral Act, except on points regarding which there would be practical unanimity in the House. Certainly the Government are not justified in introducing partisan clauses in the Bill which would give rise to the most violent party feeling, and afford some particular advantage to the Government in the foreshadowed election.",64
553,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Will the honourable member tell us what he would like us to do ? L et us see whether we can make an arrangement.,65
554,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"If the honourable member will grant me leave to continue my speech tomorrow, we shall be able to retire to rest at a reasonable time. [40]",65
555,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The Opposition Whi p said the debate would be finished at 11 o'clock to-night.,65
556,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"We have been refused information which the House has a riglit to expect, and, as a result, this debate has extended over a whole sitting.",65
557,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,We are ready to give you the information.,65
558,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"But it would be given in a speech which would close the debate. If the Prime Minister himself will give us the information, I shall resume my seat.",65
559,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"The speech of the Honorary Minster will not close the debate on the Bill . prin- Mr JH CATTS - But it will close the debate on this motion. We ought to know what the Bill is to contain before we give leave for its introduction. The During the Age, in a special article, shows that the present Government secured at the recent elections a minority of votes to the number of 8,000 or 9,000.",65
560,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The honourable member knows that that is incorrect.,65
561,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I am sure that the honourable gentleman will not charge the Age with any desire to help the Labour party at the expense of the Liberal party, because its arguments are all devoted to helping our friends opposite, to our disadvantage. If the Government had como to this House with a clearly defined policy, endorsed by a clear majority of the people, they would have the right to introduce a Bill as outlined in the policy speech, but under existing circumstances I submit that they have uo such right. I am entitle-I to continue my remarks for a considerable time, but to show that I have no desire to obstruct busiuess, I shall make way for some words of a very pertinent character by the honourable member for Gwydir.",65
562,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Gwydir) [11.3] - I have regarded the honourable member for Wentworth with a great amount of sympathy for a great many hours, while he has been regretting that lamentable error he committed earlier in the sitting, when he refused or neglected to inform honourable members what is contained within the pages of the proposed amending electoral law. It seems an awful oversight on the part of the Honorary Miuister, at the in ception of his official responsibility, when he is trusted with the introduction of a measure of bhis character, that he should not have asked some of the senior members of his party as to how he had better proceed, with a view to the harmony of this Chamber. The Honorary Minister, however, will probably learn something from what he has heard to-night. The debate, I take it , has shown an honourable intention on the part of honourable members on this side bo indicabe bo the Government what kind of an electoral law is most suitable to the people of this country. Seeing that party represents more than half of the electors of the country, surely the Prime Minister- I am not going to speak of his assistanb-mus b recognise that we have a right to suggest the character of the legislation the larger proportion of the people of the Commonwealth require. I am satisfied that the reason why the Minister did not do what it was his duty to do when he rose to move this motion, was because he wished to withhold from the public as long as possible the unpalatable character of the measure of which he is in charge. I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he will consent to an adjournment now? Caucus meeting in the morning, and I should like this subject to be threshed out there as well as here.",65
563,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,That settles it !,66
564,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Do I understand that the Prime Minister agrees to an adjournment ?,66

578,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"Where is the hurry ? If the Prime Minister wishes to make a statement, I will sit down.",66
579,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I will not so far humiliate myself as to make a statement now.,66
580,Mr WEBSTER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I wish to say, in conclusion, that I am very sorry that the Attorney-General has caused this trouble today. It . has largely arisen out of his action on this measure. He tells the We have a House that he is going to give power to certain political organizations whereby they will be able to cull the names of respectable citizens from the rolls of the Commonwealth, and object to them. Persons are to do that in their capacity as organizers. Like the policeman who gets a reward according to the cases that he deals with, those organizers who get like to the most names struck off will get the highest salary. The Attorney-General has thrown down the gage to those who are know what Liberal organizers can do. I have in my possession a list from the Dubbo subdivision, showing that the Liberal organizers at the last election had a challenge list printed in roll form, on which there were 551 names for the I make a scrutineers to object to when the persons came to vote. Not one reason is set out on the list as to why the persons leave of the should be objected to. That is typical of the sysbem which the Abborney-General you desires bo introduce inbo the electoral sysbem of bhis counbry. His acbions, like the brail of the serpent, can be traced in I will nob everything he does in regard to politics. We have to wabch him whenever a proposal is made bo amend democrabic legisask you lation. He is always aiming ab sbrangling Democracy in the interests of the Plutocracy that he serves. It is not necessary to say any more now, because we can say what we wish later on. I will allow the Honorary Minister to open his mysterious packet, and, when he has done so we shall be able to analyze, to dissect, and, I hope, to annihilate what he proposes.",66

583,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,I cannot recall an instance of the forms of the House being strained in the way they have been strained today. Honourable members opposite have been delaying business and the public funds have been suffering all the time.,67
584,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Is this the information that the Minister desired to give?,67
585,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,It has become abundantly clear that honourable members opposite do not desire any information on this question. The Standing Orders wil l not permit me to express myself frankly in regard to their conduct today. they have indulged in this farce,67

595,Mr SPEAKER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I wish to point out once more that when the Speaker has called for order, and especially when he has done so several times, it is grossly disorderly for an honourable member to interject.

596,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"I think that the extraordinary questionings of honourable members opposite-the extraordinary straining of their imaginations as to what may possibly be in this Bill make it abundantly clear that no answer the from me is necessary at this stage.

I refer to Lithgow, in New South Wales, where he spoke on the 10th June, in the Oddfellows H all . On that occasion, he said, as reported in the Lithgow Mercury of 12th June, 1912He believed in having his own opinion, and would not allow any caucus to think for him, or to come between him and his constituents. He had not altered his position; the others had done the jumping round, and now imagined he had. I wish to place that statement upon record. The Prime Minister was speaking in the district which first returned him to Parliament as a Labour representative, and he was there explaining that he had not altered his democratic opinions. It is a matter of some importance, particularly at this juncture.",68

I wish to point out that if the Prime M in isber had adopted my suggestion to secure that leave, there would have been no objection by honourable members upon this side to his making a statement.",68
602,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,Leave House for what?,68
603,Mr FRAZER,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,"To make a statement when the Prime Minister was out of order. I repeat that no objection would have been offered by honourable members on this side of the Chamber if he had first sought to obtain the leave of the House. But, instead, he sat down in a dramatic fashion and endeavoured to make it appear to the press and people of this country that we did not desire him to speak at all. That was not the case. We merely desired to have the Standing Orders strictly obeyed. The Prime M in ister's understudy has now obtained leave to introduce an amending Electoral Bill . He has stated that he is bursting with a desire to give information in respect to that Bill . There is nobody in this House who is better acquainted with the Standing Orders than he is, and he knows that under those Orders the motion for the first reading of that measure must be taken without debate. He has not given honourable members an opportunity of seeing the Bill to-night; and, consequently, they will not be able to discuss it until it has reached its second-reading Btage. I feel that he has treabed the House with scant courtesy in this matter. We are all greatly interested in electoral matters.",68
604,Mr KELLY,NUMBE R OF OFFICERS,The honourable member knows that the discussion has not been serious.,68
