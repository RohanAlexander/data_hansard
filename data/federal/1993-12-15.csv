2,Dr KEMP,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill contains a series of amendments which are designed to introduce more stringent accountability requirements for the commercial activities of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. For example, the corporation will be required under the bill to forecast anticipated expenditure and revenue from its commercial activities, as well as measuring such activities against commercial criteria. Nevertheless, a significant issue arises in relation to the Broadcasting Corporation's commercial operations. At present, the ABC, as we know, is primarily funded by the Commonwealth, but it is also involved in commercial activities. The arrangements under which the ABC operates give it a clear commercial advantage over private businesses arising from, as the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) pointed out in his second reading speech: . , . exemptions from state and Commonwealth taxes, except sales tax and customs duty on goods for resale; exemptions from many corporate regulatory requirements; access to publicly funded infrastructure; and free radio and television tions. . These are some advantages. As a result, there is a potential problem with ABC involvement in competitive business activities in that under the protection of public ownership and very substantial subsidy the ABC may deter private businesses from entering a particular market or may unfairly disadvantage any business which is already operating in that market. The minister has indicated that the government is going to monitor the effect of these amendments which are designed to resolve the problem of unfair competition. If the government considers that they do not do so or that commercial activities are imposing undue risk to taxpayers' funds appropriated to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for charter 1993 purposes, the gqvemment will consider the need for further legislation. This monitoring is important. If the problems are identified, it is important that they be expeditiously addressed. It is anticipated that the bill will apply more rigorous financial accountability requirements, including new corporate planning and annual reporting requirements. The coalition welcomes these changes on the assumption that they will indeed improve the accountability of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It must be said that accountability does remain, for the coalition, a continuing issue of some importance in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The issue of accountability, indeed, starts at the very top, with the managing director, Mr David Hill, who has been much in the news of late. Since his appointment Mr Hill has not shied away from controversy. Most recently, Mr Hill hit the headlines with his comments on the government's proposals for a republiccomments which, I have to say, were most inappropriate for him to make while he is the managing director of our national broadcaster. His statement compromised, in our view, the integrity of the ABC as a non-partisan organisation which should be dedicated to pursuing Australia's national interest, to be seen to be doing so by the general public and not to be pursuing political 'agendas. After calls from the opposition for him to be dispromomissed, Mr Hill issued a statement which assured the public that he would think before he made such public statements in the future. Mr Hill is welcome to his opinions, but he cannot, and should not, state them as he did. It is singularly inappropriate for the head of a government authority to reflect in the way in which Mr Hill did upon the Governor General. In addition, he is in charge of an organisation, the charter of which requires its staff to be accurate, impartial and fair. The coalition believes that Mr Hill seriously undermined public confidence in the ability of the ABC to report fairly the republican debate. I draw the House's attention to the fact that, when Mr Hill appeared before a Senate estimates committee hearing to be questioned by opposition senators about the state of affairs of the ABC's administration and about his comments on the republican issue, he seemed to contradict the minister's assurances that the chairman of the ABC board 'would speak to Mr Hill' and that ' Mr Hill has issued what amounts to a public apology' in relation to his comments on the republic. When Mr Hill was asked by the shadow minister for communications whether he accepted that it was inappropriate for him to have made his comments given his position, his reply was: ... youthat was a reference to Senator Alstonmade two inaccurate statements here in Senate estimates about my views on the republic on 4 November-the first one, that Mark Armstrongthe chairman of the ABC boardhad in some way coerced me or forced me to issue this statement, and the second one, in saying that I accepted it was inappropriate for me to make those statements. Neither of those is correct. This, I have to say, is despite his press release which stated: As Managing Director of the ABC, I accept it is inappropriate for me to make public statements on contentious, partisan or party political issues. I accept, as does Mr Hill, that the future constitutional structure of Australia is an important issue. It is also a very contentious issue and, by Mr Hill's own admission, a partisan issue. Again, I quote Mr Hill: I did make the point in my speech-and I took a sample from both sides of federal politics-that I thought that it was a shame that this constitutional debate was becoming partisan. So Mr Hill acknowledged that it was a partisan issue. When questioned further about his statements by Senator Kemp, particularly in relation to the nature of the republican debate and the naivety of believing that such an issue would not become political and, indeed, would not uItirpately become party political, Mr Hill's response was: ... you are quite right that I should be careful. That is really what this statement was saying. It was really an assurance that, when exercising my right as a citizen, I should have some regard for the sensitivities and my responsibilities as Managing Director of the ABC. By his own admission again, Mr Hill should not have made the comments that he made. Anything Mr Hill does or says redounds to the credit or discredit of the ABC as our national broadcaster. It is in the public interest for a man in Mr Hill's position not to make any statements on an issue which is clearly a partisan or party political issue. It is the duty of the ABC to be fair· and impartial. Mr Hill may not have intended that his statements be construed as ABC policy, nor that they renect upon the ability of the ABC to carry out its functions .under its charter, but that is a consequence of his actions. The ABC and he himself were compromised. Given his previous statements and the responsibilities of his position, Mr Hill should not have made the comments he made. He should have acknowledged his error and resigned. He has not done so. The minister responsible did not request that he do so; far from it-the minister tried to excuse his conduct. At the Senate estimates hearing he gave a quite different version of the conduct and intentions of Mr Hill from the version Mr Hill gave to the committee. Mr Hill brought the integrity of the ABC into question. The minister tried to excuse him. This is the standard of accountability we see demanded of the head of our national broadcaster. The role of the board and its strength in dealing with its managing director is called into question. We have seen the standard of accountability required of government ministers in this place, and this House is entitled to ask what standard of accountability will be required of the ABC in relation to other matters, particularly the matters raised by this legislation-the impact of the commercial operations of the ABC on competition. As I stated at the commencement of my remarks, the government must closely monitor the competitive impact of these operations and not delay if action is required to ensure a fair trading environment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",11
3,Mr BEDDALL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Rankin-Minister for Communications) (10.11 a.m.}-by leave-I move: Pages 1 and 2, clause 3, omit the clause, substitute the following clause: Interpretation ""3. Section 3 of the Principal Act is amended: (a) by omitting from subsection (I) the definitions of 'broadcast casting program', 'broadcasting station', 'broadcasting translator station', 'national broadcasting station', 'national television station', 'telegraph line', 'television program', 'television receiver', 'television repeater station', 'television station' and 'television translator station'; (b) by inserting in subsection (1) the following definitions: '''broadcasting service"" means a service that delivers programs to persons having equipment appropriate for receiving that service, whether the delivery uses the radiofrequency spectrum, cable, optical fibre, satellite or any other means or a combination of those means, but does not include: (a) a service (including a teletext service) that provides no more than data or no more than text (with or without associated still images); or (b) a service that makes programs available on demand on a point-to-point basis, including a dial-up (c) a service, or a class of service, determined by the Minister under paragraph (c) of the definition of casting service"" in subsection the Broadcasting Services Act 1992; ""program"" means a radio program or a television program;'."". Page 9, Schedule I, after the amendment of subsection 70(2) inse.rt the following amendments: ""Se.ction 73: Omit the definition of 'transmitting station', Subsection 74(4): Omit 'broadcasting or television',"", Page 9, Schedule I, omit the amendments of paragraph 82(1)(a), paragraph 82(1)(b) and subsection 82(5). The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) made some points in relation to financial accountability and the need to make change if change is required. He has my a-surance that that will happen as quickly as is required. The proposed amendments are technical amendments consequential to changes to the ABC bill made in the Senate. The ABC bill, which was originally introduced in the Senate, contained amendments to simplify and update the technical services provisions of the ABC Act. Those amendments were omitted by the receiver', 'broad- Senate. A close examination of the technical services provisions following the making of these amendments has made it clear that many of the archaic definitions in the act can be removed without affecting the operation of the technical services provisions. The proposed amendments therefore remove the unnecessary definitions. The bill passed by the Senate modernises the terminology in the ABC Act by removing an outdated distinction between broadcasting, meaning broadcasting by radio, and television. The proposed amendments insert a new definition of program to support the modernisation of terminology. They also update the terminology in the technical services provisions which are retained as a result of the Senate amendments. The amendments will not affect Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I commend the amendments to the House and service; or present the explanatory memorandum,",13
4,Dr KEMP,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Goldstein) (10.12 a.m.}-First of all, I thank the Minister for Communica""broadtions (Mr Beddall) for his assurances on the 6(1) of operation of the amendments to the main legislation that we discussed in the debate on the second reading, and the opposition will certainly be closely watching that situation. The opposition has no objection to the additional amendments which have now been brought forward by the minister. It is interesting that at this stage of the parliamentary year the government is still introducing legislation with additional amendments. Earlier in this budget session, it complained vigorously about the concerns expressed by the Senate that the government had a tendency to leave its legislation until the last moments of the parliamentary sitting before Christmas, so that the parliament was inevitably subjected to a rush of amendments and legislation was forced through the parliament under guillotine. Despite the very vigorous efforts of the opposition in the Senate, and despite the disruption to business in this House as a result of the government's actions which deprived the opposition of its traditional rights to move censure motions, suspend standing orders and debate MPls in this House-despite all of these actions of the Senate, which have derogated from the functions of the government and which have derogated from the functions of this chamber-at the very last moment we still have legislation and amendments being brought forward by the government into the parliament. This reflects poorly on the capacity of the government to order the legislative timetable. We have been told that the parliament will have to sit on Friday of this week, and there have even been rumours that it may be sitting in the early hours of Saturday morning-and I see that the minister is deeply concerned at this prospect and may have to change his arrangements. That is typical of what w- have come to expect. Anything is possible, the w-y the legislative business of this chamber is handled. We are all prepared for that, but the Australian people must be desperately concerned at the way in which the legislative program is handled. Once again I want to' express the great disgust of the opposition at the last minute stampede of legislation through this chamber and at the introduction of continuing amendments right up to the final bell. It is clear the government has not got its house in order. It seems to. be unable to order this program properly, and of course the proper consideration of legislation suffers. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr BeddalJ) read a third time. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Cognate bill: NA NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 September, on motion by Mr O'Keefe: That the bill be now read a second time.",13
5,Dr KEMP,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"This first bill, the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill, amends four pieces of legislation. I shall address those aspects of the bill which arere1evant to the communications portfolio. Firstly, I make some comment on the Australian Postal Corporation Act amendments which are proposed in the bill. These amendments will allow Australia Post to operate a national change of address scheme. They amend section 92 of the act so that a customer's name and address can be disclosed where customers consent in writing to the disclosure of their new addresses to persons, organisations and classes of organisations on a form obtained from Australia Post. Section 92 imposes a duty on Australia Post employees and persons performing services for Australia Post not to disclose, among other things, personal affairs or particulars, including the address of a' person. All disclosures will therefore be recorded by Australia that Post, and any information obtained through the scheme will be handled in accordance with the information privacy principles as set out in the Privacy Act 1988. The scheme was devised in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. The scheme will mean that when a customer changes address Australia Post will, when it is authorised to do so, advise mailers who subscribe to the scheme. This scheme appears to have some benefits, particularly for businesses and other users of Australia Post with large numbers of correspondents. So far as the coalition can see, the safeguards on privacy appear to be adequate, and therefore we have no objection to it. Secondly, I comment on the Radiocommunications Act 1992. These provisions are no more than minor typographical and technical corrections to the act. They are an indication that originally in the act there was sloppy drafting and sloppy proofreading. I am afraid that this seems to be the rule rather than the exception in this department. The Radiocommunications Act 1992 came into effect on 1 July 1993. To have to make amendments in September 1993, which is when this bill was introduced into the Senate, in order to correct minor errors of typography and incorrect references, together with what the second reading speech referred to as minor inconsistencies in the act, is nothing short of lous. Indeed, it should not occur. If the Minister .for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) were on top of his portfolio, it would not occur. Thirdly, I make comment on the Telecommunications Act 1991 amendments which are embodied in this bill. The amendments to this legislation will require suppliers of telecommunications services to consult with law enforcement agencies about new technologies they are intending to introduce and to assist agencies in carrying out their law enforcement responsibilities. These provisions, again, are not opposed by the coalition. Similar conditions are imposed on the licences of the three telecommunications carriers, Optus, Telecom and Vodaphone. The .government has also promised $25 million over the next two years to re-encode and re-encrypt the A5 algorithm which enables authorised law enforcement agencies to intercept signals. The security provides to users in terms of unauthorised interception is good, while not hampering the authorised interception of signals by law enforcement agencies. However, this demonstrates, in our view, the government's uncoordinated and haphazard approach in the area of telecommunications infrastructure reform, because the twoyear gap between the introduction of digital GSM technology and the introduction of interception capacity by law enforcement agencies means that the system will operate during this time apparently as a totally secure information exchange network, which may entail some risks. Despite the government's lack of foresight, the general public should not be denied access to this new technology. The new technology is also limited in its range in Australia. Consumers based in Perth, Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne, the Mornington Peninsula, Geelong, Newcastle, Canberra, Brisbane and the Gold Coast will have access to the new digital network. The whole of the Northern Territory, including Darwin, and the rest of rural, regional and remote Australia will be excluded. This is in contrast to the current network which covers some 84 per cent of Australian consumers. It is to be hoped that the digital GSM network will be ridicu- expanded to at least this capacity. It has been the government's unwillingness throughout the whole development of policy in this area to commit itself to a clearly competitive structure for telecommunications in Australia. The government has been through a series of the most extraordinary Uturns in enunciating policy in this area, its handling of pay TV being the most outstanding example of mismanagement. I think every member in this House, and probably a very large proportion of the public, will remember the pay TV debacle-that sorry saga which is still unfolding as we speak. Honourable' members will remember the tendering process which defied all the rules of normal tendering practice and which has resulted in unnecessary delays in the introduction of pay TV in Australia. We have, therefore, these inconsistent policies which have pervaded this area. The government claimed that it did not this favour one form of pay TV delivery over another, but it has approved the tendering for satellite pay TV while pulling the plug on MDS delivery the day before tenders were to be lodged. The introduction of pay TV services using MDS technology has been postponed until the satellite services to be provided under one of the three satellite pay TV licences have commenced, or until 31 December 1994, whichever is the earlier. In a further twist, the regulation imposed on cable TV is quite different. Thirty-six licences have been issued to date. This decision clearly has some inequities by implication. In North Queensland, MDS licence holder, Mr David Butler, cannot commence broadcasting through this technology apparently until 1995, yet the Canadian company Paynet Telecommunications Pty Ltd can commence delivery of programs via cable immediately in the same area. Added to this is the fact that a current MDS licence holder not only has to buy the licence but must then pay an annual fee of $23,000 for the one defined area. But the cable licence holder has to pay only a one-off $785 for a. cable service licence which operates nationally. This disjointed and incoherent approach to the introduction of pay television inspires little confidence from potential operators in the government's ability to provide and maintain a stable investment climate for pay TV in Australia. Tom Burton in the Australian Financial Review has summed up the government's position in relation to pay television. He said the government is: . .. trying to control technologies rather than services. The same old thinking has polluted the Government's Pay TV regime, with Canberra again trying to regulate technologies, restricting use of work. satellite and microwave, but leaving cable unfettered. The government, one has to say, has shown its inability to develop coherent and rational policy in communications. We have a minister who commenced this parliament by presiding over this sorry saga of pay television. When established, subscription television may well be very popular in Australia. Australians have shown again and again that they have appreciated and enjoyed the technical advances in television from its initial introduction to the establishment of video technology. Subscription television holds out the prospect that, well managed and within an appropriate framework, it will provide Australians with increased choice and control over television services. The tendering process has now been completed-a process that saw the minister in the other place abandon his junior minister, and a series of backflips performed in a manner worthy of an Olympic athlete performed by not only the two ministers but also the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993, like the previous one, makes amendments to existing legislation. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe) noted in his second reading speech: The amendments do not introduce substantial new policy schemes, although a number of the amendments do introduce some new policy arrangements and initiatives. The main purpose of this bill is to: ... correct technical drafting defects and typographical errors which have been discovered since the original passage of the relevant bills. What an old story this is. It is ludicrous in this day and age for the parliament to be filled with bills of this nature. Were the changes substantive legislative ones, such a bill would warrant the scrutiny of the parliament. But what deserves scrutiny in this instance is not so much the legislation but those who have initiated it. The function of this place is to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Australia. Here we are correcting sloppy· and unprofessional Honourable members opposite control the timetable for the introduction of legislation in this place, yet it would seem that they have once again lost control of the legislative program. Legislation is drafted in a great hurry, not checked for simple spelling errors or typographical errors and then rammed through this House with limited debate. I ask the minister and his department, through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns), who is at the table, how he can run a communications portfolio when he cannot even introduce legislation which is free of errors. I fear that we are seeing some of the evidence of the decline in literacy standards which have taken place over the last decade in this country under the education policies of this government. The parliament is now suffering the consequences of this failure. The amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 deal with the numbering and protection of the content of communications. The coalition does not object to these changes. The numbering plan introduced by Austel which provides a framework for the allocation and administration of numbers will enable greater choice and flexibility for the consumers of telecommunications services. The protection of communications carried by telecommunications carriers brings the act into line with the Privacy Act 1988 which places limits on the disclosure and use of personal information. I would like the House to note that the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, to which I have just spoken, which is being debated cognately with this bill, also makes amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991. I ask the minister whether his department is unable to deal with more than one concept at a time. The provisions in the previous bill relate to interception of digital mobile telephone communications by Australia's security services, an area which surely should have alerted the drafters to the changes to the act predicated on privacy concerns. The coalition does not object to these bills.  a.m.)-We have just listened to the hypocrisy coming from the other side about rushing the drafting of legislation. The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who has just resumed his seat, is a party to the decisions by his colleagues in which the Senate sets deadlines for legislation to be introduced this place. The physical effect of that is to rush and to place pressure upon parliamentary counsel, upon all avenues of government, to try to get legislation into the House. More appropriate circumstances would enable this chamber, the chamber in which the government resides, to have more time and preparation to deal with legislation. The parliamentary counsel would work more reasonable hours. Sometimes I marvel at the ability of counsel, given the very tight time frames, to even get the legislation into the appropriate form to come into the House. Those honourable members on the other side who clamour about minor errors in drafting and in bills should have a very good look in the mirror. They are the instigators of the actions that lead to those kinds of errors happening. They are not errors of great substance; they are errors that are very understandable, given the time frame in which the officers drafting the legislation and the responsible officers in departments have to work. The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill and the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) cover a range of amendments to a range of acts. In the time available to me this morning, I want to touch upon some of them. I want to start with the amendments to the Motor Vehicles Standards Act. The Motor Vehicles Standards Act is a very important piece of legislation for the Australian motor vehicle industry. The object of the act is set out in seCtion 3, which states: The object of this Act is to achieve unifonn vehicle standards to apply to road vehicles when they begin to be used in transport in Australia. That is an extremely important issue and one that I will come to in a few minutes. I will repeat that. It states: The object of this Act is to achieve unifonn vehicle standards to apply to road vehicles when they begin to be used in transport in Australia. Section 7 of the act empowers the minister to determine vehicle standards for road vehicles or vehicle components and provides the determination relating to disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the into Acts Interpretation Act. The problems that arise with this is that all components of motor vehicles being assembled to be used for transport for the first time in Australia are covered by the act. What is not covered by the act are those automotive components that are sold subsequently. There is a great problem in that the components that are made for installation as initial equipment are completely controlled for safety standards in accordance with the Australian motor vehicle certification rules. The after market or the replacement parts are not covered at all. There is a continuing debate about the cost of motor vehicle spare parts and the safety standards of parts being fitted to vehicles in repair. The parties in this debate are the vehicle manufacturers themselves, the motorist organisations, the importers and marketers of some of those parts and, in some cases, the manufacturers of those parts. The argument is that the price of motor vehicle spare parts is excessively high in some cases. The price of motor vehicle spare parts has been the subject of an inquiry and a report by the Prices Surveillance Authority. It came to the conclusion that longer stock holding periods, lower turnover, uniqueness of the parts and the standard to which those parts are manufactured all contribute to a higher cost and to a higher price of those parts. The problem is the power of insurance companies to pressure motor vehicle repairers to use spare parts that are not to the same standard as initial equipment. As I said earlier, those spare parts are not subject to this act-they are not subject to any safety standards at all. The question arises: should there be a set of standards? I believe very strongly that there should be. I believe that this act ought to be extended to include cover for motor vehicle spare parts being fitted to motor vehicles. I want to give an example of what is happening. If I buy a new vehicle-under this act that vehicle meets national safety standardsand the vehicle is damaged in a crash within a year or two years, all of the components of that vehicle are covered by the act. The vehicle is then taken to a vehicle repairer for toration. The insurance company covering that vehicle then applies pressure on the vehicle repairer to use the parts that it specifies. pressure is designed to minimise the cost of repair and the burden being incurred by the insurance company. If my vehicle is fitted with initial equipment under the act, it has protection in the doors against side intrusion in the event of a crash. But the replacement parts-the doors can be replaced or bought overseas-do not have to meet those standards. So the vehicle that has been returned to me after repair has a lesser standard of safety than the vehicle that I submitted for repair. Some of the argument about that is on cost, but there can be no argument about the safety of that vehicle. It is a mockery of road safety motor and vehicle safety standards to allow that process to continue. As a consumer, if I submit my vehicle that has been damaged in a crash for repair, I am entitled to have that vehicle returned to me and restored to the same level of safety standards as it was prior to the crash and its submission to the vehicle repairer. The parties behind this, the motorist organisations and some of the insurance companies, are arguing that, if the same standards that apply to initial equipment were applied to replacement parts, there would be an increase in costs. I believe that that is a cost that has to be borne. If motorists were fully aware of what is going on as a result of this practice, then they would be quite prepared to meet that additional cost, minute though I think it will be, as is reflected in the level of insurance premiums. We hear all sorts of allegations about the practices being pursued by insurance companies from the people in the motor vehicle repair industry. The vehicle belongs to the owner. But when the vehicle is submitted to the motor vehicle repairer, the insurance company exercises its market muscle on those repairers to force them to carry out the bidding of the insurer. The objective is not to maximise or maintain the level of safety of that vehicle for the owner of the vehicle, but rather to minimise the expenditure of the insurance company. My understanding is that the liability for the resrepair of the vehicle rests with the vehicle repairer. So, in law, if something is wrong with the vehicle after repair, it is the responsiThe bility of the vehicle repairer. But the market muscle of the insurance company is applied to pressure the vehicle repairer into using substandard parts or-if I can define substandard in this way-parts used in the repair of that vehicle that do not meet vehicle standards of this nation that are applicable to new equipment, to new vehicles and to initial equipment standards. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe) to take that on board. It could well be something that is the subject of inquiry by the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure that I chair. I am not canvassing or looking for work-we have almost a full book of inquiries to conduct-but it is an issue at national level that ought to be brought out into the open, discussed and recommendations brought back to the parliament. In effect, the practices at the moment make the Motor Vehicles Standards Act, as it extends to vehicles that are damaged, a farce. It is an effective act for initial equipment for new vehicles; it is a farce in relation to vehicles that are subsequently damaged and have to be repaired. I heard the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Goldstein, on the Telecommunications Act. I am pleased that the opposition supports the legislation that is before the House in that respect. Again, I thought the rather crocodile tear type comment by the honourable member that all of this should have been foreseen previously would have been better left unsaid; he should show an appreciation and understanding of the legislation and the kinds of factors that are involved. The amendment to the act makes it quite clear that, in the granting of licences under the Telecommunications Act, the department will be able to ensure that law enforcement agencies are not hindered in their work by the development and introduction of new technology. I tum to that part of the bills before us relating to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The Navigation Act currently empowers the making of regulations to allow the Maritime Safety Authority to issue licences to persons to enable them to act as pilots under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act. That is covered in Marine Orders, part 3. But the regulations flowing from the amendments that are before us today will give AMSA the power to issue licences to coastal pilots in other non-compulsory areas, notably the Torres Strait. It does not mean that the changes embraced in this legislation will make other sections of the coastline or Australian waters compulsory for the carriage of pilots, but it means that we will be able to license pilots to operate in those areas. The amendments will allow the regulations to prescribe other matters associ ed with the way that coastal pilots carry out their work. I think that is desirable and I think it would be welcomed by the industry. The amendments affecting the Civil Aviation Act and the provisions relating to article 83 BIS shows how far behind we really are in making amendments to international conventions and the legal provisions that apply in this country in respect of those international aviation conventions. The process of change is a long and tortuous one .. The amending legislation deals with the problem caused by the fact that when the convention was negotiated in 1944 the parties did not envisage, and the resulting convention did not provide for, aircraft that were operated by an operator belonging to a state other than the state of registry. The movement of aircraft, the growth of the industry and the development of aviation technology have been such that aircraft now operate in one country but are owned and registered in another. We therefore have to make provision in legislation to deal adequately with the safety requirements. This is welcome legislation, but again it highlights the length of time involved in trying to get through these difficult problems and the time that is taken in international negotiations. The extension of the Australian Land Transport Act embraces provisions about which there were some concerns, such as the termination of specific road funding-a decision made at the 1991 Premiers Conference. The concern is already being expressed that, with the untied moneys going to some states, the states are siphoning off some of that money away from roads. It is very clear that this will be a continuing issue. I know it was a decision made at the Premiers Conference and I know that a proposal is coming through. But there is widespread concern around Australia-not the least among state roads and transport ministers-about the impact of that decision. There has been criticism in relation to the auditor's report. The Auditor-General referred to $4.1 million in interest being lost by the Department of Transport and Communications as not being a loss to the taxpayer. It was not a loss to the taxpayer, but it certainly was a atloss to Commonwealth revenue. I think that is the point the Auditor-General is getting at in his comments and in his report to this parliament. That is an area of continuing interest to this place and among those who are associated with roads. Tomorrow, we will be tabling the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure inquiry into the efficiency and performance of road building and road maintenance in this country. What came across very clearly throughout that inquiry was the paucity of information available on how money is spent on road repairs and road construction. One would have thought that, with the massive amounts of expenditure incurred by local governments, state governments and federal governments over decades now, there would be ample information and established systems to enable us to monitor how well that money was being used, to monitor the effectiveness of the various systems of maintenance and classification of maintenance and costings for roads. At public hearings throughout our inquiry we found that that information was not available. The other point I wanted to mention in this debate concerns the establishment of the national transport planning task force. That is a very important initiative by this government. Transport in this country has always been very much a scapegoat for those people who use transport services. It is always that area expenditure that people can point to as being the problem. People point to that expenditure item and say that, if it were not for this or that or if it were less, all of their business activities would be successful. We know that is not the case. That is what we call 'scapegoating' . The problem we have had throughout the transport area, particularly in domestic transport, is that those businesses and users of transport services who could get a better deal do not go to the trouble of seeking that better deal or of organising.their activities to make better use of the transport services that are available. That is not to say that transport services cannot get better, will not get better and must not get better. They will; we must be persistent in that. That is very much the role of the national transport planning task force. I am pleased to say that the task force comprises three gentlemen who have taken on that challenge: Ian Webber, chairman of Mayne Nickless; Lance Hockeridge, the general manager of BHP Transport; and Derek Scrafton, the directorgeneral of transport in South Australia. Those three men bring to the task a wide range of experience, competence and integrity. Their knowledge and experience cover all of the Australian transport system and its services. I hope that when they commence their work there will be a strong response from transport users. I do not mean the usual diatribes and slogans that transport costs ought to be cheaper; but the material things, such as how better use can be made of the transport system and how transport users can better arrange their activities to fit into the transport services that are available. That inquiry, which is to report in mid-1995, will have the very important task of looking at how we link together the differing forms of transport. In that context, I mention that, in my view, there ought to be an industry council-a forum like the Transport Industry Advisory Council, which was terminated because the bureaucracy of that time did not want any other form of advice going to government or ministers. Information is power, and if one is to maintain one's power within the bureauof cracy one needs to be the sole source of advice going to government and ministers. The importance of the Transport Industry Advisory Council was never understood by a number of senior bureaucrats in the transport area. Its vital role-its most important function-was simply to be a forum where people at senior level in the differing areas of transport and people using some of those services could come together and come to understand the role that each played. We could then build bridges of communication and understanding across the different forms of transport and link the whole system together. It would then not remain five disparate forms of transport, but one system where the principals and the decision makers in each of those systems would come together in a non-crisis, noncompetitive situation to build communication and come to understand how they could make the whole transport system of this country work better. ' I hope that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) will take on board the remarks I am making at this time and give serious consideration to the re-establishment of the forum. It does not have to be the Transport Industry Advisory Council, but we need a national forum where all of the principals of the transport services can come together on a regular basis, sponsored by government, get to know the interests of each and get to understand and embrace the national priorities in the provision of these services. They have their own responsibilities in areas of transport-one understands that. But there is a greater responsibility to ensure that this nation has the best arrangement and the best system of overall transport services able to help make this country more competitive in our trading markets.(Ttme expired)",14
6,Mr SHARP,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill and the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). I represent the opposition in terms of its transport responsibilities, and I follow on from the speeches by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) and the  Morris). Transport is a subject of great interest to me and to many other members on this side of the House. It is a subject that concerns us all. It greatly affects the cost of doing business in Australia. Varying estimates are made as to the transport component in our total cost structure. It has been estimated around 17c in every retail dollar is related to transport. The subject under discussion today-for which I have responsibility on the opposition benches, and for which the honourable member for Shortland has a great deal of interest from his side of the fence-is one that is critical to the Australian economy. I might make some passing reference to the opening remarks of the honourable member for Shortland by saying that I, too, join with the honourable member for Goldstein in my comments about the drafting errors that are being corrected in this omnibus bill. This is increasingly becoming the case when we deal with bills from the Department of Transport and Communications in the House. This particular bill changes and amends a number of errors from previous legislation that has passed through here. Whilst the honourable member for Shortland was critical of the opposition, saying that we are hypocritical and that it is all our fault that these mistakes are being made, I would make the point that that is not the case. The government is very keen to take the prizes of government, but it is very slow to pick up the responsibilities of government. their The Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) and the government are responsible for everything that happens at the federal level, and they must be prepared availto take responsibility for these errors. These errors are quite simple. For example, my own staff member, whilst first reading this legislation that arrived in our office a little while ago, immediately detected a drafting error and rang up the minister's office and said, 'On page'- whatever it was-'you will find there is a drafting error in this bill which is partly designed to amend drafting errors in previous bills'. The person at the minister's office said, 'We will have to deal with that the next time we have got a chance to amend some drafting errors'. I reiterate the point that was initially made by the honourable member for Goldstein: it is worth our while to look long and hard at the way in which legislation coming from this depart-ent is drafted, to ensure that it is properly done and that we are that not resubmitting bills for correction-all of which ends up costing us money. I also take up some of the points made by the honourable member for Shortland in his comments to the House a few moments ago. I join with him in expressing concern about the untied nature of the road funding grants that are distributed to state and local governments. The honourable member for Shortland has made the point that it was a decision of the heads of government a little while ago that this should be the case, but anybody who is genuinely interested in and concerned about the state of our roads in Australia today would be concerned about any moneys that are theoretically attributable towards roads not achieved on the Federal Highway. being spent on roads. It is a well-known fact that moneys from the Commonwealth that pass through the states' hands, or indeed go into local government hands, that are not particularly or directadvantageous; ly tied to a particular road project sometimes get redirected to other purposes. I know that in the case of most local government authorities that is not the case. Most local government authorities spend far more on their roads than they ever receive in grants from federal or state governments. But there are some instances where local government is redirecting funds that are attributable towards roads and spending them on other projects. There is no doubt at all that states are siphoning off some of those road funds and putting them to other purposes. I join with the honourable member for Shortland in his concern about that. I also join with him in talking about roads around the country and the need to do things to improve them. I particularly take up the issue of the Federal Highway along Lake George which is in my electorate and is of concern to me and to people in this whole region. Once again, I express-as I have done publicly-my dissatisfaction with the comments of the Minister for Transport and Communications about that. Just recently he was on ABC radio in Canberra on the Matthew Abraham program and he made a promise to construct to four-lane standard-dual carriageway standard-the Lake George section of the Federal Highway. This was welcome news. The minister said that this would be done by the year 2000 in time for the Olympic games in order to provide better access between Canberra and Sydney for the expected rush of tourists and other activities that will be generated as a result of the Olympics. We all praised that decision at the time, but I thought I would take a little bit of insurance and write to the minister and ask him to confirm in writing what he said on the Matthew Abraham program. Unfortunately, in the correspondence that followed, the minister backed away from that commitment and said that he was merely expressing an ideal, a hope, of what could be That is typical of the way in which the Minister for Transport and Communications does his business in this country. He says one thing to one group because he thinks it is politically when the heat is put on him to come up with the goods he backs away. In many ways he is engaging in political trickery. The minister is doing the same thing in the case of a subsidy on the ferry across Bass Strait. I was at the annual conference of the Australian LivestQck Transport Association in Sydney where the minister absolutely rubbished the idea of a subsidy for passengers on that new ferry; yet when that was picked up by those who are championing that cause and they asked him in writing what he was saying, he wrote back and said, 'No, no, no. I am not rubbishing the idea. I still hold great hope for it to come to fruition'. The minister is engaging in double talk and people need to realise that this minister, unlike some of his predecessors, is engaging in activities that are designed to deceive people politically for his own political purposes. I believe it is worth making that point. With the honourable member for,Shortland, I welcome the establishment of the national transport planning task force. I particularly welcome the selection of the members of the task force. Its chairman, Ian Webber, is a person who is extremely well known in transport circles. If my memory serves me correctly, he was responsible for one of the first reports on waterfront reform that were commissioned by this government back in September 1984. That report led to a number of changes on our waterfront. Ian Webber is a person of very high repute. He will do many good things on this ·task force. However, I make the point that I think the guidelines for the establishment of the task force are a little narrow and need to be broadened. I believe that if this task force is given a very broad commission it can achieve tremendous things for the transport industry in Australia. I also back the comments of the honourable member for Shortland in calling for the need to establish some sort of national forum where industry people are given a direct line of communication to the government so that they can present their concerns. The whole purpose of our transport. infrastructure-our waterfronts, our ports, our airports, our road system and so forth-is to service those people who use them. It is the users of our transport system in Australia who really ought to have the greatest voice in advising the government. It is a shame that that has not been the case in the past. The establishment of such a forum would be of great benefit to the transport industry. It would be of great benefit to general users of the road who are not relating their use of the road system or the transport system for a business purpose, but simply a social purpose. A number of things can be done which would be of benefit to our transport system. I join with the honourable member for Shortland in saying that it is absolutely critical we have a competitive transport system in Australia. It is interesting to note that whilst the honourable member for Shortland expresses that concern, the party that is in government-of which he is a member-has been busily engaged in the process of putting up the costs of transport in Australia, making us less competitive. I refer specifically to the outrageous increases in fuel excise of 5c a litre for unleaded fuel and diesel and 7c a litre for leaded fuel, and a 3c a litre increase in the excise on bunker oil which is used for shipping. There is no way in the world that anybody can dress that decision up as being anything other than an increase in the cost of transport, which completely defeats the admirable aims that have been expressed by the previous speaker from the government, the honourable member for Shortland. I think the government needs to recognise that, if it wants to a.chieve the aims established by the industry and which have been reiterated by the honourable member for Shortland, it cannot put up fuel excise, because fuel excise is a direct impost on business which, therefore, makes it less competitive and ultimately ends up costing us jobs. While ever we have a government that treats transport with a cargo cult mentality, treats it as an opportunity to squeeze more tax dollars out of the users of our transport system, Australia's economy will never be as competitive as it ought to be. Our transport users will always feel that they are being cheated at the petrol bowser-and quite justly so. Today 31c a litre of every litre of fuel we buy goes in tax. For super grade leaded petrol, 33c goes in tax. Indeed, I hear so many people say, 'The oil companies are ripping us off'. It is not the oil companies ripping us off any more; it is the government. The federal government is ripping off motorists around Australia. We need to see that for what it is-nothing other than an attempt to grab dollars out of the users of our road system. At the same time, the government is cutting road funding in half, from $1,600 million a year to $800 million a year next year. It is something that I think people very that rightly can condemn this government for. Mr Bruce Scott-Bring back Bob Brown.",21
7,Mr SHARP,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Yes, bring back the honourable member for Charlton and his black spots road funding program. My colleague the honourable member for Maranoa makes a very valid point. He and I were in Tasmania last week, and in our meetings with various officials in that state it was amazing the number of people who said, 'If there is one thing you can do, bring back the black spots program'. Mr Bruce Scott-And Bob Brown.",23
8,Mr SHARP,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"And the initiatives of the honourable member for Charlton. It might be a little late to bring him back but some of his initiatives could be welcomed back onto the scene. We hope to see that in the next budget. There are a number of aspects of this bill which deserve direct reference, particularly the National Rail Corporation components. This is an interesting initiative, something which the opposition has supported from the outset and, indeed, in the days before the government finally made the decision to establish a National Rail Corporation, we have been supportive of the concept. Unfortunately, despite the goal set by the government when it established the National Rail Corporation a couple of years ago, the timetable for its establishment has fallen well and truly behind. We are roughly about a year behind schedule. To highlight that point, we have only to go to the budget papers and look at the 1992-93 allocation of funding for the National Rail Corporation. We will see that the Commonwealth allocated some $370 million to be spent that year on the establishment of the National Rail Corporation and the actual expenditure was only around $226 million in that year. It shows us that the program has fallen well and truly behind. It is of concern to a lot of people who believe in the NRC's establishment that it has fallen behind by as much as it has. It is also disappointing to see that the standard gauge rail program has also fallen behind. It is a very worthwhile goal, but it is about 100 years behind when it should .have been done. The establishment of a standard gauge rail link from Brisbane through Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Kalgoorlie and on to Perth is something this country should have had a long time ago. Unfortunately, it is falling a little behind schedule. To prove that, we have only to look at the government's One Nation statement last year and see that we should have completed this task by about now. Yet it will not be completed until some time in the first half of next year. Part of the reason for those delays has been to do with the unions, who would not agree to the sorts of changes necessary in order to trigger that funding. It highlights the difficulties of dealing with the railway industries when we have a trade union movement that is determined to hang on to the glorious practices of the past and not shape up to the realities and the needs of the future. I think the unions need to bear responsibility for a great deal of these delays. I hope that one day we will have some trade union leaders who are real leaders in their field and who are determined to bring our railway system into the 21st century as quickly as possible and give it a real future. It brings me some concern, some grief, to see the standard of the equipment that is being handed over by the states to the National Rail Corporation. It is quite alarming to see the state of some of the gear that is going over as part of the state's contribution to the National Rail Corporation. A lot of it has not been properly maintained ever since it was realised that this equipment would be handed over. A lot of it is run down. As a result, the National Rail Corporation will be saddled with a lot of out-of-date, poorly maintained equipment, adding to its initial running costs in the first few years. I hope that we recognise that has been the case when we look at the performance of the NRC in the future. There are also some aspects of the legislation relating to Australian National and the Australian National Railways Commission Act; initiatives designed to bring into line safety investigation inquiries and to increase penalties for vandalism and damage and to ensure that those penalties are much greater than they have been in the past. This is a direct result of some vandalism that has been occurring in South Australia on AN's trains. Of course, AN is particularly important in South Australia, and I have been very saddened to see that when the National Rail Corporation was set up AN was not given the responsibility for operating the NRC. I think by doing that it would have given AN a great future. As it is, AN's future is very much in doubt, particularly with the loss of the Pasminco line, which has been a very profitable line enabling AN to cross-subsidise other activities. Because of the loss of that line, less than two years away now, I think AN's future is in doubt. It is for that reason that the coalition has picked up the initiative of having a national interstate rail passenger service which would operate on that new standard gauge line running from Brisbane through to Perth. It would give AN a great future, one which would see those valuable jobs being maintained in South Australia. I know that that is of particular interest to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns), who is sitting opposite me here today, because those jobs are critical to South Australia and, without giving AN a future such as we have been talking of, I think those jobs are in doubt. The legislation before the House also deals with the Navigation Act-training and licensing of pilots in coastal seas and, in particular, the deregulation also of pilotage in coastal seas. All of this I think is a positive step forward. It brings genuine competition into pilotage in our coastal seas. I think there is very substantial evidence now available to uS that proves beyond all doubt that competition in pilotage reduces the cost of pilotage. Pilotage is a huge cost to the shipping industry and anything that can reduce the cost is welcome. Whilst we are all concerned about the standards of safety and the standards of training and licensing of pilots, I think that that is something that AMSA will have to do its utmost to ensure is maintained, because none of us wants to see pilots not being properly licensed or properly trained and, subsequently, putting at risk vessels at sea and the lives of their crews and also putting at risk our environment, which is particularly important to us in places such as the Great Barrier Reef. It is essential for the maintenance of the Great Barrier Reef's future and for our tourism industry that feeds off that. It is absolutely critical that in the process of making these changes AMSA maintain the strongest safety standards for pilot!) and ensure that pilots are as familiar as possible with the passages that they are undertaking their pilotage in. That, coupled with some changes to the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, makes up some important changes to the way in which our transport industry works. I come back to the original comment that I made, and that is that if Australia is to be competitive it has to have an efficknt, safe and viable transport system. That will not be achieved by doing things, such as putting up fuel excise, which go totally counter to the lofty goals of making Australia's transport industries competitive and, through that, creating jobs by expanding our export opportunities. I make that point. The government obviously does not understand it. (TIme expired)",23
9,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, a few weeks ago I had an opportunity to detail in the chamber some of the very significant achievements which Australia had been able to make in the area of land transport reform, road construction and maintenance programs over the whole of the continent during the last five years. They were the years during which I was privileged to occupy the position of minister for land transport with responsibility for those areas. In the last year that I was minister, I detailed what I considered to be the essential elements of the land transport strategy to integrate and coordinate all of the elements of that strategy. I detailed that in a publication which the government then produced called Australia - land transport strategy. The opening paragraph of that document says: OUT National Land Transport Strategy seeks to contain the cost of transport and to increase Australia's economic efficiency and competitiveness. It had been developed in response to calls for Australia to have a more integrated and planned approach to transport, incorporating strategies for various modems. That was the objective that the Hawke government and, more recently, the Keating government had set. As I say, I was privileged to be able to participate in the development of that strategy and the putting into place of those programs which have proved to be so enormously important in Australia. The Industry Commission for example has indicated that reforms in the land transport area are capable of achieving improvements in gross domestic product in excess of $10,000 million. No government worth its salt would turn its back on achievements of that kind, when they are possible, and the Labor government did not. Before I go on to make some references to the National Rail Corporation, or reforms in the rail industry generally, to supplement those remarks which I made a few weeks ago about reforms in road programs and road transport, I would like to mention a matter referred to by previous speakers-the establishment of the national transport planning task force under the leadership of Ian Webber-and to endorse the complimentary· remarks made about him. He was one of the very many people with whom I, as minister, developed a very close personal association and upon whom I could call for advice and wise counsel. Ian Webber, both in the public sector and the private sector, has made an outstanding contribution to the development of transport and transport policy. I am pleased that he has been chosen for that particular role. Those people with whom he will be associated will undoubtedly make a very valuable contribution. I established two organisations-the Australian Road Transport Advisory Council and the Australian Rail Industry Advisory Council-and both were initially under the chairmanship of Ted Butcher, who went on to become the Chairman of the National Rail Corporation. Subsequently, Ron Finemore, from Finemore Transport, became chairman of the road transport advisory group, while Gavin Kenneally, a former South Australian transport minister, became the chairman of the rail industry advisory group. Mr Duncan-Excellent minister.",25
10,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"An outstanding minister, yes, and a good bloke-a wise, sensible fellow. He is another of those people with whom I developed a warm and fruitful association. I want to put on the record my appreciation for people of that kind. There were many of them throughout the country who, in so many different ways and in so many different capacities, were making a substantial contribution and were collectively able to bring about a situation where, over a five-year period, they secured changes considerably in excess of any changes introduced in any comparable five-year period. I also pay tribute to Gough Whitlam. During the 1960s, Gough Whitlam was the Labor Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He later became Leader of the Opposition. Then, in the early 1970s, after a period of 23 years of Labor in opposition, Gough Whitlam became a Labor Prime Minister. He is a man of great vision and he is a great Australian. is a pity that Gough Whitlam's vision for rail transport during the years of his government was not realised. That was not a result of any lack of commitment on Gough Whitlam's part, nor any lack of architectural competence on his part in putting together a program for the Australian rail network and the Australian railway industry; it was due to a reluctance on the part of the states to adopt a national view. Fortunately, Tasmania and South Australia were a little more nationally minded and outward-looking, but they were the only two states to respond favourably to the initiative and the very significant offer that Whitlam made to them at that stage. I know that there were occasions, particularly during the earlier part of my ministry, when Gough Whitlam expressed concerns to me that we were not pursuing vigorously enough the types of reforms that he had been seeking to put into place 20 years ago. I am pleased to say that, as a result of the changes we did put into place, Gough Whitlam was a little kinder to me, appreciating the approaches that we were taking and the achievements we had made. Of the two developments in the area ofrail transport, the first was establishing the National Rail Corporation. The second was completing an agreement to upgrade and complete the standardised rail network from Brisbane to Perth. The missing link was Melbourne-Adelaide. In my last few weeks as minister, I completed an agreement with Alan Brown. I want to pay tribute to him because he very courageously and vigorously pursued the agreement to complete the standardised link between Melbourne and Adelaide. When that is completed, we will have a magnificent, standardised rail link-a rail highway-from Brisbane through those capital cities and around to Perth. That is something that should have occurred when the rail network first went down over 100 years ago. Instead, we have had the absurdity and the cost of the different rail gauges which have dogged development and added enormously to the cost of moving freight around Australia. The reason that happened in the first place was the attitude of the states and their incaIt pacity, inability or reluctance to show a sensible level of cooperation. Fortunately, we were able to get better responses from them. But as the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) quite correctly observed, some of that rolling stock, and some of that capital equipment which is being transferred to the National Rail Corporation from the states, has been allowed to run down. As soon as the states knew that it was going to be transferred, they stopped maintenance. We may call it rolling stock; we are probably lucky that any of it still rolls. That reflects un favourably on the states. It is not really the spirit in which we entered into the agreement, but we were able to get their agreement. This legislation also provides for one specific element of that agreement. There was some reluctance on the part of the states when we announced the One Nation funding. We said that the funding would go to the rail network, essentially for the purposes of the National Rail Corporation and the shipping of heavy interstate freight around Australia. We would expect that to be recognised as part of the Commonwealth contribution so that when it becomes a profitable operating organisation, as it will, the share that represents the or the interests of the Commonwealth government will be enhanced by this injection. They were reluctant to accept that. They said, 'No, you put it in anyway and we'll just treat that as something separate'. We were not prepared to go along with that. We insisted that it be treated as part of our capital equity. This legislation is giving effect to that. The total operating loss of the whole of the railway industry in Australia is estimated, again by the Industry Commission, to have been something like $4,000 million a year. Some of that represents, at least in part, the maintenance of a reasonable public sector subsidy given the size of our continent, the nature of our economic activity, including our production and our commercial exchanges, and the movement of freight and so on across Australia. But a lot of that $4,000 million represents just plain inefficiency, bad operation, bad management, bad work practices, a failure to maintain the system, a failure to introduce innovations and a failure to carry out rail operations in a sensible and efficient way. We can identify from the books of the rail authorities that $1.2 billion of that is accounting losses. The other $2.8 billion represents losses or inefficiencies which occur as a result of all types of special concessional arrangements-subsidised freight, reserve freight and so on. All of those things contributed towards the inefficiency of rail in Australia. I will give an example of what we attempted to overcome in completing a standardised rail network at the same time as establishing a National Rail Corporation to take responsibility for the movement of interstate freight. First of all, every year on the movement of interstate freight-which is of course the most profitable form of rail-there was about a $400 million loss, over the whole of Australia for all of its rail systems. That was $400 million out of the total $4 billion rail loss over the whole of Australia. That was reflected in facts of this kind: freight being moved between Sydney and Perth before we put into place the National Rail Corporation would go on trains that went over three non-integrated rail systems. During equity the movement from Sydney to Perth, there were four changes of locos. There were five different sizes of loading gauge and 10 different engineering standards. Twelve hours plus were taken up as a result of trains standing at sidings or junctions for inspections, crew changes or refuelling. It is not surprising, then, that the movement of freight was so inefficient. One of the reasons we decided to approach the rail freight area in the first place was the successes we had had with Australian National. I pay a tribute to all of those people-such as Don Williams and Russell King-who have made a contribution to the development of AN. AN showed that, with commitment and sensible funding, improvements could be carried out. I also referred in Australia s land transport strategy to the fact that, since the Commonwealth assumed operational control of AN in 1978-this is until last year-AN had recorded a 250 per cent productivity gain. That gain was reflected as well in a 69 per cent real term decline in AN's annual revenue supplement, or subsidy, since 1983-the period we have been in government. That represented a substantial reduction in the call on taxpayers' funds-a great achievement. We could have adopted a number of different models in seeking to bring about some type of national operation and. national control. One of those models would have allowed AN to continue to prove what could be done and show the other states, in effect, that it was a good means, a good mechanism and a good vehicle through which these improvements could have occurred. But there were a number of reasons why that option was not available to us. There was the matter of urgency. The honourable member for Hume again quite correctly said that a lot of these things should have been done over 100 years ago. That was the urgency. If we were not going to do it then, when for heaven's sake would we have done it? There was that urgency about it, and we had to adopt the most effective model for achieving, with urgency, the objectives that were being set. I know there were some sensitivities on the part of individual people, particularly in AN, who knew that they were performing well and were operating the most effective rail system in Australia. There were personal sensitivities involved. I know they would have preferred that we adopt a different model, but the government made its decision. I endorsed that decision and had the responsibility for implementing it. I had the responsibility for its carriage. I pursued that decision on behalf of the government. Again, those delays that the honourable member for Hume quite correctly referred to occurred because-as he knows and, in his more generous moments, I know he would concede this-we set ambitious targets. It took about five years to get AN in place. The National Rail Corporation of course was a much more ambitious project. We set targets for staged achievements. But, during that three-year transition period of that much more ambitious project, we sought to achieve something that had taken five years back in the 1970s to achieve in connection with the establishment of AN, as nationally limited as that project was. There was another special reason why there were delays in getting those funds into place and getting the projects under way. When I said to the state transport ministers and some of their rail transport bureaucrats, 'Get the plans out of the drawers, get them off the shelf, blow off the dust and get the projects under way', they said, 'What plans?'. I said, 'The plans that you have there ready to use when you get funds'. They said, 'What funds? We have never had funds. Why, in heaven's name, would we have any plans to carry out any improvements in our rail systems? We do not even know where the deficiencies are'. So when the government gave them another $450 million under One Nation, they had to look around to see where they would spend it. They had to identify the priorities. Of course, despite the fact that the delays were there, we endorsed that. We did not want them pouring national taxpayers' dollars down the gurgler, as had been going on to the tune of $4,000 million every year. We did not want that to happen at all. So, yes, there have been some delays. The target dates were ambitious for that reason. I wanted to make sure that we set targets that would put people on their mettle and make sure that they acted with some degree of expedition and vigour in pursuing it, and they did. Things are now rolling pretty well. Whatever the deficiencies or delays appear to have been, I think the strategy itself has worked. Of course, I rejoice in that because it has been an initiative of enormous importance. When we set up the corporation, I said we did not want to adopt essentially the role that the states had adopted previously-that is, pouring state taxpayers' dollars down the gurgler. We know what happened as a result of that-we had a rail system which was ready to collapse. A train-I will not say where because I do not want to embarrass any of the states-carrying motor vehicles from one capital city to another was lost. Honourable members might ask, 'How the hell could anyone lose a train?'. The authority lost it all right. The people who were supposed to take delivery of the cars got in touch with the rail authority and asked where the cars were. The rail authority said, 'We don't know where the cars are. We don't even know where the train is'. It had been taken onto a siding to let other major trains go through, and it got lost in the system. I think the cars subsequently showed up. Maybe people are driving them around now. That is what we had to contend with. We needed a national approach. We needed a national commitment. We needed national funding. We needed a national drive behind it. That is what we .did first of all with the National Rail Corporation. Out of the initial new capital funding of $414 million that it needed, we said that we would put in $300 million. The Commonwealth government would accept responsibility to dig the states out of the rail hole that they had got themselves into. Everyone endorsed it. The honourable member for Hume, and his colleagues as well, have been good supporters of that. There has been bipartisan support because people realised that, if we did not do it, one would do it. So, of that amount of $414 million needed, we put in $300 million. As I say, there were no plans available for states to spend that money but they eventually got things into place. Out of One Nation came another $450 million and all of the things that have then been made possible as a result of that. That money has made it possible to have bigger, faster freight trains moving around Australia as well as concrete sleepering, bridge replacement, realignments, passing loops, enlarged tunnels, signalling systems, the monitoring of training operations, and train control systems. All of these things did not exist before, and all that money is going through. The amount of a little over $400 million that we provided for the National Rail Corporation was to act, in effect, as seeding funds for a total investment program of over $2 billion that the states intended to undertake over 10 years. They were major improvements and Australia has benefited as a result of them. (TIme expired)",26
11,Mr JULL,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I would like to confine my comments in this cognate debate to the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), which deals with changes to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the Air Navigation Act 1920. A number of these changes are consequential but a number are worth highlighting in the House today. The principal amendment to the Civil Aviation Act deals with an arrangement with the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to give effect to article 83 of the Chicago convention when it comes into force internationally. The amendment will facilitate the oversight of leased, chartered and interchanged aircraft by enabling a contracting state to enter bilateral agreements transferring some or all of the obligations relating to the airworthiness and safe operation of the aircraft registered with it to the state in which those aircraft are based. These arrangements will permit closer and more effective oversight of the safety of such aircraft. Going back over the history of this, it is interesting to note that, when the Chicago no- convention was first brought into play in 1944, I doubt whether there was any perception of how international civil aviation would develop over the next half a century. At the time nobody believed that international aircraft would be running all around the world in the numbers that we see in the 1990s. Over the last 13 or 14 years there has been a great deal of activity to ensure some control over these chartered and leased aircraft operating in each other's countries. It was in 1980 originally that the ICAO assembly and council first came up with the idea that this amendment should be ratified. Finally, in some sense of desperation, in October 1992 just the agreement was fully agreed to and the participating states signed it. That agreement makes so much sense-in Australia today we see ample evidence of how this international trade of aircraft operates. Already a number of aircraft that operate regularly within Australia are on the American register. Most of them are business jets operated by one of the major shopping developers and the aircraft flown by Sir Peter Abeles, which was not part of the Ansett stable registered in Australia but was registered in the United States. This particular situation will allow the Australian officials to ensure that those aircraft and any others that come in on the register have the right checks to meet the safety standards as they apply in Australia. Australia enjoys a very high safety standard and a very great international reputation-much higher than many other countries of the world. As we deregulate our domestic aviation market, within the next decade there will be opportunities for foreign registered aircraft to operate on services around Australia. For example, one of the first may be a New Zealand carrier having some limited domestic rights. Obviously, that carrier will be registered in New Zealand. While New Zealand standards are very similar to ours, it will be just the start of a process that will see the industry deregulated further and more international carriers operating within the system. It is interesting to examine some of the problems that develop overseas when airline systems are opened up more and more. Some interesting reports have come out of the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States. The FAA has banned 34 foreign airlines from flying into the United States because it found that their 16 home countries have unacceptable standards of air safety. So far, 27 countries have been investigated by the FAA, 16 of which it concluded do not meet the standards of ICAO, and some of which have no effective safety controls at all. In theory, it would be possible for an aircraft to be leased from one such country to fly in Australia. Under these amendments, obviously the Australian safety standards would be enforced. It is interesting to examine the FAA study of foreign aviation standards. Those standards were originally established after the crash off Kennedy Airport in New York in 1990 when 73 people died in an Avianca airliner that crashed because it ran out of fuel. Subsequently, carriers like Air Belize, Regal Air from Antigua and Nicaragua's Central American Air Lines were banned from flying into the United States because they did not meet those safety standards. The FAA figures highlight the air safety problems of these foreign operated aircraft. For example, an FAA team inspected a 23year-old Boeing 727 flown into Miami by the Ecuadorian airline SAETA. The plane had numerous cracks and extensive corrosion and was declared unfit to fly. Recently, the FAA inspected a Guyana Airways 707 passenger jet and noticed extensive corrosion and improper repair work. The entire jet's structural integrity was questioned by the FAA and the plane was grounded. Forty-nine maintenance problems were found on a Lan-Chile 707 cargo plane that arrived in Miami from Santiago. The plane had numerous signs of corrosion and improper repair. Epoxy and paint were used to conceal cracks, and tape was used as a quick fix for the corrosion. In Australia these days such statements would be regarded as almost unbelievable because of the standards that we employ on our aircraft, but obviously those sorts of problems exist in certain parts of the world. When we had the airline dispute in 1989, all sorts of aircraft were imported to Australia to operate our domestic services. Honourable members would remember the tramp 707 which was one of the first airliners to arrive. It sat at Sydney and, at the end of the day, the CAA decided that that aircraft was not fit to fly on the Australian network. There are also legendary stories about some of the other aircraft, especially from central Europe, that arrived to undertake services within the Australian domestic network. So the opposition certainly supports Australia signing that particular section of the ICAO convention to reassure all Australians that the aircraft that will be flying domestically in our skies will have the same safety protection as applied to our own domestically registered aircraft. It is interesting to note the changes in this particular legislation to clause 26 of the Civil Aviation Act. This clause expands the Civil Aviation Authority'S ability to export a range of aviation related consultancy services overseas. While this is causing some concern in private companies, the reality is that there are some enormous opportunities for Australian companies, and probably the CAA, to become involved in the ever expanding civil aviation market, especially in the Asia-Pacific Rim and earn a lot of export dollars for Australia. I was interested to see the report a couple of days ago where the chief of China's aviation said that air safety within mainland China was in a state of crisis. China has an amazing history of aviation over the past 12 months: three or four deadly crashes and an unprecedented nine highjackings so far this year. Jiang Zhuping, head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said Beijing had ordered a nationwide check of all pilots' abilities as well as all equipment at airports, and maintenance and air traffic systems, to close safety loopholes and tighten discipline. The CAA is already looking at getting itself involved in trying to modernise and update the aviation system within mainland China. Undoubtedly, the growth in the aviation industry in mainland China has been quite frightening-last year, China's aviation sector grew by 33 per cent. So far, in the first 10 months of this year, there has been a further increase of 22 per cent in air traffic. Having regard to the population of China, it is quite believable that it- domestic airlines last year carried 28.58 million people, and 572,000 tonnes of freight in the first 10 months of this year. In terms of passenger and freight growth, the figure for passengers was up by about 19.9 per cent on the previous year's figure and by about 23 per cent for freight. That rate of increase is not going to stop. Those honourable members who have been to China and seen some of the facilities there would realise that the Chinese have got a lot to do to bring their standards up to international levels and to have the capacity to accommodate the incredible growth that is happening in that part of the world. Of course, that applies not just to China but throughout Asia. A number of Australian companies have been involved in places like Malaysia in bringing their equipment and facilities up to· date. Australia does have the enviable reputation of being one of the leaders in aviation standards around the world. The opportunities in the Asia-Pacific rim over the next decade are quite challenging. In that respect, this amendment to give the CAA the authority to become involved in that has some ramifications down the track and gives opportunities for the earning of many millions of export dollars and, of course, the creation of jobs for Australians. There are some other minor amendments to the act. Clauses 27 to 29 deal with technical amendments which will convert the existing penalties in the act to penalty units without altering the level of penalties. There does not seem to be any objection to this within the industry. It is a system that is used in other government instrumentalities. Clause 31 allows for the issue of air operator certificates to authorise the operation of Australian aircraft by reference to a class of aircraft rather than to a specifi'c aircraft. We have no objection to any of those amendments. As I said, those two areas, in particular the ratification of article 83 of the Chicago convention, have some good prospects for Australia. We would like to commend the fact that the Civil Aviation Authority will be able to go into that ever expanding market and sell and promote some of Australia's expertise in air traffic control to our near Asian neighbours. .",29
12,Mr STAPLES,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga) (11.42 a.m.)Like the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) I, too, am concerned about safety. I am glad he raised the issue of air safety today. I have flown on Guyana Airways, one of the airlines he mentioned, so I am very glad to still be here, particularly as the back door flew open during take-off. However, in the short time available to me I want to concentrate on road safety issues, particularly motor vehicle insurance, which is something that affects most people who have a motor vehicle. I am very pleased that the road accident rate in Australia has reduced very significantly in the last couple of years, due particularly to the improvement in Australian design rules and the application of those rules, as well as a number of other contributing factors. But it does concern me that there is great potential for danger in thousands of cars-and, therefore, for thousands of people-on the road every day. A family's car is one of their major assets, apart from their house. The family's greatest assets are the family members themselves, which is something we take into consideration every time we get into a car and travel on a road. Mr Deputy Speaker, if your car was in an accident, I would expect you would want to make sure it was repaired in such a way that brought it back to its pre-accident condition, so that you and your family were protected after you drove it but of the motor vehicle repairer's yard. You would want it to be in a safe, road worthy condition which continued to conform with Australian design rules. You would want to get what you thought you had paid for in terms of your insurance premiums. Unfortunately, I have seen quite a number of problems regarding motor vehicle repairs. I make the point that it does not simply reflect the quality of the job done by the motor vehicle repairer; it also reflects prob-' worthy. lems in the industry-the broader aspect of the industry being the insurance company and the relationship between the insurance company, the consumer and the motor vehicle repairer. I have seen cars on which the brake linings have been affected by welding and the brake lines have been weeping and have broken. I have seen those cars after they have been back on the road and then brought back to rectify these problems and also many other structural problems which are not repaired. The consumer is quite rightly very concerned about these matters because they affect road safety and, in the end, people's lives. I have here a letter from an insurance company authorising a motor vehicle repairer to apply heat to intrusion bars on door frames to allow them to be repaired if needed when door skins are removed from doors. I also have an extract from a repair manual which talks about repair methods for heat sensitive steel where conventional torch and hammer repair techniques cannot be used to straighten heat sensitive, damaged panels and underbody components. So there is a contradiction: on one hand an engineering repair manual states that one cannot apply heat and other body straightening techniques; on the other hand, there is a letter from an insurance company that says that this can be done. These sorts of situations are imposed upon the motor vehicle repairer-upon the consumer, ultimately-in order to get the cheapest job done. I do not think when it comes to road safetyor air safety-that the cheapest job should be the criterion. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), a former transport minister and now the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, has already raised this issue in the debate today and I support him in that regard. I believe, as he does,that when a vehicle comes off the factory floor, whether it be lost on· a train, as the honourable member for Charlton(Mr Robert Brown) mentioned, or whether a person drives it away, it should conform with Australian design regulations and is roadUnfortunately, if a person's car is in an accident and has to be repaired, there is no requirement generally across Australia for that car to be brought back to a safe condition in a way which guarantees that safety to the consumer. There is no requirement that the parts that are used to repair that car are from the manufacturer who made the original parts. There is no requirement, even if the parts came from the original manufacturer, that those parts will conform with Australian design regulations. What is happening in regard to insurance and motor vehicle repair in Australia is that a lot of parts are being imported. They might be Toyota or Nissan parts, but it is more than likely that they are not for cars built under Australian design rules. They might come from Malaysia, Taiwan or somewhere else, not to mention the cheap parts which do not have to comply with any engineering or safety standards and which are made by any number of small factories scattered around the world and which are used as replacement parts in Australia. Then there is the issue of technologically inappropriate repairs, such as the case I mentioned regarding the intrusion bars. There are a number of problems which I do not believe most people are aware of when they sign an insurance agreement or have their cars repaired. They are not aware that they are not getting what they thought they had paid for. I do not think consumers need to be lawyers or engineers to have that degree of confidence in having their cars repaired. I believe there needs to be an examination of this area. I welcome the statement made today by the honourable member for Shortland that his committee will look at it, but I think we need something a bit quicker than that. He has already indicated that the workload of that committee is extremely heavy, and a perusal of the Notice Paper will show that. I believe that state and federal transport ministers-I am glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe), who has already taken an interest in this, is here today-and state and federal consumer affairs ministers, and others as need be, need to get together now to sort this issue out. The bottom line has to be that, if consumers enter into a contract for the safe repair of their motor vehicles, they should be assured by government regulation, by good practice or by whatever means necessary that when that car is taken out of the showroom and put on the road, when it is bought in a road worthy condition second-hand or when it comes out of a panel shop the car is safe and restored to its pre-accident condition. That should be the bottom line protection for the individual consumer and every road user around that vehicle. Unless we do that, we leave ourselves open to a market which is fed not by consumer entitlements in a very technical engineering area but by the way in which an insurance company and others-motor vehicle repairers-operate. It is not a matter of a fair job for a fair price; it is not a matter of a panel beater spending X hours and producing X work at the end of it. In the mind of a person getting a car repaired, that is not what the contract really is. Consumers expect to get their cars back in a safe condition, and they should be assured of that. There should be a contract between the insurance company and the consumer to do a proper, safe job and to restore the vehicle to its pre-accident condition, whether that be in its structural integrity or in its roadworthiness for day-today operation. I have a serious concern that there is a growing practice that disenfranchises the consumer choice of repairer. That is illustrated by the tow out policy which does not give, by and large, the choice of repairer. A lot of insurance company contracts now, through various forms of persuasion, disenfranchise people from their choice of repairer. The tow out policy basically means that a car is taken out of a panel beater's shop to a central auction room where the job is auctioned off to the cheapest bidder without regard necessarily for the safety of that repair. The solution boils down to this matter being resolved only by ensuring that the responsibility for rectifying damage rests squarely with the motor vehicle insurance company. There is an insinuation that it is the panel beaters' job-they quoted for the job so they should fix it. The responsibility has to come· back to the motor vehicle insurer. The consumer holds the key to it. The contract is made with the insured to fix it, and that is the way it should be. It should be the insurance company's responsibility to ensure that the job is done properly. It should be the insurance company's responsibility to see that that vehicle is put back on the road in a roadworthy condition. Let us look at this situation. When we go to buy a new car it has to conform to Australian design rules before it goes on the road. It requires an annual inspection of roadworthiness. When we buy or sell a car we have to get a road worthiness certificate to go with it. When a car is smashed almost to the point of being written off it does not require a full safety inspection to go back on the road. The responsibility of the insurance company is to rectify the damage to the point of safety and to certify that that car is roadworthy, safe and complies with Australian design rules in the replacement· of parts and the quality of repairs. That should be the basic bottom line of any contract between an insurance company and a consumer. I believe the insurance company should be responsible for it.",31

15,Mr OKEEFE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Burke-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (11.56 a.m.)-in reply-I understand that no-one else wishes to speak on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), so I will just take a couple of minutes to wind up the debate on this legislation. I thank the opposition for its support for these measures, bear- third time. ing in mind that there have been points made in the debate this morning by some honourable members opposite that reflect differing views, but overall we have consensus on the approach to these reforms. I also thank honourable members from this side of the House for their contributions, and the officers of the department who have put a lot of effort into the preparation of these amendments which, as honourable members know, have been far ranging. They reflect ongoing changes to legislation which must now occur from time to time given the reforms that have taken place across a full range of areas. These amendtnerits reflect that right through the whole range of transport and communications issues-from Australia Post, through telecommunications, through shipping to national rail. I make a quick observation about the points made by the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples) on the issue of the safety of used cars coming back from repairers. He has been focused on this issue for a long time. He has watched the operations at a local level. He has met with members of the industry and has pointed out the issues to senior members of the government. It has clearly reached the stage where the Standing Committee on be Transport, Communications and Infrastructure is prepared to have a look at it. There is a lot to be said for the suggestion that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) and the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) should consider whether the federal government might take an active role by making some changes to legislation now. I certainly think that is fertile ground and that there is a responsibility to act there. Having said those things, I thank the House for its support for this legislation, and I formally close the debate on these bills. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

16,Mr RUDDOCK,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"The Arts, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 is an omnibus bill dealing with a wide range of matters that might be seen as being largely machinery in character. In fact, if we look at the explanatory memorandum, we see it says fairly explicitly that the purpose of the bill is to make various minor improvements to the ACT self-government legislation, which are as a result of a review of legislation conducted in 1992, three years after self-government. Interestingly, these amendments are being made almost 12 months after that review. Some important changes are being examined which could be included in a separate bill at a later date. So the government still has not acted fully on that report. The bill amends the ACT self-government legislation to ensure that, during the transitional period before the ACT establishes its own public service, the Commonwealth's· Comcare system applies to the ACT fire brigade and to staff of the members of the assembly in the territory, as it does to other ACT government employees. It ensures that an eligible judge, when exercising power issue search warrants under the enforcement provisions of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, has the same immunity tants. from legal action as a justice of the High Court in proceedings before that court. Finally we are told in the explanatory memorandum that the bill makes various minor corrections and drafting improvements to other legislation relating to the arts, territories and the environto ment. In that regard I notice that in the Australia Council Act 1975 there is the removal of sexist terminology. After the term 'he' there is inserted the term 'she', and the term 'chairman' is replaced by the term 'chairperson'. Similar minor drafting errors had to be addressed in the National Gallery Act 1975. In the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, there is the correction of a citation error, references to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973-74 being replaced by the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. Obviously a bill of such major moment is unlikely to be opposed, particularly as it has already passed through the Senate and we are dealing with it in this case as the house of review. However, I take the opportunity, given that it is an omnibus bill dealing with a wide range of issues, to make it clear that, when these housekeeping measures are dealt with, some of the other myths that the government has been about peddling in recent times are, as I have described them, largely myths. In relation to the arts community and heritage issues in particular, the government would have us believe that only it cares. Having had 20 years experience in this parliament and some recollection of the way in which events have unfolded over time, I know that to be a myth. I am surprised that those people who have any awareness of these matters would fall for some of the nonsense that was perpetrated particularly in the last election. I refer particularly to those people who saw fit to believe some of the hype generated at the State Theatre in Sydney. This is particularly so when one has some knowledge of the background of the way in which that hype was generated. As my colleague Senator Patterson deto scribed in another place, the Labor Party's interest in culture seemed to have been developed largely through the use of consulIt was rather interesting that $9,000 was paid to one former press secretary of one of the ministers to prepare the cultural statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that the sum of $9,000 was paid to another consultant and that $5,000 was paid for somebody else design the cover. As my colleague said: The Labor Party's cultural policy was paid for with taxpayers' money. ... In large part, that was the way in which this myth was generated. I make it very clear in the context of this debate that it has been governments of Liberal and National persuasion and our predecessors that have been very significant in establishing much of the institutional and cultural arrangements that exist in Australia. In fact, if we go back as far as 1908, Alfred Deakin, the Prime Minister at that time, established the Commonwealth Literary Fund-an important initiative which we on this side would consider to be the start of our interest in these matters. In 1967, the Holt government. provided assistance to composers and, in that same year, commenced the first federal arts funding agency. In ·1968, when John Gorton was Prime Minister, the Australian Council for the Arts met for the first time. In 1969, the Australian Film and Television Corporation received over $1 million. In 1970, again under John Gorton, we saw the establishment of the Australian Film Development Corporation. The first federal minister for the arts was Bill MCMahon, followed by Peter Howson. In 1971, the establishment of the Australian Film and Television School, close to my own electorate but in the electorate of Bennelong, was announced. In 1971, announcements were made in relation to the establishment of a national gallery. In 1978, we had the section lOB tax concessions for Australian films initiated by Bob Ellicott under the Fraser government, and we had the agreement to fund the building of the NIDA facilities in Sydney at the University of New South Wales. In 1979, we saw the first ministerial council for the arts involving Commonwealth and state ministers meeting jointly. In 1980, we saw the section lOBA tax concessions of 150 per cent for films in particular and the establishment in that same year of Artbank. In 1980, we saw the establishment of the Australian Children's Television Foundation, and our colleague the former member for Sturt, Mr Ian Wilson, was involved in that. In 1982-83, the principle of arms-length funding at the Australia Council was established under our friend Tom MCVeigh. It is interesting that in relation to the arts we have been able to establish the principle which was intended to maintain a bipartisan approach to these matters and to keep gross politicisation out of the arts area. When we look at the events that have occurred recently in relation to sports funding and the like, we could be forgiven for saying that that was a very significant achievement. I suppose we ought to be glad that at least the arms-length funding arrangements were not breached in the run-up to the election, even though the efforts to establish this new myth of Labor's cultural superiority was commenced. In this debate we need to look at the way in which important organisations have been supported traditionally under coalition governments. Organisations such as the Australian Ballet, the Australian Opera, the National Library, the National Gallery-which I have previously mentioned-the establishment of the predecessors to the Australia Council, the National Institute of Dramatic Art and Artbank, which I mentioned before, are very important initiatives. It is interesting that, the context of the arts, what we have been hearing since the election has had a lot more to do with the more imperial style that the present government has adopted in furnishing the cabinet room and the arrangements for the Lodge. It is interesting that, in the context of heritage issues, which this legislation deals with, the Australiana Fund was established under a Liberal-National Party government and under the auspices of a former Prime Minister's wife, Mrs Tamie Fraser. That fund ought not be politicised. I think all of us see it as very worthy. It seems strange, but I have had a personal involvement in these matters. Not so long ago an item came into my possession-a hand-carved pipe rack and tobacco box-that belonged to a former Prime Minister, Ben Chiney. It was presented to him by the Australian timber producers and was hand crafted out of Australian timber. After Mr Chifley was no longer prime minister, the item was presented as a gift to a member of staff and held for a long time till it was handed on to another couple that I happened to know. That dear lady passed away, but she had given instructions that I ought to ensure that the item was offered again to the Commonwealth. It was my privilege to be able to present, through Sir John Bunting to Mr John Walton, that item that had been given to a former Prime Minister of Australia for inclusion as part of our cultural heritage. The Australiana Fund was meant to be a fund that would be able to bring together important items of Australian heritage that could be displayed in very important Australian national facilities like the Lodge or Yarralumla. It is a great pity, is it not, that because of the political argument that we have in Australia the Australiana Fund itself has been politicised by the Prime Minister. He is determined to try to impose his will on the way in which the Lodge, in particular, would be furnished; to move away from the acquisition of important Australian heritage items to the acquisition of copies of antique furniture-not only copies of antique furniture but also copies of antique furniture manufactured abroad-and to use the Australiima Fund for in that purpose. I find a matter such as that of great disappointment to me, because I like to think that there was not an effort to politicise those matters, rather there was a recognition of the involvement of governments of all political persuasions to support our important Australian arts in their various manifestations. It is certainly very clear to me from my own dealings with members of parliament on this side of the House that there is a wide range of interest in the Australian arts. I must say that, while I have been a subscriber of the Australian Opera and the Australian Ballet for some time and have a particular interest in supporting Australian live theatre when able-I like to see Australian films and have certainly been pleased when opportunities have been provided at Parliament House to use some of the recreational times available to witness such presentations-I think it is nevertheless more important to me that a good deal of work be put into supporting the arts in those areas of Australia where there is very often more a cultural dearth than a surfeit. One of the great privileges I have had over time is to be a member of Arts West-an organisation designed to encourage a development of the interest in the western suburbs of Sydney. The Arts West publication is produced by the Arts West Foundation. It particularly tries to support all of the cultural activities in western Sydney. It is a fact that, while we can go to places like Parramatta and find .very old buildings of the character of Old Government House and Elizabeth Farm, one of the great heritages that the Labor Party left Parramatta was a willingness to accommodate through the local council some more modern monstrosities in the form of high-rise and medium developments for development purposes. Over time a large number of heritage buildings have been destroyed. It is a great pity that we have not seen the establishment of the sorts of art galleries and so on that we see here in Canberra. I do not deny those sorts of facilities the Canberra community, but if honourable members go to places like Parramatta and the western suburbs of Sydney where the population is every bit as large, and probably larger, those sorts of facilities are not found. It is a great disappointment that, while the Prime Minister has put a lot of effort into thinking about the refurbishment of the Lodge and the cabinet room, we do not hear speeches in relation to the dearth of cultural facilities in the western suburbs of Sydney, much of which is represented by the Prime Minister himself and at times by some of his other ministerial colleagues. I recognise that through the Australia Council there has been some support for cultural programs and a developing interest in pursuing multicultural arts issues as well but, if one looks at the support that is given in relation to those particular arts programs in comparison to overall arts support, one can see that it is still minuscule in terms of the needs that ought to be addressed. I think that it would be far more preferable in these matters if, rather than in the run-up to an election, arts were politicised in an effort to garner support and a greater willingness to recognise the shortcomings that exist within our community; an effort on the government's part to develop a bipartisan approach to supporting the programs that exist; an involvement of some of the major arts in being able to visit western Sydney, in particular; and a consideration of the provision of arts facilities. I notice, when we look again at the sporting and cultural grants, that all of the funds that were available to help provide capital support have been largely disgorged. Now that the election and the need to use those funds to garner political support are out of the way, few funds, or at this stage no funds, are available for the establishment of cultural facilities. For instance, if there were an application from Parramatta to seek support for a regional gallery, from where would that support be forthcoming in the Commonwealth's funding arrangements? If one were looking for support for bringing to the Australian Opera to Parramatta Park for a performance such as the one in the Domain in Sydney, where would one· find it? Where would the sponsorship come from? When I attended a performance of the Australian Opera in Parramatta P-rk a number of years ago, it involved considerable cost. In the end, because there was no support for it, the cost was such that the opera in the park concept was not continued in the western suburbsthere was only the night in Sydney. What fascinated me on the evening at Parramatta Park were the tens of thousands of people who came out to hear our Australian Opera Co. The assumption that in the western suburbs of Sydney-I still represent part of that area of Sydney, albeit the north-west of it-there is no interest in cultural matters, it is a cultural desert, is flawed. The government needs to back up its rhetoric with performance. We need to look at cultural matters not only in terms of the national bodies, which I strongly support, but also in terms of ensuring ways and means for all Australians to have access to the performing arts, such as opera and ballet. They should be able to witness the great works of art, to attend the national and state art galleries and museums, and to benefit from them. In the context of this debate, I again take the opportunity to assert that, in relation to the arts, and in the most positive and constructive way, the opposition continues to support the organisations that were established when we were in government. We continue to give support to those who seek to achieve excellence in the arts. We encourage our people who are performing in the dramatic areas through the medium of film and the like. But we want to see a situation in which all Australians are able to benefit from the pursuit of excellence in these areas. We want to see that the cultural wealth that this nation has-a multicultural wealth-is something that is supported across the board politically, supported throughout the Australian community, and supported through funding. I make it very clear that the principle of arms-length funding in this area is something that should be maintained, and that the program of support, particularly for sporting and cultural facilities, should be depoliticised. Support for sporting and cultural facilities should be available to people right throughout Australia. It should not be the case that if people live in blue ribbon Labor electorates or blue ribbon Liberal electorates they will not be able to have cultural facilities built provided. Mr Sciacca interjecting. Mr RUDDOCK-Well, parliamentary secretary, let me just say-I have not said a great deal about these cultural and sporting grants-it was interesting that in my electorate",34
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"Mr Newell)Order! The subject matter you are raising is not contained anywhere within the bill, as I that understand it. Just make sure your remarks remain relevant.",38
18,Mr RUDDOCK,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"We are dealing with cultural facilities and the bill deals with arts and cultural matters. I will conclude by making the pOint, as I did before, that the principle of arms-length funding in relation to the arts has been clearly established in the legislation that we are dealing with. It is a point. that ought to be carried through to all funding in relation to cultural matters. That is the point that I was making. There are areas of our great cities and areas Which have been generous in their support for the government that have suffered over time. I would invite you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I would the parliamentary secretary, to meet with your colleagues who represent western Sydney-or, if you would prefer, with somebody such as' me-for a little guidance. I could show you the facilities that we do have and the extent to which people in organisations, such as my friend Katherine Knight in the Arts West Foundation, went in bringing the arts to western Sydney. They put an enormous amount of effort and work into it but they did not have the substantial capital investment in the provision of galleries and theatres which can ensure that these performances and works are properly demonstrated and shown. It is a matter which, if the government is looking at meeting the needs of the Australian community as a whole, needs to be addressed. I would encourage honourable members opposite to look at the way in which they have politicised .these programs, to address these questions anew and to bring back the bipartisan approach that used to exist in these and matters, which was demonstrated by the record of the previous Liberal and National governments.",38
19,Mr LANGMORE,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"I was interested to hear the comments of the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). I wondered if one could interpret his comments as an affirmation that the opposition would increase funding for the arts rather than reduce it-as it announced it was planning to do at the last election. If so, would have been a fine announcement. He was not, however, as specific as that. The honourable member simply made claims about the opposition's contribution to the arts in past without making any promises for the future. Therefore, it is difficult to take what he said as anything more than the most superficial rhetoric, and that is disappointing. I would love to see the arts as a bipartisan issue. We depend a lot on the community building, the nation building and the cultural development that occurs through expenditure on the arts. The government, in fact, has a very good record in this area, most notably in the last budget. The honourable member did not mention that in the last budget funding for the arts went up by about eight per cent, that it was allocated to national collections and to a whole series of areas of the arts and that it was in fulfilment of a promise made during the election campaign-which promise the arts community was delighted to hear about and fully supported during the campaign and has warmly welcomed since the budget was brought down. I think the honourable member for Berowra, the opposition spokesman on the arts, gave a very unbalanced picture. He also made a number of cheap shots, which I was surprised at since I have some respect for the opposition member. For example, he was critical of putting Gould bird prints in the cabinet room. This morning I was privileged to take a group of visitors, .some from Australia and some from the United States, through the cabinet room. It was with some pride that one saw on the wall these absolutely superb bird prints that were described by the man in charge of the cabtnet suite as 'the finest ornithological prints made in Australia during the 19th century'. That, of course, is true. I felt that it was entirely appropriate that prints of which we could all be proud were on display in the cabinet room. They are, of course, prints that do not carry any kind of political message. The prints demonstrate the excellence and the beauty of Australia's natural species, which are beautifully reproduced in those prints. They are prints, by the way. I am sure that the honourable member that would know the difference between prints and paintings: prints are a very modest, mass produced form of artistic representation. These prints are amongst the· finest ever the produced of Australian birds or any other aspect of Australian life. Nevertheless, relatively speaking, they are not expensive forms of representation. I thought the prints were entirely appropriate. I am delighted that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had the vision to put them in the cabinet room. They are well judged, and it is astonishing that people who claim to be supportive of the arts can be so narrowly and ignorantly critical to not see the appropriateness of those purchases. The honourable member for Berowra in his remarks ranged very widely from the Arts, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought you showed considerable leniency in letting him talk about the arts, because this bill is really about some very minor changes to the legislation covering self-government in the Australian Capital Territory. I think we should return to those issues relating to the legislation. The bill itself extends to the ACT powers that have already been extended to the Northern Territory so that the ACT is a step closer to finalising and completing that movement towards self-government, which has been under way now for about five years. The bill is supported in its entirety by the opposition as well as the government, as it should be. It is about five years since the ACT was given self-government by the Commonwealth. That was not an entirely popular decision by the Commonwealth government, but I have to say that I thought it was an entirely appropriate one. It is not reasonable that any part of the country should not be able to govern itself. This is particularly important at a time when very difficult decisions about expenditure priorities have to be made. Whatever happened in relation to the government of the ACT, whether it received self-government or not, it was going to have to cope with a smaller budget in the way the states and the other territory had been doing for some years. That has occurred. It has been extremely difficult for the ACT government to decide how to do that, but it is better for a government elected by the people of the ACT - representative of them and accountable to them-to make that decision, rather than a government remote from the people and not accountable directly to them. I think the ACT government has done a very creditable job in trying to make those difficult choices between competing outlay priorities whilst a reduction in its budget. That leads on very naturally to some comments about the relationship of the programs of the states and territories to employment. Honourable members will know that today the Committee on Employment Opportunities released a report entitled Restoring full ployment-it is called the green paper on employment. I strongly welcome the publication of that report. Employment is the central economic and social issue which Australians should be addressing. It is clear that this report has many ideas in it that need to be seriously considered. The central requirement for restoring full employment is increasing employment in human services. Most people-about 65 per cent of the total work force-are now employed in human services. Many of those human services are provided by governmenteducation, health, civic protection, arts, environment, all of the services for the aged and the young and so on. In order to ensure that those services are of a high quality, accessible and equitably available, the Commonwealth is required to fund the states and the territories adequately. So a necessary condition for restoring full employment is matching the need to improve those services with the funding for those services. If we aim to effectively achieve human services which are of a good quality, decent and equitably available, we are going to have to increase the funding provided for them. That means that we will have to change the trend of funding for the states and territories because most of those human services are provided through the states and the territories. Since the mid-1970s, the proportion of the national income which has been provided to the states and the territories, both from the Commonwealth and through their own revenue, has fallen from about 12 per cent to six per cent of GOP. In other words, there has been a massive reduction in the funding made available for human services that are provided by state and territory governments. A necessary condition for improving those services is the improvement of funding. As that funding is improved, it will lead to improvements in coping with employment in those areas. If we are to provide good quality education the and restore full employment, we need to increase the quality of education. If we are to increase the skills of the work force and restore full employment, we need to improve the funding for technical and further educaem- tion. At the beginning of this year about 150,000 applicants for technical and further education could not be admitted because there were no places available. That is very s,ad because it not only reduces the opportunity those people will have for developing the kinds of skills that they want for their work and their activities later in life but it also denies them a chance to contribute in a more skilled way after they graduate. We must build up support for technical and further education, for university education and for hospitals and other health services. I am quite sure it is clear to every member of this chamber that we need to improve services for the aged. The average age of the population is increasing. We need more nursing home beds and centres for old people, just as we need Illore child care for the young, better support services for recent migrants, the disabled, Aborigines and so on. In other words, we need to improve services in order to establish a firmer basis for economic development and a more humane and civilised society in Australia. As we achieve those goals, we will be increasing employment opportunities in areas where people who are graduates or trained at TAFE will have opportunities to contribute. This profoundly important dimension of the employment crisis has not been adequately addressed in the last few years. There has been a tendency to think that we must concentrate on improving the efficiency of services, not the quality. Obviously, it is essential to improve efficiency, but at the same time, and without neglecting efficiency, we must aim to improve quality and accessibility-that is, the equity with which public services are available. In doing that, we will provide a better infrastructure for the private sector. There will be a more effective stimulus to the private sector because more trained people will be available. The network of education, research, communications and so on, which the private sector requires in order to operate efficiently, will also be improved. We must recognise that effective economic development depends on cooperation between the public and the private sector. Their activities are not antagonistic, as the opposition keeps on saying; they are complementary. Both are essential if we are to have a well-balanced economy providing the services that the community needs, as well as providing an efficient framework for building up the exports essential to external balance. Although this bill relates to funding for the ACT, funding for the other states and territories can be seen as another relevant dimension and as another crucial element of the national strategy for the employment growth that we all want. None of us can be satisfied with a situation where someone wanting to work is not able to get a job. There is increasing recognition that government stimulus to economic development is essential for employment growth. Clearly, part of this report is about that fact. We will find that support for the kinds of employment stimulating strategies outlined in this report, and which I am outlining now, will strengthen as people recognise them as the productive, effective, humane and decent way forward. That is the kind of society that we want. I strongly support the legislation, and link with it those broader issues which are also important to effective and humane economic and social development.

21,Mr CLEARY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Prior to the March general election the minister's department, through the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program, allocated in excess of $200,000 in grants to the seat of Wills. Personally, I was thankful that such moneys were allocated to an electorate desperately in need of funds and so reliant on its sporting and community culture. However, there seems to be a major and striking anomaly in the allocation of these funds. The minister's list of grants document identifies the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia as the recipient of $100,000. Is the minister aware that the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia has approximately 25 Melbourne parishes, four of which are in Wills? Was the minister aware that the whole $100,000 was in fact allocated to one parish of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese, the Coburg parish? Was the minister or her staff aware that the twice failed 'Labor candidate, Mr Bill Kardamitsis, was and is employed at the Coburg parish of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese at 29 Victoria Street, Coburg? Finally, how does the minister respond to the claim that the allocation of money to Mr Kardamitsis' parish was a blatant attempt to buy ALP votes in an area known to be a power base of the member for Wills who just happens to be me?",41
22,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I appreciate the preamble to the honourable member's question when he outlined that the areas in his electorate are areas of great need and clearly would qualify under the guidelines. On the specific points that the honourable member raised in relation to that grant, I will take the matter up, examto ine the application and give the honourable member a detailed response. NA",41
23,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afterinternational noon members of a parliamentary delegation from Pakistan .led by the Speaker of the National Assembly. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Banking  been drawn to a headline on the front page of yesterday'S Australian Financial Review which read, 'RBA: Open slather for foreign banks'? Has the Reserve Bank announced open slather for foreign banks and, further, can the Treasurer inform the House of the broader ramifications for the Australian economy of recent developments towards freer trade in financial .services?",42
24,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for the question. I did see the headline to which the honourable member refers'RBA: Open slather for foreign banks'. Far be it for me to comment on the news judgments of the newspaper in question. However, the story underneath the headline concerned an announcement by the.Reserve Bank that was in pursuit of the policy objectives which I set out in a banking policy statement on 18 June. At that time. I was keen to ensure that we gave effect to our commitment to provide more opportunities for foreign banks to operate in this country, including branches as well as subsidiaries. The Reserve Bank, in the announcement that it made the other day, has removed a· significant impediment which stood in the way of further enhancing the level of competition within the banking system in Australia; particularly competition coming from those foreign banks, whilst at the same time preserving the integrity of the prudential requirements of our banking system. Australia has taken a very relaxed approach the entry of foreign banks, believing that more competition within the Australian banking system is desirable nbt only to the extent of providing a greater range of services to banking customers in Australia, particularly corporate Australia, but also in enhancing links for Australia and the rest of the world. In. this regard, this is entirely consistent with the objectives of the reform to the trade in financial services which has been pursued as part of the Uruguay Round. Whilst it is not possible to be totally definitive on where that is going to end up, given some reservations on the part of the Americans in this area, it is nevertheless the case that Australia has been supporting the view that there ought to be liberalisation internationally as far as trade in financial services is concerned. I make the point that the success of the Uruguay Round, which is now assured, is of enormous importance to Australia and to the entire world. There is nothing which could be more encouraging to business confidence internationally than a successful outcome of the round and a demonstration that the governments of the world can work collectively in the interests of ensuring a greater ability for corporations around the world to engage in freer and fairer trade. As one of the people who represented Australia seven years ago in Uruguay when this round was launched, I must say how delighted I am that the objectives which we set for ourselves that many years ago are now coming to fruition. Most importantly, we ought to reflect on the finality of this round compared with the finality of the last round. On the last occasion that we were seeing a GATT round concluded, all that the Australian minister-the then Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr ANTHONY - could do was stamp his foot and walk out of those final negotiations because it was agreed that agriculture should be once again left out of the disciplines of the GATT. As a result of the work that Australia has done with other countries during the last seven years, we now see agriculture firmly embedded within the disciplines of the GATT. The unfair trading practices of some of our competitors are going to begin to wind down in the years ahead. Mr Tim Fischer-Slowly.",42
25,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Farrer might say slowly; but much more importantly than slowly is the fact that it is happening at all. His predecessor of a few years agoMr Tim Fischer-He set up CER.,43
26,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He did a number of things. He was a commendable member of this House. But he did not manage to get agriculture into the GATT. That has now been done. Now that agriculture is in the GATT, we will see those barriers to freer and fairer trade in agricultural products inevitably and irresistibly come down. They must .come down. I suspect that they will probably even exceed the timetable and the targets which have been set by the revised Blair House agreement. I conclude by saying that, at the beginning of this question, I referred to Australia's in playing its role in freeing up trade in financial services. But it is not confined there and it is not confined to agriculture. Australia has a very broad view of the advantages which can come to Australia and to the entire world· economy as a result of the successful conclusion of this round. I am proud of the role that Australia has played in the successful conclusion across a wide range· of areas. Community Grants",43
27,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Exactly how does the minister propose to look into the grant that was raised by the honourable member for Wills when the Auditor-General has found that no records exist to justify any of the grants she has made?",43
28,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members of this House will be aware that there are a number of recommendations about improvements to this grants scheme. As I have said previously, the department is going to take into consideration all of those recommendations. In the meantime, I also answered a question from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday when I outlined in detail the letter that I sent to the Auditor General, which elaborated the factors that I took into consideration when examining each of the grants and making a determination.

36,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is good. Mr Downer interjecting,43
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left! The honourable member for Mayo!,44
38,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to say that it is the first such report which has been commissioned in the postwar years looking at the particular problems of the labour market and the operation of the social security system. It is a report which looks particularly at the problem not just of aggregate employment-it addresses that by suggesting that there is no substitute for aggregate growth or growth in producing aggregate employment and bringing down aggregate unemployment-but talks also about the growth record of the 1980s and how the Australian economy would need to grow in the 1990s to bring unemployment down to around five per cent in aggregate by the year 2000. It also focuses on the needs of the long term unemployed, suggesting policies that would reduce long-term unemployment or the pool of the long-term unemployed from 440,000, as at present, to around 90,000 by the year 2000. It talks persuasively about the inefficiencies of the labour market which the economy, in a growth mode, would experience if indeed we had the better part of 400,000 people unemployed long-term; and how we might deal with getting those long term unemployed people ready for work to participate in the growth in employment which is now coming through the economy. In the last three months we have seen 100,000 jobs created in the economy. As well as that, we have seen a forecast yesterday by the Treasury looking at, I think from recollection, something like 180,000 jobs across this year. So we are starting to see aggregate employment pick up. But what we will not see, unless the government and the community focus on this problem, is those jobs being taken by the long-term unemployed. We do not want to see the position that we have seen in Britain, for - instance, where, with quite levels of unemployment, real wages were still rising, not tempered by the pool of unemployment because the people in the pool-Iongterm unemployed people-were effectively sidelined from participating again in the labour market and in society. As a consequence, the new entrants to the labour market were the only ones who went into the jobs which the economy was creating. The ethos of this country has been around the question of social participation, a fair go and a fair opportunity to participate in our society. That has always come first with employment. But we know that there are effective bars and inhibitions to people who are long-term unemployed getting back into the labour market. We know from the 1980s experience that it took us a very long time, with a very large decline in aggregate unemployment, before we started to cut into the level of long-term unemployment. That level has now quadrupled and it will take, on the 1980s experience, a very long time to deal with that group. This is an approach which deals with the long-term unemployed, to try to train them and give them work experience and get them back into the work force. The committee, in writing the report to the government, has talked about a job compact built on the principle of reciprocal obligations for the government to provide help through expanded labour market assistance, and for job seekers to get work and to use such help. By talking in terms of a job for up to nine months for those unemployed for at least 18 months, it holds out the prospect of those people having the capacity to train themselves, to pick up their experience, to have actual work experience and to lift their esteem and get back into the labour market. The report is a very comprehensive one. It also looks at things like the delivery of the Commonwealth Employment Service and how that service can be improved. It looks at ways of reconfiguring the social security system built on the kind of labour market experience we have today as distinct from 40 years ago when the social security system was designed essentially around generally a male full-time earner. In these days we see high participation high rates by males and females in the labour market for both fulland part-time work. The report is suggesting changes which might be made to the social security system to accommodate the changes that we have seen in the labour market over time. The report talks about the need for growth. It suggests that the economy needs to grow at about 4.5 to five pe(.cent a year between now and the year 2000 to reduce unemployment to around five per cent. It suggests that, were to grow at the current rate of around 3.5 per cent, unemployment would fall only to around seven per cent. Then the report catalogues the things the economy would need to do, and how policy will need to respond to be able to run the economy at the 4.5 to five per cent rate. Those things include the pressures labour market, the pressures on inflation and the current account deficit, the need for a greater capital stock to handle imports and the Training. need for flexibility in the labour market to handle price stability. It is a very comprehensive report. It is one which portends the building of a more flexible labour market on the changes which the government has already introduced with enterprise bargaining and the historic changes introduced by my colleague the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith who has piloted the government's labour market changes through this House, and through the Senate last night. These labour market changes will give more flexibility to those people covered by federal awards, and that flexibility will brought into the labour market by both the full enterprise bargaining stream and the award variation stream in ways which will mean that we have a more flexible labour market. There is a view around-and we hear it all the time-that the best way of making the labour market more flexible and to create more jobs is to cut the price of labour. The report says-and I think the government would agree-that it is better that we attack the problem of the long-term unemployed with labour market programs and specific assistance rather than reduce the whole community's wage levels to try to achieve the same thing. Even if it were to succeed, the jobs it would create would not go to the people who actually need them-the long term unemployed. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Committee on Employment Opportunities for serving on the committee. I will record who they are: the chair, Dr Michael Keating, Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; Mr A.S Blunn, Secretary to the Departwe ment of Social Security; Professor Jan Carter, the professor of social work at the University of Melbourne; Professor Bob Gregory, professor of economics at the research school of social sciences at the ANU; Professor Barry Hughes, professor of economics at the University of Newcastle; Ms Mary-Anne on the 0' Loughlin, senior adviser to me in my office; and Mr Derek Volker, Secretary to the Department of Employment, Education and I thank those people most sincerely for a comprehensive, thoughtful and well written report done very expeditiously in a very short period from May until November. I assure them that their report will be considered by the government. It will reappear as a white paper for further public discussion. The key point is for the consensus that has existed amongst all Australians for full employment to be made clear for people to understand and comprehend the issues in a commitment to full employment and that that commitment and the commitment to bear down on unembe ployment are ones which can make this report a success in terms of its conversion to public policy. I table the document and the issues brief which accompanies it. I have much pleasure in so doing. Community Grants ' Mr RONALDSON-My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sports and Territories and concerns the sports rorts issue. I refer the minister to the fact that she personally granted the Hurstville council $250,000 in 1991-92 for an aquatic leisure centre in the electorate of Watson. I also refer the minister to the fact that the same project received, another $200,000 in 1992-93, making a total of $450,000. Why did the minister wilfully breach program guideline 3.4 which states, 'The maximum Commonwealth grant available for any project is $250,000.'? Is it a fact that the first portion of the total grant was approved on the basis of an internal feasibility study only and, further, that when the application was lodged that feasibility study had not even been undertaken?",44

But the guidelines state that $250,000 is the maximum grant for each round. Taxation Laws: Compliance",46
62,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Assistant Treasurer. Is the minister aware of claims that the cost to companies of complying with the taxation laws is estimated to be as much as $1 billion per annum and as high as 10 per cent of the total revenue raised by some taxes? Can the minister inform the House whether it is possible for companies to lower compliance costs? Is the minister also aware of claims that 96 per cent of companies spend more in complying with tax regulations than they pay in company tax? Are these claims true?,46
63,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of a study by the Australian Taxation Research Foundation that allegedly shows that costs, such as complying with the FBT, are around 10 per cent. I remind honourable members here that the fringe benefits tax was introduced as an equity measure to ensure that the tax paid on remuneration packages-a combination of cash and other benefits, such as cars, travel, payment of mortgages and school fees-was the same as if the remuneration package were cash only. As such, it is a voluntary tax. The government does not tell companies how they should remunerate their executives or anybody else. If they choose to give fringe benefits instead of cash, they pay the fringe benefits tax. It is obvious to anybody here that, if they give small fringe benefits, the cost of recording them and paying the tax on them increases along with their complexity. Of course, if companies are in this situation and wish to lower their compliance cos- they can do it quite easily by cashing out the fringe benefits. I would also like to look at the methodology employed by the Australian Taxation Research Foundation. I am advised by the Taxation Office that it is not realistic. In actual fact, it is .a postal survey. As such, the responses are usually based on perceptions and recollections rather than recorded facts. I would compare that with the household expenditure survey where accurate records are kept. The point I am making here is that the household expenditure survey is an accurate reflection of the costs that are measured, whereas the methodology used by the Australian Taxation Research Foundation can only ever be a general guide. As far as the second part of the question is concerned, I am aware of claims made that about 96 per cent of companies incur greater compliance costs than tax costs. The simple fact is that that is an outrageous allegation that nobody here would believe. There is only one person in this House who would make such an allegation and, of course, that is the honourable member for Mayo. That would not surprise many people around here. In fact, at an address to the Kenmore branch of the Liberal Party, the honourable member had this to say: For example, approximately 96 per cent of companies spend more complying with taxation regulations than they pay in company tax to the Australelectorate Ian Taxation Office. Of course, that is absolutely untrue. In actual fact, the report did not say that. The honourable member for Mayo has either mistaken 'actual' for 'average' or he has deliberately misquoted the report. In fact, a conference on compliance costs was held here in Canberra a couple of weeks ago. When the authors of this report were given the interpretation put on their report by the honourable member for Mayo, they said that it was wrong. Just to explain the concept a little, it may well be that just to show the difference between average and actual-this is for illustrative purposes only-we may say that the average IQ of the front-bench over there is 50. We cannot say that everyone there has an IQ of 50-it may well be that Tim's is 100but the difference is stark.",46
64,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Certainly no more.,47
65,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It would certainly be no more, as the Prime Minister says. I thought I was being very generous. The honourable member has either misunderstood it or has deliberately misused the report. He was ungracious enough to say in his address to the Kenmore branch of the Liberal Party-not that it would have made much difference-that 60 per cent of companies do not pay any tax at all. That would have affected the averages that he used. Once again, the honourable member for Mayo has been caught fiddling with statistics to suit what is an incorrect assertion. A couple of weeks ago, I had to pull him up when he made the assertion that millionaires paid less taxation in percentage terms than people on $40,000. At that time, he left out the fact that people on high incomes receive a lot of their income from shares and so he left out the tax paid through the imputation system. At that time, I said that it was incompetence. But, if he keeps this up, I think we might change that charge to deception. Community Grants",47
66,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I ask the minister whether she can explain the fact that, in the of Watson, a project received in excess of $250,000 when her own guidelines state: . The maximum Commonwealth grant available for any project is $250,000. How does she explain this in view of the Auditor-General's finding on page 15 of the report where he gives a case study of a payment, in excess of the program limit, which went to $350,000? I ask whether she still stands by what she said to the Auditor General on page 11 of the report: ... selection decisions were made personally by the Minister in order to protect public servants criticism ...",47
67,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The decisions were made by me as the minister because I have responsibility, as portfolio minister, for this program and for other programs within my portfolio. On the question of grants and guidelines, let me explain the process to those opposite once again, as I have done in speeches to this parliament before. At the moment that program is finished. We will now look at the renewal of that in the context of the next budget. Every time there is a round of grants we call for applications.· The application is part of Appendix 1 of the Auditor-General's report. It clearly outlines that grants for projects with a total cost of over $50,000 will be available on a one-for-one contribution. In other words, the federal government, through this grants scheme, would put in $1 and, for amounts over $50,000, the club, the association, the local government or the state government would have to match that. But the total amount that the federal government, through this scheme, can contribute in any one round is. $250,000. That does not preclude any club or association from applying during the next round of grants. The Hurstville council has been mentioned. This one refers to another project called AItone Park. There may well be others, because each time they are looked at in their own right. In relation to determining grants, I would like to follow up some of the points raised earlier about the whole question of needs based funding. Yesterday, the honourable member for Fadden asked me a specific question about grants, which I would like to follow through to give him some idea of how these are assessed. Yesterday, the honourable member for Fadden asked me about an application by the Logan City Council for improvements to Underwood Park. He asked why the application was not approved, and he compared it to a successful application by the Mount Gravatt Workers Club. Undoubtedly, the honourable member is correct in saying that Logan City is a high need area. That is why the government provided substantial support for it. As I pointed out to the House yesterday, one of the factors I take into from account is the need for reasonably even geographic distribution of grants. It is therefore more relevant to compare the application referred to by the honourable member with the other applications in the Logan City area. The application referred to by the honourable member for Fadden was to assist the local council to install lights, sprinklers and seating on the ground. The application was fairly average-it was one of six applications for which the honourable member for Fadden wrote letters of support. In none of those letters did the honourable member give me any indication that he believed that this application should have a higher priority than any other that he supported. One of the successful applicants in the Logan City area was the Logan City Junior Rugby Union Club in the electorate of the honourable member for Fadden, which the honourable member also wrote in and supported. This club was given assistance to build a number of facilities, including change rooms, toilets, et cetera. It was a very good application which was rated highly by me and my department. Incidentally, this club was the subject of an earlier question in this place by the honourable member for Higgins. He wondered why this club received only $19,870, when a neighbouring club was granted $95,000. The honourable member implied that there was some discrimination. As the honourable member for Fadden knew, the club got only $19,870 because it applied for only $19,870. It was a bit difficult to provide $90,000 when the club had not applied for it! Also, in the Logan City area another two grants totalling $112,210 were awarded to two organisations, both of which will provide important new facilities in the area, providing new recreational opportunities and employment. Over the last couple of weeks a clear theme has flowed through a number of accusations made by opposition members about this program: they obviously believe that assistance should not be given to groups which have access to licensed clubs with poker machines or groups with which members of political parties are affiliated. I wish to remind honourable members of these points because I now want to return to the specific application so strongly supported by the honourable member for Fadden. application was put in by the local council; however, I understand the main tenant of the ground mentioned by the honourable member is a major local soccer club. I also understand that this is a rather wealthy club which large poker machine infested clubhouse adjacent to the ground. I am also informed that one of the most prominent Liberal councillors-indeed, one person told me the most prominent Liberal the area-is actually a member of the manAgrifood agement committee of the club, as well as being a member of the council which applied for funding. I am not implying any wrongant doing in this. It simply seems at odds with pious position taken by the opposition House in the past. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I ask the minister to table the ments from which she was quoting, which show that she has more records than she has cared to admit today.",48

72,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy inform the House of the The steps that are being taken to promote Australia's clean food exports into Asia.,49
73,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There have been many successful initiatives under the auspices has a of the Agrifood Council over the past 18 months which have seen significant improvement in high value added processed food products exported from this country. Indeed, the value of those products has increased by in 50 per cent over the last two years. The Council, which the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development and I jointly chair, has been an importcatalyst for bringing together the key the players in the industry as well as giving a in the focus to the export opportunities. Today, I am happy to inform the House of two new initiatives. One is the establishment docuof a joint government-industry company to promote the clean food concept, to develop the logo, to get industry support for that logo and to ensure the integrity of the quality of products that contain that logo. This company has directors from the NFF and from the manufacturers. I am happy to advise the House that Dr John Keniry, recently of Goodman Fielder WaUie, has agreed to chair has this committee. It will give important added not focus to this significant initiative. The other thing that occurred yesterday was the commencement of television advertisements in Taiwan to promote the clean food program. This is a pilqt program that is funded dollar for dollar by the government and the private sector. Depending upon its success it will form the basis for extended If the activity at a later stage. Mr Tim Fischer-Even in Malaysia?",49
74,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Even in Malaysia. It is important to advise the House that it is not is only the large companies that are signing up under this strategy-it is not just companies like Kelloggs, Goodman Fielder Wattie, et cetera-but it is also the small companies and groupings within regions which are getting behind this strategy. 1\'10 important examples are the Hartz mineral water company from Tasmania, which now exports 30 per cent of what it produces. From the perspective of the regional focus, the producers of cherries from Young have grouped together in a consortium to export their product into the Taiwanese market. These are both great examples of how regions can respond to the strategy as well as small companies, by identifying what their particular strengths are in the food area-be they in horticulture, dairy, grains, beef, you name it-and how they can get behind this strategy and secure a stronger future for their base within their region. I think all honourable members should welcome these initiatives and take note of what this government has been able to achieve yet again by working with industry to expand our export opportunities and to grow jobs in regional Australia. Taxation: Cuts MI'1>OWNER-My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer to the fact that the government promised Australians at the time of the last election $8 billion worth of tax cuts. I remind the Treasurer that $5 billion of those tax cuts were abandoned effectively in this year's budget. Is it a fact that the jobs proposed in the green paper on employment would take away the last $3 billion of tax cuts promised at the last election? MI' DAWKINS-The answer is no. Regional Development MI' GIBSON-Can the Prime Minister tell the House when the government expects to receive the report of the task force on regional development? Can he say what approach the government will take in considering the report and whether this may involve any departure from the usual caucus and cabinet processes?",49
75,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government expects to receive the report early next week. It will be the second milestone report we will have received in a week-that is, the report from the Committee on Employment Opportunities, Restoring full employment; and the one on regional development. It has been a characteristic of the government, given its long tenure in office, that it has been able to tackle long running issues in a systematic way. As we have done this across the great realms of policy-economic policy, taxation policy, social policy, health policy and education policy, et cetera-we are taking the opportunity to do it again in respect of regional development and regional employment so that we do run, as we have said on this side of the House many times, an inclusive policy where people in all regions of Australia feel that they are part of what is happening in the nation. So much of the verve and vigour of the country resides in rural and provincial areas, and we want to be able to involve these people in the development of policy so that the benefits of the economy flow to these areas and to these communities. But our processes will be the same processes we nonnally employ-that is, cabinet committees and the full cabinet, as well as the processes of the caucus of the parliamentary Labor Party. In other words, we will go through these things in a systemic and systematic way. I might say that this is in contradistinction to the Liberal Party which is now proposing to hold some sort of seminar in early January tax where it will not be looking at the big issues of health, industrial relations, regional development, unemployment or native title, but where it will be looking at world competitive individuals and teams in business, sport and other areas. The seminar will have four sessions-one of which will do that. The second session is a discussion and group presentation looking at specific team and individual factors which might help or hinder the Liberal Party and 'a critical assessment of our current position within the party' having regard to these factors. The third session is on personal perfonnance-a series of practical activities on perfonnance management, in particular focusing on the ability to communicate a vision in simple, practical language. The fourth session is on the psychology of the enemy-what to focus on, how to create imbalance in the enemy and capitalising on errors and opportunities. There will be a screening of slides of individuals, including me, and people will look at them and work out what this does to their psychology. Participants are required to recognise the enemy. On this side of the House we do not have any problems in doing that-we do it intuitively; it is bred into us. Honourable members over there will have to have this session and participants are required to recognise the enemy. They will have sporting psychologists around to talk to them. One of these is a world champion in lacrosse, shooting, archery and trampolining and there will be a talk about this. The interesting thing is that this is being organised by the honourable member for Indi, the honourable member for Isaacs, the honourable member for Adelaide and the honourable member for Moncrieff and it is widely regarded as the 'Save Hewie's Leadership' session. A lot of people have signalled that they are not going. These include the honourable member for Flinders, the honourable member for Barker, Senator Vanstone, the honourable member for Forrest, the honourable member for Deakin, the honourable member for Ryan and many others. So there is great trouble afoot. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Mr Beazley interjecting Mr Andrews-I know who the enemy is, Kim, do not worry. This may be highly amusingGovernment members-It is!",50
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member is entitled to be heard. Mr Andrews-The question to the Prime Minister from the honourable member was on a serious subject and was about the way in which his regional task force was going to carry out its activities. For the last three minutes, the Prime Minister has gone off on this folly which may amuse the backbenchers on the Labor side but is treating question in a way which is disrespectful to the House. Mr Speaker, I ask you to bring him back to the question.",51
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister, as indeed was indicated, was asked a question on regional development and processes. I gather that the Prime Minister is endeavouring to illustrate processes, but I invite him to come back to the substance.",51
78,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I can assure you that the government will not be departing from the usual caucus and cabinet processes in considering how it deals with major public issues in the year ahead, whereas the Leader of the Opposition is saying, - A top program has been put together and details are attached. To reach our goal of government, a party conference has been planned'Mr Tuckey interjecting",51

82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Banks is probably not helping.,51
83,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a leadership problem afoot in the opposition, and we can see this from the non-attendees and the cheer group organising this little session-the empty-of-policy focus on all of this stuff about personal performance and psychology. Those over there will not make it until they come to terms with the core reasons for their failure over five elections. No amount of talk about psychology or personal performances and visions and putting slides up of me or other people are going to help them with their problem. They have got basically a leader who cannot cut the mustard. They are now basically deciding how they can be rid of him. They are having a cheer squad meeting on one weekend to try to cheer him up. Good on you! But I can assure them that the way basically to do the government in is 1,10t by looking at pictures of me, feigning indignation about the enemy or recognising us but getting down to a bit of good old policy formulation time and consideration, as the government has done regularly for a decade and, as this report today and next week shows, we are going to continue to do. Employment: Green Paper",51
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Are the measures contained in the green paper, especially the proposal to impose a jobs tax, not the price the Australian electorate has to pay for the government's gutless refusal to reform the Australian 'industrial .relations system?",52
85,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad that the honourable member has asked me this question because quite a bit deals with the issue of wages which, fundamentally, the industrial relations formulation of those opposite is primarily directed at. A couple of points need to be made about that. There is no doubt at all that there is a relationship between employment and wages; we would not dispute that. But the whole thrust of government policy in the industrial relations area over last 10 years has basically been dealing with the opposition's incompetent management of that when it was in government in the late 1970s and early 1980s where it cut loose with its crazy propositions and massive surge in wages. In fact, there has been a 10 per cent correction in real wages over the last 10 years. The point about this report is that it simply feeding off situations which have developed in this country but also dealing with a phenomenon that is common throughout the Western world, and that is a higher and higher percentage of those who are in unemployment finding themselves long-term unemployed and not capable of participation in the labour market. If the honourable member were to actually comprehend and attempt to deal with that point, he would have to acknowledge the fact that they face exactly the same problem in Britain. Is the honourable member's position that Maggie Thatcher's industrial relations policies were inappropriate and therefore brought about that situation? Or is he prepared to concede that there are structural changes in the work force and massive requirements now on those who wish to prepare themselves for entry into that work force to gain skills which permit them to participate? The Liberals are now the only conservative party in the world that cannot get to grips with that. If one were to talk to the British chancellor now and look at the statements he is making about employment in OECD countries, one would find that he is saying that growth is not enough. Growth will not deal with employment problems. We require active labour market measures in order to be able to deal with them. If one goes to the conservatives in Germany, the conservatives running Sweden or the conservatives running France, one finds that they all have disagreements with their social democratic counterparts as to how unemployment problems should be dealt with, but all of them come through. The United States government is looking at our labour market programs to find ways in which it might implement some of those the propositions when dealing with unemployment in the United States. Of course, the reason why there is some degree of difference between us and the United States with regard to unemployment is that period between 1979 and 1982 when wage movements in the United States got out of kilter with those in Australia. Since then it has to be said that there have been corrections in Australia which have dealt, to some degree, with that problem. is not But who was directly responsible then for those particular changes-the sorts of changes that the honourable member is now encouraging? Since then, the trade union movement has been prepared to exercise a degree of discipline over wage claims and respond totally differently to issues in the work force. It has been concerned about unemployment in ways in which the honourable member· for Bennelong was not concerned at that time. He masquerades in this place as the saviour of industrial relations. Whenever a point like this is made we get this juvenile patter from the pale knight vainly loitering-or the vain knight palely loitering, if his little performance in January is taken into account. We get this meaningless gibberish from the Leader of the Opposition across the table because of course he was the meretricious player who was advising the honourable member for Bennelong on his stupid wages and industrial policies back in 1979 and 1982. Mr Howard interjecting",52
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong will have his chance.,53
87,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What we confront in this country-apart from the massive babble from the opposition benches-is the situation that is now being confronted in the Western world for a whole series of structural reasons. When the honourable member for Bennelong and I were kids, 65 per cent of those in the classroom with us left school in year 10 and did not skill themselves or go on to university. They now find themselves in a situation where some 80 per cent of the jobs being created in affairs now require a year 12 standard of education or better. There are massive requirements on skilling the population. If those requirements are not met, those who do not acquire those skills do not get work. That is all there is to it. They cease to be job ready and there are higher and higher unemployment levels. Bottlenecks occur in the labour market and there are inflationary pressures and all the rest of it. If there is one central element of this paper that ought to be understood-because it is a far more sophisticated paper than its preliminary publicity gives it credit for-it is that is fundamentally not about job creation. It is not a job creation paper. It is a paper dealing with job readiness and allowing people who are now unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed, to participate effectively in the work force and get themselves back into employment. It is absolutely and quintessentially with what the Prime Minister said after the last election. He said he would extend an arm to the unemployed and enable them to have an opportunity to participate in society. If the problem of long-term unemployment is not dealt with, we will experience those bottlenecks at something like seven per cent or eight per cent unemployment. There will be enormous pressure on wages and inflation as a result of that inefficiency in the job market and the cycle will recur, with unemployment at higher and higher levels. As I said before, we are not Robinson Crusoe. Countries governed by parties like ours-and like the Liberal Party in everything but IQ-have experienced exactly the same propositions and problems that we are experiencing now. And, except for those opposite, all of us have come to the same conclusion on how to deal with them. Mabo Legislation",53
88,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the minister aware of reports concerning opposition to certain aspects of native title legislation which would have the effect of causing uncertainty and insecurity to the farming community? What action has the minister taken to overcome these concerns?,53
89,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Yesterday in this House I was asked a question by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia which expressed concerns of the rural sector in relation to our Mabo legislation. I was interested in the quote that the deputy leader referred to and went back to find out where he got it from. He got it from a press release issued by the NFF that supported our Mabo legislation but-wait for it-it was a press release issued three months ago. It might take it the deputy leader that long to get into the queue to ask a question, but I want to refer today to a more recent concern that the NFF has raised. I refer to a memo dated today that has been sent to the executive committee, the chief executive officers of member bodies and the Aboriginal affairs committee of the NFF. The memo says: NFF has been negotiating with the Government for in line amendments in two key areas: To ensure that there is no problem with the renewal of valid pastoral leases ... To provide an exclusion for pastoral leases under clause 208(3), which now automatically converts any statutoryreservation of native interest to native title. This is particularly important to SA, WA and the NT . The memo goes on to say-and the honourable member for Barker should take note of this: The Greens will not support our amendments. The Democrats will not oppose our amendments, as this is not sought by the Aboriginal negotiating team. The ... team is sticking to the agreement negotiated with NFF and the Government. Paragraph 7 of this memo says-and this is the point that all of those in the opposition should take note of: However, the Opposition party room yesterday decided as a matter of 'strategy' to oppose all amendments. Their reasoning apparently is that no amendments will make the legislation acceptable, so that they will oppose the bill and amendments. The Opposition's tactics once again give the whip hand to the Greens. Then, in a personal plea, the NFF wrote a letter to the Leader of the Opposition. The letter says: The Government has agreed to our requests and a similar request from AMICagain those whom the opposition comes and expresses mock indignation for and amendments in .these areas will be put to the Senate. We are anxious that they should be carried by the Senate... The amendments therefore will not be carried in the Senate without Opposition supporthaving gone through the scenario of the Greens positionI noteand this is the President of the NFF, Mr Graham Blightthat the Opposition has made a tactical decision to oppose all amendments. This is of great concern to NFF and our constituent member bodies. The likely effect would be to enable passage of amendments supported by the Greens and the Democrats,. but prevent passage of amendments opposed by the Greens. Clearly, amendments proposed by NFF, AMIC and the State Governments of NSW, VIC and QLD are likely to fall into this latter category. NFF would find it astonishing if the opposition allowed this scenario to unfold ... the Opposition's actions would be against the interests of the farm sector, and presumably against the interests of the mining industry... NFF strongly urges the Opposition to support Government amendments negotiated with us ... These amendments are consistent with numerous statements made by Opposition Members in recent weeks. There we have it, and I hope that the National Party in particular takes note of this. There is no point in members of the National Party coming in here trying to dismiss the NFF concerns and saying that we have not taken account of them when the NFF has actually written to the Leader of the Opposition and told him precisely what it wants. The trouble with members of the opposition-and particularly the National Party-is that it is led· by the cabal of the honourable member for Barker; the honourable member for Flinders, who I note is no longer here; and the Leader of the Opposition-the ideologue, the spoiler and Dr No. Dr No can only say 'no' to anything constructive that this government puts forward. That constructive position is supported by the NFF, but those in the coalition will not take any notice. The reality is that the NFF will take no notice of those opposite in future and nor should it. So far as it is concerned, it knows what to get from this government and how to get it. We have delivered for the NFF, and those opposite are the ones who are opposing it. I say simply to the coalition: take note of what the NFF has said if it really has concern for the NFF. Get behind this legislation and support it.",53

92,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am happy to table the letter and the memorandum. It might enable the Deputy Leader of the National Party to get his next question ready-three months in advance-for March next year. NA Sexist Language,54
93,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have a question for you about what consideration you might give to eliminating the use of sexist language in this House. In recent weeks, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has had some fairly aggressive questioning from this side of the House-and quite properly so, given the circumstances. First of all, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training made quite a wrong accusation against the honourable member for Higgins, suggesting that he, in turn, had made a sexist remark. Today we have had the Prime Minister accuse members on this side of the House of interjecting loudly purely because the minister is a woman. If we. are to have fair play in this House we will have to do without that sort of discrimination and without the use of sexist language. I am wondering how members in this place may be educated to that end, and I ask you to do something about it.",54
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,The honourable member for Adelaide raises a valid point in respect the use of language in this place-whether it be sexist or other language that is remarked upon by the chair from time to time. I again say to all honourable members that they should be very careful in their use of language in this place,55
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,You'll notice that the prime offender is not here to hear you.,55
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The honourable member for Bennelong! I do not need you to talk while I am talking, thank you. Again, I say to all members that the responsibility for the language they use ultimately rests with them. Tabling of Documents  ask a question of you. It relates to your interpretation of, or the method that you use to interpret, standing order 321-the quoting from documents. Today when I raised this question-as did, I think, the Leader of the National Party of Australia-in regard to the minister for sport and everything else quoting from a document, you asked her whether she was quoting from the document and she said no. I do understand that method. It is a method of interpretation that has been used for some time now in the House. What concerns me is that, unless that method of interpretation is changed, the standing order regarding the quoting and tabling of documents is rendered nebulous. There was patently clear oral and visual evidence of the minister reading extensively throughout that answer, and you were bound to accept her answer that in fact she was not. We were tied to a position where we could do little more than move against you, and you were in fact practising a method of interpretation which has been used and which I believe should be changed. If standing order 321 is to mean anything, I would ask you to reconsider the method whereby you interpret that standing order. Mr SPEAKER:-The honourable member for Kooyong quite clearly explained the difficulty that the chair has in this respect. I would think there are two approaches that can be adopted: one is that the standing order be re-examined-anq that is a matter for the of Standing Committee on Procedure-and the second, which quite clearly is within the realm of the chair, is for me to take some advice and look at the matter quite closely.

100,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,55
101,Mr ANDERSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) claimed a moment ago in an answer to a question from his own backbench that I had quoted from a three-month old NFF press release in a question that I put to him yesterday,and that it was therefore irrelevant and not an indication of the NFF's current position. In fact, I was quoting from the Farmers Voice of November 1993, which was released just last week as an insert in rural press publications around the country. The fact is that the· NFF plainly still does have major c()ncems with the government's approach, and I hope that the minister will now be big enough to apologise for his misrepresentation.",55

105,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,56
106,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do-grievously.,56
107,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,56
108,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,During question time the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) claimed that I had saidMr Snowdon interjecting,56
109,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,You should go back to Tennant Creek to the dog show.,56
110,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory!,56
111,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, this is sad. I was talking about the Assistant Treasurer during question time. During question time the Assistant TreasurerA government member-And you should go back to the doll's house.",56
112,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The minister might also cease interjecting.,56
113,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Assistant Treasurer claims that I had said in a speech in Brisbane that approximately 96 per cent of companies spend more in complying with taxation regulations than they pay in company tax to the Australian Taxation Office and that Australian businesses spend up to 11 times more than. companies in the United Kingdom in complying with direct tax obligations. He went on to claim not only that I said thatwhich is true, actually",56
114,Unknown,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Government members interjecting,56
115,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am just about to tell you why. He went on to claim that what I had said was manifestly false and was not based on any evidence. As a matter of fact, what I said was based on a paper by Jeff Pope of the Department of Economics at Curtin University and Ric.hard Fayle of the Department of Accounting and Finance at the University of Western Australia-both in Perth, coincidentally-who said that 96 per cent of companies on average incur higher compliance costs than they remit in income tax. That is precisely the point I made. I was grievously misrepresented by the Assistant Treasurer.",56
116,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member has now shown where he was misrepresented.,56
117,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have a further personal explanation on an entirely different matter. At one stage during question time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) interjected in the debate during the answer to a question given by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). I interjected while the minister was giving an answer and you warned me, Mr Speaker, at that time. The Prime Minister then said that whenever the minister is on her feet people in the opposition have a callous view that they can shout a woman down. It is perfectly clear that the Prime Minister was referring in that case, inter alia, to me as I w-s one of the people interjecting. This was a grossly sexist remark made by the Prime Minister, who is using sexist tactics to try to defend a failed minister who ought to have resigned weeks ago, and it is a gross offence for him to say that sort of thing. The Prime Minister is sexist.",56

121,Mr CLEARY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes.,56
122,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member may proceed.,56
123,Mr CLEARY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yesterday the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) made a generic statement about the effect of the postal ban of the Communication Workers Union on members of this House. I am in receipt of a letter from the CWU which contradicts the statement made by the honourable memberOpposition members-Where have you been misrepresented?,56
124,Mr CLEARY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Just listen until I finish. You are one of the black-banned; I am not. The letter says: Given the level of support we are now receiving from some Victorian Mps, and encouraging reports from interstate, I am pleased to say that I will be making representations at the national level of our . organisation for the limitations to be lifted delivery of mail to politicians who have given a commitment in writing to defend our national postal service. So not all honourable members are affected or will be affected by the ban, as was implied by the right honourable member for New England.",56

127,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,57
128,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,57
129,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Like the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), I admit openly to having interjected during an answer being given by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). As a result of that interjection, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) rose and made the totally false, cowardly, sexist and erroneous claim that we on our side of the House",57
130,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Mr SPEAKER ,57
131,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,No. He started this.,57

134,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member will resume his seat.,57
135,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The honourable member lives in a world of his own. My point of order, Mr Speaker, is that a personal explanation goes very specifically to where a person has been personally misrepresented. The person states the misrepresentation and corrects it without directing any epithets at anybody else. In neither this case nor the previous one has that been observed.",57
136,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,This is what the Prime Minister said: ... it cannot be a coincidence that the cacophony of voices which comes from the opposition comes on the whenever the minister is on her feet. That is totally wrong. There is no cacophony of voices.,57
137,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! The minister and the honourable member for Bennelong will resume their seats., The honourable member for Bennelong is now taking this to an extreme degree, in ,my view. The point has already been made by the honourable member for Mayo. The honourable member for Bennelong is endeavouring to use this point to take it a step further. We have got the message and, as far as I am concerned, the matter stops there. NA",57
138,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"On 13 December the honourable member for Bennelong raised as a matter of privilege actions taken to withhold mail services from the offices of honourable members. Yesterday the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) also drew my attention to a media release issued by the Communication Workers Union on 13 December. I have also had representations from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). The basic position in relation to contempt is that actions found to amount to, or to be intended or likely to amount to, improper interference with the free performance by honourable members of their duties as members can be found to be contempts. The honourable member for Bennelong mentioned two precedents of similar complaints having been raised, one in 1988 and one in 1985. In neither case was precedence given to a motion. I have to advise the House, however, that, on the information available to me, the actions complained of by the honourable member for Bennelong were directed quite specifically at honourable members and would have been affecting their capacity to perform their duties as members. I had concluded that a prima facie case existed and, accordingly, that I would be justified in allowing precedence to a motion. However, I am pleased to be able to report that I have been infonned that, first, nonnal mail services to and from Parliament House are to be resumed on the afternoon of Thursday, 16 December 1993 and, second, that all mail to the electorate offices of federal politiyour cians is to be released by members immediately upon receipt of a union branch circular. Opposition members-That is tomorrow.",57
139,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I know what it is. I am just reporting. In the circumstances, I suggest that it may suit the interests of honourable members if no further action is taken at this stage on the complaint in order that the apparent resolution of the problem can proceed.",58
140,Mr HOWARD,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, with your indulgence: I appreciate the thought that you have given to this matter and I do not wish this comment to be misunderstood. I certainly agree with the conclusion that you have reached. Quite plainly this ban was directed specifically at members of parliament. I have to say, as the person who raised this matter, that I am not prepared to accept that the matter rests at that. I think there is an important issue of principle involved. I am not aware that the doctrine of privilege operates on the basis that, no matter what has happened in the past, once it is stopped that is it. That may be relevant to penalty and to damages, as it is in relation to many matters that appear before the courts, but the concept is that one can put a ban on members of parliament, blackmail the perfonnance of their duties and then, as soon as it is finished, say, 'Let's forget about all of that'. A lot of people in the community would like that kind of privilege and that kind of benefit extended to their conduct. I am speaking ad hoc, but I am certain that my colleagues would strongly support me on this matter. We are simply not prepared to accept that, simply because the industrial dispute is, conveniently, going to end tomorrow afternoon, that should tenninate any consideration of this matter as a breach of privilege. It was a breach of privilege when it was put on; it is still a breach of privilege. The fact that it is ending tomorrow is no excuse.",58
141,Mr LIEBERMAN,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I wish to comment on the same matter. I listened with interest to ruling and I certainly agreed with you when you said that you believed that a prima facie case had been established. In respect of the second part of your ruling, I believe that",58
142,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I have not given a ruling.,58
143,Mr LIEBERMAN,PRIVILEGE,"I refer then to your comments. I believe that the nature and extent of the prima facie breach of privilege is one that goes to the very tenets of the successful operation of our democracy and the work and perfonnance of elected members of parliament from both sides. I have some difficulty in saying what I want to say because I am a member of the privileges <;:ommittee and I want to indicate that I am trying to keep an open mind. Nevertheless, I feel that it is in the interests of the parliament and the nation that this matter be investigated by the committee. If anyone has concerns about what I have just said, I naturally will not sit on that committee of inquiry. I feel very strongly that it is time for a parliamentary committee to examine these sorts of actions and to report back to parliament so that people know what it thinks about the sort of behaviour that prevents constituents-not members of parliament-from communicating their concerns to their elected members. I think that is absolutely fundamental to the success of our democracy, and, of course, it is fundamental to the operation of the parliament. Mr Speaker, I have great respect for your position and the way in which you deal with it. I therefore ask that you give consideration to reviewing the matter between now and tomorrow and to allowing a few more hours consideration for what I regard as a matter vital to the successful operation of the people's parliament.",58
144,Mr HOWARD,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, with your indulgence again: could I inquire of you whether you will accept from me a motion, or give precedence to a motion from me, to refer this matter to the committee of privileges?",58
145,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"As I said in the statement Australian that I read, I have concluded that a prima facie case exists and, accordingly, I would be 1992-93. justified in allowing precedence to a motion. But I went on to suggest, in view of pending lifting of the bans, that it might suit the interests of honourable members that further action be taken. That in no way inhibits members of this place from moving a motion. Motion (by Mr Howard) agreed to: That the matter of bans by the Communications Workers Union on the delivery and despatch of mail articles from the offices of Members be referred to the Committee of Privileges.

NA NA The following bill was returned from the Senate without amendment or requests: Industrial Relations Court (Judges' Remuneration) Bill 1993 NA Unemployment",59
148,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the employment green paper to address the industrial relations cause of high unemployment. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",60
149,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Today there was tabled in the parliament, and therefore made available to the nation, a very important report which goes under the very adventurous and optimistic title of Restoring full employment. I would like to sayan behalf of the opposition that, if ever there were an objective that ought to enjoy the bipartisanindeed the widespread-support of honourable members on both sides of the House, it ought to be the objective of restoring full employment. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced a few months ago that he was going to have an investigation by way of the preparation of a green paper into the question of restoring full employment in Australia, I am sure that every honourable member on this side of the parliament hoped against hope that it would be a genuine attempt to examine the causes of the fact that Australia has one of the worse unemployment records in the industrialised world. I think all of us hoped that this would be a serious examination of the problem. I think all of us hoped that what members of the government might for once do about this appalling social disaster was to put everything on the table, to forget the political and industrial cabal to which they are the perpetual hostages-in other words, the leadership of the trade union movement of this coun.try-and for once in their lives honestly address why Australia had a level of unemployment of 1l.1 per cent, why Australia's unemployment level was almost five per cent greater than that of the United States, and why Australia's unemployment level was almost two per cent higher than what it was in New Zealand. Do honourable members remember New Zealand? New Zealand was the country that honourable members opposite held up as a laboratory example of failed industrial relations policies. Mr Brereton tnterjecting",60
150,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister interjects and he confirms the interjection. We thought for once that he might honestly address the question, why is it",61
151,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Don't you use the word honest.,61
152,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Is the minister a little embarrassed about the use of the word honest? If ever there were a bloke who ought to be embarrassed about the use of the word honest, it is the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) after his record in New South Wales politics. We on this side of the House thought that at long last the government was going to seriously address this problem and that we might get an answer to the intriguing question: why is it that the United States-which has been through the same recession as Australia and, indeed, has a far greater problem with its urban underclass than, thankfully, Australia has at present, bad though ours may be-has an unemployment rate of only 6.4 per cent? Why is it that the United States recovery long since ceased to be a jobless recovery? Why do we compare so badly with a nation that the government is pleased to make comparisons with whenever it pleases? We thought that at long last the government might look seriously at some of the reasons. The truth is that when it came to the crunch the one thing the government could not bring itself to do was to confront its trade union masters with their responsibility, duplicity and involvement in the creation of such a high level of unemployment in Australia. The terms of reference for the Committee on Employment Opportunities sound like a longrunning excuse for not saying anything rude about the ACTU. In his terms of reference, the Prime Minister said that he wanted the committee to. examine developments in the Australian labour market since the 1960s, including: demographic changes; changes in the labour force participation .. . changes in employment levels and patterns .. . changes in the types and location of jobs being created and lost; characteristics and location of unemployed ... the emergence of long-term unemployment; and the effect on income distribution and living standards of the changing patterns of employment and unemployment. There is nothing wrong with any of those terms of reference. However, the remarkable thing is not what was there but what was not there-Australia's ancient and decrepit industrial relations system. A very simple proposition tells the real truth about this green paper: a jobs tax will be the price that Australia has to pay for the gutlessness of this government's failure to address trade union power in the Australian industrial relations system. That is the bottom line of this green paper. One can strip away all of the rhetoric and the phoney concern. When it comes to the crunch, the government has been unwilling to embrace the fact and to confront the reality that the trade union dominated industrial relations system has done more to create high unemployment in Australia than any other structural cause. There are two major causes of high unemployment in Australia. Firstly, there was the Keating-caused recession-the recession we had to have-wherein one million people were thrown out of work because the Prime Minister was an incompetent Treasurer. Secondly, there is the fact that those one million people were shed by the hundreds of thousands of small businesses that were destroyed by that gentleman's high interest rates-the highest interest rates that this nation has ever suffered. The man has no shame. He offers no apology for what he has done and what he continues to do to the unemployed of this nation. He has no loyalty to the truth, when he makes false accusations of sexism against this side of the parliament. In 19 years as a member of parliament the performance of the Prime Minister at question time was as cowardly a performance as I have seen from a Prime Minister. That man knows that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is a lame duck minister. If the Prime Minister had any shred of decency, he would sack her but, because she is part of the imperial Keating court, he will not. He actually got up to make the phoney charge that we were shouting her down because she is a woman. How pathetic can he get! His lot are the very ones who lecture us about gender equality. Yet, when it comes to a proper response from our side of the House, simply because the minister happens to be a woman, the Prime Minister has the gall, the cheek and the nerve to ask us to keep quiet and to go lighter. The Prime Minister is a phoney. He does not believe in sexual equality-true equality; he believes in a new form of political and industrial elitism in Australia. Certain ministers-such as the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories-who are part of the power elite, part of Keating's royal family, are the lucky ones. The Prime Minister got up and protected the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories because she is part of Keating's royal family; she is part of the imperial court. Is that not amazing? The Minister for Industrial Relations is part of it as well. The Prime Minister will never drop him because the Prime Minister owes him a very big favour. It goes back 23 years, when the Minister for Industrial Relations ran away with the ballot box because he knew damn well that the Prime Minister had not really won preselection. If the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories is guilty of this so-called 'sports rorts', she learned her lesson very well at the knees of people like the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Prime Minister. The way they rorted the preselection procedure so many years ago will always dog them as an illustration of what a lot of political phoneys they really are. I return to the issue of full employment. What the government has really done with this report is to reveal its utter moral and political bankruptcy. Last Friday, I read quite by accident a paragraph in an article ,written by Laura Tingle in the Australian. I think it gave the whole game away. She said: There has been considerable speculation in Canberra that next week's jobs paper would attempt to avoid by omission any contentious industrial relations issues ... I repeat: .. , next week's jobs paper would attempt to avoid by omission any contentious industrial relations issues, .. All I can say is that Laura put her finger right on it. The members of that committee have done a yeoman job for the government. The members of that committee have well and truly delivered on the brief that was given to them by the Prime Minister. He said, 'Examine anything but industrial relations. Don't go into the industrial relations area, because if you do, you will come up against the fact that we support an industrial relations system that is driving hundreds of thousands of people out of jobs'. The only defence that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) had in parliament today was to trot out that tired old excuse that it was the policies of the Fraser government that caused people to lose their jobs in the early 1980s. The minister at the table would not have forgotten that famous piece of rhetoric of his mate the Prime Minister at the 1986 ALP conference in Hobart, when he was having a fairly vigorous exchange with George Campbell of the metalworkers union. He jumped up, got very florid, pointed at George and said, 'You have got 100,000 dead men hanging around your neck, George'. What he was referring to was the fact that during the recession of 1982 it was the rampaging of the metal unions that drove hundreds of thousands of people out of work. It was the responsibility of the very trade union movement that has cowed the government into inactivity on the jobs front that caused people to lose their jobs by the hundreds of thousands in those years; and they have done it again. They have silenced it again. They have bludgeoned it out of facing the reality that trade union monopoly and domination of the industrial relations system is the greatest single structural cause of high unemployment in Australia. The other cause, of course, is the recession we had to have-Keating's destructive, diabolical recession that heartlessly threw tens of thousands of people out of work and destroyed the livelihoods of thousands of decent, hard working small business men and women in this country. The man has no shame about that. The minister has absolutely no shame about the fact that he does not have the guts to tell the trade union movement to get off the backs of the million Australians who are out of wor.k. He does not have the guts to stand up to the people who are really calling the tune. He does not have the guts to say to the organ-grinders, 'Why don't you lay off the Australian people for a change?'. He does not have the guts to be honest that one of the reasons why we have an appallingly high rate of unemployment is that we have a union dominated industrial relations system. If we end up with a jobs tax, the government will have completed the job of destroying the taxation cuts on which it went to the last election. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) in question time pinpointed the fact that if we get a jobs levy there will not be a cent of the personal tax cuts left. cism. We know who the people of Australia will have to thank for that-the Keating-Kelty axis which has maintained an uncompetitive, unproductive industrial relations system. Is it not an incredible irony that at the moment we debate a document called Restoring full employment, on the very day on which the Prime Minister will wax lyrical over the airwaves of Australia, saying how he cares about the unemployed-he will wring his hands about the unemployed and say, 'Please believe me, I love the unemployed'on the very day on which that is being done, in another place more people are being put out of work, because at the moment in another place, at the instigation of the Minister for Industrial Relations, a bill is being passed that is going to increase unemployment in Australia. The minister's industrial relations bill will put thousands more Australians out of work. The minister's industrial relations bill will make the Australian labour market even more inflexible. His industrial relations bill will add to the cost of employing people. His industrial relations bill, in particular, will make it. more expensive and more complicated for small business to employ people. The only real hope. of the side in this country if we are to rebuild employment levels is the small business sector. The government will not rebuild employment through the large companies of Australia; it will not rebuild employment satisfactorily through the public sector. Employment will only be rebuilt if the constraints, the regulation, the barriers and the impediments that currently prevent small business from employing people are reduced. The government is going in the opposite direction. It is defying the submission of the Reserve Bank of Australia; it is defying the logic of 10 years of experience. It is once again cowering before the might of the trade union movement in Australia. The government may think it is slick and smart and that it ran a clever fear campaign; it may think it is slick and smart to smear and distort history and to rewrite what happened a few years ago, but in the long run the government will pay at the bar of public opinion for its cyniToday the government is pleading to be believed on unemployment, and all the while it is handing more power over to its union mates. It is throwing more and more thouvery sands of decent Australians out of work. The government's unemployment document is a disgrace, not because of the quality of people involved in it but because the government handed the committee loaded terms of reference. It said, 'Whatever you recommend, don't under any circums·tances say anything rude about Bill Kelty or Martin Ferguson'. (Time expired)",61

154,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Dh!,64
155,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"'Dh', the honourable member for Bennelong says-'Dh'. He comes here 10 years later and illustrates that he has learned nothing in the interim. Howabsolutely ironic it is that, as we wait in this House for the message from the Senate agree in& to the government's Industrial Relations Reform Bill, that we should have this farcical matter of public importance brought before the House. . We await the message from the Senate on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, which is a bill which will do more to revolutionise industrial relations than anything else since the Arbitration Act of 1904. The bill provides unlimited opportunities for freeing up the labour market. The bill provides for enterprise agreements to be available to all Australian working men and women, everyone under a federal award, whether they are in unions or not. The bill provides for the removal of a union veto over agreement making, the veto that has been so roundly criticised by employers' groups. The bill creates a whole new division of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, a division charged with the responsibility of doing everything it can to facilitate the making of enterprise agreements to provide more nexibility. At the same time the bill provides for the creation the new role of vice-president of the Australian Industrial Relations Comrriission to oversee the spreading of enterprise agreements right throughout the federal system. For the very first time the bill provides the lise of the corporations power of the Commonwealth to facilitate agreement making, to provide for agreement making in every individual enterprise covered by a federal award in this country. That power will be used for the first time, and I do not need to tell the honourable member for Bennelong about that because he has often bragged about the need to use the corporations power but, of course, in his day he never got around to using it. The bill provides for the elimination of all the restrictions of the conciliation and arbitration power that so frustrated the making of enterprise agreements on a single enterprise basis because of the need for an interstate dispute to have been created before there was jurisdiction to make such an agreement. The bill provides for a no disadvantage test to be applied to the totality of the work force in that enterprise and to be applied to the totality of the conditions of the work force in that enterprise. The bill provides for every federal enterprise to reach an agreement that suits its individual circumstance. As we wait here for that message from the Senate on this bill-which provides for things such as shift penalties, restrictive work practices and restrictive hours of work to be reviewed so that the sort of agreement that has revolutionised business for, say, the Sheraton group and so many other best practice companies in Australia can be spread right throughout the length and breadth of the Australian work force and which provides for multi-skilling and the elimination of demarcation disputes-how absolutely ironic it is that the honourable member for Bennelong, who has learnt nothing in 10 years, should put on this bellicose performance. The bill does not start and finish with the revolution in workplace agreements. It goes further than that. It provides for a whole new nexibility in the award stream, for award nexibility clauses to be inserted into all of federal awards. It provides for the simplification and the modernisation of the whole of the federal award system. It provides for the continuous review of awards to remove outdated provisions and to make sure that for prescriptive award provisions that have hampered nexibility are all eliminated. While we wait, we have this totally hypocritical performance from the opposition. The government is justly proud of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. It will do more to change the industrial relations system than anything else that has been attempted. It has all been done· this year, and in the face of opposition from those opposite at every tum of the way-13 hours of bitter debate in this chamber and 271/2 hours of bitter debate in the Senate with abuse upon abuse heaped on the Democrats and the Greens who saw the merit in the government's approach. So we have this perfonnance today from those who have really been sidelined by history-the political punch-drunks who have tried their fonnula of division, of bitterness and of slashing wages. They are the people who took this fonnula to the people of Australia in March this year and lost the unlosable election. Here, several months later, they have learnt absolutely nothing. This year, they added to a decade of defeats the biggest defeat of all. One of the three principal reasons for that defeat was the policies that were put forward, pursued and thrust upon the opposition by the honourable member for Bennelong. He hates our success, and he certainly hates his own failure, as do all those in his party. One of real reasons those opposite failed was their approach to industrial relations. It was one of the major bases why they lost the election and were so roundly rejected by the people of Australia. Those opposite went to the people seeking to destroy the basic protections-the protections that are so loved and cherished and so close to the hearts of every Australian working man and woman. They sought to destroy the Australian award system; they sought to chop awards to pieces and to replace them with legislative minima; and they sought to abolish the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. There is no place for the umpire in their scheme of industrial relations. Their scheme is to get rid of the umpire. That was fundamental to the whole plank of the policies they were pursuing. They sought to force individual contracts upon all Australian workers. Their policies were the policies of bitterness and of division-and the policies pursued by their colleagues interstate. They sought to entrench the principle of the contract system-the system of 'take the contract or take the sack'-and the politics of industrial fear in every workplace. They sought to see the young people of Australia being paid $3 an hour as a youth wage. That was their policy. But what have they· learnt? All honourable members in this House, and, indeed, the people of Australia know whose brainchild these crazy ideas were. We want to thank the honourable member for Bennelong for the major contribution he made to make sure that we are still on the government benches. Industrial relations was a major contributing factor. I thank him for everything that he has done for us. He was a huge help. Let me say a few things about the policies that those opposite pursued that were so roundly rejected. They were rejected because Australia, quite frankly, would not have a bar of them; and neither would we. The end result was not just a rejection of them by the Australian people but a rejection of them in the opposition's party room. I think the vote was 47 to 30 when the honourable member for Bennelong's party told him what it thought about his industrial relations approach. That the was the margin which saw the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) re-elected to the leadership of the Liberal Party. What.have those opposite said since? They have said that Fightback stands and that the only thing they are thinking about reviewing is the $3 youth wage. The Liberal Party believes that the rest of its industrial relations policies should all stand. I will tell the honourable member for Bennelong something of the industrial relations realities in Australia today. We are proud of the fact that we enjoy the lowest level of strikes for 50 years. We are proud of the fact that industrial disputation under our government is 60 per cent lower than it was in the comparable period under the Fraser government. We are proud of the fact that since 1991 enterprise bargaining principles have been established by the commission and that, through Minister Cook, we have seen the introduction of section 134 of the Industrial Relations Act which has already resulted in 1,365 federal industrial agreements entered into, with 37 per cent of all federal award employees in this nation now covered by one fonn of agreement, or another. We are proud of the fact that there has been a huge productivity increase-a magnificent profitability increase-in so many of the companies involved in those 1,365 enterprise agreements. We are very pleased that company profitability is now at its highest level. Indeed, it is equal to the level in the late 1980s which was the highest level at any time since the early 1960s-the time that the honourable member for Bennelong recalls with such wannth, as he so often says on the radio. We are proud of the fact that inflation in Australia today is running at 2.2 per cent per annum compared with those double-digit days of the Liberal government and the disgraceful manner in which it left the economy when the Australian electorate so. roundly rejected the Liberal Party in the 1983 election. It is strange how the Liberal Party has managed to be so consistent down through the years; it is as though it has learnt nothing from this whole process. We are very proud of the fact that we have created 100,000 jobs in the last three months. We know it is not enough, but we know it is a great tum around and a great signal to the rest of Australia. Most importantly, we know that it points to a future with real prospects, because the trend line is there. We also know that we have created more jobs here in three months than have been created in three years under the industrial relations policies in New Zealand, which the honourable member for Bennelong again held up to us today as an example. We are proud of the fact that there is no wage pressure here in Australia as a result of the accord and very proud of the fact that, as a result of this year's refonns, we have flexibility galore. The fact is, as we have said this year-and we have clearly established that we believe it-that flexibility must be achieved upwards and not downwards. We want high wage, high productivity outcomes, while the opposition is locked into this mindset of flexibility downwards-the Jeff Kennett school of economic recovery. I well recall the honourable member for Bennelong saying late in 1992, in that great quote of his: ... I think Jeff Kennett deserves the 100 per support of this Parliament. He said that here in this chamber. He went on: ... what he has done is to implement an industrial relations policy for which he has received a mandate. There was no mandate, of course, and the result was the destruction of industrial relations in Victoria. That is the path the opposition would take us down. All this time, the opposition has been looking for a reason to slash wages. It has been looking for a basis on which to abolish awards. Today it has come to us and held up the US wage system as some sort of a model-a model, when people often have to rely on tips to survive because the minimum wage in the United States is so wretchedly low. On this side of the chamber we all know the social costs of the US system. I say this to the opposition-and I say it long, hard and clearly-we will not have a bar of it. I need take honourable members no further than the report and findings of the US Bureau of Census on workers with low wage earnings 1964 to 1990 to indicate that 16.8 per cent of full-time wage and salary earners in the United States earned less than the poverty level for a four-person family, which is equal to $US12,195. Let us look at the Australian comparison through the Australian Bureau of Statistics. When adjusted for exchange rates, the comparable figure is 4.8 per cent of full-time adult non-managerial wage and salary earners in Australia earning below that amount. That is less than a third of the American experience and yet the opposition holds it up to us as some sort of a model. What a disgrace. The opposition would have the same sort of social dislocation and wretched impact upon Australian working men and women if they had been foolish enough to give the Liberal Party a mandate this year. The fact is that the Liberal Party's approach was rejected by the electorate, and properly rejected. I have said that we will not have a bar of it and I am sure that in the future the Australian electorate will not have a bar of it. The fact is that the opposition has never cent really had original ideas. When it comes to the republic, it is good old mother England; when it comes to IR, it is good old. Uncle Sam. Let me say clearly-that is what this employment statement is about today-that we are looking for Australian solutions to help Australia's unemployed. That is what the green paper is about, and those major features of· it which were addressed by the Prime Minister today indicate some real hope for the people that we understand and need to help so much. I conclude by saying that the matter of public importance before us speaks about the failure of the employment green paper to address the industrial relations cause of high unemployment. It should refer to 'the failure of the employment green paper to recommend a slashing of wages'. We reject the honourable member's formula and we reject it absolutely. (Time expired)",64
156,Ms MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome the opportunity to speak today on this matter of public importance. I would ask that the House and those people in the gallery might pause for a moment to reflect on what might happen if every business proprietor in this country walked out the front door of his establishment tonight, turned the key and never returned. Any reasonable person thinking reflectively would quickly come to the conclusion that that would be a great disaster for Australia. It would be a great disaster because private business enterprise in this country employs seven million Australians. They are the biggest contributors, together with the people they employ, to the tax revenue that operates this country and provides all of the benefits that we enjoy. It is important to pause and give some thought to that. The reason I ask people to pause and think about that today will become clear as we look at this green paper and the way it began. Of course, the business people of this country will not have to tum the key on their business and make a voluntary decision not to return to it the next day. I am saddened that this government has seen fit to bring in policies, particularly industrial relations policies-I spoke about this yesterday, so I will not labour the point-which are making that decision for many small businesses. I would like to refer to the ABS review of small business in Australia in 1993. There are two disturbing things that come out of this report. The first is the growth in small business-I am talking about small business today because big business in this country is very well looked after by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). As I said, I am , here to speakon behalf of small business and what I call 'microbusiness', a very substantial part of the businesses in this country. The report shows that between 1983 and 1984 and 1991 and 1992 small employing businesses were increasing at the rate of 25 per cent per annum. Over the same period, the total small business employment rate was increasing by 27 per cent per annum. In the period 1989-90 to 1991-92-where we saw the worse of this government's legislation in terms of business in this countrythe number of small businesses in Australia decreased by 6.3 per cent. It is a savage reduction. Furthermore, the capacity of those businesses to employ fell dramatically as well. Small business in this period has been employing only 0.4 per cent. i think those figures speak for themselves. We can see from those figures that, if we were to keep going in that direction, there is not a great future for any of us. The other figures that are disturbing are the bankruptcy figures-the business bankruptcy figures, in particular. They have been growing at an alarming rate. In 1990-91 they grew by 53 per cent. In 199,1-92 the figure from the previous year continued to grow by 28.2 per cent. In 1991-92, we had 5,387 Australian businesses go bankrupt-not to mention the personal bankruptcies. Thirty-two per cent of respondents said that the causes of those bankruptcies were economic conditions, which are clearly in the hands of this government. Sometimes, just somet.imes, when faced with major problems-in Australia we are faced with a very significant problem of one million Australians out of work-we have to be prepared to start to think laterally. Stand on our heads, so to speak, but think laterally! We should do something and do something different. But it appears to me that the unemployment problem has reduced many in government today to a state of mental paralysis. As I came into the House today, I think I heard the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) say that the green paper entitled Restoring full employment is not about creating jobs. I was surprised to read in that green paper that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had given the committee a brief. This is the brief that he gave. The minister might take note of this. The first point states: · increase employment opportunities; The second point states: · reduce unemployment and particularly long unemployment; The third point states: · improve the skills base in Australia; The fourth point states: · promote equity in the labour market; I suggest that they are laudable goals, but this government has been long on rhetoric and short on effective action for four years now. Every time. I listen to speeches on the topic of unemployment, I hear the same tired old cliches. Let us return for a moment to the Prime Minister's brief and turn those points I have just outlined upside down. Let us turn them around. I have to say before I do that-and I will do it-that this green paper really surprised me because I have gone through it with a fine toothcomb and I am absolutely surprised and appalled that not one reference is made to how we can help sustain small business in this country. Yet that is the key restoring a full employment position in this country. Furthermore, if we look at the people that the Prime Minister put on this committee to inquire into this matter, we will see that not one business person is represented therethey are all academics. It might be hard for people in this House to imagine what it would be like for business proprietors to in their door and walk away because most people in this place have been nurtured in the bosom of bureaucracy. Mr Lieberman-On the other side.",67
157,Ms MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, on the other side. I thank the honourable member for that. Why does this committee not change these goals? Why did the Prime Minister not charge the committee with these goals which might indeed really get to the heart of the problem in this country, of solving our unemployment and helping our unemployed? Let us turn those points. in the Prime Minister's brief around. Instead of increasing employment opportunities, why do we not increase business opportunities? Instead of reducing unemployment, why do we not reduce inhibitors to business? Instead of improving the skills base, why do we not improve the climate for business and get rid of the impediments to it? term Instead of promoting equity in the labour market, what about a bit of equity for the small business proprietors in this country? It is Christmas time and possibly appropriate that the spectre of Scrooge is raised for, 100 years ago, this image of proprietors carried some validity. But today it is a different scene. The typical business proprietor is a family man or woman, often with a spouse and children working in the business. They work long hours. They certainly work more than 36 hours a week. They pay themselves no holiday leave loading. They are lucky to take two weeks holiday a year. They do not have an extensive iIlness and accident cover. If we seriously analyse their hourly rate of pay, we are lucky to get into double digits on a calculator. In my experience as president of a chamber of commerce, small businesses are great contributors to the social well-being of their communities. They are great contributors to to jobs in this country and great contributors to the tax revenue required to run this country. This defies the spectre of Scrooge and his miserly treatment of employees in his community. On the other hand, one could well be mistaken for thinking Scrooge had come back to haunt us today in the form of the Prime Minister and his tax hikes and added administurn the key trative burdens on business. To sum up: we have milked the cow but have failed to feed it. There is no quick fix to unemployment. But if we could shift the emphasis from 'what can we do for the unemployed' to the more positive 'what can we do to provide a nurturing climate for small business today to employ', we might well be on the way to solving a problem about which we speak often but rarely act.

158,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This green paper· entitled Restoring full employment, which the government has presented today, is a personal challenge to every Australian. It a personal challenge to every employed Australian; it is a personal challenge to every unemployed Australian. It is a challenge towards national cooperation to cut back the fearsome cost of unemployment-the fearsome cost in economic terms and the fearsome cost in social terms. It poses a question very starkly, and every member of this House and every member of the community should take this question very seriously: do we want a divided Australia, content to pass by permanently an underclass of long-term unemployed people or are we, as a society, prepared to make a lot of sacrifices for the national good? The green paper presented today is visionary and also hard headed. It takes up the questions which were just raised by the honourable member for Pearce (Ms Moylan). The fact of the matter is that nobody in this House disputes the fact that the key to long term job creation in this country is to create better conditions in the private sector, to create long-term jobs in it. That has been the whole thrust of the government's policy. It was the whole thrust of the government's policies in the 1980s. We need growth. We need it to feed on a productive and healthy private sector, which is why the profit share in this economy is so high-something which is completely ignored by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Pearce. The fact of the matter is that growth alone is not sufficient. This displays the poverty the opposition's approach. If opposition members just spent a while studying the green paper and many of the papers by people such as Dr Bruce Chapman, they would see that those papers adequately describe the problem we have in our economy. The problem we have in our economy is that there is fundamental structural change at a time when the labour force is growing, brimming, increasing-the participation rate is up-and we cannot create, through growth and through a healthy private sector, jobs for all of those that require them. That is a fundamental fact which needs to be understood because Australia is at the crossroads. This may well be our last chance to give the long-term unemis ployed one last opportunity to return to the world of work and to the society that we know-that is, the society that the employed people in this community know. Growth alone does not solve the problem. But what do we get in the House today from the opposition? We get the same tired old arguments: slash wages and slash the deficit. It is crucial in the months ahead that the debate in the community be much more open than the debate put forward by the opposition in this House. It is crucial that organisations such as the churches, which have a moral responsibility and a moral agenda, get involved in this debate so that the views of the economic fundamentalists opposite do not dominate when the government brings down its white paper in May. We need a full debate. We need to lock out this nonsense which is peddled by the opposition that the cause of all of our employment problems lies in the wage system. It does not lie in the wage system. Prominent economists estimate that we would 'have to cut wages in the community by as much as 30 per cent to have any substantial employment effect. A cut in wages of something like 30 per cent is something like $10,000 off the average wage. Is that the policy that the opposition is putting forward in this House today? The problem with the opposition is that it is locked into a form of economic fundamentalism which goes right back into the last of century. Those opposite pine for the days when chimneysweeps had to go up the chimney when their master told them. They pine for the time when convict chain gangs built the roads. They do not think about industrial relations in terms of collaboration between employees and employers. They do not care about the living standards of average men and women. The pathetic reality is that the dogma that comes from those opposite is the dogma of old Stalinists-a dogma which is completely irrelevant to modem social and economic circumstances. They are committed to a form of economic fundamentalism put forward by the New Right. They believe unemployment is solely a function of wages and that ees are not people but just another factor of production, like a nut or a bolt, and that they can be sold on the market like those factors of production. But that is not the case. That is why they do not understand the labour market. The conservative parties are sadly out of touch and they will not have any influence on this debate if they keep coming forward with those sorts of propositions. The fact of the matter is that the recent caucus task force report on employment and the green paper put forward today reject that economic fundamentalism. It is rejected for a very good reason: unemployment not only is bad for human dignity and destroys workers as human beings but also has a fundamental effect on the operations of the economy. It is bad for economic growth. We need to intervene to provide more substantial labour market programs to ensure that there is an adequate supply of skilled labour available to match the vacancies that are available. The fact is that the opposition does not understand these imperatives of the moderri economy. It does not understand the importance of a labour force to a modem, competitive and productive economy. That is very sad. I would like to spend a little bit of time talking about some of the central recommendations in the green paper. The first measure advocated and put forward in the green paper, which should be the subject of intense public debate, is the employment compact. This is intended to give training or work experience to long-term unemployed people in return for enforceable obligations to accept work or the offer of .a training program. That is a very important concept. If we as a community take a decision to provide sufficient work experience programs or training places for all of long-term unemployed, they in tum will have an obligation to participate in the system. That is a very important concept which should be the subject of substantial community debate. The concept of community work is also put forward in the report. The unemployed have the opportunity to participate in meaningful community work, which will allow them to get experience and to move employ- back into the world of work. The second area of the report which should be the subject of much discussion is radical changes foreshadowed to the social security system, which would ensure members of low income families have more of a chance to accept work or ensure that one partner can stay at home and act as a parent. The green paper advocates a parenting allowance to encourage families to choose whether they work or stay at home minding children. This will ensure that those in low-wage jobs or those that are unemployed will have the choice to either look after their children in the home or move into the work force. What will be removed through the recommendations made in this report is the existing disincentive for some people on welfare benefits, where they have three or four children, to move back into the work force. These are radical changes which should be the subject of intense public debate. Thirdly, the report recommends action to ensure there is greater access to capital for small business. This is an area of the report which the honourable member for Pearce has not even read. She is completely ignorant of a whole chapter which deals with growth and business conditions. The report says quite unequivocally that there is a need for substantial and radical action in this area. It also recognises that complex administrative burdens are placed on small business via a whole raft of government requirements and that action should be taken in that area. We acknowledge that. We are not blind to these facts as the opposition is blind to the whole problems of our broader labour market. Lastly, the green paper puts forward a case for a substantial shake-up in the Commonwealth Employment Service, including a the move to a case management approach, local employment committees and contracting out. These are all very substantial proposals which are very worthy of substantial public debate. They are proposals, however, which will not receive the due consideration that they deserve from those opposite, locked as they are into this dogma that the cause of all of the problems in the labour market is to be found in the wage system. If the proposition of those opposite is that to solve our economic problems and to create jobs for all who want to work a 30 per cent wage cut is required-a cut of $10,000 in the average wage-why are they not honest enough to say so? If the proposition of those opposite is that we should reduce public spending to Asian levels and, therefore, cut spending to the tune of $10 bilJion to $20 billion a year, why are they not honest enough to say so? . The opposition has no positive alternative policies. It is simply locked into the tired dogma of Fightback, which commits them to substantial cuts in public expenditure and slashing wages. None of those approaches can do anything creative for the long-term unemployed. The government is not afraid over - he next four or five months to have a fullyfledged debate on this question. The poverty of the opposition's ideas in this area will become rapidly apparent. As I move around the community and talk to people, there are plenty of creative ideas about what we can do. There is plenty of lateral thinking going on in the community. But what do we get from the opposition? We get this mindless opposition to labour market programs. But the opposition itself is committed to labour market programs. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in the House earlier today, those opposite are to hold a seminar, to which they have invited a sports psychologist and experts in competition to teach them how to lift their gatne. Yet, through their opposition to the labour market programs, they want to deny to the unemployed the same access to those experts through labour market programs so that they can lift their game. This government will not move away from providing access to all the services the long term unemployed require to become competitive in the labour market, even if the opposition will not acknowledge it in terms of the labour market, only in terms of its own performance.

160,Mr SAWFORD,PRIVILEGE,"by leave-On 28 October, the House referred to the Committee of Privileges the matter of articles in the Australian and the Australian Financial Review and comments on the WIN evening news on 25 October which appeared to reveal a knowledge of the contents of a draft report and/or deliberations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The committee has received written submissions from members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and now wishes to take oral evidence from some members of that committee. In a letter to the Committee of Privileges, Senator Parer, Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, has referred to the adverse effects of these leaks on his committee. The Committee of Privileges would wish to be able to discuss this matter further with Senator Parer. Because of the procedures of the House, the committee understands that it will be necessary for the House to ask the Senate to grant leave for Senator Parer to appear. Accordingly, I haye taken the opportunity to advise the House of the committee's wishes. The committee asks that consideration be given to a motion to facilitate that matter. With the agreement of my colleagues, I have foreshadowed this request to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and to the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard). Motion (by Mr Tickner)-by leaveagreed to: That a message be sent to the Senate requesting that leave be given to Senator Parer, a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, to appear before the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges.

161,Mr LINDSAY,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development) (4.19 p.m.)-I move: Excise Tariff Proposal No.4 (1993). The excise tariff proposal I have just tabled contains alterations to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 which will correct an anomaly that exists in the legislation as it relates to the granting of 'exempt offshore oil' status for crude oil excise purposes. The proposal will operate from 1 January 1994. The government announced in 1987 a number of changes to the petroleum taxation arrangements to encourage petroleum exploration and development in Australia which in part exempted from excise duty the first 4,767.3 megalitres-that is, 30 million barrels-ofcrude oil produced from onshore fields and new offshore projects. These provisions were reflective of the issues relevant to Bass Strait production. From 1 July 1990, the provisions of the Commonwealth's resource rent tax were extended to cover production from Bass Strait leaving the North West Shelf project area as the only offshore area subject to crude oil excise. Recent legal advice indicates that 'exempt offshore oil' status is dependent upon whether or not a development constitutes a 'project', a term which is not defined in the legislation. . To correct this situation and to eliminate inconsistencies between the treatment of petroleum developments located onshore and offshore, the legislation has been redrafted base the exemption from crude oil excise in both instances on the concept of a 'field', a term which is more readily understood by the industry. The amendments .proposed to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 have been discussed with the North West Joint Venturers and have their support. A summary of the alterations contained in the proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCGauran) adjourned. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Motion (by Mr Tickner, for Mr Beazley) agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Notice No.3, private Members' business, given by Mr MACKellar and accorded priority for Thursday, 16 December 1993, being moved in his absence by Mr Sinclair. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Tickner, and read a first time. Second Reading",71
162,Mr TICKNER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (4.23 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in accordance with decisions made by the government in respect of higher education. This bill provides funding of $12.9 million in 1996, rising to $35.2 million in 1999, for an additional 1,500 undergraduate student places, including 500 to be funded jointly with industry. These new places are part of the government's strategy for dealing with the continuing strong demand for higher educato tion and significant regional shortages in the provision of higher education opportunities. This increase raises the total of new places created by the government between 1989 and 1998 to over 100,000. The government announced during the budget that the period of rapid growth of funding in the sector had finished and that other mechanisms needed to be developed to ensure the efficient and effective use of public funding in maintaining a high quality higher education sector. As part of this strategy the government recently foreshadowed that it will be looking to shift some currently allocated places within and across states on the basis of institutional performance. Criteria for reallocating the places will be developed in full consultation with the higher education sector. The bill also provides for higher education funding adjustments to cover the areas of superannuation, support for redundancy payments, and the open learning initiative. The bill's provisions include financial adjustments to funding for higher education superannuation expenses of $23.3 million in 1994, $12.9 million in 1995 and $15.5 million in 1996. The additional funding is being provided to institutions to meet the costs arising from the implementation of the superannuation guarantee levy. Under another measure introduced in this bill and in line with the teacher education development strategy, the government will assist universities by supporting redundancy payments to excess staff. The government will advance higher education operating grants for this purpose from 1995 and 1996 into 1994 and 1995, respectively, on advice from institutions. The open learning initiative reflects the government's commitment to increasing access to higher education. Funding for individual years will be adjusted to better reflect the cash flows in those years while maintaining the total funding of $52 million over the 1993-95 period. The bill's provisions include amendments to the higher education contribution scheme, HECS. These changes aim to improve the operation and administration of the scheme. This bill will correct an anomaly whereby certain fully funded overseas aid students are currently liable for HECS. The bill also clarifies the classification of student's course load units incorporating work experience in industry. Guidelines will be provided to further assist institutions to clarify work experience units.

163,Mr LAVARCH,CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to promoting and developing Australia's reputation as an attractive and reliable place to invest. That reputation suffered a severe setback in the late 1980s when too many people lost money in circumstances that could have been avoided by timely and adequate disclosure of relevant information to investors. The government has worked hard to restore that reputation. The establishment on 1 January 1991 of the national scheme, based on the Corporations Law and administered by the Australian Securities Commission, was .an enormous achievement. The cooperation between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories behind that historic agreement was founded on a common desire to repair the damage of that period and raise a new regulatory umbrella, tailored to the real needs of investors in the internationalised, competitive Australian market of the 1990s and beyond. Other notable reforms have included changes to the accounting requirements, strengthening the law on insider trading, and improving the procedures for the settlement of stock exchange transactions. More recently, extensive reforms have been made to the corporate insolvency provisions and to the law on loans .. to directors and related companies. These reforms have contributed to the improved legal framework we now have. However, in my view the most significant change has been the establishment of a single well-resourced regulator - the ASC - which can take prompt and strong action to counter corporate wrongdoing. With equities again enjoying strong growth and attracting many investors into the market for the first time, this bill is an important and timely advance in ensuring a well-informed market. It makes major changes to the Corporations Law designed to enhance disclosure of relevant information for investors. For entities which are listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, it will significantly bolster the continuous disclosure requirements already in place under the rules of the exchange. Unlisted entities in which members of the public invest will have a new statutory requirement to disclose material information to the ASC. New periodic reporting requirements-in particular, half-yearly reports-will also enhance disclosure by entities of interest to investors. The bill also reforms the prospectus . provisions to facilitate fundraising, especially . for listed entities and continuous fund-raisers. History of the bill The present bill is a revised bill, originally introduced in the Senate in November 1992 as the Corporate Law Reform Bill (No.2) 1992. I. will elaborate shortly on the major differences between the two bills. However, it should be emphasised that the central aim of this bill remains the same. Timely disclosure of relevant information is essential for investors to have confidence in the integrity of the marketplace and to make informed investment decisions. This must be the central feature of an efficient and fair securities market. Full disclosure of information about the financial position and prospects of entities in which Australians invest helps to counter insider trading, the creation of false markets and the distortion of markets through rumours. In essence, the capacity of a market to attract investment-and thus to enable continued economic growth-is directly linked to the confidence generated through timely disclosure of material information. The 1992 bill was prepared in light of a report in September 1991 from the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee on an enhanced statutory disclosure system. This report pointed to the need for improved disclosure and recommended the introduction of a statutory system for continuous disclosure to the ASC by a wide range of corporations and other investment entities. As I said in my introductory remarks, inadequate disclosure of material information was a major problem during the 1980s. This has been widely acknowledged, not only by the advisory committee but also by the report of November 1991 on corporate practices and the rights of shareholders by the House Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which was prepared while I was the chair of that committee. . Clearly, significant improvements in disclosure have been made by the Australian Stock Exchange and by corporations themselves since that time. However, past experience has pointed to a need to change the legal framework to improve the level of disclosure .and increase investor protection . One essential difference exists in the approach to disclosure in the bill now introduced from that of the 1992 bill. This bill builds on the existing framework for disclosure by listed entities to the Stock Exchange, rather than creating an overlapping system for disclosure of the same or similar information to the ASC. This approach has been adopted in light of the recommendations of the legal and constitutional affairs committee. It also takes into account some of the criticisms of the 1992 bill from business and professional advisers. While the bill retains and reinforces the role of the Stock Exchange, it also strengthens the position of the ASC to take action to ensure compliance with continuous disclosure obligations. Most importantly, it retains the principle that civil remedies should be available in respect of breaches of disclosure obligations. As now formulated, the bill provides investors with a right to recover damages where loss is suffered as a result of the market being misled through an intentional, reckless or negligent failure to ful-1 these obligations. The bill has been the subject of an intensive consultation process over more than two years. This consultation has occurred at all stages in the development and introduction of the 1992 bill and again in the revision of that bill. In addition to the discussion papers and draft legislation released for comment, my department and I have held numerous discussions on the bill and the approach to be adopted. This input has been welcomed and will continue to be an essential part of the corporate law refonn process. The views of business and professional users of the law are carefully considered and have played an important part in detennining the content of the legislation. I should add that the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee was amongst the bodies consulted on the revised approach to continuous disclosure. The committee has recently advised me that it supports the approach adopted in the bill, including that continuous disclosure for listed companies be regulated through the Stock Exchange listing rules. The bill also contains major amendments to the prospectus provisions. The amendments are based in part on a report in March 1992 on prospectus law refonn by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. A number of the provisions included in the bill were contained in draft legislation released for public comment in January this year. These provisions, as well as a number of others, have been revised to make policy and drafting improvements in the light of the comments received. Content of the bill I will outline only briefly the most significant features of the bill. A more detailed outline of the bill is in the explanatory memorandum. (a) Enhanced Disclosure As with the 1992 bill, the enhanced disclosure scheme will apply to listed and unlisted entities in which there is a significant investor interest. These entities are referred to as disclosing entities. In addition to listed entities, unlisted entities, primarily prescribed interest schemes and debenture issuers, will be covered if they issue a prospectus or engage in analogous activities to raise funds or trade in securities. The treatment of prescribed interest schemes is largely consistent with the relevant recommendations of the review of collective investments by the Law Refonn Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which I tabled in parliament in September. Flexibility is provided to enable regulations or ASC class orders to alter the effect of the disclosure obligations under the Corporations Law where this is considered appropriate. Enhanced disclosure will be achieved as a result of new legislative requirements for periodic reporting and for continuous, or ongoing; reporting. The major change in relation to periodic reporting is the introduction of statutory halfyearly reports. These reports will be similar to, but not as detailed as, the present annual financial statements. The Australian Accounting Standards Board will have power to set standards for half yearly accounts. There will be a requirement for an auditor to review, bunot audit, the half yearly accounts. I As previously mentioned, the continuous disclosure obligations for listed entities will be based on the Stock Exchange requirements. Civil and, in limited cases, criminal sanctions will apply where inadequate disclosure would reasonably be expected to materially affect the price or value of the relevant securities. This criterion, which needs to be satisfied in addition to showing that a breach of the listing rules has occurred, will ensure that only serious breaches of the disclosure requirements are subject to direct legislatiye sanctions. For unlisted entities, a statutory scheme analogous to that proposed for listed entities is appropriate to ensure that investors can be fully infonned through continuous disclosure to the ASC. However, in many, if not most, cases these entities will already be subject to the supplementary prospectus requirements and thus will not need to comply with the new obligations. Unlike the 1992 bill, no carve-out has been included for confidential material to be withheld from disclosure. This is consistent with the approach now adopted ofIeaving the content of disclosure to the listing rules. The Stock Exchange has recognised the need to re-examine the listing rules in light of the legislative backing in the bill. It proposes consider, in particular, the adoption of an express confidentiality provision. Should necessary, such a provision could be made by regulation. The success of the approach now adopted for listed entities in relation to enhanced disclosure depends on a vigorous and effective approach by the Stock Exchange to the enforcement of its disclosure rules. It also depends on close and effective cooperation between the Stock Exchange and the ASC. This cooperation is already apparent in a number of areas and will be further enhanced by the proposed conclusion of a memorandum of understanding between the two regulatory bodies to provide for cooperation in the enforcement of obligations on listed companies. I am confident that the new legislative framework and the enhanced role of these bodies can achieve the necessary enhancement in disclosure. However, the bill requires a review by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee after 18 months of the commencement of the continuous disclosure and related enforcement provisions. This review, to be completed within a further six months, will provide an important early assessment of the effectiveness of the legislation. Information released to the market by the ASX about listed entities·will be given to the ASC and, together with information provided directly by listed entities, will be accessible through the ASC database. Significant reforms will be made to the powers and immunities of the Stock Exchange to ensure that it can properly carry out its major role in securing prompt and full disclosure. As with the 1992 bill, the 1993 bill expressly confers qualified privilege on the Stock Exchange in carrying out its functions. New measures in this bill will remove the requirement for the exchange to give an undertaking as to damages when it takes court action and enable the ASC to share confidential information with the exchange. A further, very important new measure will require securities and futures exchanges to notify the ASC of serious breaches of the corporations law or of its rules. This will to ensure that the ASC receives, as a matter of right, information necessary to enable it to it be take appropriate enforcement action. (b) Prospectus Reforms The new approach to prospectuses introduced in the 1991 legislation is generally regarded as having been very successful. However, in a number of areas it has become clear that, without detracting from the thrust of the provisions, amendments are appropriate to improve and streamline their operation: Consistent with the enhanced disclosure obligations, listed entities which fulfil certain conditions will be able to rely on a more limited prospectus that contains information relating to the particular offer of securities, including its effect and the rights attaching to the securities. Except in the case of sales of 30 per cent or more of an entity, the requirements for secondary prospectuses will be abolished and replaced by a requirement for an information memorandum. Incorporation of documents into a prospectus will be facilitated where the document is lodged with the commission, a summary is included in the prospectus and a copy of the full document made available without charge on request. The provisions on supplementary prospectuses will be clarified and in some cases tightened. A replacement prospectus, incorporating the original prospectus and any changes, will be permitted as an alternative to a supplementary prospectus. Refunds will be required where applications for securities are made on the basis of an out-of-date prospectus. (c) Other Reforms A major reform will be made to the Corporations Law to clarify and relax the present restrictions on companies which wish to insure or indemnify their officers-including directors-and auditors. This reform will meet long-standing criticisms of the present law and is based on reports of both the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee and its predecessor, the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. Another reform in the bill will enable a document from the ASC's database to be admissible in court proceedings as prima facie evidence of the matters stated, without certification of the document. Financial Impact Provision has been made for additional costs which will be incurred by the ASC in relation to the enhanced disclosure system. The 1992 budget allocated additional expenditure of $3.2 million over the following four years. The funds were to cover upgrading of the ASC's computer system and ongoing administrative costs. However, the ASC expects ongoing costs to be substantially offset by revenue raised through charges for access to new information on its national database. Significant changes are now proposed in the legislative scheme - but these changes do not affect the need for funding the ASC to perform its role. Further details, including the financial impact of the bill on business, are contained in the explanatory memorandum. While some additional costs can be expected for business, these should not be significant. For listed entities, continuous disclosure and half-year reporting is already required by the Stock Exchange rules. Most unlisted entities covered by the bill will already be subject to continuous disclosure through the supplementary prospectus provisions. However, the new civil and criminal sanctions for failure to comply with disclosure requirements may result in some additional compliance costs, consistent with the need to ensure appropriate disclosure on a continuous and periodic basis. Future Reforms The Commonwealth is not resting on its laurels. The platform already in place means the government can now take a more measured approach to reform and honourable members may be aware that I have recently initiated a major long-term process to progressively simplify the Corporations Law. We cannot be satisfied only with a regulatory regime that protects investors. It must also designed to be clearly understood by all who must comply with it, with cost and other impositions on commercial activity kept to the minimum necessary to adequately safeguard investors. The aim will be a user-friendly I look forward to bringing the initial results of that review into the House within the current life of this parliament. However, achievements under this program will take some time and in the meantime it is appropriate that certain reforms proceed separately. In addition to introducing the present bill, I propose to release for public comment very shortly a draft bill containing miscellaneous amendments to remedy deficiencies and anomalies in the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. These amendments will improve the operation of those laws and facilitate the operation of the ASC. A number of important reforms remain to be considered by the government. These include reforms of corporate structures to cater for the needs of small business, regulation of collective investments and enhanced rights for shareholders to take legal action against company management. Conclusion In accordance with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council on Corporations has been consulted and, to the extent necessary, given approval for the introduction of the bill into parliament. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Williams) adjourned .. EVIDENCE BILL 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Kerr, and read a first time. Second Reading",73
164,Mr KERR,CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. be The bill provides a modem and comprehensive law of evidence to apply in federal courts and, with the agreement of the Australian Capital Territory government, in the courts of the ACT. Comprehensive evidence law law. reform is not easy. Many challenges have accumulated over too many years for that to be the case. But this government is taking evidence law reform out of the too hard basket and making it an important feature of the law reform agenda. The bill has three main objectives. The first is for the first time to provide an evidence law to apply in proceedings in federal courts. At present, by operation of section 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903, the evidence laws of the state or territory in which a federal court is sitting apply in that court, in addition to the common law, which is applied under section 80 of the Judiciary Act. There are significant differences between the various state and territory statutes dealing with evidence. Thus, the preparation by a practitioner of a case before the Federal Court .of Australia may differ dt?pending on where the hearing will take place and, if evidence is limited, its outcome may depend on where the hearing is held. Indeed, where the hearing of a proceeding in a federal court is adjourned for further hearing in another state, the evidence law which applies in the proceeding changes. The second major aim of the bill is a modem law of evidence for our nation. Reform of the legal system is essential to ensure that it meets the needs of contemporary Australia. Reform of the law of evidence is an essential component of reforming the legal system. The current law of evidence is a significant cause of cost and delay in many proceedings. Also, where relevant evidence is excluded because of an overly technical or inappropriate rule of evidence injustice may result. On the state of present evidence laws, and the need for their reform, the Law Reform Commission said: The present law is the product of unsystematic statutory and judicial development. It is a highly complex body of law which is arcane even to most legal practitioners. It contains traps and pitfalls which are likely to leave the unrepresented baffled, frustrated and defeated. There are also many areas of uncertainty in the law of evidenceareas on which definitive law is yet to be pronounced by the courts. The need for reform is also demonstrated by what happens in practice: the complexities are ignored, oversimplified versions of the law are applied and judges try to discourage use of its technicalities. Evidence law reform is micro-economic reform. A reformed evidence law will simplify and shorten proceedings. It will reduce costs, both to governments in providing court services and to litigants. Reform is necessary to assist the courts to achieve just and proper decisions with a minimum of expense to all concerned. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, this bill and a similar bill to be introduced into the New South Wales parliament early next year will, it is hoped, form the basis of substantially uniform evidence law throughout Australia. The benefits of uniformity for the legal profession and for efficiency in the conduct of proceedings are obvious. Probably the greatest benefit would be for business. Business could achieve substantial savings through lower legal costs and record keeping costs if uniformity is achieved. The role of this bill in seeking to achieve uniformity is best seen by considering its origins. The impetus for reform, which has led to this bill, came from this parliament. The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs issued a report in November 1977 in which it recommended that 'a review of the whole of e-idence law should be undertaken by the Law Reform Commission with a view to producing a wholly comprehensive code of evidence based on concepts appropriate to the present day'. The then Attorney-General, Senator the Hon. Peter Durack QC, gave a reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission in July 1979. The Law Reform Commission released 16 research papers on various evidence law topics, an interim report with draft legislation in 1985 and its final report, also with draft legislation, in 1987. In 1988, the New South Wales commission issued a report recommending that, with minor modifications, the bulk of the Australian Law Reform Comlitigant mission's recommendations be adopted in proceedings before New South Wales courts. In 1991 New South Wales and the Commonwealth each introduced evidence bills. Both bills were largely based on the Law Reform Commission's draft bill but both differed in several respects from that draft bill, and from each other. In October 1991 the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General gave in-principle support to substantially uniform evidence laws, based on the New South Wales and Commonwealth bills. The Commonwealth and New South Wales then worked together to develop a uniform law, taking into account the comments that had been received on the two bills. This work was carried out in consultation with the ACT government, which gave its support to uniformity by agreeing that the Commonwealth bill should also apply in ACT courts. In August this year New South Wales released a working draft as an exposure bill, for the purpose of obtaining further comments. The Evidence Bill 1993 and the companion New South Wales bill, which evolved from the working draft, are the result of that process. The bills are uniform, except where a difference is required because one is a Commonwealth bill and the other a state bill or where there are technical reasons. I interpose my own note of personal appreciation for the work of John Hannaford, who intervened personally towards the end of these proceedings to ensure the effective coming together of both governments on these matters. The Commonwealth wants this bipartisan approach to achieving uniformity to be taken up by other states and territories. The Commonwealth, for its part, will continue negotiations on uniform evidence laws with state and territory governments through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Commonwealth, state and territory governments now have an opportunity to improve the law, to remove inconsistencies and, as a result, make them more just, reasonable and comprehensive. I now tum to some of the most important features of the bill. Like the 1991 bill, this bill is based largely on the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. It also replaces the State and Territorial Laws and Records Recognition Act 1901 and most of the Evidence Act 1905. The bill will apply in federal courts-the High Court, the Federal Court and the Family Court-and in ACT courts. However the bill provides a capacity for a proclamation to be made to terminate the application of most of its provisions in ACT courts. That recognises the self-governing capacity of the ACT. Provisions of the bill replacing the Evidence Act 1905 or the State and Territorial Laws and Records Recognition Act 1901 will apply to proceedings in all Australian courts and tribunals or to proceedings in courts exercising federal jurisdiction. There are two dominant themes in the bill. The first is to remove unnecessary restrictions on relevant evidence being put before courts. The second is bringing evidence law up to date with technology. Firstly, the bill removes unnecessary restrictions on relevant evidence being put before courts. It is artificial, and in many instances absurd, to limit the material a fact-finding tribunal can accept as evidence. It will reform the existing rules relating to admission of hearsay evidence. A hearsay statement of a person who witnessed the relevant event-' first hand' hearsay-is to be admissible, subject to safeguards such as the giving of notice to other parties and to the calling, if available, of the person who made it, in civil proceedings and for the defence in criminal proceedings. Only specific categories of first hand hearsay evidence are to be generally admissible, subject also to the same safeguards, against the defence in criminal proceedings. More remote hearsay is to be admissible if it falls within one of a number of categories which are inherently reliable for some reason; for example, because it is a business record. Secondly, bringing evidence law up to date with record keeping technology will mean potential savings to government, business and individuals of millions of dollars annually if substantially uniform national evidence laws are implemented. At present the rules for admission of documentary evidence vary from state to state. The original document rule, under which, generally, the contents of a document must be proved by production of the original, applies in all states but with significant exceptions which differ from state to state. As a result, at present governments and' business operating throughout Australia find it prudent to maintain records in forms that would be admissible in all states and territories. This means the retention of the most primitive form of record keeping-original paper records-instead of modem methods. The Commonwealth will get the immediate benefit of reform because the bill's documentary evidence reforms will apply to use of its records as evidence in all Australian courts. Similar benefits for business will depend upon the states and territories adopting similar reforms. Removing the need to retain original documents will result in very significant savings in storage costs. No detailed costing has been made of the likely overall savings for the Commonwealth. However, the savings available from individual items indicate that they are likely, across the board, to run into millions of dollars. Savings for business across Australia would, of course, be much greater. The bill provides a number of ways in which the contents of documents-including photocopies, facsimile copies, microfilm output or optical laser reader output-can be proved. Computer output will also be admissible. Safeguards are provided in relation to the testing of documents and the means by which documents have been produced or kept. Uniformity will also result in savings as lawyers will need to learn only one law of evidence-which can be used regardless of which court or part of Australia in which they are practising. They will not have to understand different rules applying in different states and territories. They will not need additional education or research and significantly their clients will not have to meet the cost of this in their bills. Existing common law, and state and territory laws, will have effect subject to inconsisThis tency with the bill. However, because the bill is comprehensive, the scope for operation of these laws will be extremely limited. Special evidentiary provisions in other Commonwealth laws and ACT laws are preserved by the bill. The Evidence Bill 1993 paves the way for significant reforms to the application of evidence law in federal courts. The bill will permit significant savings in Commonwealth storage costs by enabling departments and statutory authorities to abandon storage of original documents, after their microfilming or transfer to other modem storage media. One difference from the New South Wales bill relates to unsworn statements or so-called 'dock statements'. Unsworn statements have been abolished in most states and territories but still may be made in New South Wales, in the ACT and on Norfolk Island. There is current debate regarding the future of unsworn statements in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory and, rather than pre-empt the outcome of that debate, the Evidence Bill 1993 retains the status quo regarding so-called dock statements. Therefore, the provisions regarding unsworn statements of the state or territory in which the matter is heard will continue to apply. I present the explanatory memorandum for the bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Williams) adjourned.

165,Mr SCIACCA,CARE AND PARTNER,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (5.00 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. bill gives effect to a significant initiative announced prior to the 1993 federal election. A new home child-care allowance is to be introduced from September 1994. The Department of Social Security will pay it each fortnight. The home child-care allowance reform consolidates the government's provisions that assist families with children. It provides more direct recognition of the considerable time, energy and personal support devoted to children by parents, generally mothers, who decide to stay at home to raise their children. For the first time, this support will be provideligible ed directly to the parent caring for children, rather than to the other partner as a tax concession. The allowance will replace the dependent spouse rebate currently available to couples with dependent children and be paid at a higher maximum rate of $60 a fortnight. About 55,000 families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the dependent spouse rebate available to couples with dependent children will receive greater assistance from the new home child-care allowance. The new allowance will also be more responsive to families' needs than the dependent spouse rebate. Parents leaving the work force at any time during the year to, say, care for dependent children will be able to claim the allowance in that year, instead of waiting to re-establish their entitlement in the followallowance. ing year. This flexibility is expected to up to 120,000 families whose circumstances change within any year. The new home child-care allowance will not be means tested on family income. Dependent partners with children and incomes below $10.85 a fortnight will receive the full $60 a fortnight. Those with income of up to $250 a fortnight will receive part payment. Some 840,000 families in total are expected to receive it at anyone time. Home child-care allowance will be tax free and indexed annually. It will be paid until the end of the calendar year in which a dependent child, generally the youngest child, turns 18, or until the child ceases secondary schooling, whichever happens first. It will not be paid where the child is a prescribed student child except where the child is qualified to receive payments under the assistance for isolated children scheme.' A prescribed student child is a young person who has turned 16 and is qualified to receive payments under a prescribed educational scheme such as Austudy or Abstudy. Families will have to meet family payment residency qualifications. The dependent spouse rebate for couples without dependent children and the sole parent rebate will remain unchanged. Families that receive the new allowance will not be for these rebates. Legislation to prevent dual eligibility will be introduced later. Current taxation arrangements provide for a beneficiary rebate to protect full-year allowees from income tax,. but the rebate assumes that for couple allowees the family receives the full value of the dependent spouse rebate. Abolishing the dependent spouse rebate for couples with children would have left full-year allowee couples with dependent children with a large income tax bill. Currently these couples receive one combined payment. This payment will now be split so that each member of a couple will receive his or her own payment, with the dependent partner receiving a new partner allowance paid directly to him or her. Each partner will also get a tax rebate so that he or she does not have to pay tax on the basic As a result, dependent partners of assist maximum rate job search, newstart and sickness allowances and special benefit will generally not be eligible for home child-care allowance as they will receive the maximum rate new partner allowance in their own right. Both the home child-care allowance and the partner allowance build on recent family assistance reforms that together will result in over $3 billion of assistance to families being directed to the primary care giver, usually the mother, each year. The government has a strong commitment to assist families. The initiatives contained in this bill reinforce that commitment and are timely in view of the forthcoming International Year of the Family. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. NA 1993 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (5.05 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This measure, to establish a military compensation scheme for members of the Defence Force, can be viewed against the recent history of compensation measures for that force. In 1972, benefits under the Repatriation Act, which was originally designed for members on active service, were made available to Defence Force personnel on peacetime service. This cover was in addition to, but offset by, normal Commonwealth compensation cover. The Veterans' Entitlements Act, which replaced the Repatriation Act in 1986, provides for a continuation of this dual entitlement for members on peacetime service, but only until such time as a military compensation scheme is established. . In recognition of the special nature of Defence Force peacetime service, this bill establishes a military compensation scheme which will provide members with compensation and rehabilitation benefits available the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, together with the following additional benefits: cover for the unintended consequences of medical treatment provided at Commonwealth expense; and, where members are discharged within 45 weeks of the date of an injury or illness that gives rise to compensation, supplementation of any earnings to ensure payment equivalent to the member's normal defence salary up to the 45-week point. In addition, cadets, non-members with honorary rank, philanthropic representatives and ex-members on discharge training will be provided with cover under the enhanced Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Although cover under the Veterans' Entitlements Act is to cease for Defence Force members on peacetime service, the government recognises that significant numbers of these members are already eligible for benefits under that act. These personnel will retain their choice of coverage for any period of entitlement that has arisen under the Veterans' Entitlements Act before commencement of the military compensation scheme. The government also recognises that the military compensation scheme will be attractive to the non-peacetime categories of operational, peacekeeping and hazardous service, even though it was conceived primarily for Defence Force members rendering peacetime service. Because of its significant lump sum and rehabilitation benefits, which are not available under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, there will be situations where the provisions of the military compensation scheme would be more appropriate to an individual's personal circumstances than those of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. That is not to say that the latter is in any way inadequate-the point is that its emphasis is on medical care and pensions rather than the lump sum and rehabilitation benefits available under compensation legislation. A key feature of the military compensation scheme, therefore, is that Defence Force members on operational, peacekeeping or under hazardous service will be able to choose between Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage or the enhanced Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act coverage. This entitlement to choice will provide a balance in the level of benefits provided for the various categories of service in that it acknowledges the greater risk and difficulty associated with non-peacetime service. I might emphasise that the government does not envisage any change to the current arrangements for administration of compensation benefits. In particular, as a function of its responsibility as an employer, the Department of Defence will administer the military compensation scheme benefits that arise under the enhanced Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. I commend the bill to the House and present the· explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned. NA NA LAVERTON AND POINT COOK, NA Approval of Work",80
166,Mrs CROSIO,VICTORIA,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services) (5.10 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: RAAF Williams rationalisation project at Laverton and Point Cook, Vic. RAAF Williams, which is comprised of the Point Cook and Laverton bases, is located 20 kilometres west of the Melbourne CBD and five kilometres from the city of Werribee. The defence force structure review rationalised the disposition and functions of all defence units and subsequently, in May 1991, the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, announced that the airfields at Laverton and Point Cook were to be closed or sold. As a result of this announcement a consultative committee under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) examined the impact that the closures at Laverton and Point Cook would have on local communities. The Department of Defence participated in this consultative process. At the same time Defence continued to refine its force structure review objectives. Defence considerations revealed that some advantages could be obtained by the retention of the base area at Laverton, although other defence property previously considered for retention would no longer be required. The consultative committee supported the defence proposal. The proposal consists of three major items, minor adjusting works and engineering services. The major items are: refurbishment of the school of radio building at Laverton to accommodate RAAF headquarters logistics command, which will vacate rented premises in the Melbourne CBD; refurbishment of existing facilities at Laverton to house all elements of the RAAF publications unit; and purpose built facilities for the RAAF Institute of Aviation Medicine, which will be relocated from the Point Cook base to RAAF base Edinburgh in South Australia. The estimated out-tum cost of the works is $19.80 million. In its report the committee recommended that the RAAF Williams rationalisation project should proceed but raised the following specific issues: the RAAF museum should be maintained at Point Cook and be incorporated into the National Air and Space Museum of Australia; no further capital works should be commenced at RAAF base Point Cook and units located at Point Cook, with the exception of the RAAF museum, should be relocated elsewhere; the Department of Defence to keep the committee advised of the results of the ground contamination surveys of RAAF Williams and possible costs of decontamination at both RAAF base Point Cook and RAAF base Laverton. Defence will take due consideration of the recommendations of the Public Works Committee in determining future strategies for RAAF Williams and undertakes to keep the Public Works Committee informed regarding the future of Point Cook. Construction work on site is expected to commence in early 1994 and be completed by mid-1995. I would like to thank members of the committee for their support and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. ' NA Delegation to New Zealand  leave-I present the report on a visit to New Zealand by a joint delegation of the Standing Committees on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Senate in May 1992. Delegation to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia",83
167,Ms CRAWFORD,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia from 17 October to 5 November 1993. I seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.",83
168,Ms CRAWFORD,DELEGATION REPORTS,"The delegation comprised Senator MCKiernan, Senator Short, the honourable member for Cook (MrDobie), and me. Ms Robyn MCClelland was delegation secretary, and Ms Jackie Watkins, spouse of Senator MCKiernan, accompanied the delegation. The visit of the parliamentary delegation was timely. In Vietnam, there has been a recent surge in Australian investment and commercial interest. The visit preceded the forthcoming visit to Vietnam of an Australian delegation on human rights. In Laos, the Mekong River Friendship Bridge between Laos and Thailand, which has been funded by Australia, is nearing completion for opening in April 1994. The visit preceded the visit to Australia this week of the Lao Prime Minister, Mr Khamtay Siphandone. The timing of the visit to Cambodia is particularly significant, following immediately after the establishment of the constitution, the parliament and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The three countries have not been visited by official parliamentary delegations for some time. The aim of the delegation's report is to inform members of the Australian parliament and Australians in general about the three countries, and specifically in relation to the status of economic and political development, the prospects for national stability and trade, and foreign policy and development cooperation issues. The Indochinese region is signifiries: cant to Australia because of its proximity and size, its importance for regional stability, because many Australians are immigrants from the Indochinese countries. The report presents a number of recommendations aimed at optimising Australia's role in the region and ensuring that our good relationships with the three nations continue and develop. The delegation saw it as important to ensure that its report was presented quickly; the information in the report will become less valuable when it is no longer current. The report is likely to be of particular interest to members of the Vietnamese, Lao and Cambodian communities in Australia. For example, the report presents information on the situations facing returnees to each· of the three countries. It includes, in particular, a detailed statement from the government. of Cambodia on this issue. The. report is also likely to be relevant to Australian business people. It presents information on the opportunities for developing Australia's investment and commercial interests in the three countries. I would also like to refer to two other matters included in the report: human rights, and the Australian development cooperation programs in the three countries. Whilst human rights was not a principal focus of the delegation, the delegation did raise particular issues on behalf of the constituents of its members. The report includes two recommendations on human rights. As to development cooperation, the delegation visited many aid projects and was generally satisfied with what it saw. There were, however, issues of viability and accountability for some projects. The delegation considers it very important for aid administrators to get out into the field to see their projects. A project that looks fine on paper may not be so in practice. The delegation would like to record its appreciation to the chairmen of the national assemblies of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia for the hospitality and courtesy extended during its visit. The delegation also thanks the Australian ambassadors to each of the countHis Excellency Michael Potts, His Excellency Michael Mann and His Excellency and John Holloway. Australia can feel justly proud of the efforts of our embassies in these countries. We also thank officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Parliamentary Research Service and the Parliamentary Relations Office for helping with the delegation's program; and the delegation secretary, Robyn MCClelland, .for her assistance, and in particular her efficiency in facilitating the development of the delegation's report in such a short period of time. In closing, I would like to say that the delegation was privileged to visit these countries. It was clear that Australia has good relations with the three countries. The visit served to reaffirm the strength of Australia's bilateral relationship with each of the three countries. I commend the report to the House.",84
169,Mr DOBIE,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I, too, wish to speak on this report because I believe it is of great importance. It is very important for the future of Australian delegations and relationships with South-East Asia generally. Rather than repeat what the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) has just said, I would like to take my time in thanking some people for what they did for us during the visit. I would like to acknowledge the efforts of one of our Vietnam embassy officers, Miss Robyn Moody. Her appreciation and dedication as a young officer have set a standard of application and effort that should be an example for other young Australians and one that could be followed by them both nationally and within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I also thank Miss Kathy Klugman, who works in the embassy in Vietnam and who was another example of the quality set for others to emulate. I also acknowledge the efforts of those people within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both those within the individual countries which we visited and those here in Canberra. The three ambassadors-Michael Potts in Vietnam, Michael Mann in Laos and John Holloway in Cambodia-with whom we made very good contact, were quite splendid, although they were quite different in their.personal applications to their duties. They have each not only undertaken a great benefit for Australian interests in individual countries, but also shown dedication to the needs and concerns of the countries to which they have been appointed. We in Australia are particularly fortunate that in these three significant and vastly different countries we have such superb heads of mission. I was fortunate to have known two of the ambassadors very well previously, and I very much enjoyed seeing them. The differences between these countries in a trading sense are very real. It should be realised by the parliament that Vietnam is really only interested in big ticket items, such as BHP or ANZ, and things of that ilk. In my opinion, it is not interested in smaller or medium sized Australian businesses taking up posts in Vietnam. In Laos and Cambodia, the interest is the exact opposite. They are interested in small or medium sized Australian investments, which, because of the peculiar state of their economies, are ideal. What we have to be careful of-I hope the report makes this clear to people who are interested in this area-is that anybody who is interested in investing in those countries must be interested in the long haul. There is no room for people who only want to go up there to make a quick buck and then fly the coop. There is no room for such people in any of these countries. In the report we are saying that we should maintain our interests and offer encouragement; that we should be encouraging NOOs, with government assistance, to go to these countries. I would like to pay a tribute to our accompanying officer, Miss Robyn MCClelland. As mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Forde, she was a great companion. I would like to congratulate her-as the House should too-on her herculean effort in having the report under discussion today prepared and ready just a few short weeks after the three-week tour of Indochina finished. Honourable members will see from the daily program that this is a report relating to an October-November 1993 visit. The report presented in the House just previous to this one related to a visit to New Zealand in May 1992. The fact that this report was prepared their and presented to the House so quickly is largely due to Robyn MCClelland, and I personally thank her very much indeed. She fulfilled her job to this parliament in a way I have never seen before from an accompanying officer, and I have been on quite a few delegations during the past 27 years. This visit was fascinating to me because I was part of the delegation to Vietnam in 1989. In 1968 I visited our troops in South Vietnam. The difference in attitude of the Vietnamese towards this delegation was staggering. The Vietnamese want investment and support, which is quite different to 1989, when they were wanting to find out what parliament was all about. For their sake, I hope they are more successful with their investigation of business investment than they were after the 1989 delegation when they wanted to find out how to run a parliament. However, they were very friendly and very nice, and the visit went very well. As the report stresses, we have to maintain these parliamentary delegations and, if the need arises, we will have to finance visits from their parliamentarians to this country. That does not happen now. While we do look after them when they come here, I think we have to go further and make sure that we assist with their fares to this country. Quite frankly, Cambodia and Laos do not have any money anywhere for anything. How they survive I do not know, and that says a great deal for the Laotians. ' With those few random words about the report, I would like to say that it was one of the most pleasant delegations I have been part of in the past 27 years. I pay tribute to tor Jim MCKiernan and his wife, Jackie Watkins, who accompanied us. Jackie Watkins was a Labor member of the state parliament for 10 years. I also pay tribute to the honourable member for Forde and to Senator Short. It was far too busy a trip. We never stopped, day or night, but it was a very pleasant and useful delegation. I would like to pay tribute to the other members of the delegation for their contribution, which will be of benefit to Australia. BOUNTY (SHIPS) AMENDMENT BILL Cognate bill: NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 September, on  That the bill be now read a second time.  afternoon we are debating two customs bills: the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 and the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1993. Although the government has chosen to debate these bills cognately, I would like to address each individually because I believe there aTe a num""ber of important points that need to be made on each. The Customs Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus bill proposing a range of amendments to the Customs Act 1901, the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988, the Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Act 1992 and the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping Amendments) Act 1992. The bill contains three key proposals which I will briefly run through, as well as a number of administrative amendments of a minor nature. The bill comes into this place after having been debated in the Senate. In the preliminary stages of discussing this bill with the Australian Customs Service, the coalition indicated that we had considerable difficulties with one of the measures being proposed. After negotiations with the Minister for Science and SenaSmall Business (Senator Schacht) and the Australian Democrats, I am pleased to see that the offending clauses have been removed from the bill currently before this House. For the benefit of honourable members let me outline the nature of the amendments which the government had sought to implement but has since seen fit to withdraw. The present Anti-Dumping Authority is required to make available to the public any report or notice once it has been presented to the minister or to the Comptroller-General of the Australian Customs Service. As such, it can be made public before the minister makes a 1993 decision on the recommendations contained in the report. The government sought to revise this so that reports would only be made available to the public once the minister makes a decision. The government justified this change on the grounds that the current arrangements could allow for pressure to be placed on the minister to consider arguments or information on recommendations after he has received the report but before he has made his decision. Not only does the government believe that this would place extra pressure on the minister, but it suggests it would also duplicate the work of the Anti-Dumping Authority. The government also argues that present arrangements could leave the minister open to Federal Court action if he fails to seek advice from all interested parties. The coalition was extremely concerned about this proposal. Indeed, having considered both sides of the issue, we believe that the case against the government's changes is far more valid and overpowering than any possible reason for supporting the changes. The first cause for concern to the coalition was that the proposed arrangements effectively cut off the flow of information to the minister. We strongly believe that an integral part of the democratic process is the ability interested groups to put their case to the minister for comment on the proposals. It is critical that the minister make an informed decision based on representations from both industry and his department. The second reason for concern is that this amendment gives the minister the capacity to receive a report and sit on it without making a decision for any length of time-for weeks, months and possibly years. According to the Anti-Dumping Authority, ministers usually make a decision within two weeks of receiving a report, although in the past this has stretched to six to eight weeks depending on the minister and the issue. However, for some 'reason or another, ministers could be encouraged to sit on a report for a much longer period. Foreign affairs matters, for example, could encourage a minister to delay the release of a report. Alternatively, a minister may simply be too busy or too disorganised to approve a report in an appropriately quick turnaround time. As such, industry would be left to operate in a market into which foreign goods are possibly being dumped, and to make commercial decisions without any indication of the outcome of the dumping inquiry. I put it to the House that there is potentially quite a considerable period of time in which the industry must delay its commercial decisions and activities. For these reasons, the coalition strongly opposed to any changes to the current arrangement. We were therefore pleased to see the government remove this change from the bill when it was being debated in the Senate. One of the key proposals of this bill relates to the Timor Gap. The Australia-Indonesia Timor Gap Treaty establishes a zone of cooperation between Australia and Indonesia in the once disputed seabed between the two countries. The zone of cooperation allows the exploration and exploitation of resources by dividing the region into three areas which are controlled independently and jointly by Australia and Indonesia. The Australian Customs Service advises that it has recently become concerned that its barrier control and enforcement measures do not extend to the of movement of passengers and cargo into and out of the zone controlled by Australia. It has further suggested that this ,poses some threat to the national security. Accordingly, the bill before the House amends the definitions of 'places outside Australia' to incorporate bodies of water and resource installations, including zone A of the Timor Gap. The amendment ensures that passengers and cargo movements around the Timor Gap art(subject to normal Australian Customs Service barrier control and enforcement activities. The coalition is nof opposed to these amendments. As I have said previously in this place, it is delighted to support any measure within reason which enhances the safety of the community. The second key amendment extends the nature of the material to be provided by a master or owner of a ship upon arrival of that vessel in an Australian port. Currently, the information provided includes details of the arrival of the vessel in the port, the names of the crew members and details of cargo being carried on board. There is no legislative requirement for the captain to advise of personal effects being carried by crew of the vessel, leaving the way open for goods which would otherwise attract duty to be brought into the country. This bill seeks to rectify that situation by requiring a ship's master or captain to include details of the possessions was of crew upon arrival reports. A penalty for failure to comply is introduced, namely, the surrender to the Crown of any undeclared items found in the possession of a crew member. Again, the coalition does not oppose this measure. Honourable members would be aware that preferential rates of duty are applied to imported goods from selected developing countries, such as many of the less developed Asian and African nations. Honourable members would also be aware that under the terms of the Australia-New Zealand closer economic relations agreement a zero rate of duty is applied to goods imported from New Zealand. This bill clarifies the rules which determine whether goods are the manufacture or produce of a nominated country for the purpose of a preferential rate of duty. A new division is inserted into the Customs Act to provide a more accurately defined and predictable basis for determining the origin of goods. The old concept of factory or works cost of goods has been replaced by a new percentage rule based on allowable factory costs as a percentage of total factory costs. Of course, new definitions of allowable factory expenditure costs-including raw materials, labour and overheads-are included. In respect of imports from New Zealand, a two per cent margin of tolerance for manufacturers seeking to meet prescribed content requirement is also introduced. The margin is largely designed to accommodate changing circumstances which are beyond the control of the manufacturer, such as fluctuating exchange rates, and which may otherwise result in a shipment failing to meet the prescribed preference criteria. In a new initiative, one which I believe has considerable merit, a diagram and explanatory notes to explain the operation of preferential country arrangements as they apply to New Zealand are also included. The remaining amendments are of a minor and administrative nature only: for example, a facility to wipe"" electronic import entries off the computer system where duty has not been paid on the items on that entry is introduced. In most cases the amendments are simply to correct previous drafting errors, legislative omissions or administrative procedures. In spite of this, and given that the government has removed its proposed changes to the AntiDumping Authority, the coalition will not oppose this bill. I tum now to the other bill before the House, the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill. The Australian shipbuilding industry has rightly been held up as one of the shining lights of Australian industry. It has progressed from a highly protected, inefficient and inward looking sector in the 1970s to an automated, innovative sector with an ever increasing focus on exports. In the 1980s the Australian shipbuilding sector was under a lot of pressure. Employment levels were high, technology was outdated and exports were non-existent. However, in conjunction with the shipbuilding plan, the industry rallied, reorganised itself and changed its focus. The result is the industry that we have today. The structure of the shipbuilding sector has altered with the new geographicallocntions of the industry now centring in the emerging states of Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. The nature of the vessels being produced has also changed. Vessels have moved away from the large ships and tankers of yesteryear towards the high speed, fastmoving ferries, catamarans and leisure craft that we see today. Australian shipbuilders are seen to be at the forefront of technology in the construction of very fast ferries and ships and \are generally considered to be the preeminent builders of the larger capacity, high speed passenger and cargo vessels. The industry is rapidly segregating into three distinct tiers which provide broader coverage of markets and greater opportunities. These tiers include builders constructing large capacity vessels for international markets. These builders have developed sophisticated finance and corporate structures and are committed to the development and use of leading edge technology. There are niche market product builders that are concentrating on the efficient production of large vessels using established designs, and there are smaller boatbuilders constructing pleasure and fishing vessels primarily for the domestic market. Australia's market share of world ship production is estimated to be around 10 per cent, up from virtually zero in 1985. Revenue from exports grew from virtually nil in 1984 to $155 million in 1990-91. The total turnover of the .shipbuilding industry continues to grow. In 1990-91, turnover was estimated to be $1.4 billion, while the industry employs some 6,200 people. The industry's increased market share is largely the result of the development of innovative ship design and new construction methods that have allowed the use of such materials as aluminium, composite and glass reinforced plastics. The Asia-Pacific region, with its large number of water-based nations and emerging wealth has become a major target market for Australian shipbuilders. In 1992, approximately 70 per cent of the vessels constructed in Australia were sold in the Asia-Pacific region. The activities of producers of passenger and cargo ferries have been especially impressive. Production is up from 15 vessels in 1988 to 35 in 1992, and another 10 are on order. Most of these vessels were destined for the export market. Honourable members may be interested to know that many passengers travelling across the English Channel do so in an Australian built ferry. International Catamarans Australia of Tasmania manufactures and exports ferries to transport passengers across the English Channel, building three or four vessels a year worth around $30 million per vessel. The wave piercing catamaran, which this company produces, is an Australian invention and is generally described as the most significant breakthrough in naval architecture this century. Passengers commuting between Hong Kong and China also travel on an Australian ferry. Austal Ships of Western Australia supply aluminium catamarans to the Asian market. This company is the biggest producer and major world supplier of this type of passenger ferry. It has recently secured contracts to export to Europe which are worth $30 million to $50 million. The annwll sales of Austal Ships are currently around $70 million and it employs some 200 people. Oceanfast Pty Ltd, also of Western Australia, has just secured a $120 million contract with an Asian country. To fill this contract, Oceanfast plans to invest $8 million in a new factory and equipment and employ some 400 people. As these examples illustrate, the industry has come a long way in a very short time. I agree with the industry commentators; the industry still has great untapped potential. This is in spite of government, not because of it. The industry has struggled to improve its performance in the face of the worse recession in 60 years. It has also been confronted with a range of onerous burdens imposed. by government. Taxes, charges, regulation and labour on-costs have all hindered our international competitiveness. Indeed, if it were not for our advanced technology, superior marketing and exploitation of niche markets-in short, the industry'S own initiative-we would have to wonder where this sector would be today. This is not just my view, but one also shared by the Acil Consulting Group which, in its report on Australia's high speed shipbuilding industry, suggested that Australia did not have a natural advantage in the construction of vessels. On Acil's international scoreboard, Australia ranked eighth behind Japan, the United States, the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Norway. Acil's report stated: Viewed against the general competitiveness environment Australian shipbuilding strengths are fundamentally those of the industry: it owes nothing to the general economic environment. If the shipbuilding industry did not have its own strengths, it would not enjoy the competitive position it occupies today. This suggests that the industry is well placed to benefit significantly from any improvements in the general economic environment in Australia. Equally without such improvements the industry will face intense competitive pressures from shipbuilders in the rest of the world. This view was confirmed in submissions and evidence presented to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology during its inquiry into the shipbuilding bounty. One industry association pointed out to the committee that regulations applying to the labour market, health and safety, red tape and taxation policy all had an impact on the industry. A second industry association was even more refined in its comments. It said: With a high level of wages and on-cost loadings such as payroll tax, holiday loadings and three percent superannuation contributions etc, Australian industry has had some major problems to overcome. A local dockyard commented on the low levels of productivity and suggested that they were due to award conditions. It expressed particular concern in its submission about the effect of the 38-hour week on idle machinery time and postponement of contract delivery times. The committee, in its final report entitled The shipbuilding industry-in the wake of the bounty, tacitly criticised the government over the· burdens it imposed on industry. The committee said: Taxation policy in relation to investment and depreciation, particularly when compared to other countries, was considered not to encourage major investment in the industry. It went on to say: The Committee is aware of the arguments that labour market regulations, occupational health and safety requirements and environmental protection measures can serve to increase manufacturers cost and have the effect of decreasing the international competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry. I think the committee, which was headed by a Labor member of this House, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), very adequately summed up what the opposition has been saying for many years. But the tragedy is that this government has not listened. Rather than take action to remove the impediments to industry, the government has taken the easy way out by simply, at this stage, extending the bounty. The coalition does not plan to oppose the extension of the bounty because we understand very well the sorts of burdens that the industry is operating under and the detrimental impact that they have on this sector's international competitiveness. But, as I mentioned, we are concerned that the government has sidestepped the real issues. It has neglected to address those things which could make our shipbuilding industry a potential force in the world market in the long run. I stress the long-term aspect; not just until 1997 when the bounty expires, but well into the next decade. The potential for the industry is there. According to the Acil Consulting Group, world market demand for high speed ferries and, particularly, wave piercing ferries is substantial. It suggests that there are four key factors underlying this market growth. Firstly, faster ocean transport offers market opportunities not previously open to ferries. These opportunities are traditionally seen as being the domain of air travel because of its speed and includes the transport of fresh vegetables and produce, flowers and components or parts used for 'just in time' manufacturing. These opportunities will largely be confined to Europe, South-East Asia and the Mediterranean. More easily manoeuvrable vessels and increasing access to city centres is the second factor behind growing demand. Thirdly, the ageing of the existing fleet provides an obvious impetus to market growth. Finally, the economics of operating fast ferries, especially for passenger and cargo transport, favours the industry. High speed vessels have lower operating costs and lower capital costs. The long-term future for this industry will be assured if the government gets its act together and moves to enhance the industry'S competitiveness. I suggest to the government that simply extending the bounty is not the way to do this. The shipbuilding bounty has a rather chequered history. It was the subject of an Industries Assistance Commission review in 1988. The review found that shipbuilding was a growing industry with Australian firms developing expertise in the design and production of high speed passenger and cargo vessels. It noted even then that the industry was internationally competitive and that exports were growing. Currency depreciation, better marketing, improved engineering and the availability of the bounty were all listed as key factors behind the improved performance of the industry. The Industries Assistance Commission was, however, critical of the administration of the bounty. It found that multiple rates of bounty were available, that payment of the bounty to firms was selective and that lengthy registration and approval times led to considerable uncertainty in the industry. The government subsequently restructured the shipbuilding bounty assistance, incorporating many of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendations. The new arrangements became operational in 1989. The bounty is currently paid in respect of the construction and modification of selfpropelled vessels over 150 gross construction tonnes. Bounty is payable on vessels destined for both the domestic and international markets. Under the current schedule, a bounty of 15 per cent was paid in 1991, phasing down to zero in 1995. The government announced during the election campaign that it would extend the payment of bounty until 1997 and gradually phase down the reduction in payments to minimise the impact on industry. The new arrangements are designed to bring the payment of bounty into line with the reduction in general manufacturing tariffs and other bounty rates which also phase down to five per cent by 1996. The more cynical amongst us might suggest that this was a more transparent ploy by the government to win marginal seats in Western Australia and Tasmania. This bill puts a new schedule into place. In closing, the coalition will not oppose this bill. But in doing this, I would like to reiterate our very strong concerns about the lack of government action on key micro-economic and labour market reform measures which would entrench the shipbuilding sector as a major competitive force in world markets.",85
170,Mr GRIFFIN,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"Corinella) (5.49 p.m.)Given the time allotted for this cognate debate and the fact that others are wishing to speak, I will endeavour to be brief. I would like to speak firstly on the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1993. The original act provides that bounty is payable to registered shipbuilders who incur eligible costs in the construction or modification of bountiable vessels in Australia where the construction or modification is completed between 1 July 1989 and 30 June 1995. The sorts of costs incurred by a shipbuilder in the construction or modification of a bountiable vessel include design costs, direct material costs, subcontracting costs, fitting out costs, costs of trialing, and transportation costs involved in delivering a completed vessel. In the 1993 election campaign, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that the shipbuilding bounty scheme would be continued beyond 1995 and that the 10 per cent bounty rate, which was to have been reduced to five per cent this financial year, would be continued for several years when it would again be reduced to five per cent. It was estimated at that time that these measures would cost $57 million over four years. This bill will give effect to the government's election undertaking. The reason for extending the life of the bounty and phasing down the bounty rate from 10 per cent to five per cent over four years, rather than an immediate drop to five per cent as was currently scheduled, was stated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the  second reading speech to this bill. He said: The government recognises the problems that could result from premature phasing out of assistance and proposes to extend the bounty in line with general manufacturing tariffs. The more gradual reduction in the bounty rate will sustain the competitive gains made by the industry. As mentioned by the previous speaker, the  the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology published a report entitled The shipbuilding industry: in the wake of the bounty, which was tabled in June 1992. In relation to the bounty, the committee remarked as follows: The Committee recognises the concern of industry that while the bounty is being reduced in Australia, some competitor nations are subsidising their industries significantly both directly and indirectly. The Committee endorses, however, the decision arising from the lAC Report of 1988 which recommended a decrease in the bounty as it had achieved its aim of enabling the industry to enter export markets, but was not encouraging the growth of a viable, efficient industry. That committee raised a number of recommendations, some of which were mentioned by the previous speaker. However, I think particular aspects of the report need to be emphasised at this time in terms of the future of the industry. The then Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce was urged to take action to encourage a viable, efficient shipbuilding industry by exploring what assistance other than subsidies could be given to the industry to promote its ability to be export competitive, for example, through the use of financial packages for shipbuilding loans and internationally competitive interest rates; and to encourage an international recognition of the desirability of limiting subsidisation practices which distort the international shipbuilding market. The whole shipbuilding industry is a crucial one for the future of Australia. Australia needs a shipbuilding industry which will ensure that we have construction facilities available to make us a maritime nation on a continuing basis so that we are not entirely the mercy of the overseas markets in relation to the cost of maritime transport. We as a government must work towards that in a way which involves not only the industry but also the unions involved both in the construction stage and in the actual provision of maritime services. This industry has potential and it has shown that potential. It was reported in the 1991-92 annual report of the then Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce that, in a survey of registered shipbuilders for the period ending 30 June 1992, the Australian private commercial shipbuilding industry's order book-comprising vessels under construction and on finu order-had increased by eight per cent compared with the level at 30 June 1991 and that over 80 per cent of the industry's order book represented vessels for export compared with nil in 1984-85. On the basis of vessels under construction at 30 June 1992, it was estimated that the value of exports in 1992-93 would increase to approximately $200 million. It is clear from that that the industry has great potential. It is an industry which can expand. It is an industry which can also do bit on the balance of payments front to improve our position in tenus of exports and also in tenus of import replacement. As I mentioned earlier, there has been micro-economic reform in the maritime industry as a whole in the last few years. refonu has occurred particularly in the labour market. When speaking to the unions and the people who are actually involved, we find that this industry has had massive cuts in employment. That has been achieved on a cooperative basis-generally on a consensus basisand in a way that has maximised efficiency. Ships that previously had crews of up to 36 are now down to crews of 18. There have been major decreases in manning levels and there are probably more still to come. We are seeing improved career structures. On a personal level, members of my family and friends of the family who are involved in the shipping industry, although they were seamen initially, over time have been able to get their certificates and move up through the system. at It was hard for them because in years gone by there was no system to actually encourage that progression. But, through increased training and an improvement in the way the industry operates on a labour market basis, we are now seeing that people can move through from the lowliest AB ranks right up to the master of the ship. We have to continue that process in a constructive way into the future. I think we can do it and I think the signs are there that we are doing it. The Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 is an omnibus bill that amends the Customs Act 1901, the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 and two other customs legislation acts of 1992. One of the major purposes of the bill is: Refinement of provisions to CER Agreements with NZ, PNG, Canada, Christmas and Cocos Islands. I would like to talk particularly about New Zealand in that context. The previous speaker went through the detail of the amendments and I do not propose to do that as well. But the key aim of the amendments proposed by the bill is to better define and get a more predictable basis for calculating the origin of its goods. When we look at the question of trade with New Zealand, which this legislation relates to, we are seeing some amazing figures coming through as to what that means great for this country in tenus of its economic perfonuance and how important it is to the That overall operation of the region. In the period 1983 to 1989, total bilateral trade between Australia and New Zealand grew from $1.99 billion to $4.5 billiongreater than the growth in each country's trade with the rest of the world. In 1989-90, New Zealand was Australia's fifth largest source of imports, supplying approximately 4.2 per cent of total imports. New Zealand was Australia's fourth largest export market, taking approximately 5.3 per cent of total Australian exports. Australia was .New Zealand's largest source of imports in 198990, supplying approximately 20.8 per cent. In 1988-89, Australian exports of services to New Zealand were valued at $1.328 billion and accounted for approximately 37.4 per cent of the total value of its goods and services exports to New Zealand. New Zealand's services exports to Australia were valued at $986 million, 33.3 per cent of the total value of its exports to Australia. The continuing development of trade in this region and the closer economic ties with New Zealand are, I think, central to what will happen in this area in relation to international trade. Much has been said about the GATT talks and NAFfA. When we look at the question of trade, one thing is clear: as the world becomes freer the fact remains that local markets will still be crucial. New Zealand remains a crucial local market to Australia, and vice versa. One aspect of the bill which I understand has been withdrawn to an extent relates to changes to the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988. I would like to say a couple of things about dumping. In my time in this place, and prior to that in my time as a candidate, I do not think any other issue was raised with me with such vigour and concern by small businesses and many ordinary Australians as the question of dumping. Dumping occurs when products from one country are exported to another country at less than their normal price. Anti-dumping legislation is designed to combat the unfair trading advantage gained from dumping or from subsidised exports. Over the last couple of years I have found it very difficult to establish when dumping is occurring. I have been told many times that a particular product was being dumped in Australia and that something needed to be done. But, upon checking, that was often found not to be the case. It is an area where we must remain ever vigilant, because if we are not we will continually be taken to task by unscrupulous importers from overseas. We have to work on those issues all the way through and we have to make sure that we keep a good, strong anti-dumping regime in place at times when other parts of the world are still not showing the same commitment to free and reasonable trade as we are showing. I commend both bills to the House and wish them a speedy passage through the parliament.",91
171,Mr SHARP,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"I rise this afternoon to support my colleague the shadow minister for manufacturing and service industries, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), who spoke for this side of the House just a few minutes ago. I thank the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) for the brevity of his remarks, ensuring that we get through the business of the House in a more speedy fashion tonight because we have a lot of things to do over the next couple of days. I wish to direct my comments to the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1993 which is of particular interest to me, being shadow minister for transport and having had responsibility for the maritime industry since 1989. It is an area that I have grown to understand reasonably well, and I would like to think those in the industry understand me reasonably well. One of the things that we come to understand if we have studied this area for some time is that Australia's shipbuilding industry, contrary to popular opinion, has seen a resurgence in recent years. The honourable member for Forrest pointed that out quite handsomely in his remarks earlier today. Some years ago in places like Newcastle and other major shipbuilding centres we had a major closure of our shipbuilding yards. That was preceded by the usual round of strikes, upset and publicity that goes with it. As a result of that, most Australians have it firmly entrenched in their minds that we do not build ships in this country any more, and therefore the shipbuilding industry is of little consequence. However, it is of major consequence to us today. The shipbuilding industry in Australia is worth several hundred million dollars a year in export earnings. It is growing at a rapid rate. We are establishing new markets for our product around the world and we are making a very significant impact in certain parts of the world with the sorts of vessels that the honourable member for Forrest was referring to. I refer particularly to the wave piercing ferries manufactured in Tasmania and Western Australia, using a natural advantage that Australia has-the technology that we have been able to develop. That has really put us at the leading edge of ferry construction. Those companies deserve congratulations for the work that they have done and the ingenuity that they have generated. We hope that they will continue to earn Australia many dollars and provide employment for Australians into the future. The purpose of the bill is to extend the bounty to the industry. Off the top of my head, I think the bounty applies to all ships constructed of a gross weight of over 150 tonnes. This means that, through the bounty, we can help our ferry building industry and thus establish a competitive place for ourselves in a very competitive marketplace. Having said that, I must express some criticism of the way in which the government is approaching not only the shipbuilding industry, but many other industries as well. Because we are talking about the shipbuilding industry, I will refer directly to it. I put to the House that we do not need bounties if the government takes a totally different approach to the way in which it goes about helping Australian industry in a competitive marketplace. The government has chosen to apply many taxes to the business inputs of industries like the shipbuilding industry: the payroll tax, the sales tax, and taxes that affect things like fuel. Taxes on fuel affect the total cost of transport, which is a big component in everything that we do here in Australia. The government has chosen to apply those sorts of taxes and, over the years, to increase them. To try to offset the effect of those taxes it is providing a bounty-a direct cheque in the mail, let us say, to offset the high cost of producing things in this country. That is one way of going about it. I guess, from the shipbuilder's point of view, he is not particularly worried which way he gets the assistance, as long as it comes one way or the other. The government has chosen to send the shipbuilders a cheque in the mail. Prior to the last federal election the opposition took a totally different view of how we would assist industries like our Australian shipbuilding industry to compete in a competitive marketplace. Our view would have been that, rather than continue the bounty for an extra few years, we would certainly have maintained the bounty according to the previous schedule. But at the same time we would have done away with many of those taxes which affect the cost of building ships in Australia. There is no question at all that the impact of payroll tax and sales tax is a major deterrent to our industries being competitive. Industries have to write those taxes into their costs and reflect those taxes in the prices that they charge for the ships that they build. We would have done away with those taxes and removed those costs from our shipbuilders, and thus put the shipbuilders in a position where they were not dependent upon a cheque in the mail or a bounty, but rather dependent upon a government doing away with those business taxes. A coalition government had committed itself to doing away with those taxes; they would have been gone forever. Those are two methods of assisting shipbuilding in this country, and each one has its merits. I would also put the proposition-as I have done' on other occasions-that the shipbuilding industry in Australia would receive far greater long-term benefit from having things like sales taxes, payroll taxes and fuel taxes done away with, rather than having a bounty system extended for another couple of years, which is effectively what we are doing here today. There is no doubt that doing away with those taxes would mean that they were gone forever, whereas this bounty system is going to step down incrementally over the next few years and will disappear by the year 1997. In 1997 our shipbuilders will be out there in the marketplace with all of these business taxes having to be written into their costs with no offsetting bounty to assist them in this competitive marketplace in which they have been so successful to date. I question how competitive our shipbuilders will be post-1997, and I think many people in the shipbuilding industry would also put that question to the government. How are they going to cope without a bounty whilst still having to pay all these business taxes that affect the cost of everything that they do? I make this plea to the government: if it wants to nurture this industry further to allow Australia to continue to earn those valuable export dollars, create those valuable jobs and bring prestige for Australia internationally by having people in China and Hong Kong and other parts of the world travelling in Australian-built ferries on their day-today journey to and from work or wherever it may be, it has to be prepared to look at dispensing with the effect of these taxes on our shipbuilding industry. I hope that the government will take the lead that the coalition showed in its Fightback package and look to doing away with these taxes so that the industry can be competitive forever, rather than having to depend upon a disappearing bounty to continue to be competitive. I think it would be a shame not to mention that the government has delivered a significant blow to the shipping industry in Australia. That, of course, affects the shipbuilding industry because if the shipping industry in Austraiia is viable and competitive, the shipowners can afford to buy new ships and have them built. The viability of the shipping industry in Australia was severely set back in the government's budget of 17 August this year when it increased the excise on fuel by 5c a litre. We might say, 'Five cents a litre; so what?' Five cents a litre for the shipping industry is in effect a doubling of the excise that the industry has to pay. For those who do not understand, most ships use what is called bunker oil. Bunker oil is a very unrefined, or not very well refined, oil and it has in the past had an excise of 5.5c a litre applied to In the budget the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) added another 5c to that-nearly doubling it. It was a 92 per cent increase, in fact. - r JulI-Stupid.",93
172,Mr SHARP,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"As the honourable member for Fadden interjects, it was a very stupid decision. It was opposed, quite rightly, by the industry. If the Greens and Senator Harradine had stuck with us in the Senate, we would have been able to lift the effect of that increase by blocking the increase in the Senate. Unfortunately, Senator Harradine backed out at the last minute, which was a very silly decision from his point of view because his state of Tasmania that he represents in the Senate is greatly affected by shipping costs. He backed down and Senator Margetts forgot to turn up for the second round of voting, having initially moved the amendment to exempt the increase in the excise on bunker fuel for the shipping industry. If they had turned up and voted in the way they had in the original round of voting in the Senate, the shipping industry would not have had this increase in excise. The industry now has a 3c per litre increase in the excise on its fuel, which is a small win, if you like, but it is not much of a win at all. The shipping industry has effectively lost any of the gains that it had from its reforms. As honourable members would know, over the last three or four years the shipping industry has undertaken a very significant reform program, the second round of a shipping reform program which started in the very early 1980s under the tutelage of Ralph Hunt, the minister for transport in the previous Fraser-Anthony government. Many gains have been made by the in9ustry-crewing levels have been brought down-and a fair swag of those gains was completely. washed away because of the government's decision to increase the excise on bunker oil used by our Australian shipping industry. It is terribly relevant, when we talk about assisting our shipbuilding industry, which this bill in the House today covers, that we look at not only the way we can help the shipbuilding industry, but also the way in which this government treats the potential customers it. of our shipbuilding industry, that is, the shipowners themselves. There is no question that in the budget of August this year the government did the shipping industry in Australia a great deal of harm by ,putting up the excise on fuel and, as a result, it has made the customers of our' shipbuilding industry less viable. If we want to help the shipbuilding industry, we have to help the customers that it has to service, and this goventinent is going about it in the totally wrong way. It has a cargo mentality when it comes to transport because it has put up the cost of excise not only on ship bunker oil, but also on the road transport industry by 5c a litre. Of course, people who are unfortunate enough to drive a pre-1986 car, which the average Australian does, have had their fuel put up by 7c a litre, because that is the extra increase that leaded fuels have experienced through the budget in August of this year. No matter which way we look, at the end of the day, the government is not doing much to help these industries and, indeed, is probably harming these industries by its cargo cult mentality of putting up fuel excise whilst, on the other hand, turning around and trying to compensate a little by increasing things such as the ships bounty that we have talked about today. If the government wants to really help our shipbuilding industry, as I am sure it probably does, it should dispense with those taxes which affect the cost of business here in Australia, such as payroll tax, sales tax and fuel tax, and not put up the excise on bunker oil, to ensure that our ship industry in Australia remains viable and is able to go out and order new ships built here in Australia. If we do that, so many other benefits will flow from that as well, which will more than compensate for any loss of income that the federal government will experience as a result of doing away with those taxes. I am sure that at the end of the day the Australian economy will be better off without bounties, by doing away with all those business taxes that make Australian industry uncompetitive and, of course, throwing in a little industrial relations reform in the process. The opposition, as the honourable member for Forrest has pointed out very adequately in his speech, is not opposing this bill before the House today. We aresupporting it because we recognise that these types of bounties are necessary to overcome this government's reluctance to do away with a very substantial number of taxes which affect the viability of the Australian shipbuilding industry.",95
173,Mr LINDSAY,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development) (6.14 cult p.m.)-In closing the debate, I acknowledge the competent contributions made by the  and the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) in the second reading debate. Indeed, the speeches by both of those honourable members were quite detailed and showed a breadth of understanding of the issues, which was very helpful. I am sure that it will be appreciated by people in the industries that are affected by these bills. ' Normally one hears an erudite contribution from the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp). He has been shadow minister for transport for some time now and I acknowledge his understanding of road transport issues, as it is quite profound. But on this issue he is dead wrong. I do not know whether he was listening to what the honourable member for Forrest said this evening in this debate. I do not think he was. How on earth can he come into the House and utter the mumbo jumbo and babble that he went on with during the second reading debate? He wants to abolish the taxes. He referred to them in his speech during the second reading debate. Is the honourable member for Hume, a person whom I respect greatly, suggesting that this government should introduce a goods and services tax to replace the taxes? He is not? Is he suggesting that someone should introduce a 15 per cent goods and services tax? Is he suggesting that the government should abolish the bounties? Is he suggesting, for example, that the government should follow some of the more crazy proposals in Fightback, such as cutting government expenditure by $10 billion? What effect would that have on the shipbuilding industry in this country, particularly the naval shipbuilding industry in this country? I do not know whether the honourable member has heard the remarks made by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), but the honourable member for Mayo described Fightback as a 700-page suicide note. In my extensive travels in my current position as parliamentary secretary, from Western Australia right across to northern Australia and down the Queensland coast, not even the most rabid conservative voter could stand the mention of the word Fightback-not one. These measures introduced by the government have been welcomed by the industry after much consultation and, indeed, are supported by the opposition. I want to counsel my friend the honourable member for Hume. It is all very well for him to say in the confessional, where no-one is listening, that he supports Fightback or a GST. But if he takes that message out into the wider electorate, even in his own electorate, he will find people-even his most fervent supporters-with deep misgivings about Fightback or a GST. Turning to the bills before the House, I deal firstly with the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1993. The year 1992-93 was a year of strong export growth coupled with increased employment in the shipbuilding industry. In fact, a survey of builders in December 1992 indicated that the value of vessels expected to be completed by shipbuilders registered under the act in 1992-93 was about $294 million, almost double the level of the previous year. The June 1993 survey results provide further indication of strong export performance in 1993-94. As has been said by previous speakers, Australian builders have led their competitors into the fast ferry sector. Recent press reports have drawn attention to the success of firms in this industry. The honourable member for Forrest and the honourable member for Corinella mentioned some of those firms. For example, they mentioned International Catamarans Australia Pty Ltd, located in Hobart, which sells wave piercing catamarans and last financial year had a turnover of $75 million. The company is gearing up to produce one every two months and employment is expected to grow to over 400 people. Austal Ships Pty Ltd, located in Henderson in Western Australia, has had extraordinary success in selling 20 high speed catamarans to Asia since 1990. Its most recent order from China is for three 40-metre catamarans, the first Australian built vessels to be turbine powered. So far as the bounty is concerned, this government believes that Australia's builders deserve at least the same backing from government as other Australian manufacturers get while they tackle the competitive challenges ahead. As to who can receive the bounty, I think it should be mentioned that there are two basic requirements for the bounty to be paid. First, a shipbuilder must meet registration criteria set out in section 70 of the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989. These principles are aimed at registration of those shipbuilders who have the potential to be world competitive. This approach has produced successes, and I gave two examples in my earlier remarks. The bounty is open to any new builder who seeks registration at any time. It is open· to all will registered builders who are required to reapply for registration annually. In contrast, the more laissez-faire approach to registration that operated in the early 1980s failed to establish a viable industry in Australia. The second requirement for receiving a bounty is covered by section 4 of the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989. It requires a bountiable vessel to be between 150 and 20,000 gross construction tonnes and to be both self-propelled and navigable. Modification work on a bountiable sized vessel in excess of $1 million is also bountiable. I believe that there may be other potential shipbuilders in Australia who are not aware of the eligibility criteria to receive a bounty. I hope that, as a result of this debate, they will be encouraged to make inquiry and perhaps receive a bounty. The bounty is not a great deal of money. In 1992-93, the cost of the bounty was $24,241,000. The allocation for 1993-94 is $26,676,000. As the honourable member for Forrest and the honourable. member for Corinella said, the income earned by Australia with respect to this revitalised industry-the shipbuilding industry-speaks for itself. It has been a success story that every Australian, I am sure, is very proud of. I now wish to mention the main features of the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. The first is the refinement of the rules of origin as a consequence of the 1992 closer economic relations review. These amendments are intended to provide greater guidance on the use of the provisions and to close loopholes which have enabled the abuse of the spirit of the rules of origin. The amendments retain most of the elements of the existing rules of origin whilst introducing significant changes to the rules relating to goods of mixed origin. Secondly, there is an introduction of a new definition of 'place outside of Australia' to ensure tighter customs control over people and goods moving between Australia and installations in area A in the zone of cooperation in the Timor Gap, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Forrest. Thirdly, there is the introduction of the requirement that a sh-p's arrival report under section 64AA of the Customs Act 1901 contain particulars of the personal effects of the Finally, there is the introduction of a number of technical amendments to the provisions of the Customs Act 1901 which, as the honourable member for Forrest said, deal with the electronic lodgement of import entries. There is one other matter that I wanted to mention before closing this debate. There were some concerns expressed by New Zealand over certain provisions of this bill which it claims would introduce restrictions on trans-Tasman trade and create discrepancies between Australia and New Zealand. I believe that those concerns have been more than satisfactorily answered. There has been wide consultation between Australia and New Zealand in respect of this issue. There was a substantial process of negotiation which thoroughly canvassed all the relevant issues over the last two years. Each country has its own sovereign rights to decide how these agreements are implemented. Australia does not seek to dictate to New Zealand how it interprets agreements and legislation, and vice versa.",96

176,Mr LINDSAY,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development) (6.26 p.m.)-in reply-In respect of the Customs crew. Legislation Amendment Bill, there is one matter that I wish to raise, that of gold chain jewellery. Gold chain jewellery enters Australia duty free from New Zealand, and has done so for some years. The Australian gold jewellery industry objected to what it perceived as the unfair duty free competition from minimal processing operations in New Zealand. Gold chain roll is made in Italy from gold allegedly mined in New Zealand. It is then imported into New Zealand as Italian gold chain roll. The roll is cut into lengths and a 25c clasp added-that is, minimal valueadding is undertaken in New Zealand. It is then exported to Australia as New Zealand gold chain. Australian authorities took action in this matter. This legislation will ensure that that kind of conduct or subterfuge will not be allowed to continue. In view of the time remaining for debate on this bill, I close my remarks and commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

177,Mr SHARP,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"Since the subject of the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Bill 1993 is in part the same as the one we were debating earlier, it affords me the opportunity to make some brief remarks regarding the comments that the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) made a few moments ago. I make the point that in the debate on the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill I was drawing attention to the fact that the high cost of taxes-which this government is imposing at an increasing rate as a result of the last budget-negates the benefit that industry gets out of having these bounty bills extended for another couple of years. There is no question in my mind that whether we are talking about shipbuilding or road transport, as we are with this bill, the high cost of taxes-something that this government has turned into an art form-is impairing the ability of the shipbuilding industry, the road transport industry and the shipping industry to compete. The point I was making earlier was that, if the government wants to do something to help industry get on with the job of making Australia competitive, earning us income and creating jobs, it must get out of this cargo cult mentality. In the last budget, the government not only put up fuel excise but it also put up sales tax. That has all been an added cost to the shipbuilding industry and the road transport industry. I believe I am right when I get up in this House and say that one of the ways we can help our industries-whether it is the shipbuilding industry or any other industryover the longer term is not by introducing or extending bounties into the future but by doing away with the cost of taxes that those industries have to bear as a consequence of this government's decisions in its annual budget statements. I will refer to this in more detail in my remarks on the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Bill, which is a bill that the opposition will be supporting. On a previous occasion we have debated a similar bill which was designed to establish national uniform rules, regulations and charges that apply to the road transport industry. As I said in a debate in this House on a similar type of bill which aimed to achieve the same goals as this bill, the opposition will support these moves that the government is making and will continue to make in the House through the course of the next year or two. We support the bill for very good and practical reasons. They relate to the high cost that the road transport industry has experienced as a result of having a set of road rules, regulations and charges that are determined state by state but yet affect an industry which is essentially a national industry. So a truck leaving Queensland-the home state of the honourable member for Herbert-and going to Victoria by passing through New South Wales would find that, whilst it was totally legal and within all bounds of the law in Queensland, the minute it crossed the Queensland and New South Wales border it would suddenly become illegal. In order to become legal again in New South Wales so that it could· end its journ-y at its destination in Victoria a whole host of paperwork and charges would be imposed on the operator of that truck. In a country which sees itself as one nation, and in a parliament which represents the whole of the nation, that is seen as ridiculous. For those who have anything to do with the road transport industry-I have been involved with it over the last few years-they would recognise the extreme frustration that those road transport operators have suffered as a result of all of the paperwork, cost and inconvenience that state by state road regulations, charges and rules have imposed upon them. So the government has embarked on a course which is designed to overcome that. It is doing it with the cooperation and support in principle from· each of the states. It is also doing it with the very strong support and leadership from the peak body that represents road transport operators in Australia, the Road Transport Forum, which is ·led by Mr Bruce MCIver from Queensland. This is an issue that I think shows the merit of leadership at the state and federal levels and leadership at the industry level all working towards a common cause. I will point out in later remarks that, at the state level, state ministers are trying to deal with complications in their own particular way which makes it difficult to establish totally uniform charges, regulations and rules. However, despite their concerns at the individual state level, the states are supportive of this proposal in principle. Indeed, I have seen a letter that the Western Australian Minister for Transport, Mr Eric Charlton, has written in recent times outlining his views on this particular subject. But each state has its problems. This legislation passing through this House is known as peg legislation. It will apply only to the ACT but can be picked up by each of the states as a model to be applied in its own particular state. But I think division 2 clause 17 of this bill enables each of those states the rights to declare exemptions in its particular state. This will ensure that, if there is a particular problem or something is different in a state from other states, a state government and its state minister for transport have the right and the authority to make an exemption to enable that state to deal with its own particular road transport problems. That gives state ministers the comfort and confidence to proceed with this type of legislation. In talking about introducing this legislation in their own states, state ministers will know full well that, in the process of adopting national uniform laws in the road transport industry, they will have the ability and authority to make exemptions that are specific to their state to deal with their particular state's problems. But this is an area of microeconomic reform. It is an area that will help to reduce the cost of operating trucks in and around Australia. The road transport industry has established a reputation for being very innovative in reducing costs. Of all of the arms of the transport industry, road transport stands out as a shining light of what industry can do when there are people who are not only the owners but also the operators of their vehicles. As a result of being an owneroperator, they spend a great deal of time looking at ways of reducing their costs and increasing their capacity to generate income. Over the years the road transport industry has reduced its costs. Sadly, though, as I said in a speech earlier this morning, the government sees it as its right to pocket the dividends of those savings as the road transport industry reduces costs. We saw this in vivid colour in the August budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) when the government increased fuel excise by 5c per litre on diesel. The net effect of that is very significant. It roughs out at about $6,000 per truck on average per annum. I happened to be in the Northern Territory recently where I spoke to Jim Cooper, whom the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) possibly knows. He owns Gulf Transport and also has a significant share in Road Trains of Australia. They bring live cattle out of Queensland and the Northern Territory for export out of the port of Darwin. He showed to me how that 5c per litre increase in excise adds an extra $1.80 to the cost of a six-decker road train transporting cattle to the port of Darwin for live export. That is a very significant burden on our live cattle industry. It is a very competitive market where the difference of 50c per head can shift a buyer's decision from one country to another. Yet the net result of this government's decision in its budget of August of this year was to push up the cost of road transport in Australia, therefore reduce our ability to be competitive in the live cattle export market. Not only has the government put up the cost of fuel excise but it has also put up the cost of sales tax. The effect of that is to add about $2,400 to the cost of purchasing a truck. So each year road transport operators have to find an extra $6,000 a year from their revenues in order to pay the increase in fuel excise, plus an extra $2,400 every time they buy a new truck. That is very significant. One could say that if they put it up only 5c a litre that would be not so bad. But this government since it came into power just on 11 years ago has raised fuel excises from 6c a litre to 31 c a litre for un leaded and diesel fuels and 33c a litre for leaded fuel. That is an extraordinary increase. The revenues from fuel excise will have risen from approximately $1 billion per annum when Labor came into government in 1983 to $9.9 billion next year. That scandal highlights this government's cargo cult mentality on transport. The government does not look at ways to make transport more efficient or to assist road transport operators. This government sees transport, particularly road transport, as an opportunity to get more money for its coffers. Despite that huge increase in taxes over the past few years, road transport is still competigovernment tive against rail, shipping and aviation. Looking at the savings that could be achieved by reducing or removing those taxes, we see a clear picture emerging. Interestingly, under Fightback, the average truck operator would have saved per truck per year between $40,000 and $60,000 if we had done away with sales tax, payroll tax and fuel taxes. Mr O'Keefe-They didn't vote for you though.",99
178,Mr SHARP,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"A lot of truck operators did vote for us and, indeed, a lot more truck operators will vote for us the next time around because of the government's decision to put up fuel excises and cut road funding. Those figures I have quoted highlight the amount of tax that truck operators have to carry which, somehow or another, those people have managed to cope with. It is a great testament to the ability of Australian road transport operators that they find new ways of cutting costs and increasing their efficiencies. We support the bill on the basis that it helps reduce costs in the road transport industry, helps make the industry more efficient and helps do away with the paperwork and frustration that many people in our road transport industry have suffered for a long time. However, it is worth making the point that, if this government is doing something good here, as this bill does, it is turning around and doing something far worse by increasing the fuel excises and sales taxes that were brought down in the budget. We support the bill because it benefits the industry. But I take this opportunity to highlight-I know that government members would agree with me privately-the stupidity of increasing the tax burden on our road transport industry. Many road transport operators would understand an increased tax because most truck operators are fair dinkum blokes who believe that if they use something they have to pay for it. Although that attitude prevails, most of them think that fuel excises are a complete rip-off. In fact, I have not met a truck operator who thinks that they are not anything else _but that. Fuel excises are a rip-off because the is not contributing more funds to roads; indeed, the opposite is the case. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who will contribute to this debate in a little while, will also take the opportunity to point out that, using the forward estimates as a guide for road funding allocations in the last budget to the next budget, road funding has effectively been cut in half from $1,600 million to $800 million per annum, yet fuel excises are going up by about $2 112 billion over the same period. Most truck operators, being fair dinkum fellows, say, 'If we are going to pay a lot more money, why are they putting a lot less money back into roads?'. The other side of the coin in road transport is the state of the roads. A bad road is an expensive road to drive on. It adds to maintenance costs and reduces speed, thus increasing the time taken in getting from A to B and the overall costs. So road operators say that bad roads are costly roads and that bad roads are unsafe roads. As most trucks are operated by owner drivers, they take a particular interest in road safety because it affects them personally. If we cannot maintain our road infrastructure, as is increasingly the case, particularly on the lesser roads that we have to use around this country, driving dangers will no doubt increase. So road transport operators are very concerned about the state of our roads and hence Commonwealth road funding. I tum now to the uniformity that is being established in this bill. I recognise that each state has difficulties with the implementation of this legislation, as we saw with the previous legislation which sought the implementation of uniform vehicle registration charges. On that occasion, New South Wales had a problem because its truck registration charges would go down and income would be lost. In other states, truck registration charges would go up and therefore cause concern in those states of increased costs for truck operations. The same problem of road registration costs and charges is occurring with this legislation. The Western Australian government put it most aptly. I will quote from a letter written by the Western Australian Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton, who is doing an extremely good job. Whilst the Western Australian government, and he in particular, supports the principle of the legislation, he said that any desire to undermine the national reform process or obligation- arising from the heads of government agreement- is being undertaken by them simply because of their particular needs at the local state level. He also said: ... the geography and demography of this State are sufficiently different to warrant, on occasion, different transport solutions from the rest of the country ... He also said: ... there remains a very real risk that Western Australia will, on occasion, have to abide by decisions which it has not supported, and which inimical to the efficiency of this State's road transport and its users. In other words, Eric Charlton is saying, 'We support the principles of these bills. We will do our very best to implement them. But where our state has a need different from the national need we will override the national need with the state need'. People will say that is not helpful. The Road Transport Forum says that it is illogical to have exemptions for each state if we are trying to ensure national uniformity of road rules. . Despite that contradiction, I can understand the particular needs of each state. My colleague in the other place Senator O'Chee made a contribution on this same biII the other day and he pointed out the needs of livestock transport operators in Queensland and the need for volumetric loading arrangements. I am sure the honourable member for O'Connor will point out the needs in Western Australia which are recognised. in Eric Charlton's recent decision to extend access for road trains into the outer metropolitan areas of Perth. Each state has particular needs. Because of the long, Oat and straight roads in the Northern Territory, there is not the need for the same speed limits that apply in other states with lesser types of roads. This legislation caters for those needs if a state government feels it is necessary. The opposition will support this bill, as it will other bills designed to establish national uniformity, as long as those bills are reasonable, do not create too much problem with our state coIIeagues and do not go against the wish of the industry itself. We are happy to support them in that event-in the process, of course, airing any concerns that may be out there in the field at present. We support the measures because we are a national parliament and we beiieve it is important for Australia's transport industries to be efficient. One of the ways that can be achieved is by establishing uniform national laws so that trucks can travel from Queensland through New South Wales to Victoria, or from Victoria through South Australia to Western Australia, without having to chop are and change as .they go, adding extra cost and inconvenience as they go. We support the legislation, recognising each state's particular needs which can be catered for by this legislation. We express once again our increasing alarm at the cargo cult mentality that this government has with regard to our road transport industry. Again, I say to the government that if it wants to do good things for road transport in Australia it should reduce taxes, not increase them, so as to ensure that road transport operators can remain viable. Through that, we will have a healthy, competitive road transport industry servicing the needs of Australia and ensuring that this country has a better future and can create more jobs by having a more competitive economy.  p.m.)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I am wondering what you are doing here. I thought you' should be in Brussels at this time, having .regard to the great events happening there in which you played a part. I return to the bill before us. Mr O'Keefe-You might elucidate more on that.  Speaker was the deputy leader of a delegation to the European Parliament last year. That delegation was easily the best delegation that has ever attended the European Parliament and played a very constructive and positive role in advancing negotiations in respect of the agreement on GATT. I commend him on that. I am sorry he is not able to be there at this time. I return to the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Bill that is before us. It is part of a scheme designed to improve the safety and efficiency of road transport and to reduce the administrative costs associated with road transport operations in Australia. I do not want to canvass again all the provisions of the legislation as mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe) in introducing the bill, but I will touch upon a couple of them. I reinforce that the effect of the legislation will be in respect of the Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay territory only. The states and the Northern Territoryhave to pass complementary legislation to give effect to the operation of the new system of charges and the program of reform that is encompassed within the bill. This bill deals only with the operation of vehicles and traffic rules. I must say I find the words used in the legislation rather quaint. It is a 'walk softly, talk softly and carry a big stick' kind of approach. It is designed to put in place a range of regulations covering issues such as heavy vehicle standards, driver standards, traffic and vehicle operations. Traffic and vehicle operations include speed limits and are quite stringent. We know what happens with speed limits and how rigorously they can be enforced in respect of truck operations and similarly in respect of vehicle dimensions and weight limits. I am not suggesting that they should not be, but it should be done in a fair manner and in a manner that is appropriate. I will come back to that later. Further bills will be developed to deal with registration, driver licensing and compliance. They will be combined in time to form what will become the road transport law. That is a desirable direction to pursue. I return to the· comments made by my friend the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp). He and I say many things in this place with which we both agree. Let us fix this one he mentioned about the explosion in fuel excise. It was his predecessors, those on his side of the House-a. National Party minister, then known as a Country Party minister-who were very strongly in support of the introduction of the crude oil levy back in the late 1970s. That was when road users, truckies, motorists were slammed with the introduction of a heavy federal charge on fuel. That crude oil levy, together with a small level of excise, was still in place when we came into government in 1983. A couple of years down the track that was changed. The title of the charges was changed, but the collection remained somewhat the same and was subsequently indexed. So to make a comparison of $1 billion in 1983 with almost $10 billion in collection of fuel excise is a comparison of unlikes. It cannot be justified. I am surprised that the honourable member continues to repeat that kind of assertion. It undermines the good things he says, because there are some good things he says that I would like to support. But to dare to ascribe that to a cargo cult mentality is really over the top. It comes back to a bleeding heart sort of approach to things-this terrible increase in excises. The honourable member knows, as do all members of this chamber, that fuel excise is a form of general revenue. It is a form of indirect taxation, a portion of which is earmarked for use on roads. It can be earmarked in relation to use for transport matters. Unfortunately, in my view, conservative premiers went along 'with the untying of road funds at the Premiers Conference in 1991 which resulted in the amount of money earmarked for roads in this budget being less. But the amount of that money going across to the states is without any strings attached. The opposition cannot make those kinds of comparisons, saying, 'Road funding expenditure is being cut by the federal government'. It may be wearing another label now that it is untied, but the money is still available for the states to use. Similarly, of that big pot excise, the states get one dip, one handful, which comes out marked roads or transport. But they can dip out as much more as they want and use it on roads, if that is their priority at their budget table. So it is not an accurate presentation of what is happening in respect of charges on road use and charges on fuel. I think my friend undercut his presentation when he then said that, despite all the horrendous charges he has outlined, road transport still remains competitive against sea and rail. If it is, what the honourable member is inviting governments to do is jack up the charges some more. That is not what he wants or what I want; rather, the issue is that, across figure. surface transport, forms of transport have their own natural markets. If one looks at road and rail-those dreaded four-letter words-one sees that for about 40 per cent of the transport tasks rail has a natural advantage and for about 40 per cent of the transport tasks road has a natural advantage. We argue about the remaining 20 per cent. While we,. as members of this national parliament, allow ourselves to get drawn into that debate about what happens to the remaining 20 per cent, we are doing this nation a disservice because we should be concentrating on maximising the efficiency of the 80 per cent. We should be seeing that rail performs its task as efficiently as possible and that road performs its task as efficiently as possible. It is difficult to gather information on the road transport industry. The last comprehensive analysis of the industry was the national road transport review in 1983-84, which reported in 1984. That provided the last comprehensive set of statistical information. There has been some work done since then. I am looking at the road freight transport industry information paper No. 38 from BTCE from March of this year. To put some dimensions on the industry and try to get the debate back in its proper perspective so that people better understand it, it is interesting to look at employment in the road freight transport and storage industry. In 1991 there were 138,000 Australians of fuel employed in road transport compared to 108,000 in 1985. So there has been growth in that area. Road freight transport has performed quite strongly in respect of employment opportunities during that period from 1985 to 1991. If we look at the shares across the forms of transport between 1975-76 and 1990-91 on a tonne-kilometre-cargo-distance carried-basis, we find that road was carrying 35.1 billion tonne-kilometres of the surface transport tasks in 1975-76 and that grew to 82 billion tonne-kilometres by 1991. In percentage terms, the figure was 17.8 per cent in 1975-76 and that grew to 30.6 per cent by 1990-91. The figure was about 29.6 per cent in 1984-85, and it stayed at around that In the same period, 1975-76, on a cargodistance basis the percentage carried by rail was 29 per cent. It grew to 33.2 per cent. So road and rail transport are up. The big loser is sea transport which dropped from 53 per cent to 36 per cent. Air transport is nil in that figure. That gives a much better understanding of the situation. Let us look at the actual weights carried. Road transport carried some 72 112 per cent by weight in 19.75-76, which dropped to some 69.6 per cent by 1990-91. Rail transport grew from 22.6 per cent to 26.8 per ceht. Sea transport again dropped from 4.9 per cent to 3.6 per cent. So in terms of actual tonnages carried in those periods, sea transport lost again. When people think of road transport, they seem to conjure up this image of these great big rigs hurtling along between Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and all these places, but the vast bulk of road transport involves short haul journeys intrastate in rigid trucks. They are not big, fancy, new Kenworth, MAN or other brand rigs, they are not 22or 24wheelers cruising from Sydney to Melbourne; they are rigid trucks doing intrastate journeys. The proportion of freight moved by road between 1975-76 and 1991 was between 70 per cent and 76 per cent of the total. I now tum to the average distance covered by each form of transport. In 1975-76 the average distance that freight was carried by road was 49 1/2 kilometres; in 1990-91 it was 92 kilometres. So the average journey was a pretty short journey when we look at the road transport industry as a whole. The average rail journey was about 260 kilometres-a one kilometre difference in that IS-year period. The average sea journey has gone down a little from 2,202 kilometres to 2,109 kilometres. . People have an incorrect image of the transport industry. There are not all these great rigs hurtling across Australia. If honourable members go further into the publication I referred to, they will find that the number of articulated vehicles moving around is a relatively small proportion of the total number of trucks registered. The majority of road freight transport measured in tonne kilometres is performed intrastate and, as I mentioned earlier, this is particularly the case with vehicles. The same thing applies to articulated vehicles. In the period 1975-76 to 1987-88, the proportion of the task performed intrastate has gone from 96 per cent to 97 per cent for rigid vehicles, and from 67 per cent to 72 per cent for articulated vehicles. So 97 per cent of the freight carried by rigid trucks is intrastate freight, and 67 per cent of the tonnes articulated vehicles carried is intrastate. The interstate cargo is a much smaller proportion than most people would have thought. I have tried to give some sort of background to the' whole debate about the road transport industry. It is a vitally important industry in this nation. As I said in my earlier remarks, we should be concentrating on maximising the efficiency of the industry in respect of those cargoes which have a natural advantage. These are cargoes which are time sensitive, which are short haul or where rail does not exist. In much of Australia, rail is not available and will never be available. Road transport is the only form of transport available to Australians living and working in those areas who need supplies. It is similar with rail transport, which takes medium-long haul, bulk cargoes which obviously trucking and road transport are not suited to. For a longer journey with high energy efficiency and lower cost the best form of transport is by sea around our coastline. The honourable member for Hume referred to truck safety and to the fact that truck drivers are good blokes. They are good blokes. Most people in transport are good Australians who work hard to try to better their industry. There needs to be a greater understanding of truck safety. This government and state governments need to educate motorists about truck space on roads . Often many people misjudge the distance required to pass a truck. They do not have skills to pass trucks. Our once-a-year drivers, who come out for their annual safari to go to the coast, are not experienced in long distance driving. They often drive for too long and come to grief. They do not know how to pass a large vehicle like an articulated truck and misjudge the distance. Much more ought to be rigid done by governments to educate other road users about the performance capacity of trucks. Many people think-it is obvious when we are out driving on the road-that they can drive up behind a truck, whiz round, pull in in front of it, hit their brakes and sit there. It is not understood that the truck driver does not have the capacity to pull up in as short a distance as motor car drivers. Many times truck drivers are forced to take evasive action because of that. People need to be educated about truck braking ability, truck passing distance and simply the truck speeds at which trucks are required to operate. We hear a lot about competition. It has been said that this industry is highly efficient. It is highly efficient, but in some areas of activity it is at a cost-a human cost. One aspect of that cost is the cost of going broke. It is easy to get into the trucking business, but it is much harder to stay there. It is said in the private sector, 'You have got the right to be in business and you have got the right to go broke'. Many of these people have been great truckies who have been very good at driving a vehicle, handling a cargo, scheduling their times and driving safely, but they have little comprehension of running. a $250,000 ot a $400,000 business and so come to grief. Sometimes these people are preyed upon by others in the industry. When we look back at the national road freight industry inquiry, we find that the prime contractor was often benefiting from the competition. There is a human cost with excessive competition that has to be met by society as a whole. It does not show up in the accounts or in the statistics, but it is there in the broken marriages, in the lives lost, in the careers ruined and in the family assets destroyed. I tend to look at that side of it when we look at the whole picture. What is the other cost with this excessive competition? The other cost is the hours that drivers are forced to work. It may be said that nobody forces them to work those hours, but they are really forced to do so by the conditions within the industry. Up to 60 per cent of crashes involving heavy vehicles have some element of driver fatigue, either by the heavy vehicle driver, the car driver or both. There is some overseas evidence linking driving and working hours and crash risk, but the indication thus far is that the relationship is not simple. Obviously more work needs to be done. There are not common regulations across Australia. This shows the hypocrisy in government across Australia. There are not uniform regulations across Australia about driving hours as opposed to working hours. Some companies prefer to talk about driving hours, but only time spent at the wheel is classed as working time. Someone may be at work, .but not at the wheel. In the Northern Territory and in Western Australia there are no restrictions. New South Wales allows up to 14 hours driving time. Most states allow a maximum driving time of 12 hours. This is fundamental when it comes to truck safety and the operation of these vehicles. We should forget about the economic benefits and everything else: here is a man or a woman behind the wheel, yet as a nation we cannot agree upon what are driving hours and what are working hours. To my mind, working hours should be the relevant measure, and they should be uniform, because they generate the fatigue. To say that we can accommodate that sort of variation across Australia is to betray the people who have to work in that industry. The Worksafe study of this industry shows that 66 per cent of truck drivers broke the driving hours regulations on at least half of their trips. That is another symptom of the excessive competition that exists because times are tough, so people make commitments, they try to stay alive, and try to hang on to their business. That is why more than half of them break the regulations-with all their imperfectionscovering driving hours. In this Worksafe study one-third of the drivers admitted to using stimulants. No more can be said about the state of an industry if we turn a blind eye to the conditions that force people to do that. The figure of one-third of drivers is a very conservative, understated figure-the real figure is very much higher than that-but it is reflective of conditions within the industry. This legislation will do something about creating a better system in the ACT and Jervis Bay which will act as a lead for the industry in the rest of Australia. that It is within that system that the issue of the number of working hours can properly be addressed. Finally, I was pleased to read in the Telegraph Mirror yesterday that New South Wales is at last installing cameras at black spots on the road and will be moving away from the new stretches of the national highways-national highways built for 130 kilometres safe operational standards while a police officer sits there with a camera nipping people going over the speed limit. I commend the bill to the House. (TIme expired)",101
179,Mr TUCKEY,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"As previous speakers have indicated, the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Bill deals with traffic rules for heavy transport in particular. It is known as peg legislation because it amends legislation relating to Commonwealth areas and is designed to set a standard that the states will follow. The honourable member for Shortland(Mr Peter Morris) corrected the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) on certain comthis ments that he made concerning the revenue that the government has collected on fuel over the years. He made the point that, prior introduction of much higher excise rates, the Fraser government had implemented and achieved revenues, as I recollect, of some billion or $3 billion a year from the so-called crude oil levy. As he chided the honourable member for Hume, I now chide him. There was a reason for that particular levy being introduced. It had to do with the actions of the OPEC becoming a cartel at a time when the world had become very dependent on liquid hydrocarbons, forcing world fuel prices up dramatically. Because of the circumstances that pertained at the time, the owners of Bass this. Strait oil, which included overseas countries, would have made massive windfall profits. The government stepped in and said, 'We will have some of that', and it introduced this price equalisation arrangement. That was the reason. When the world eventually turned to other forms of energy, such as coal, and OPEC could not sustain the prices couldn't give it up.",106
180,Mr TUCKEY,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"The government got hooked on it. I well remember the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who was then Treasurer, complaining that the nasty old Liberals had hooked him on this revenue. In the beginning; the legislation was brought down for the purpose of giving the people of Australia some benefit from that massive hike in fuel prices that otherwise would have gone the owners of the Bass Strait oil. When there was no further need for that price equalisation scheme, we argued that it should be abanour doned and that the government should forgo the revenue. The then Treasurer did not want to go along with that, so from then on it became a pure revenue measure. As such, this government must take the blame for it cause the opposition opposed it strenuously. As I recollect, we reminded the then Treasurfrom er of his earlier claims that our actions when in government were making every bowser in Australia a tax office. He has now made that an art form. Since we are yet to see the regulations, and legislation is really only preliminary to a form of traffic control, I want to raise a few matters for debate. In his closing remarks, the to the honourable member for Shortland talked about the shifting of speed cameras to places where accidents actually occur. He endorsed $2 that measure, as I do. But there are other interesting aspects of traffic control that I would like to put on record because people should be aware of them, and they certainly apply to the area of heavy transport. With the festive season on our doorstep we are now, as 'a community, being pounded with television advertisements being paid for by police departments. As I will prove in a moment, the police departments have a lot of money to do These advertisements warn motorists to be very careful about their behaviour over the Christmas period. I do not object to that, although I think it is a bit overdone. Holiday motorists are a relatively innocent sector of the community, yet we are being pounded and threatened every day by the police forces. My complaint is that the police do not have lot of advertisements that threaten criminals who are breaking and entering people's houses over that same period. In fact, if one were a criminal, one could almost get the message from the television advertisements that Christmas is a pretty good time to go out and break into people's houses because all of the police resources are going to be directed towards catching motorists. In a simple way, that was brought home to to me the other day. As honourable members are aware, I still have some business interests. On two Saturday nights the floor safes of two of business premises were bashed in. Criminals have .learnt that floor safes are hardly that; they can be belted in with a sledge hammer. On the first occasion, it happened in a shopping centre and nobody heard the noise. beOn the second occasion the premises happened to be next to a residence. The lady that residence rang the police and told them that there was a dreadful lot of noise going on in the shop next door-as honourable members can well imagine there would be when someone is belting the hell out of a floor safe with a sledge hammer. She rang the police twice. As far as she is concerned, the police did not attend. When I rang the police and made a bit of a fuss about it they said that they had attended but that they did not see anything. So there was someone inside a shop belting the hell out of a floor safe but the police did not hear anything. I do not think that they wanted to get too close. For the record however, they have since caught the people concerned. As it turned out, the same people had broken into 10 safes that night. The other day I read some interesting figures relating to the shift of police activity from crime prevention to road traffic patrol, and I would like to put those figures on the record because they also apply to the trucking industry. In New South Wales there are 1,700 full-time traffic patrolmen out of a police force of 12,900. That represents 200 more policemen being allocated to traffic than are allocated to full-time criminal investigation. There are some interesting figures on the increase in traffic fines. In New South Wales for the period from 1985-86 to 1992-93, revenue from traffic fines rose from $75.8 million to $173.4 million. In Victoria, in 1971-72, traffic fines brought in $1. 3 mi Ilion, but by 1990-91 the figure had reached $34.2 million. In every state the number of infringement notices issued per annum in the last 20 years has increased approximately fourfold. In my state of Western Australia, the increase was from $57,000 in 1971-72 to $294,622 in 1991-92. In New South Wales, speed cameras were budgeted to raise $23 million this year. I am told that maybe they have not achieved that figure because there have been some public complaints. Apparently Victorians view it differently because in 1991-92 the revenue figure was $55 million. While all of this is going on-this is my concern-the clear-up rate for residential break-ins has fallen across the nation from 19 per cent in 1973-74 to nine per cent currently. The clear-up rates of residential break-ins in New South Wales has dropped from 10.2 per cent to 5.2 per cent; in Victoria from 28 per cent to 13.5 per cent; in Queensland from 20.7 per cent to 10.6 per cent; and in Western Australia from 28 per cent in 1973-74 to 13 per cent in 1988-89 which were the latest available figures. Tasmania used to have a clear up rate of 44 per cent and that figure has dropped to seven per cent. Those figures have to be put on the record. We have to start asking ourselves what is going on with road traffic patrols. Whilst I am the first to endorse road safety, one might wonder how successful these people are if infringement notices and revenue massively increase. Is it a simple fact that some of these areas have simply become revenue? I think state governments, in particular, should be checking the record. Recently in Geraldton, in my electorate, I dealt with some great problems associated with a crime wave-some of which have eventually been addressed after the community went off its brain. The community was having public meetings of 500 people and 600 people, and I think it was very close to taking vigilante action. I wrote to the Sunday Times not that long ago in relation to a story about a very elderly lady who had been murdered in her bed one night. The story was reported on the front page of the Sunday Times in one copy. The editorial discussed a suburb of Perth where the people had had meetings to have a vigilante organisation put in place, and the editorial was saying that this was not the way to go. Another article told of how the police in the early hours of a Saturday morning had stopped 1,100 motorists on the Mitchell Freeway and caught six. Honourable members can imagine how many policemen were involved in this process and how much money it cost to pay them all at double time while a poor old lady was being murdered in her bed. That was all reported in one newspaper. To me, that is a problem. If what we are bringing down today is perceived to be a form of revenue raising as compared to the proper control and regulation of vehicles, then I find that a matter of grave concern, particularly when we see that dreadful fall-off in the resolution of residential breaking and entering. The example I gave a moment ago related to business premises. As I said, I have to recognise that the police on this occasion, having failed to catch the criminals in the act, certainly have caught them since and that is to the credit of the police. But we have to start asking ourselves as a community just how far this matter is going:' In the case of Geraldton, I begged the Premier of Western Australian to stand up and try the Australian community out; say to it, 'I am going to take 50 per cent of the traffic patrol over to criminal and crime control, and I am daring the community to behave itself on the roads'. I think that proposition might be worth a try. I think it is time that we said, 'Let us have a good go at the crime situation. Let us ask the community to do the right thing on the roads'. The statistics will soon prove how we are going. I do not want to spend any more time on that matter, because I want to give another honourable member a few minutes to speak on this bill before the debate is concluded. I want to say a couple of things about this legislation-the honourable member for Hume said that I might. I just wanted to talk about how much road trains and vehicles of that nature can contribute to the efficiency of road transport. There has been some debate in Western Australia because road trains are presently being broken up on the periphery of the city area, or in the built-up urban area of Perth. That means for road trains to get to their destinations they probably have to do the last 10 or 20 kilometres as single units. When it was suggested that stock carters should be able to go right to the Midland saleyards, the people who were protesting said, 'We cannot have all these extra trucks going past the door'. In fact half as many trucks would go past the door. People have to understand these sorts of things. A road train is not necessarily a monster. I know this because I had to convince the then state minister for transport 25 years ago that it was reasonable to take road trains past the town of Geraldton-300 miles north of Perth. We were trying to cart perishable goods at the time. For the last 30 miles into Geraldton, road trains used to come down a narrow, snaky, hilly road. From there on, the road all the way to Perth was as flat as a table. Road trains could come down the really dangerous bit, yet they could not go on to Perth. Eventually, four trucks were trialled for six months. Within six weeks the whole operation was opened up. It has to be understood that these vehicles are not necessarily monsters. I owned a road train at one stage and operated it around the metropolitan area. We have always been able to tow a full semitrailer dog with an eightaxle ridged prime mover. I guess there would not be more than a lO-foot or IS-foot difference between the two. People are quite used to the other vehicles. We nee<j those sorts of configurations. I think if those vehicles were good and were properly run on the Hume to us Highway and we used speed limiters-I am a great believer in speed limiters because they are sensible-it would be much better than a couple of policeman hiding with a speed camera somewhere up the road. A speed limiter guarantees speed control; it is most sensible. I congratulate the government for its decision to bring forward speeds that were sensible for trucks in this modern age. Let me close on the point that diesel engines are still the most efficient form of locomotion that we have. Trucks are still very efficient. Diesel motors are probably the most environmentally friendly type of locomotion that we have. People should not forget that fact when they attack the road transport industry. I will stop my remarks there, because the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) will have a few minutes to speak before the guillotine is applied. I naturally endorse all the concerns expressed by the honourable member for Hume of additional costs imposed on transport and on all Australians every time we add additional costs to transport-road or rail. It is a silly concept in a country like Australia.",107
181,Mr VAILE,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I welcome the opportunity to make a few brief comments before the allotted time expires for the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Bill. It is interesting to note that the government introducing these uniform road transport regulations without the total support of all the states in standardising the regulations for transport. I believe that ultimately they all must fall in line. There are obviously reasons why some of those state governments are not prepared to accept some of the regulations that the federal parliament is proposing within this bill. I think it is a good move by the government. The opposition has a lot of reservations regarding the cost of road transport in Australia-not the least being that component of the cost of fuel that goes straight into the Commonwealth coffers by way of fuel excise and the taxes that we pay through the bowser, and also sales tax that is paid on parts for the transport industry. Almost 80 per cent of all consumable goods throughout Australia that are moved around this country are transported by road transport, so fuel excise and sales tax impact on our cost of living. Hopefully when these uniform regulations are introduced, the running of these rigs might be cheaper in some areas. That will be interesting to see. It will also be interesting to see whether the four states that at this stage are not entirely in agreement with this bill fall into line and agree to it down the line. I suppose that begs the question of why we need to start legislating to improve these standards. Why can we not encourage the industry in other areas? A.s. I commented earlier, I believe standards have slipped because of the economical pressure placed on the industry to try to survive. Following on from that, we have had a proliferation of road accidents on our highways involving semitrailers and the like. So we find ourselves in a situation where we .will introduce legislation to try to control the heavy vehicles that use our highways moving from Queensland to get registered in South Australia, or vice versa, because the restrictions are not as tough. If we have standardised restrictions or regulations across Australia, our roads should be safer. The underlying reason the industry'S standards have dropped is that we continually hit it with taxes at the petrol bowser and sales is tax, which it pays on tyres, batteries and everything else, rather than trying to encourage an industry that is very efficient, that is road doing a good job and certainly has a major impact on everything that we consume and everything that we do within Australia. Hopefully, following the introduction of this regulation in this bill",109
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"Mr Jenkins)Order! It being 7.30 p.m., the time allotted for the remaining stages of the bill has expired. The question is that this bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",110
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,The question now is that the remaining stages of the bill be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA Motion (by Mr O'Keefe) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Country Students: Rural Studies,110
184,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to raise an issue which I believe is very important to country students and the rural community. It relates to the Certificate of Occupational Studies Rural which is conducted by the Loddon Campaspe College of TAPE. This is a six-month rural studies course for country students and has been running at the Loddon Campaspe College of TAFE for some 50 years. I understand that, due partly to budget cuts, this course is not going to continue. There are already a number of students who want to do this course and, bearing· in mind the rural recession that we have experienced over the past few years and the withdrawal from the rural community of numbers of young people who do not wish to proceed with farming as an occupation, I believe this course is extremely important in training young people to take on farming full time. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns), who is at the table, to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) because he would have major concerns that, at this time of difficulty for the farming community, this occupational studies rural course will no longer be offered because of budget cut-backs. Young country students who wish to take up farming as a full-time career will not have the opportunity to do so. I think it also falls into an area that would be of concern to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley). I ask that this course be continued for a period of time. I discussed this matter with a member of the minister's staff and I was told that this course is not adequately meeting the needs of industry. If the course has been running for 50 years it should continue for at least another 12 months while it is evaluated, rather than being dropped completely. I ask the parliamentary secretary at the table to take up this matter with the respective ministers. Aurukun",110
185,Mr DODD,ADJOURNMENT,"The Aurukun Aboriginal community in my electorate has received more than its fair share of unjust and, at times, ill-informed media attention. While the media is keen to portray Aurukun as a community in peril-troubled by violence and clan disputes-I would like to balance that by informing honourable members of some good news from Aurukun. Last week I had the privilege of attending the presentation night at the Aurukun state school, which is called the MCKenzie award night. Aurukun is historically based on an artifice-an artifice which started when four different clans from this region of the gulf and peninsula were herded off their traditional lands and forced to live together. The result was a justifiably angry community. Clan fighting in the township was common, and unfortunately it continues today. But at the Aurukun state school, where classes were often tense because opposing clans were pushed together, the classes are now organised along clan lines. This is an initiative of the community, obviously in close consultation with the Queensland government. As well as this initiative, a community education advisory council has been formed at the school· and more locals are employed as support staff at the school. Now, instead of the traditional classes, children from the same clans study together. This has been a real success story. Last year there were hardly any children attending the Aurukun state school-so much so that the state government withdrew teachers. Now the retention rates are right up. It is a real success story. The idea came from the community and, as the local member, I commend the community. It illustrates how imposing an inappropriate template or model on indigenous communities does not work and will not work, and how much more effective locally generated, appropriate ideas can· be. I would like to convey to the people of Aurukun my sincere thanks for their hospitality last week. My thanks go especially to the school manager, Gladys Tybingoompa, for hosting the evening and also to the principal, Frank Green, and his staff. This was not the first time that I had enjoyed the marvellous hospitality of the people of Aurukun. The displays of indigenous culture-both traditional singing and dancing-were of a very high quality and were very entertaining. Pre-school children were involved in these activities, which shows that Aboriginal culture is alive and well at Aurukun. Plays and songs were all part of the evening's entertainment. One song was particularly relevant and obviously will be helpful in building the confidence of Aboriginal children in pursuing their future careers. The song was titled You can do anything you want to do, if you want to. I think that is very significant. It was acted out by the childrenthere was a model aeroplane; some children had stethoscopes-obviously with the intent of building the confidence of those children to look towards the potential of their communities. I am sure that that song is an inspiration for the whole community and I am confident that in the future Aurukun will be able to do anything that it wants to. Arts: Regional Development",111
186,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I would like to voice my concern about this government's smokescreen representation of the arts community in my electorate. I have spoken at length with local representatives of the arts community on the midnorth coast, and they have expressed quite clearly their disappointment towards this government's policies on regional arts development. Only last Friday night! had the pleasure of opening a privately operated art gallery in Port Macquarie, called Lady May's Art Gallery, at 95 Hastings River Drive. The owner of this gallery, Mr Michael O'Connor, is taking a big chance in opening the gallery but he feels inspired by support within the community that he might just be able to make it successful. I wish him and his wife, May, all the very best in their venture. However, during the opening ceremony, Mr O'Connor presented to me a statement regarding government arts assistance in the Hastings Valley which he wanted read out in parliament. I therefore will happily oblige him. Mr O'Connor writes: RE: STATEMENT REGARDING GOVERNMENT ARTS ASSISTANCE IN THE HASTINGS VALLEY. It is in my opinion as the Principal Director of Hastings District School of Art as well as the presiding President of the North Coast Professional Artists Association and Director of the Lady May's Art Gallery, that financial assistance from this Government is greatly lacking on the mid-North Coast. Since I first came to Port Macquarie two years ago, I have been concerned with several aspects of the funding arrangements for this arts community. Firstly, there is no regional program for the assistance of growth in the arts, especially with regard to grants and indigenous displays. Secondly, the mid-North Coast has no Government assisted Aboriginal gallery, which is a poor reflection on the Government, considering that there is, to my knowledge, more than 700 active Aboriginal artists here. Another point which also needs addressing is the issue of assistance to independent Arts Schools. These schools are being funded at great expense by private individuals, simply to make available art education to all areas of the community. For example, I am conducting 8 classes a week at a personal loss, just to give the opportunity to all sections of the community, such as the unemployed and the elderly, to express themselves in art. We also conduct an Associate Diploma in Visual Art over a one year period. Again, we are running this academic course to assist those with the talent to springboard onward into the art industry, but at a personal financial loss. The only current assistance is through a N.E.I.S. allowance that runs out in June 1994. If the Government doesn't introduce a new way of assisting people like myself, and I can assure you that there are many people in the same situation, then these Art Schools will unfortunately just fade away. I therefore call on the Minister for the Arts to act in a more appropriate manner for regional arts communities such as the struggling Hastings Valley. This is not a lone voice of complaint about regional arts funding on the mid-north coast, either. I have also spoken with Jamie Derkenne, the new mid-north coast regional arts development officer. He is highly critical of the approach that this government has taken towards funding arrangements for the arts community on the mid-north coast. He argues that, despite the strong activities of arts groups within the region, the mid-north coast has in the past received a small fraction of federal money for arts development compared with other regions of Australia. He also argues that the arts on the midnorth coast are faced with a chicken and the egg scenario. At present, no venue is suitable for a large performance or a large touring arts exhibition on the mid-north coast. As a result of this lack of facilities, major shows and major touring exhibitions which quite happily travel inland to centres such as Cowra simply cannot tour the mid-north coast. This inability of many shows to tour the coast partly explains the lack of government subsidies for arts activities. If the activities cannot take place because of inadequate venues, then there is no point in handing the money out to host those activities. I will finish on a positive note. Arts development on the mid-north coast has entered an exciting phase. Never before have the local arts groups enjoyed such community support. Never before have the different arts groups been so unified in their approach to arts development. That enthusiasm, and that recognition of the benefits arts development can bring, is being thwarted, however, by not only a lack of facilities, but also a perception that such facilities will not be in place in the foreseeable future. The federal government can help the situation on the mid-north coast in two ways: firstly, by allocating more funds to high growth, low infrastructure regions like the mid-north coast for capital works expenditure in the arts; and, secondly, by encouraging departments such as health, tourism, training and employment to see the various benefits that arts development can bring to their own fields of endeavour. This could be done by having such departments set aside a proportion of their budget for arts and cultural activities which would have a direct and immediate impact on their field. Equality of the arts throughout Australia simply does not exist, and the sooner this government addresses this· very important aspect of regional development, the better for everyone involved throughout regional Australia. Prime Minister: Foreign Policy",111
187,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"The lack of understanding by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of human relations as they affect foreign policy has been demonstrated glaringly by his recent highly publicised diplomatic faux pas surrounding remarks made about the Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, and their grave consequences. However, let us not forget that, since taking office only two years ago, he has managed, wittingly or unwittingly, to offend a number of other countries, including long standing allies and near neighbours. The Mahathir disaster is merely the last, though arguably the most potentially damaging link in a chain of similar instances, stretching back to the time of his accession to that position ranked as the foremost in Australia. The Prime Minister's lack of dignity and sense of occasion were illustrated when he put his ann around the waist of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, during her official visit to Australia in February 1992. The Prime Minister believed that her majesty was 'flattered', but the British press certainly were not. Following that, as early as 4 May 1992, I had cause to speak of the Prime Minister's 'chronic anglophobia' which was an ongoing phenomenon even then. I pointed out the grave danger of his intemperate comments on our trading relationship with the United Kingdom which, incidentally, is still the third highest investor in this country. It actually rates second as far as the stock of investments is concerned. It was in the previous month that the Prime Minister used the occasion of an official visit to Indonesia to promote the notion of a new Australian national flag-minus the Union Jack-much to the outrage of thousands of Australians who deeply resented their Prime Minister belittling his own country's flag before a foreign audience. It would have also left the Indonesians with the impression that Australians were ashamed of their heritage and uncertain of their identity-another grave diplomatic error. The Prime Minister's first outing into the arena of international politics in July 1992, when he arrived late to the South Pacific Forum's official opening at Honiara, was not exactly an exemplary initiation. Although a spokesman reported that an apology had been made and accepted by the Solomon Islands' Prime Minister, Mr Mamaloni, South Pacific leaders would not have been impressed. So the story unfolds. On 23 September of this year, france became the next victim of the Prime Minister's loose tongue. Whilst in that country, he blasted 'selfish France' for hurting Australia by its attitude to GATT and to world trade, despite the legions of diggers who had died defending French soil. The Prime Minister's curious comparison between trade and lost Australian lives caused dismay; probably even more so in Australia than in France. French fanners were, incidentally, protecting their livelihood. Finally, to the story which has dominated Australian and Malaysian politics since Monday, 22 November, when the Prime Minister delivered his infamous 'recalcitrant' description of Dr Mahathir because the Malaysian leader had not attended the recent APEC conference in Seattle. Since then, the hazard of engaging in thoughtless, insulting, throwaway lines has been brought home to not only the Prime Minister, but to the Australian people, particularly those involved in enterprises which may have been sacrificed to the threatened sanctions applied by Malaysia. Luckily, the situation has now eased and such is not to be. Hopefully the Australian Labor Party will bow to public pressure and rid itself of its diplomatically incompetent leader as soon as possible. If not, for the sake of Australia its people, may the coalition's victory at the next election come swiftly. Woomera",113
188,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Grey) (7.46 p.m.)Tonight I would like to say a few words about Woomera township and the Joint Defence Facility at Nurrungar. Woomera is situated in the electorate of Grey and has a population of about 1,loo-that is after 75 workers and their families left on 30 September. Until 30 September 1993, SERCo Pty Ltd held a contract for the provision of support services to the Joint Defence Facility at Nurrungar. From 1 October 1993, Australian Defence Industries and the Defence Support Centre at Woomera and Rockwell have taken over the contract for the provision of support services to the Joint Defence Facility at Nurrungar. I understand that these contracts are for a period of three years. That is the purpose of my brief speech tonight. I have some concerns about these new management arrangements. Visits to Woomera and contacts from constituents at my office have raised several matters of concern. As at 30 September, the 67 full-time and seven part-time staff were retrenched. These workers had 28 days to leave Woomera after 30 September. No person in Woomera is able to own a home. Some of these people have resided in Woomera for 15 to 20 years and were given just 28 days to relocate. There was uncertainty about the benefits that workers received under the new arrangements. Time has moved on, and it is clear that those package deals were considerably less than what people were on before. I understand that the issue of redundancy payments for displaced SERCo employees is still not resolved. I am informed that the matter is currently before the Industrial Relations (Commission. Similarly, there is uncertainty about the transfer of removal entitlements to the new contractor. Previously the Commonwealth subsidised the rent of SERCo employees. Under the new arrangements effective from 1 October 1993, the responsibility for subsidising rents will reside with the new contractor, Australian and Defence Industries, which is owned by the government. One constituent in my electorate has contacted me to say that the rent on his three-bedroom townhouse is due to rise from $71 to $171 per week. This new rental price is after receipt of a subsidy from AD! of $140 per week, taking the total rental price to $322 per week-an extraordinary price for a remote area like Woomera. It is quite interesting to note that the Defence Housing Authority says that there is a 50 per cent loading on such houses in these locations. I am informed that the rental price for a four-bedroom house is $228 per week before subsidies-still an extremely high price for Woomera. Along with many of the residents of Woomera, I would like to ask the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner) how the Defence Housing Authority arrives at these abnormally high rents. I understand that these new arrangements at Woomera are a result of the defence commercial support program-a program which aims at reducing the cost of support services to defence related activities. However, I would argue that many of these changes have been implemented quite ruthlessly without adequate consultation with the Woomera community. Mabo Legislation",114
189,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"O'Connor) (7.50 p.m.)During question time today the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean)-I think he thought he was making a pretty substantial point; he certainly did to me, but in a different way from what he intendedgot up and read us a letter written by Graham Blight of the NFF asking us in the opposition to fix up some of the mistakes that he has apparently made in endorsing the Keating government's Mabo legislation and suggesting that we would be dreadful people if we did not. I think the record has to be put straight on all of this. It was an interesting factor that people were concerned that some of the major mining houses were rather quiet in the preliminaries to Mabo and that companies such as BHP and others were not out there fighting a fight until they saw the legislation. Of course, BRI;> in particular, having had the opportunity to view the legislation, obviously gave it to its wellpaid legal advisers, and three days later it came out and stated its opposition-in fact, it referred to it as porridge; in other words, a very responsible and sensible approach notwithstanding that it too would have been under some political pressure in certain sectors to have more to say. By comparison, Mr Farley-he seemed to have the sole power of negotiating with· the government on Mabo because none of his elected representatives seemed to be consulted in any proper way, certainly not by having meetings or conferences, and the Aboriginal affairs subcommittee of the NFF did not meet once whilst all this was being resolvedeventually found himself constrained to give an undertaking of support for the legislation to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) somewhere around midnight one night, and prior to the legislation seeing the light of day. Mr Farley then said that this was absolutely necessary simply because he had to protect his members' land rights; that is, the rights farmers to occupy land in particular pastoral leases. The interesting thing about that is that he has now discovered he has not done that and he is running around trying to obtain amendments to legislation which he quite foolishly endorsed without ever seeing it. Somehow or other and at some point in time he wants to make bad guys of us because our simple proposal is that it is not a case of amending the legislation; we must oppose it. Re is now finding that it is not doing for him what he said it would. Of course, he made a grave error in endorsing something he had not seen and then going along and convincing his federal council to do the same. They have no excuses now and should not be running around asking the coalition to change its clearly stated policy, which is one of total opposition to the bill. Mr Johns-Are the amendments sensible though?",114
190,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"No, the amendment is not sensible simply because the government is putting up a piece of legislation that will not survive in the end simply because it lacks the power to protect anybody's property. That is why the government is desperate to have the state governments go down the road of complementary legislation, because it knows they are the only ones that can protect people's property. But it wanted them to do it according to its set of rules. If the government wants just an experiment, it passes its legislation, and if it does not get the support of most state governments it is not worth the piece of paper it is written on, because the government cannot do it on its own. The constitution will prove that to the government in time. In fact, it is the government's legislation that has the biggest problems. Nevertheless, Mr Farley went down his road. Mr Farley and Mr Blight made decisions. They stood up there and harassed their councillors from all around Australia to support them. Now they have found they have got it wrong. Furthermore-and I have made this point before-it was Mr Farley who said that he had a letter from the Prime Minister guaranteeing financial assistance for any of farmers who found themselves in the position of being dragged into a land claim and having substantial legal costs. Then he watered that down to say that he had a guarantee that he would be able to put a member on the committee that would decide who would get the money. I am now told from authoritative sources who have seen the letter that the letter does not even guarantee that. Yet when the people from the NFF voted here in Canberra the other day, they voted on the basis of what Mr Farley had told them. This only further supports my advice to people in my electorate that it is time Western Australia got out of the NFF. It has become totally bureaucratised and the people are being misled by their own employees.(1ime expired) Banks",115
191,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I have here a copy of an advertisement from PIBA, the Primary Industry Bank bf Australia, which is, of course, owned by the Rural and Industries Bank in Western Australia. It is advertising property purchase refinancing on off-farm investments at 5.45 per cent per annum. It is certainly a low interest rate and I am sure it would gladden the heart of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). But this bank is the same bank that is still charging farmers 17 per cent on loans. I think it is an absolute outrage that PIBA should be able to advertise this sort of stuff when it is clearly acting to penalise horrendously primary producers. Indeed, Shylock has nothing on the actions of these modem bankers. There are many farmers for whom the difference in that interest rate is a difference between survival and failure, and I think· that PIBA should be forced to make adjustments to those interest rates. I also think-I have taken this matter up in this parliament before-that the government should make much more available through legal aid to people who want to take on banks, because there is no doubt that banks have acted illegally in many cases. They have acted illegally knowing that the people they were acting against had no financial resources and that they could simply be steamrollered. I believe that if legal aid were made available to people to take on the banks, we would have seen a much more responsible action from these banks. One example comes to mind, and that is an example in Kalgoorlie where the proprietor of the then Kalgoorlie Hotel had a loan from Citibank. He told me that he had no worry with Citibank because, while his main mortgage was with it, it had all the security and would not bother him. One day it moved in as mortgagor in possession and he was out of his hotel. It proceeded to run it appallingly badly, to increase the costs enormously, and eventually it put the business on the market. At auction, the hotel was turned in at $400,000. Within a year Citibank had sold that hotel for something like $260,000. So it rejected an offer of $400,000, which would have cleared all the creditors and the unsecured creditors. Within a year, it then sold the hotel for an amount which meant it cleared itself and left. the unsecured creditors with nowhere to go at all. It was a totally irresponsible action. Given the growth we have had in Kalgoorlie, that h-tel is worth much more today. The fellow who bought it-I wish him all the best-bought it in a very depressed situation and has done up the hotel very well. It is doing a good trade and he certainly has my endorsement for his efforts. But the fact remains that the behaviour of Citibank-it is only an example of what I call the oppressive, irresponsible and criminal behaviour of banks in Australia-is an example of what this government, indeed any government, should have been doing its best to redress. The best way to redress that is to make money available through legal aid for people who have problems with the banks. This has not been forthcoming. Indeed, there is simply no scope at all in that area. lri the time. I have left to speak, which will not be enough, I want to talk about the West Australian newspaper. I do not criticise the media on my own account, and I think the record will show that. I am quite prepared to roll with the punches and let the cards fall as they may. However, I believe that the West Australian is, without doubt, the most reprehensible newspaper in Australia. It enjoys a monopoly situation and there is no doubt that for many years it was manipulated by Brian Burke. He was very good at it. It is my view that it is the job of politicians to try to manipulate the media and that it is the job of the media to resist that manipulation. In this case, the media failed to do so and, having conspicuously failed to do so, it then became irresponsible in its attacks on the government. The recent attack by Stephen Loxley on Julian Grill was without foundation and was cowardly. In his article Mr Loxley did not address the substance of what Mr Grill had said in his speech. I am going to run out of time. I will make it a priority in February to put the record straight on this account because I believe that Julian Grill has outstanding integrity in the Western Australian parliament and it is quite clear that the Liberal Party would like to get rid of Grill because it knows that, if it can get rid of him, the Labor Party will be left with a leadership which will ensure the unwarranted survival of the state Liberal Party. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Public Service Act-Determinations-1993 Nos LES 20, LES 21. Superannuation Act I 976-Determinations under subsections 240(1) and 241(1), 7 December 1993. The following answers to questions were circulated: Facsimile Services (Question No. 234)",115
192,Mr CAMERON,PAPERS,"the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: (1) What is the average cost of sending a one page facsimile message from Perth to Canberra. (2) Which Government instrumentalities provide a commercial facsimile service for the public. (3) Does Australia Post, under its FaxPost service, charge $6.00 for the first page and $2.50 for each subsequent page; if so, (a) how were the charges determined and (b) are the charges excessive. (4) Will he institute a review of charges to ensure the public is not being overcharged for facsimile services. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The cost of sending a facsimile is comprised of the cost of the telephone connection and overheads such as staff, accommodation, and so on. Telecom advises that if the telephone connection was made using the Public Switched Telephone Network during business hours, the cost of the call would be approximately fifty one cents. (2) Australia Post is the only Government instrumentality providing such a service of which Telecom is aware. (3) the cost of sending a FaxPost item in Australia is $4 for the first page and $l per page thereafter. FaxPost operates in a competitive environment. Charges for the service are set by Australia Post having regard to market considerations, the cost of providing the service (including acceptance, delivery and related operating and overhead costs), and its statutory obligation to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. (4) Under section 32 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 the Board is responsible for determining rates of postage and the terms and conditions for the supply of services. The Minister has authority under section 32 to disapprove rates of postage for standard postal articles and registered publications which are determined by the Board. NA There is no power to disapprove rates or conditions related to the supply of other services. Hotel Kurrajong: Sale (Question No. 259)",118
193,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: (1) Has the Government given any undertaking to the ACT Administration to (a) sell, (b) lease or (c) grant some form of access to the Hotel Kurrajong and adjacent site; if so, has due process, such as advertising and tendering been followed. (2) Will cost penalties be incurred if the Hotel Kurrajong does not meet the ACT Administration's expectations; if so, will the Government be required to carry out or pay for remedial work such as asbestos removal or structural modification. (3) Has the current market value of the Hotel Kurrajong been determined; if so, (a) by whom, (b) what is the valuation, (c) how was the valuation determined and (d) has a transfer price been negotiated which reflects the current market value. Mr WiIIisThe Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The Commonwealth has recently negotiated a 50-year lease of the Hotel Kurrajong to the Canberra Institute of Technology for $1 million. The settlement took place on Friday 1 October. The sale of the lease of the property was negotiated on a direct basis with the Canberra Institute of Technology, an agency of the ACT Government. (2) As all renovations to the building are to be carried out by the ACT Government, the question of cost penalties does not arise. (3) The current market valuation was determined as follows: (a) Valuations were conducted by both the Australian Valuation Office and a private sector valuer specialising in the hotel industry. (b) The most recent valuation of the property, obtained on 1 February 1993, was $825 000. (c) The valuation was detennined on the basis of hospitality-industry usage in the context of zoning and heritage constraints. (d) The 50-year lease was finalised for the sum of $1 million, using the valuation advice obtained as a guide. The lease also requires the lessee to spend a minimum of $5 million on the restoration and refurbishment of this heritage property. Comcar Computer System (Question No. 260)",118
194,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: (1) Has the Com car computer system crashed since it was installed; if so, (a) on how many occasions and (b) what was the total downtime. (2) How many cars in each State and Territory are linked to the central system. (3) Why does the system crash. (4) Is system failure influenced by the number of cars logged on to the system at any time; if so, what is the critical number. (5) What booking details are lost when the system crashes. (6) Is billing information lost when the system crashes; if so, how does Com car re-establish the information. (7) How frequently (a) should Comcar bill its customers and (b) has Comcar billed its customers since the system was introduced. (8) Who manufactured the system. (9) What did it cost to install the system in each State and Territory. (10) What does it cost in each State and Territory to (a) service and maintain the system and (b) rectify systems failures. (11) On what advice was the system acquired. (12) Was the system trialled with Comcar or a comparable private operator before it was installed; if so, what was the result of the trial. (13) Did the Minister's predecessor approve the acquisition of the system; if so, (a) when and (b) in what fonn. Project Supplier NA NA (14) When was the system installed. (15) Was the system recommended to the Department of Social Security; if so, (a) when, (b) by whom and (c) in what fonn. (16) Are the two-way radios or telephones about to be removed from Commonwealth cars; if so, why. ) Mr WILLIS - The Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1)(a)-(b) During the implementation phase of this complex solution, outages did occur. The rate of these outages is not inconsistent with expected bedding-in issues involved with a project of such complexity. Since full national implementation was completed on 1 July 1993, following cutover and a one month period for settling-in in the last site, a total of 1991 hours up time was scheduled. Some 138 hours (or 7%) downtime has been experienced. Some 4% of this outage period was caused by faulty hardware which has now been replaced. (2)Adelaide-29 Canberra-109 Brisbane-43 Sydney-95 Melbourne-lOl Hobart-12 Perth-22 (3) The majority of outages since full implementation were traced to a single hardware unit which was found to be faulty. It has now been replaced. (4) No. (5) None. On only one occasion, 10 June 1993, some details for some reservations for that day were lost. (6) No. (7) (a) Monthly. (b) Tn the first 4 months of operations in 3 sites, billing was not conducted until the fourth month.

The total cost of the system is of the order of $6.6m. (10) System service and maintenance costs are borne centrally. To date maintenance costs are covered by warranty agreements. (11) A systems solution was recommended in the 1991 Price Waterhouse Urwick Review of Comcar and the concept confirmed in more detailed recommendations made by KPMG Peat Marwick .. Subsequent calls for Expressions of Interest for a solution to the private marketplace also confirmed the system strategy. (12) A successful pilot exercise was conducted in Adelaide by Comcar in September to November 1992. (13) Approval to proceed was obtained in the 1992 Budget. (14) Progressive implementation was commenced on 21 September 1992 with the pilot in Adelaide and was completed on 31 May 1993 when Perth changed over. Full implementation was completed on 1 July 1993. (15) No. (16) Two-way radios need to be removed because of radio frequency spectrum changes by Department of Transport and Communications. Telephones have been installed in every Com car as a means of voice communication when necessary and for customer convenience. Taxation Agreement with United States (Question No. 292) Mr Truss asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 August 1993: Australian content FULLY DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED IN AUSNA FULLY DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED IN AUSNA FULLY DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED IN AUSNA FULLY DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED IN AUSNA FULLY DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED IN AUSNA AUSTRALIAN. SUPPORTED PRODUCT NA NA NA NA MANUFACTURED IN AUSTRALIA (WANGARATTA) NA NA (I) Was the Australia/USA Double Tax Agreement negotiated to avoid double taxation on incomes in Australia and the USA. (2) Have changes in tax laws in both countries since the agreement was negotiated in 1982 resulted in double taxation now occurring for Australians living in the USA and vice versa in a range of areas including capital gains tax, imputation credits attached to fully franked dividends, income from property trusts and bonus share issues. (3) What action has the Government taken to renegotiate the agreement to accommodate tax law changes over the last decade. (4) Will a new agreement be made; if so, when.",119
195,Mr GEAR,DAS BUSINESS UNIT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The principal purpose of the Australia/USA Double Tax Convention (the Convention) is to reduce or eliminate potential double taxation of income earned by citizens and residents of either country from sources within the other country and to prevent avoidance or evasion of the income taxes of the two countries. The Convention is intended to promote closer economic co-operation between the two countries and to eliminate possible barriers to trade caused by overlapping taxing jurisdictions of the two countries. It is intended to enable the countries to co-operate in preventing avoidance and evasion of taxes. (2) No. The Convention is a comprehensive tax agreement which provides rules for the allocation of taxing rights in respect of income taxesincluding similar taxes imposed after the date of signature of the Convention in addition to, or in place of, the existing income taxes-imposed at the Federal level by the USA and Australia. Thus, changes to the income tax laws of either country should not give rise to double taxation. Taxing rights are allocated on specific items of income to either the USA or Australia or both, depending on the type of income concerned, the source of the income and the country of residence ,of the recipient. A 'sweep-up' article provides rules for allocation of taxing rights over income not expressly mentioned elsewhere in the Convention. Where the Convention provides that an item of income may be subject to tax in both countries, the country of residence of the recipient of the income is required to provide double taxation relief by giving a credit against its tax for the tax of the country of source, subject to the limitations of the domestic laws of that couhtry. In Australia, the granting of a credit would be subject to the limitations of the foreign tax credit system and could not exceed the Australian tax payable on the relevant income. The introduction of Australia's' tax on capital gains should not give rise to double taxation because the gains are included as income and are dealt with under the relevant Article of the Convention, in particular the Alienation of Property Article or the Income Not ExpreSsly Mentioned Article. Double taxation should not occur as a result of the dividend imputation system because franked dividends paid by Australian companies to overseas shareholders are exempt under Australian tax law from dividend withholding tax to the extent that they are franked. Un franked dividends continue to be subject to withholding tax in accordance with the limits specified in the Convention. The country of residence of the shareholder is required under the Convention to provide double tax relief for dividend income. Dividends satisfied by the issue of bonus shares are also subject to the imputation arrangements. A non-resident shareholder is exempt from withholding tax on the dividends to the extent the bonus shares issue is made from fully franked profits. Double taxation should not occur therefore in respect of bonus issues. The amendments to the Australian domestic law concerning the taxation of the income of business trusts were extended to treaties negotiated prior to the enactment of the amendments in 1984. Those treaty partner countries, including the USA, were notified accordingly. Double taxation should not occur as the country of residence of the income recipient should provide double tax relief if it also taxes the income of those trusts. (3) The Convention has worked well over the last decade. While there have been changes to the tax laws in both countries, it has not been considered necessary by the Australian Government to renegotiate the Convention to accommodate these tax law changes. Nor has there been any approach from the US Government to renegotiate the Convention. In general, difficulties that have arisen in individual cases under the Convention have been satisfactorily resolved and there has been an absence of representations from industry bodies or individual companies seeking renegotiation of the Convention. (4) There are no plans to renegotiate the Convention at this time. Aboriginal Programs and Interests (Question Nos 298 and 302) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 30 August 1993: (1) Will the Minister provide details of the number of (a) statutory bodies, (b) statutory offices, (c) non-statutory bodies and (d) companies and incorporated associations within the Minister's portfolio which deal (i) exclusively or (ii) substantially with Aboriginal programs and interests.

201,Mr COSTELLO,FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 7 October 1993: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the regular publication by the Department of Social Security of full statistical details of its income support programs including the Ten Year Statistical Summary. (2) Does his Department deal with income support programs worth more than $1.6 billion in the education area alone. (3) Does his Department match the publication of information achieved by the Department of Social Security; if not why not. (4) Does his Department periodically change the form in which it presents statistical data thereby reducing comparability and accountability; if so, why. (5) Do all of his Department's program management information systems allow the retrieval of historical information; if not, (a) which do not and (b) why do they not. (6) How many persons were covered by income support programs administered by his Department or its predecessors at 30 June in each year between 1970 and 1993; if the data are not available, (a) why not and (b) is he able to say whether the Department of Social Security is able to provide similar information in respect of its programs.

(8) Do the total n-mbers of participants in the employment access programs referred to in tables 4.1.2, 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 at pages 109 and 110 of the program performance statements refer only to those who participated for the duration of the respective program; if so, how many individuals left each program before it was completed.",123
202,Mr BEAZLEY,FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware that such a publication exists. (2) Yes. (3) No. My Department makes its own judgements on such matters. (4) No. Changes to the presentation of statistical data are made only when considered necessary (eg, for reasons of clarity or in light of changes to program structures or coverage). Due regard is paid to considerations of comparability and accountability. (5) The vast majority of the Department's management information systems allow the retrieval of historical information. In exceptional cases (eg, inactive jobseekers after 12 months) the benefits would not justify the costs.

Mr WiJlis-The Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. National Rail (Question No. 454) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 7 October 1993: (1) What quantities of diesel did Australian National Rail (ANR) consume in (a) 1990-91, (b) 1991-92 and (c) 1992-93. (2) What associated revenue in fuel excise was collected from ANR in (a) 1990-91, (b) 1991-92 and (c) 1992-93. (3) How much additional revenue will be collected from ANR as a result of the increases to fuel excise in the 1993-94 Budget. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) 95.5 million litres (b) 78.6 million Iitres (c) 84.3 million litres. (2) (a) $23.9 million (b) $20.4 million (c) $22.0 million. (3) Based on current fuel consumption projections, approximately $2.3 million additional excise will be paid in 1993-94, increasing to around $3.8 million in 1994-95 and 1995-96. These figures include interstate traffics currently operated by AN. Over the period in question, the full responsibility for these traffics will be transferred to National Rail, including the payment of excise. Coastal Shipping Industry: Fuel Excise (Question No. 455) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 7 October 1993: (1) What quantities of marine fuels did Australia's coastal shipping industry consume in (a) 1990-91, (b) 1991-92 and (c) 1992-93. (2) What associated revenue in fuel excise was collected from the industry in (a) 1990-91, (b) 1991-92 and (c) 1992-93. (3) How much additional revenue will be collected from the industry as a result of the increases to fuel excise in the 1993-94 Budget. (4) What sum in additional excise will the average ship plying the Australian coast pay. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The majorJuel used by the Australian coastal trading fleet is fuel oil. No Commonwealth agency collects data on the quantity of fuel oil consumed, nor the fuel oil excise paid, by the coastal shipping industry. However, based on information previolisly provided by the Australian National Maritime Association, the Department estimates that consumption of fuel oil for the domestic shipping task is about 322,000 kilolitres annually. There is also some use of marine diesel fuel by the coastal shipping industry. However, separate figures relating to the consumption of marine diesel fuel by the coastal shipping industry are not available. (2) Based on annual consumption figures of 322,000 kilolitres, it is estimated that the coastal shipping industry would have paid around $17.5m annually in fuel oil excise at the rate applying prior to the 1993 Budget. (3) Based on Australian National Maritime Association figures, it is estimated that an additional $9.7m in excise will be collected from the coastal shipping industry as a result of the 3 cents/litre increase in excise on fuel oil. (4) Based upon the additional fuel oil excise of $9.7m incurred by the coastal shipping industry as a result of the Budget's 3 cents per litre increase in the fuel oil excise, the average additional fuel oil excise incurred by the fleet of 44 ships is around $220,000 per vessel, per annum. Vietnam Veterans (Question No. 461) Mr Bradford asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 18 October 1993: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the suicide of a Vietnam Veteran, Mr Dallas Johns of Riverhills, Queensland.

(5) Is the Minister able to say how many of the deaths have been attributed to (a) suicide or (b) suspected suicide.",125
204,Mr HOWE,FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS,"the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Until this question was put on notice I had not had my attention drawn to it. (2) & (3) Due to the sensitivity of this information I do not propose to have it placed on the public record. It has been provided to the honourable member by other means. (4) The Department of Defence has advised that about 53 000 personnel either served, or were deemed allotted for service in Vietnam. My Department has estimated there to be about 49 600 surviving Vietnam veterans. This estimate is based on 501 deaths in action and about 2 900 deaths since 1973. (5) Of the total number of deaths reported to the Department, 176 have been classified as deaths from suicide and self inflicted injury. 5 deaths have been classified as ""undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted"".

Aboriginal Organisations: Grants for Cattle Stations (Question No. 549) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 27 October 1993: (1) Do the figures provided in the answer to question No. 174 (Hansard, 31 August 1993, page 593), indicate that total sums of $2364014 and $2 113309 were provided in 1989-90 to 1991-92 for development of Noonkanbah and Millijiddee Stations, respectively. (2) Do offers of acceptance in respect of funding for the two stations in 1989-90 to 1991-92 indicate that totals sums of $2 870 950 and $2 344 119, respectively, were to be released. . (3) Are there funding shortfalls of (a) $5.06 936 for Noonkanbah Station and (b) $230 810 for Millijiddee Station; if so, (i) what are the reasons for the shortfalls and (ii) will he instruct departmental officers to investigate the shortfalls and discuss the matter with the management of the respective stations. Mr Tickner"""":'"" The answer to the honourable member's question is, as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Problems associated, with accessing old records, particularly those relating to the Aboriginal Development Commission, has meant that the total sums offered to Noonkanbah and Millijiddee stations have not been able to be confirmed. This is in large measure because both stations,received their funding through the Management Services Unit Aboriginal Corporation as did other properties in the group under a bulk allocation. Identification of grant releases to particular stations is now difficult. However, it is' important to understand that grant approvals ,are based on station development plans and are subject to certain conditions. One of these conditions is that funding for' the station is subject to project reviews and where the status of the project may vary from the original project plan, the amount of funding released will vary accordingly. (3) Because of the reasons set out above it is probable that there were differences between the levels of funding offered to the stations and that which was subsequently released. Commission officers have been asked to improve the working relationship with the management of the respective stations. At the same time changes in information systems will in the future provide more detailed funding data on individual station projects.

(2) What are the details of existing funding arrangements. (3) Will the Government provide funding for the centre to 1998-99; if so, what are the details. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council (MDBMC) considered the matter of future funding arrangements for the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre (MDFRC) at its meeting in June 1993. Subsequently I, as Chairman of the MDBMC, approached the Chair of the Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council seeking a reconsideration of that Council's 1991 decision to withdraw core funding support for the MDFRC at the end of 1993-94.

Mr Hawke agreed that the site should be confinned. Radio Station 2KY Mr Beddall-On 18 November 1993 (House of Representatives Hansard page 3163), Mr CAMERON asked me a question without notice about the grant of transmitter licences for high power narrowcasting racing services to commercial radio station 2KY. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As the licences in question were granted by the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) I have asked it to advise me of the circumstances surrounding the grant of these licences to 2KY and other racing broadcasters. The ABA has provided the following advice: The Government had made Regulations under the Broadcasting Act 1942, for a limited licence (racing) for the provision of racing broadcasts. relevant regulations became law in September 1992 and were the result of several years of representations by Totaliser Agency Board (TAB) interests Australia-wide. During these deliberations, the TABs advised that their priority order for grant of the licences was Northern Territory, Tasmania, Queensland and New South Wales, followed by the other States. The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the Act) replaced Limited Licences with narrowcasting services. However Limited Licences granted before the commencement of the Act were preserved and were automatically converted to open narrowcasting licences by the transitional provisions. Only one limited licence (racing) was granted before the Act commenced. This was in the Northern Territory. At the time of commencement of the Act applications for Limited Licences had been lodged by TAB interests in Queenslartd, Tasmania and New South Wales, but they were not able to be processed before the Act commenced. They became, instead, applications for transmitter licences to provide narrowcasting racing services. Applications for transmitter licences for the provision of narrowcasting racing services in Perth and Adelaide were not submitted to the ABA until 24 February 1993. In December 1992, the ABA considered the pending transmitter licence applications and decided to release spectrum to the Queensland TAB for about 16 outback Queensland towns, to the Tasmanian TAB to provide an AM racing service to Hobart (when 7HT completed its conversion to FM), and to radio 2KY to provide AM racing services to Newcastle and Wollongong. The channels were released for an initial period ending in December 1993. There were no competing applications for transmitter licences in these areas, so they were issued under the established practice for the issue of licences under the Radiocommunication Act 1983, which is ""first in, first served"". Of the licences on issue-the NT TAB service has just commenced operation, the Queensland services have been operating since about February of this year, and the 2KY services commenced shortly after the licences were granted (because they used existing transmitters). The Tasmanian service has not commenced because the TAB in Tasmania decided not to convert 7HT to FM and to retain racing programs on that commercial radio station. In May 1993, the ABA announced that demand The for spectrum for narrowcasting services in metropolitan areas exceeded supply and that it would consider making available planned high power AM channels for narrowcast purposes following its determination of planning priorities. It further announced that such channels would only be made available in those places where it would be several years before fonnal broadcasting planning would be detennined. This was necessary because the requirements for national (ABC, SBS and Parliamentary Broadcasting), commercial and community broadcasters take priority over narrowcasting for access to broadcasting channels. In order to resolve the allocation of these soughtafter channels, the ABA has announced that it would arrange for the channels to be allocated through a price-based allocation (tender or auction) system as required by the Radiocommunications Act 1992 then proclaimed to commence on 1 July 1993. The ABA announced its broadcasting planning priorities on 30 September 1993. It is currently working with the Spectrum Management Agency to detennine the allocation system for transmitter licences for services using the broadcasting services bands. This breaks new ground and the scheme must be fonnulated in accordance with the new law. It is being critically examined by various experts and is expected to be in place by February 1994.",132
