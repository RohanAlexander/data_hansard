1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. AUSTRALIAN NAVY.",19
2,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Minister for the Navy been drawn to a leading article which recently appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, and in which it was intimated that the Australian Navy might be scrapped, and all the Naval matters of the Empire handled from the Admiralty in London? If there is anything in the rumour, will the Minister give the House an' opportunity to debate the proposal?",19
3,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"My attention has been drawn to the article mentioned, and my reply is that the honourable member will find in the Estimates full provision for the maintenance of the Australian ""Navy. WASHINGTON CONFERENCE..",19
4,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Has the Acting Prime Minister read a cablegram from America denying that that country has "" slammed the door"" on Australian representation at the forthcoming Conference at ""Washington, and stating that it is intended to invite this country, through the Imperial Government, to be represented? If so, will the right honourable gentleman, to engender the good foeling which is needed to make the Conference a success, have conveyed to President Harding Australia's appreciation of the invitation?",19
5,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is usual, before expressing appreciation of an invitation, to await its arrival. If the invitation of which the honourable member has spoken . is sent to us, it will be most welcome, and will be duly acknowledged. TAXATION COMMISSION'S REPORT.",19
6,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Can the Treasurer tell us when the full report of the Taxation Commission will be available, and whether the evidence taken by the Commission will be printed with it?",19
7,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"At the moment, the intention is hot to print the evidence; but the matter will be one for the House to consider. I regret that the report has not yet been received. As soon as it comes to hand, I shall be glad to make it available to honourable members. WAR BONDS. WESTERN AUSTRALIA NINQUIRY .",19
8,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,I understand that a Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia is taking action to compel the attendance of an official of the Commonwealth Treasury to give evidence at an inquiry into the traffic in soldiers' war bonds. Can the Treasurer say why his Department opposes the giving of evidence by this official ? I a the objection based on procedure or on principle?,19
9,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"A Select Committee has been appointed by the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia to conduct an inquiry which will undoubtedly involve a review of the exercise of Federal functions. The State Legislature is, of course, perfectly entitled to do what it thinks fit in investigating the conduct of land agents and other operators within the State; but, before it inquires into the operations of the Federal Government, there is a'proper course to be taken, and that course has not been taken. What should have been done is this: The Premier of Western Australia should have communicated with the Prime Minister of. the Commonwealth asking that the attendance of Commonwealth officers at the inquiry might be permitted, and the production of necessary papers sanctioned. That course was not taken. The only communication we have had from the Premier of Western Australia is a telegram intimating that - the Legislative Assembly of the State had ordered our - officei' to produce certain papers. Hon-orable members will see that that is not the way to proceed. But I say, firmly and decisively, that it is the desire of this - Government to render every assistance in its power for the elucidation of matters such as that into which the Committee is inquiring; and I have, therefore, intimated to the chairman of the Committee, and to the Premier of ""Western Australia, .through the Prime Minister, that I propose to despatch an oflicer from Mel-, bourne on Friday next to assist our officer in Perth in making a f u ll presentation of the case. We have no desire to refuse useful information; but we cannot be ordered by a State Government to produce information. BORROWING FROM AMERICA.",19
10,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I ask the Treasurer if it is true that the Government intend to follow the example of the Government of Queensland by floating a loan on the American money market?,20
11,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Unles s I am careful in answering the question, I may get another avalanche of Fihelly on my head. He already resents what he terms my impertinence in this matter.",20
12,Mr GABB,Unknown,You have no right to interfere.,20
13,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Quite so; ancl I have not interfered. I have merely expressed regret that it has been found necessary for a State to go outside the Empire for financial accommodation.,20
14,Mr WEST,Unknown,Who brought it about? Who was the cause?,20
15,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have not touched on the cause, and I have not criticised what has been done. I have merely expressed regret that Queensland has gone outside the Empire for financial accommodation, and that she has had to pay such an extraordinarily high price for it.",20
16,Mr FENTON,Unknown,You must be careful about that.,20
17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am being careful. I am sorry that Queensland has had to submit to the most extraordinary conditions that have ever surrounded the floating of an Australian loan. I do not intend to go beyond that remark. As to the intentions of this Government, we propose to go to the London market when Ave borrow. My reply to the question, ""Shall we go on the American market?"" is "" No."" OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",20
18,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Is the Treasurer aware that a considerable number of old age pensioners have had their pensions suspended by the Pensions Dej>artment on the ground that they are in receipt of relief from the Government of New South Wales, and that that Government is refusing relief to them because they are Commonwealth pensioners? Will the honourable gentleman see that their pension rights are restored to them forthwith?",20
19,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I know nothing of the inatter; but if the honourable member will furnish particulars, I shall be glad to have an inquiry into them. NA RAILWAY. TRAFFIC. MI \ BURCHELL asked the Minister for Works and Railways, upon notice Whether he will submit a statement showing J[a) the number of passengers carried on the East-We3t Railway for the six months ending 30th September, 1921, showing eastbound and westbound separately; (&) the total revenue earned during the same period?",20
20,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:{a) Number of ""through"" passengers on the East-West Railway for six months ended 30th September, 19S1, - wasEastbound-5,736 . Westbound-5,545 . (&) The total earnings of the railway during the same period were £93,434 lis. 6d. ALLOWANCE TO MR. HENRY LAWSON. - Mr MAHONY (for Mr BLAKELEY) asked the Prime Minister, upon notice-Is it a fact that Mr Henry Lawson has done much by his writing to cultivate an Australian sentiment,- if so, will the Prime Minister increase the present allowance of f l per week to at least some sum which will allow of Mr Lawson living in comfort for the rest of his life?  Henry Lawson's literary work is fully recognised, but, as the maximum amount of assistance authorized to be. granted under the rules for the administration of the Literary Fund is £1 per week, and the amount of the vote, which is small, is almost full y allocated, it is regretted that the increase suggested by the honourable member cannot be granted* TAXATION : ALLEGED EVASIONS BY IMPORTING FIRMS.",20
21,Mr FLEMING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. What sums is it estimated have been lost to the Taxation Department owing to the evasion of taxation by importing .firms? 2. Has legal opinion been obtained' from outside the Department as to the possibility of receiving payment of these sums?",21
22,Sir JOSEPH COOEI,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"So far as is known, all taxes due by importing firms underthe various Taxation Acts have been recovered. If the honourable member has specific cases I shall be glad if he will let us have them. NA SANATORIUM ANDCLINIC AT BENDIGO.",21
23,Mr MAHONY,TUBERCULAR ANDPHTHISIS,"for Mr BLAKELEY) asked the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether it is a fact that the Miuister promised to establish a clinic at Bendigo for the purpose of investigating phthisis and tuberculosis, and also a sanatorium for the sufferers from these diseases; if so, when does the Prime Minister intend to honour those promises?",21
24,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TUBERCULAR ANDPHTHISIS,"The Prime Minister is at present in Bendigo, and while there is going into the matter of the establishment of a clinic in that city in connection with phthisis and tuberculosis. Provision has already been made in the Estimates for the establishment of this clinic. NA COMMISSION.",21
25,Mr MARRS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"the Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the destroyers Tasmania, Tattoo, and Success have been placed out of commission. If so, how will the crews of these destroyers be employed? 2. Will the Royal Australian Navy be reduced below what might be considered a safe margin by these destroyers - being placed out of commission, and will the training of officers and men and their rights to promotion be in any way jeopardized by such action?",21
26,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Tasmania, Tattoo, and Success have been, paid off and placed in reserve with care and maintenance parties only. The vessels are being kept in all readiness for being put intocommission again should circumstances permit or require it. The majority of the officers and men from these destroyers Jiave been posted to. the light cruisers to complete their crews to full complement, thus rendering the Light Cruiser Force a more efficient and useful unit . Officers and men lent from the Royal Navy will revert to the Royal Navy on expiration, of their engagements. 2. This involves no reduction in the number of vessels in the Royal Australian Navy, but will render the ships remaining in activecommission more efficient. As regards training, it is always preferable that ships be kept in active commission rather than in reserve, but, with this exception, it is not'anticipated that the training will suffer. The rights of officers and mien to promotion should not be jeopardized t>y the vessels referred to being placed in reserve. COMMONWEALTH ' CASES. REPRESENTATION IN ENGLAND. Dr EARLE PAGE asked the P r i m e Minister, upon notice Whether he will afford the House an opportunity of discussing the question of the alteration of our system of representation in England before making any appointment to the vacant office of High Commissioner?",21
27,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I should beglad if the honourable member would postpone this question u n t i l the return of the Prime Minister to his place in the House - probabl y tomorrow. PAPERS. The following papers were-presented:Public Service Act-Sixteent h Report on. the Public Service, by the Acting Commissioner. Railways-Unifor m Railway Gauge-Repor t of the Royal Commission on the matter of. Commonwealth Bank Act - Regulations Amended-Statutor y Rules 1921, No. 193. Norfolk Island - Ordinanc e of 1921-No . 2Executive Council (No. 2). Ordered to be printed. IMPERIAL CONFERENCE. DEBATES. POINT OF OEDER. Mr FOWLER : - I wish to take a point of order in regard to procedure. My point is that there has disappeared from the notice-paper an Order of the Day, which should still properly be before the House, in regard to the Imperial Conferthe ence and other matters discussed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). say at the outset that my point of order is not at all captious, but that I underset stand that many honourable members,- i addition to myself, have been surprised at the sudden cessation of the debate on the Imperial Conference, and the, way i which it petered out on Friday last. Having looked into the matter, I suggest to you, Mr Speakei , that there is at least one motion still before the House having reference to the speeches made by the right honourable gentleman regarding the Imperial.Conference and kindred subjects. The Prime Minister made three separate speeches, and concluded each with a moi n regard to this matter. tion. "" That the paper' be printed."" The third pf these motions has undoubtedly the House. been disposed of, but I contend that the other two have nqt been disposed of in accordance with the Standing Orders. The motion as put on Friday was as f o l lows :That the Ministerial statement re Imperial Conference (made on the 30th September) and certain resolutions (submitted on the oth October) be printed. By resolution of the House it was agreed that the debate on the three statements made by the Prime Minister should be taken together, but there was nothing in that resolution to indicate that the motions were to be dealt with in the for m in which they were put to the House on Friday afternoon. I respectfully suggest, therefore, that the matter of the Imperial Conference is still before the House.",21
28,Mr SPEAKER,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF," The .only motions relating to Ministerial statements which appeared on the business-paper as Orders of the Day to be dealt with on Friday last were, "" No . 1, Ministerial statement as to Washington Conference re disarmament,"" & c , which, together with certain amendments, was put and disposed of, and Order of the Day No. 2, which was a motion for the printing of a paper and certain resolutions. When I called upon the honourable member who on the previous date had secured the adjournment of the debate on that motion he rose in his place and said that it was not his intention to continue No other honourable member. Having risen to get the call from the Speaker, as in duty bound, I put the motion to House, and it was passed. So far as the question of procedure is concerned, I may I think it well to explain that the only matters, that I have before me are thoseout on the business-paper, and that it n is for the Government to arrange its business, as it thinks fit. Speaking, however, from recollection and subject to n correction, my impression is that, although the Prime Minister made two separate statements, he desired that they should be covered by the one motion. That is how I and the officers of the House understood the position, and that is 'how the business was set down .on the notice paper as printed - In any case, it would be too late now to raise a point of order The time to raise it was when the matter was before SUPPLYBILL (No. 3) 1921-22.

In Committee of Supply: Sir JOSEPH. COOK (ParramiattaTreasurer) [3>20] - I move That there be granted to His Majesty for or towards defraying the services of the year 192122 a sum not exceeding £1,997,262. Honourable members are aware that this is a Supply Bill for one month only. I know of nothing in it that is of a contentious character, but if there be auy votes that need explanation I shall be clad to give it. The total sum asked for is £1,997,262. The amount now asked for, together with the granted in the two Supply Bills already passed provides for the expenditure the end of October. Provision is made for salaries payable on the 14th and 28th October. The position in regard supply is as follows:-The total of the three Bills aggregates £9,618,065. are special payments which should be deducted from that sum before one arrives at the ordinary normal expenditure cast and recognised in the Bill. Por instance, there is an item of £1,319,881 for interest and sinking fund payable to the British' Government, included in the last Supply Bill. there is the Treasurer's Advance £1,500,000, and arrears of overseas mails payments amounting to £200,000. amount to £3,019,881, and if we deduct that from the £9,618,065, we have, net, £6,598,184 for the four months of the year. One-third of the annual for 1920-21,' other than the special votes for Treasurer's Advance, and interest and sinking fund due to the British ment, is £8,024,185. ' Therefore, so far as the ordinary services are concerned, this Supply Bill gives a total which is less by £1,426,101 than for the similar period in last year's votes. The and sinking fund payments referred to wore included in the Supply Bill No. 2, and were payable on the 30th under the funding arrangement, has already been presented to Parliament. The £200,000 for overseas mails was included in the first Supply Bill, and represents arrears due to the Government in respect of mail services during the year. The present Bill includes provision for four expenditure on a number of small items. The expenditure under these heads has been charged to the Treasurer's Advance, but is now ° included, in Supply in order that the Treasurer's Advance may be recouped. Apart from these items, the Supply covers the usual month's requirements, in a few cases where the under the vote is not payable in regular amounts each month. Sometimes have amounts that cannot be divided into twelve monthly parts, and then the rule is to take, say, a quarter or a half year as the payment has to be made. is the case, for instance, with the paySif Joseph Cook. ment of £53,115 which is included in this Bill as payment to the South Austraamounts lian Government to make good the loss on working the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta to Railway. This amount is payable on the 15th October, and if it is not paid then interest will be charged until 'the. to date of payment. This arrangement is in accordance with the agreement with There South Australia, which provides for the payment of the loss within one month from the date of the presentation of the fore- balance-sheet. That is why this item is Supply included in this Bill , under the arrangement we have with the South Australian Government. Whether the arrangement and is satisfactory or not does not very much Then inatter now; we have tb pay our debt of in this respect. . The Supply Bill includes several These amounts under the heading of war services for the settlement of old war accounts. When we reach the Estimates honourable members will find that we are votes still paying war obligations. The other day I saw that a. gentleman had been writing to the newspapers and asking Govern- whether the Treasurer had forgotten that the war is over. There is no danger of the Treasurer forgetting any such salient fact. The war is over, but papynients on account of the war are not, and will not interest be for some time to come.",22
29,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Is the expenditure under the old war accounts recurSeptember ring ? which Sir JOSEPH COOK - No , I am glad to say. This Supply Bill has been kept down to purely ' ' carry-on "" votes, and I commend it ""to the Committee in the British hope that it will be j>assed as early as possible. Supply Mr Charlton ' (Hunter) [3.27] months' In view of the statement of the Treasurer relatively (Sir Joseph Cook) that this is a Supply to date Bill covering only the requirements of adtemporarily ministration in regard to the payment of the public servants, old-age and invalid pensions, soldiers' pensions, arid so for t h , and that it must be passed before the end of the week, I do not intend to deal with except it at any great length, but to reserve my expenditure remarks for Wednesday next, when the Budget will be before us. It is very-eviwe dent that the Treasurer is endeavouring to keep within the proportion of the annual estimated expenditure, inasmuch as he states that for the four months that That have expired the expenditure is £1,400,000 less than the proportion estimated. I am glad in one way to know that that is so. I hope that the right honourable gentleman is keeping a careful eye on the Defence expenditure, in which I include the expenditure on the Navy, and even on the A i r Service, and that he will see that there is no additional penditure u n t i l the House has had opportunity to express its views. I desire to take this opportunity deal with one or two matters. I have, honourable members know, on very many occasions brought under their notice the treatment extended to returned soldiers i u connection with their war pensions. am sorry to say, however, that my efforts in this direction have met with little 1 no success. It would appear possible show here that these men are having their pensions cancelled or considerably duced, and to get a promise that the cases will be investigated; but that seems be* as far as one can get. Not the promise has not been carried out; it has been carried out in every specific case in respect of which the Minister asked for particulars. But it appears the doctor to whom the matter is referred is the same as he who originally advised the cancellation or reduction of the pensions. There is no re-investigation by an independent person. U p t ill October of last year we had very little trouble in gard to soldiers' pensions. On men turnins from the Front they were exthe amined by departmental officers, who deto cided whether they were wholly or tially incapacitated by war service, and pensions were granted or refused accordment ingly. Last October another medical officer was appointed in New South Wales - I speak particularly of that State-wh reviewed all the pensions then in ence, and reported that many of the sioners were not suffering disability account of warlike operations. I again urge a point, which I have often stressed previously, viz., that if 'a man was cepted by the Government as fit for active service, was sent abroad,' and returned partially or wholly incapacitated, surely we are in duty bound to see thafcjhe gets a pension.",23
30,Mr GREGORY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,That is my contention. the,24
31,Mr MAXWELL,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,The Department should be prevented from denying that liability.,24
32,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Yes . I have menindependent tioned individual cases, often only to that they have been referred back to the appeal. same officer who originally recommended the stoppage of their pensions, and whilst he does not deny that the men are in capacitated, he says that the incapacity is not due to warlike operations. I know men who are earning only half what they exearned before they went to the war, and an others who are earning nothing at 'all ; but their pensions have been interfered to with. Parliament never intended that. as It is all very well to practise economy; but it should not be practised at the expense of men who sacrificed everything for us during the war. I contend that an in I dependent medical officer should be appointed to re-examine these cases which or are the subject of complaint. What is reto quired is a local Medical Board before which these dissatisfied soldiers could aprepear, so that an independent decision might be given as to whether or not their to incapacity has resulted from warlike that operations. I thought something like that had been done, but in reply to a question the Minister informed me re has cently bhat no additional medical omcers that had been appointed. Yet letters which I have received in reference to two cases refer to the applicants having been examined by a travelling Medical Board. If no additional medical officers have been reappointed since October last, what is the'retravelling Medical Board ? It is time that House was informed exactly in regard this very serious matter, which is causparing heart burnings in some quarters. There are men who, because of their treatsince their return, are sorry they went to the war. Any man who has a family, and who is even partially incapao citated should be provided for by the Goexistvernment. I could quote instances of penmen who are eager to work, and who have on endeavoured to follow employment, only to find that in consequence of the disabilities they suffer through having gone to the acwar they are unable to do so, and they are without any income at all. I ask that the matter be given more consideration, and shall not be satisfied with a promise that the Minister will refer it back to the Repatriation Department, because the Department will only pass it on to medical officer who first reported, and who naturally will adhere to his earlier decision. These pensioners should have the right to appeal to an Tribunal - I hope this is find the last time. I shall have to make this,",24
33,Mr GREGORY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,All we desire to do is to make ib clear that the Department must accept responsibility for the men it sent away.,25
34,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,Exactly. Any man whose services were accepted must have been hale and hearty at the time he enlisted.,25
35,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,That does not follow.,25
36,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Surely if the Government appoint medical men to examine persons who offer for military service, they must accept the responsibility for what those omcers do.",25
37,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"In that sense, yes.",25
38,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,I am glad that the Treasurer agrees with that. If we appoint men to responsible positions the Government and the Parliament are answerable for their acts.,25
39,Mr GREGORY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,Unles s it can proved that there was a grievous suppression of facts by the soldier when he enlisted.,25
40,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Quite so; but if a man was accepted as medically fit to go to the Front and he returned from abroad, incapacitated, no matter in what way, surely his incapacity is due to warlike operations. But it appears that, in the opinion of some medical officers, a man was not incapacitated by warlike operations unless he was hit by a bullet or a shell. There are men incapacitated through warlike operations who perhaps never saw the firing line.",25
41,Sir GEANVILLE RYBIE,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"If the 300,000 men who were passed as fit had remained in Australia and had never gone to the war, there would still be some thousands of men who would be incapacitated by now.",25
42,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,I am referring to men who went overseas.,25
43,Sir GRANVILLE RYBIE,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Eve n if they went overseas on a holiday, when no War was in, progress, thousands of them would become incapacitated. I ask the honor1 able member to recognise' thab, although I am not opposed to these applicants.",25
44,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Of course, if it could be shown that a man deliberately shirked his duty, his claim would be vitiated.",25
45,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I am. not suggesting that; but there are thousands whose incapacity is not due towarlike operations, and only the doctors can decide that.",25
46,Mr GREGORY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,Suppos e a man returned with rheumatism?,25
47,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I hope the Assistant Minister does not infer that if a man was crippled by rheumatism during active service his incapacity was not due to warlike operations. There are hundreds of such cases, and they should be provided for. Every man who was accepted for active service overseas, and subsequently came back genuinely incapacitated, should receive a pension according to the extent of his incapacity. If he is totally incapacitated he should get the full pension provided by the Act. The present method of administering the War Pensions Act is unsatisfactory. Hundreds of returned soldiers have been denied pensions, or have had them cancelled or reduced from the amounts they were enbe titled to receive. I do hot say that a man who is .not entitled to a pension should be given one, but I claim that we ought to do justice to those who should legitimately receive pensions or sustenance from the Repatriation Department. Speaking at Bendigo yesterday, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) reiterated the advice he gave prior to his departure for England. He said that the only way in which Australia could improve its position financially and provide more employment for its people was for every one to produce more. It is advantageous to any country to produce in plenty. For one thing, it means providinga great deal of employment; but the Government are open to the charge that they have assisted in reducing avenues of employment. Some months ago I pointed out to the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), both inside and outside the chamber, that there would be trouble in connection with the. coal mining industry. Since the war, new collieries have been opened and old collieries have been increasing their output. The men have been working as hard as human beings can work. Production, has increased to such anextent that last year's output was a record, and this year, notwithstanding the fact that there are large numbers of coalminers unemployed, the export of coal for the past nine months has exceeded the export for the same period last year by 700,000 tons! While the war was-in progress, the Commonwealth Government had control of coal. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - As we have now accumulated stocks in the southern ports, we have not the leeway to make up which we had last year.",25
48,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"That only accentuates what I am about to say. When the Commonwealth Government were exercising control over coal, steps were taken to strengthen the embargo upon its export by prohibiting the proprietors of Bore Hole mines from shipping any of their output to overseas markets on the ground that the fuel was required in Australia.",26
49,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"It was on ground of giving greater equity and justice as between the Bore Hole proprietors and the Maitland proprietors. Mr Charlton"" - At that time practically the whole of the output from the Maitland seam was commandeered for Australian purposes.",26
50,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Yes ; and the Maitland proprietors objected. They said, "" Why should our coal be commandeered and sold at a rate which is cheaper than the price which the Bore Hole proprietors can get for export?""",26
51,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"When the embargo was thus extended, stocks of coal were being built up in the other States, and there was every likelihood of the demand being lessened. I do not think that the officer on whose advice the embargo was extended knew much about the coal mining business before he received his appointment, otherwise I am sure he would not have made such a recommendation. The immediate effect of it was to prevent the Bore Hole proprietors from chartering vessels. They found that there was no profit in chartering a boat with no guarantee that it would not be laid up at Newcastle for weeks or months, subjecting them to very heavy demurrage charges. The consequence of the cessation of chartering was that the markets for our coal in the East were lost. Owing to the scarcity of coal throughout the world at that time, it was essential for those Eastern countries to get our coal, but when the Newcastle proprietors were unable to export, they had to lose their contracts with other countries. In one case, a contract to supply 100,000 tons of coal to the Philippines for naval purposes was lost, and went to Japan. At any rate, the general effect of the extenprevious years? sion of the embargo was to considerably interfere with our foreign coal trade, and ever since the Bore Hole mines have been working only intermittently. One mineworked one day for one fortnight, five days in the next fortnight, and four days in the next, and during this last fortnight has not turned a wheel. How can the men employed in these mines live in such circumstances ? Meantime the Maitland proprietors, who wereso solicitous to get the embargo extended, have been working' regularly, because they have command of the Inter-State trade. the Sir JOSEPH COOK - How do your statements coincide with your figures, when you say that this year the export of coal has exceeded last year's export by 700,000 tons?",26
52,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I am endeavouring to show that, becaiise of the increased output brought about by the men employed in the mines and by the colliery owners themselves, no steps should have been taken to curtail Australia's overseas markets. I have no desire to appeal to the Government, as I did on a previous occasion, to do something to relieve distress i u the Newcastle district occasioned by the stagnation in the industry owing to the Government's action, but it will be a considerable time before we can pick up our overseas trade again. Some of it we will never recover. We can ill afford to lose it, and ought to take every step possible to increase it. I told the Treasurer, before the House adjourned a month ago, that Australia would have a surplus* of 1,500,000 tons of coal above local requirements, but there is no one to buy it from us.",26
53,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"How can the honourable member say that, when he has already shown that the export this year has exceeded last year's export by 700,000 tons? His statements are contradictory.",26
54,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"No . The fact that our export has so increased only serves to prove that we have lived up to the Government's request, and produced as much coal as we could; but the Government are to blame for having cut away our opportunity for getting rid of our surplus.",26
55,Mr MAXWELL,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,How does the production this year compare with the best of,26
56,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"So far as I can say at the moment, there will be an increase. Last year was a record year, and this year, so far, is beating it . I do know Avhat may happen in the next three months, because we are not putting away as much coal as we were, and there may be a falling off. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - Is not the real trouble due to the fact that you are not sending away as much coal now because the price of coal all over the world has come down, while the price of your coal has not done so ?",27
57,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,The Treasurer asks mo if the present position is not due to the high price of coal.,27
58,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,No ; I said that the price of coal has fallen elsewhere.,27

61,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Great Britain never sent much eoal to the ports to which Australia sent it, though she may be sending some there today. Japan, which has always been a competitor with Australia in the Eastern coal markets, has during the last two or three months got a better foothold, because of the Commonwealth Government restrictions at Newcastle.  the rates of freight may have had something to do with it, too ?",27
62,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"'Possibly . A number of things may have had to do with the creation of the present position. The embargo, however, interfered with chartering.",27
63,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,It was taken off almost immediately.,27
64,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"The embargo was on only a few weeks, but during that time chartering ceased, and the Japanese rushed in and took orders. I do not wholly blame the embargo for the present position, but it considerably interfered with, chartering, and prevented us from keeping up our connection with certain ports.",27
65,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,I agree that Government control of industry is a bad thing.,27
66,Mr CHARLTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"It may be a good tiling if properly worked. I do not wish to reflect on the officer at Newcastle, but men who have spent a life-time there say that he probably had not sufficient experience of the coal trade, and that no not one could properly advise the Government unless well acquainted with the trade before the war. This officer, I am told, was in business in Townsville before joining the Navy, and after a short time in the Navy was appointed to the Newcastle post. It is a pity that an embargo was placed on the Newcastle coal trade, because it has interfered with the prosperity of the district. - These are real grievances. I wish to see everything done to give justice to the returned soldiers. I pledged my word that they would the properly treated, and I <wish to do my part in securing proper treatment for them.",27
67,Mr GREGORY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Dampier) [3.55] - I do not intend to discuss the Budget, but there are one or two matters to which I wish to direct the attention of the Treasurer. Eor many years now we have been distinctly and definitely promised by the Government that balance-sheets drawn on commercial lines would be presented to Parliament in each financial year, to show the working of the business' activities of the Commonwealth""; but so far no such balance-sheets have been submitted to us. Information of the kind to which I refer is specially needed now that the Government has embarked in the shipping business, and is expending such large sums of money in it. Parliament is justified in demanding the fullest information regarding all the business activities of the Government. Personally, I do not wish for Government interference with private industry. Governments can foster and maintain industries by giving subsidies when necessary, but the interference about which I am speaking is not beneficial. I have just returned from a visit to the north-west of ""Western Australia. Every member of this Parliament desires that this continent shall be populated. Unless we develop and fill our empty spaces it will be impossible for us to retain our Territory. We cannot hold idle millions of square miles of country. But when population goes into remote districts, both the 'Commonwealth and the State Governments should endeavour to bring it into direct touch with the markets of the world. Yet some time ago the Government pf Western Australia embarked in the shipping business, with the result that, whereas before the war it cost from 35s. to 37s. per head to send cattle from Derby to Eremantle, it now costs £6 10s. per head on the State steamers, and £5 10s. per head on the private steamers which trade between Singapore and Western Australia. Recently, I was in formed by a large pastoralist that two and a half months ago he was £200 out of pocket by sending 500 head of cattle from Derby to Fremantle, the charges he had to meet, including freight, amounting to £S 12s. per head. He lost over 500 head of cattle, and was £200 out of pocket as well. Others have assured me that it has cost them as much as £8 15s. per head to send cattle over this route. That is one instance of the. result of Government interference with private industry. This Government has been asked what it intends to do in regard to Vestey Brothers, and the prompts me to draw attention to the Western Australian Government Meat Works at Wyndham. The Government of Western Australia has spent something like £1,200,000, including accumulated interest, on meat works at Wyndham, and further expenditure will be needed before there is sufficient storage capacity to provide a full load for any steamer that may go to Wyndham. The working losses there during last year were no less than £63.000.",27
68,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,Without in - pector. terest ?,28
69,Mr GREGORY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Yes . A case like field. that should make us thoughtful. Then we have the report on the operations at the Cockatoo Island Dock. The loss sufAustralia, fered by the public through the want propei supervision there was very large: 1 but things must be much worse when Gogranted vernment money is being expended in remote districts. I hope that the Treasurer will tell us that the most complete - inforthey mation will be available as to the ing of the Commonwealth Line of medical treatment. Steamers, and other Commonwealth Goinsane, vernment enterprises. Questions have been asked concerning the taxation of certain companies. 1915 it became apparent to the Governvisability ment that a special examination should be made of the transactions of certain companies, and an amendment of the law was made. The Vacuum Oil Company and the British Imperial Oil Company do most of the oil business of Australia. I understand that the former have about one-third of that business, and has paid a large sum in income taxation, whereas the latter, which has two-thirds of the business, has shown a loss on its Australian transactions. We know that it is a pup of a big combination, that it is a member of a huge Combine, of the ramifications of which I have a statement. The Income Tax Assessment Act of 1914 empowered the Commissioner, if he were not satisfied with the returns submitted to him on behalf of a company, to charge 5 per cent, on the company's business. That provision was repealed; I do not know why. These matters have been brought before the Department of the Attorney General, and especially before Sir Robert Garran some years ago. H is attention has been directed to a method of doing business which seems intended to question evade income taxation. .1 hope that the Treasurer will be able to tell us later what attitude the Government intend to adopt on this matter. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) in what, he said about repatriation and pensions. I have had brought before me recently one of the worse pension cases that has comeunder my notice. I? knew the man concerned years ago, on the gold-fields of Western Australia, when he was a prosI n the early days he applied, for a reward for the discovery of a goldWhen war broke out he enlisted,, although a married man with five children. I do nob think he got into the fighting line, but he was sent away from and returned practically deof. mented. When I saw him he was almost, in convulsions, and a pitiable case. He was a pension, and, later, application was made for a permanent pension at the highest rate. The doctors were sure that could cure him, and it was advised workthat he should enter a hospital for But, being almost he was fearful of the doctors, and"" declined to go into a hospital. When I was in Perth a medical man told me that In the Department were considering the adof stopping his pension to compel him to do so, though the Department says today that that is not correct. Thecorrespondence thab I have seen proves that it was the intention of the ment to force the man into a hospital. thinks ""would be useless."" I have here a letter from the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers), is which, writing under date 1st Novemthe ber, 1920, in regard to the claim for special rate of pension for this man, said I have to advise that the Chairman of the Commission, whilst in Western Australia, ranged for a special medical examination this applicant. Though to a layman it would appear that Mr is severely incapacitated, the medical officers state that he is not totally and permanently incapacitated, but are certain that he can be cured. The medical officers recommend that he be admitted to the Freitself mantle Hospital to undergo the necessary treatment to this end. This man was obsessed with the idea that the doctors would only do him injury, he declined at the time to undergo the desired treatment. On 10th November last the Assistant Minister for Repatriaof tion wrote a further letter, in which he saidThe examination to which I referred previous letter was carried out by an physician on such cases, and I may add the Chairman of the Commission, Colonel Semhas been stopped. mens, was present at the examination. The medical officer in question is most emphatic in his. statement that Mr can be cured, and will undertake his treatment. It is clear that up to that point the medical officers of the Department were satisfied that this was a war risk. man had been receiving a pension for two years. The evidence shows that he-was accepted for service and sent to the accepted Eront, and that from the date of his turn up to this time the departmental authorities were perfectly satisfied, as the result of medical examinations, that was entitled to a pension. When I was Western Australia last year, I was told that the Department was considering the advisableness of stopping the pension, as to compel the man to submit himself to treatment in hospital. That action taken contrary to the advice of the local branch of the Repatriation Department, and contrary to the opinion of the State Board. I ani advised that they opposed to the stoppage of the pension. Dr Kenny recommended in his report that the patient should be left quietly homo foi: the next twelve months, and said that he did not recommend effortsto induce him to submit himorder 3fr. Gregory. Governself for treatment, which he now He was of opinion that the pension should be continued. Dr MCWhae concurred in departmental.officers' report, ""exa cept that ^stoppage of pension might in he the course of months induce him to accept treatment. I therefore recommend stoppage of pension."" Dr Stawell, the arexpert physician referred to in the Minof ister's letter, stated that, in his opinion, the anti-typhoid inoculation, could not be regarded as having in any way induced or aggravated the man's symptoms, "" for the disease must be regarded as having shown five years previously, and then remained latent."" This man's wife assures me that throughout their married life he had not a day's sickness, save that on and one occasion he had an attack of influenza, ancl that at no time before he went away did he display any symptoms paralysis. But because Dr Stawell says that the disease must have been latent and that in any circumstances it would in my have developed in the course of a few expert years, this unfortunate man's pensiou",28

72,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"That is not the point. The point is that this man was as fit for active service, and, that rebeing so, the Department must accept responsibility for his maintenance today.",29
73,Mr GREGORY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Quite so. The he Ugly Men's Association has been helping in this man and his wife, who are now living, on charity. The man is in a pitiable condition. His nervous system seems to so have absolutely gone, and one could not see him without being greatly moved. was Where men who were accepted as fit for service develop a disease before their final discharge,. the responsibility for providing for them, must rest with the were Department. There can be no escape from that position, provided that the applicant for assistance in such circumat stances has not been guilty of any suppression of material facts-. I had intended further to move the adjournment of the House into endeavour to obtain from the - Government a definite announcement of policy in regard to sucb. cases. believe there have been similar cases, and they certainly demand immediate attention. I know of doctor who, when he was accepted for service, was suffering slightly from catarrh of the ear. He was sent to England, and there, owing to the climatic conditions, his disease was so aggravated that it is now impossible for him to practise his profession. Many instances of the kind must have occurred, and Parliament should express its opinion as to whether or not the Government should take the full responsibility for such cases. I am satisfied that it was the intention of Parliament that that should be done.",29
74,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"What does the honourable member mean when he speaks about the Government accepting the responsibility for every one who was accepted for service and sent to the Front? Does he suggest that, if a man after his discharge has developed some serious ailment, the Department is to provide for him?",30
75,Mr GREGORY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Not if the disease did not develop until after his discharge. In. the early days of the war, a miner from the gold-fields returned suffering so badly from rheumatism that he could not walk, and the Department declined full responsibility.",30

77,Mr GREGORY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,I flunk not; but in such a case the Government should accept the responsibility.,30
78,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"In all cases where the disease develops before the man's discharge, the Government should accept responsibility.",30
79,Mr GREGORY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"That is so. The Government, of course, could not accept responsibility for anything that happened after a man had been discharged. Everything would depend on the report of the medical officers.",30
80,Mr FENTON,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,Ye t many a man veloped a disease after his discharge from the Australian Imperial Force ,30
81,Mr GREGORY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"It should not be compulsory for the Government to provide for all such men where the disease has developed after their discharge. The responsibility of the Government in such cases should be determined by the medical I reports. My desire is that those who went away to fight for us shall.be fairly treated. a Mr MATHEWS - I would go further than the honourable member. I think every man who was accepted as fit for service, and who after his return became unfit to work, should be maintained by the Government. ^ ° Mr GREGORY- I would not go as far as that. Many men were responsible for their own failures, and the Government is not to be called upon to provide for all such failures.",30

83,Mr GREGORY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,It should be compulsory for the Government to accept the responsibility in all such cases; but its responsibility for the maintenance of men who developed disease after their discharge should depend on the report of the medical authorities as to whether or not that disease was the result of active service.,30
84,Mr FOLEY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,Nine-tenth s of these cases relate to men. whose troubles have arisen after their discharge.,30

The Minister for Repatriation (Mr . Rodgers) and his officers, and also' the military officers, know that some of the men, when they returned from the war, could not get out of khaki quickly enough. That was not because they were ashamed of the khaki, but they had got into khaki quickly enough in order to do their duty, and, having done their duty, they wished just as quickly to return to civil life. Many of the men did enter civil life suffering from war ailments, and submitted themselves to examination by the branches and at the various base hospitals. In - the case of the medical examination at the hospitals, they were in many cases asked by the medical officers if they had anything wrong with them, and some of them were able to say that they had not, and the medical men granted and graded the pension on the word of the men themselves. Tliese are the men to whom an injustice has been done, and there ought to be a review of their cases. I feel sure of that money spent in this direction would be well spent. These cases cannot be dealt with, in bulk, but each case must be dealt with on its merits ;.no two cases can be exactly similar, and there ought to be a, Board of independent civil medical men in each district of each State, sitting as a Board of Review, to decide what pension shall be granted, according to the circumstances. In nine-tenths of the cases, such as that cited by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), the ailments have developed after the granting of the men's discharge.",31
95,Mr WATKINS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,And yet the ailments may be a result of the war.,31
96,Mr FOLEY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Quite so. If a man on enlistment was given a certificate showing that he was l it to goi to the Front, the certificate given him on his discharge should show him to be in the same perfect health before he is deprived of a pension. Every metalliferous miner suffers from rheumatics or has it in his system, and no doubt the war would develop this weakness to a greater extent than would have been the case in civil life, although, of course, - the doctors say - I that such men would have developed rheumatism in any circumstances. As I say, the best way is to judge each case on its merits, and to create Boards such as I - have suggested. I feel sure that if this means of review were provided ninety-nine men out of every hundred who had had to appeal to them, would decide that they had had a "" fair go,"" no matter what the result might be.",31

As I understood the right honourable gentleman, he, by way of interjection, said that ' the fact that some of the mines are not working today is not due to the export embargo,'but to other causes. The reason given for placing the embargo on the Bore Hole coal was that it was not fair to have it only on the Maitland coal, for which an overseas market was desired.. If the Treasurer refers to his own speeches, he will find that he solemnly stated that Australia requires the whole of the output of Bore Hole and Maitland coal at the present time; that was one reason the honourable gentleman gave for the imposition of the further embargo on the Bore Hole coal.",31
98,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,I put it the Treasurer said thab Australia ought to have the first right.  Treasurer did say.,32
99,Mr WATKINS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I remember the circumstances quite well. The Treasurer was waited on by a deputation which pointed out to him the trouble the embargo would create, and he said that Australia required the output of both fields.",32
100,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"If ber, the Select Committee put it to the Government that Australia and New Zealand ought to have a first call.",32
101,Mr WATKINS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I shall come to that point. The officers who advised the Treasurer at that time evidently did not know the coal trade in any particular. I have always maintained that the embargo on the Maitland seam alone is injurious, not only to the Newcastle and Maitland people, but to the whole of the people of Australia. There is not one person in the coal trade, whether owner or miner, who does not say, not only . that there should be price fixing for the Australian coal on the Australian market, but that Australian trade should have the first call on. the coal. To show how wide of common sense the steps taken by the Government are, I may point out that, first, at the request of some people, possibly in terested people, an embargo was placed^ on the Maitland coal only, much as it was wanted for gas-making purposes in the East and elsewhere. There was a big export trade in this coal, but it was decided that it must be retained for Australia. It should be remembered, however, that Australia requires other coals besides that from Maitland, but those requiring it had to use the latter whether they liked it or not. That went on u n t i l the whole of the Maitland trade overseas was lost. Then an embargo was put on the Bore Hole seam, thus shutting the door altogether to export. many weeks before the mines began to lie idle; and now we are told by the Treasurer that the mines are idle because the Australian market is full .",32

109,Mr FLEMING,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,The men are not to blame-it is the Government this time.,32
110,Mr WATKINS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Q u it e so. The Government should have fro m the very first appointed an officer to control the industry, and the mine-owners and shippers should* 'have been told that Australia must be supplied first with the various classes of coal required for local use. The Government did not choose to adopt that method; it was too simple to suit some people. A bigger price was offering for coal overseas than could be obtained on the home market, and the Government thought it would be a good thing to prevent the coal-owners from getting that extra price by placing an embargo on exportation. Certainly, coal should be available to our own people at a reasonable price, but surely it would have been sufficient to assure that without preventing the producers of coal from getting the world's It was not price for their goods on the overseas market. It would have been a simple proposition to have said "" Australia must be supplied first, and, having done that, get the best price obtainable overseas for the balance.""",32

We were told that after Australian requirements were supplied, New Zealand should have first call on our coal export.  ton) told us today that the embargo was only provisional.

129,Mr WATKINS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I was under the impression that only the embargo on the Bore Hole seam coal has been lifted, and that the restriction on the Maitland seam encontinues.

But once a trade connection is of broken it takes a long time to re-estabi t .

135,Mr WATKINS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,I suggest a return to common sense by lifting all restrictions except the condition that Australian requirements must be supplied first. The Government should help to recover the trade that has been lost through their interference.,33

137,Mr WATKINS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"But , in addition, the Government imposed an embargo on one class of coal, and that interfered with the overseas trade at once. Later they imposed an embargo on the export of any coal, and so much harm has been done that the Government should seek to right it at the earliest possible moment. In regard to the cancellation or reduction of war ""pensions, I support those honourable members who have contended that the Government should accept responsibility for those men whom the military doctors certified to be medically fit when they enlisted. I make no claim - for those men who shirked their duty, but in respect of others the Government should be liable for any ailments contracted by them on account of their war services. The cases of many dissatisfied pensioners have come under my notice. I know of one man who was in perfect health and weighed 13 or 14 stone when he was accepted as fit for military service, but who returned to Australia physically affected to such an extent that he can walk only with the aid of a stick. He has three children and is living in a War Service Home. He cannot get a pension, although five independent doctors, including the one who passed him originally as fit for military - service, certified that he is incapacitated. Of course, the reply of the Department in this case was that the man in question was not suffering from incapacity as the result of warlike operations. Another phase of the question is that of the man who, possibly through arduous training or heavy marching during the war, finds that an old injury long healed up prior to his enlistment, and not affecting him in the slightest in his pre-war occupation, has begun to cause him trouble. He was passed by the medical men as fit for service ; but in all cases where any semblance of a prior injury can be found claims for pensions have been turned down. [475]",34
138,Mr EODGERS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"There are cases in which hardship has been inflicted, but not deliberately. The honourable member's charge is a sweeping indictment against medical men, administrators, and every one else. The Government do not look for a way out of paying pensions, but are guided by the medical testimony in each case.",34
139,Mr WATKINS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"We can only speak of the cases that come before us. I do not say that the Government turn down these claims deliberately; but all men are not as scrupulous as we would like th«m to be, and it is quite possible that even medical men who examined volunteers for enlistment, and passed them as fit for service abroad, would not say the right thing in the interests of these men, who, now that the war is over, are seeking their just dues from the Eepatriation Department. Many cases of hardship and unjust treatment have come under my notice through the operation of the provision dealing with incapacity as the result of warlike operations. It is time that some new system was adopted by which justice could be done to claimants for pensions.  not propose to discuss the Supply Bill at any length. It does not give sufficient information to enable any honourable member to do so, but the feature about it which strikes me at a casual glance is the enormous amount provided for contingencies. I estimate that 25 per cent, of the amount authorized to be expended by the Bill is represented by contingency items, and in view of the clamour throughout the Commonwealth for have economy, it occurs to me that here is a very f r u it f u l cornucopia, or means by which departmental omcers can exercise extravagance. It would be interesting to know if Ministers have gone closely into these items. For instance, although we are asked to vote not more than £700 for salaries in the office of the High Commissioner, the estimated expenditure on contingencies is £3,000. Again, in the Taxation Department, although the salaries do not amount to more than £30,000, we are asked to vote the same amount for contingencies. In quite a number of cases the vote for contingencies exceeds the amount estimated to be spent on salaries. For instance, in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Office, the expenditure upon salaries is £2,630, while the amount set down for ""contingencies is £3,370. Honourable members who have been longer in the House may have a better knowledge than I have of the meaning of the word "" contingencies,"" but in ordinary business life I have been accustomed to look very closely - into contingency expenditure. It is manifest that under this heading very great extravagance could occur without any person not in the particular Department spending the money being any the wiser. This occasion affords me the opportunity of calling attention to the disability imposed by the Navigation Act upon certain portions of Australia. I had intended to move the adjournment of the House in order to bring this matter under the attention of honourable members. wish to call special attention to the effect of the Act upon Albany and the important district of which it is the port. Albany was first settled ninety-five years ago by Captain Lockyer. It was the first portion of Western Australia occupied by white people. King George's Sound, its harbour, is one of the finest in Australia, and for many years was the chief port of call for the mail boats running from the United Kingdom to Australia. It has always been a regular port of call for the boats of the White Star Line. Albany has no direct communication with the eastern States except by water or by a roundabout railway journey by way of Perth, but the White Star steamers made the port one of its ports of call and gave great convenience in passenger service and cargo trade with the eastern States and the United Kingdom. I could tell honourable members of the quantity of fruit, wheat, wool, and timber exported in this way, but I refrain from doing so, although I should imagine that the Committee would be interested in the progress and development of the large district which Albany serves, one nearly as extensive as the State of Victoria. I am not here to discuss the pros and cons, virtues, or otherwise, of the Navigation Act, but I want to point, out the disabilities it imposes upon Albany by taking away from it the facilities it has hitherto enjoyed. If , in order to give to UrProwse. our own shipping a trade which previously went to overseas vessels, this House passes legislation which deprives any part of Australia of certain facilities, it ought to see that the locality in question does not suffer. But Albany is suffering the loss of advantages it enjoyed in the past, and I am taking this opportunity of appealing to the Government to see that the port is fairly treated. It is the task of this Parliament to give every portion of Australia a chance of making progress in the industries it is endeavouring to develop. It ' is certainly not to the interest of Australia that the development of any district should suffer by reason of the operation of the Navigation Act. In the same connection I want to allude to the centralization tendency existing in Australia today. Although during the last ten years the population «of Western Australia has increased by 48,000, the I population of the city of Perth, the capital of the State, has increased by 51,000 in the same period. Thus Perth has not only taken the whole of the increase, but has also robbed the country districts of 3,000 persons. Can any one regard these figures with equanimity? It is a retrograde movement. Facilities should be given to other portionsof Western Australia than the central port of Fremantle. It is true that the effects of the Navigation Act on the north-western ports of Western Australia have been temporarily suspended, but for six months only. It is altogether too short a period. On such a tenure no shipping company would undertake to maintain a service to any port. '",34
140,Mr BUBCHELL,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"The Navigation Act cannot be brought into operation in regard to that portion of Australia unless six months' notice is given. That is the position.  rected on the point, but if is rather a slender thread \>f encouragement. I hope the Government will not regard my remarks as merely hot air. The town clerk of Albany writes to me as follows:I have been instructed by my Council to bring under your notice the unsatisfactory steam-ship service which Albany is receiving - from the Inter-State shipping companies. A boat is supposed to call at Albany once every month, inwards and outwards; but, as a matter of fact, most of. the boats anchor in King George's Sound, and passengers have to board and be put off by means of tender. Why should such an old settled and dustrious people be subjected to such cavaa lier treatment when there is a beautiful wharf at Albany at which passengers reply :could be landed.This state of affairs is most unsatisfactory toms, and inconvenient to passengers, and emquest which phasizes once more the disability which Albany of the that is suffering through the regulations under the on their Navigation Act. The member for Albany (Mr A . Thomnot son) in the Western Australian Legislawhich tive Assembly has also written tome as follows: I consider that, unless the Inter-Colonial steam-ship companies are prepared to give the port of Albany and this district better tion than they are doing at the present ,the Customs Department should give overstrict seas boats the opportunity of carrying sengers and cargoes to and from that As a case in point, we are having a special stud sale, which is held every year, and we. consider of sufficient importance justifying South Australian breeders to specially send over stud ewes and rams for that sale. Collins, a sheep breeder of South Australia, sent on the Katoomba 140 breeding ewes and rams for this stud stock sale. The Katoomba called in at Albany to drop passengers, would not unload the stock, and the owner of Taxation Commission. tliese had the mortification of seeing his valuable stock carried past to Fremantle, and meant that they were three more days and while Rome was burning. nights travelling by sea and by the train. this is the way that the Commonwealth pose to open up and develop this State of Australia, then it is time that they considered the effect that the Navigation Act would upon the development bf this State. That statement seemed to me so preposwho terous that I telegraphed to the member for Katanning, asking if the carrying of these stud stock was not due to some quarantine legislation of Western Ausment tralia ; but I have not received a reply from him. The letter continuesI urge you to use your influence to see that this port of Albany has better treatment than it has obtained from the steam-ship companies. I am sure that I could get a petition signed by hundreds of people in this district protestof ing against the effect of the Navigation if the inter-colonial boats will not give better facilities than they have done up to the present. Mr Cockram, of "" Fan-field,"" who has ported from the eastern States valuable cattle, horses, and sheep, has been in the same fortunate position of having to travel his stock to Fremantle and to turn back again to Broom Hill. This is centralization with a vengeance. It occurred to me that matters might improved if the new Bay steamers of [475]- 2 in - Commonwealth Line would make Albany port of call, and I wrote to the Government on the subject, getting the following With reference to' the copy of letter addressed to the Minister for Trade and Cusyou forwarded to me, with a rearrangements be made for vessels Commonwealth Line to call at Albany voyages to and from the United Kingdom, I regret to inform you that it will be possible for the new Bay steamers, will shortly inaugurate a regular monthly servicebetween the United Kingdom and Australia, to call at this port, as these vessels will be running to a strict time-table. To me that is not a satisfactory answer. attenThe White Star steamers called regularly time, at Albany, and they were running to a time-table. There is a fair amount pasof trade to be done at that port, and the port.

I do not speak now as an apologist for the Government; but I refer to this matter because what was said was to some extent a reflection on a Committee on which, in company with the be. honourable member for Newcastle (Mr . the Watkins) I acted for about nine months. That Committee spent many days in the taking of the evidence of' experts in ithe coal trade, concerning both the operation of the mines and the shipping of' coal. There has never been a total prohibition of exportation. While serving on the Committee, I was as active as any one in trying to provide that the export trade in coal should be considered, as far as that could be done, consistently with the supplying qf Australia's demand for coal. A restriction on exportation was imposed originally at the instance of the Committee, and the restrictions developed as the Committee's inquiry proceeded. Honourable members will recollect that at the, time every part of Australia was demanding that the Commonwealth Government should do something to increase the supply of coal for local consumption. Some of the State railways had not sufficient coal for more than three weeks' working, and all of them, except the New South Wales system, were exceedingly short, and in mortal dread of trouble.",36

143,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I was going to add that industries, particularly in Victoria-becaus e the shortage of coal was felt industrially more heavily in this State than in any other-were being crippled, and that ordinary domestic consumers of electric light, gas, and coal fuel were having to submit to irritating and hurtful restrictions. This condition 'of things obtained everywhere except in New South Wales, and it . was the business of the Committee to make recommendations for the improvement of the situation. So far as my knowledge goes, the Government did what was asked of it , and no more. I admit that the exportation of coal from a part of the Newcastle coalfield was absolutely prohibited. That was because the coal from that area was needed for the railways. A good deal is to be said for the forbearance of the owners, while the export trade was being limited, because orders were crowding in on them from abroad at prices double what they were getting in Australia, and the New Zealand price was not much higher than the Australian price.",37

151,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"That is so. If we go back a few years, we can find another reason for its loss. At that time, the export business was a gigantic one. We should do everything we can to foster our export trade in coal, because our coal resources are far beyond the requirements of Australia. I endorse what has been said by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) about the desire of honourable members for commercial balance-sheets showing the result of the Government's commercial activities.

162,Mr MATHEWS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Melbourne Ports) [5.25] - Before bringing under the notice of the Minister of Trade and Customs (Mr Massy Greene) a matter of importance relating to his Department, I wish to support the claim made by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) in regard to the case or a returned soldier in Western Australia, whose pension has been stopped. Even if the disease from which that man is now suffering was latent at the time of his enlistment, I think it the duty of the Government to care for him , and, indeed, for all whose incapacity has arisen from similar circumstances. Even if the man had gone so far when volunteering as to induce some one else to submit to medical examination on his behalf, I would say that the Government having accepted him as fit for active service, must take the responsiLike the bility for his maintenance, just as it should be responsible for the maintenance of every man in the community who is unable to work. I have had brought before me by three good old different Labour organizations a somewhat peculiar action on the part of the Department of Trade and Customs. Under the Customs Act the Minister, very properly, is allowed by regulation to remove a Customs duty relating to any commodity the free admission of which is essential to an industry. In other words, if a new industry is to be established here, and the machinery required by it is not, and cannot be, manufactured in Australia, the Department would be quite justified in allowing that machinery to come in duty free. Where a commodity is not, and cannot be, manufactured here, the imposition of a duty is not sound Protection, but mere revenue Tariffism. I agree, therefore, that it is essential in the interests of industry that such a regulation should exist under the Customs Act: It was never intended, however, that it should be' used to give preference to one manufacturer as against another. While I have at times to take up a stand in the interests of large manufacturers who employ a great of labour, it is not that I have any keen desire to look after the interests of such people, but because I am convinced unless their business enterprise can be on financial lines it will be impossible them to employ the people who send here. I have been told more than once that I have been looking after the inwhere terests of big manufacturing firms, but this explanation on my part should be a sufficient answer to all such statements. labour. When I am told by the men working in a large manufactory that something been done by the Department of Trade and Customs which is inimical to their interests, I must consider it. We have been endeavouring for some time to build up the confectionery industry in Australia. We began in the face of a good deal of opposition-. I can well' remember the taunts that were hurled at us when we commenced, some years ago, to enchinery deavour to encourage the manufacture sweets in Australia. I am glad to say that our efforts have proved successful, and that confectionery of first-class quality being made here today. We firms which claim that their are not only as good as the imported article, but superior to it. They have established a record business, which claim will hold its own with that in any other part of the world, as have not to compete with the cheap labour of other countries. It matters little me whether the cheap labour which unfairly handicaps a local manufacturer is that of Great Britain or Japan. the local manufacturers to be as protected against the products of the cheap labour of Great Britain as from the output of the cheap labour of Japan. The manufacturers of chocolates in Australia started in a small way, in many cases have built up large estabpartment lishments. Their trade has increased to such an extent that manufacturers overseas, no doubt as the result of the Tariff, have been induced to set up operashow tions here. Nestles have spent a good Australia deal of money in establishing their dustry in Australia, and other overseas firms have also commenced the manufacmoreover, ture of chocolates and sweets here. Quite latterly, as the result of the duties we have imposed, an amalgamation firms of Cadbury, Fry, and Pascall has entered upon the manufacture of confecjust  call is in Australia today. The Mr Mathews. deal came along with a great flourish of trumpets, and brought with them a good deal of British capital. We have opened that our arms to receive that capital, but I run hope we are not prepared to do anything for to the detriment of Australian capital me and Australian workers. This firm has commenced manufacturing in Tasmania, it has been able to secure cheap f land and cheap power, and where, I may say in passing, it hopes also to get cheap The Tasmanian Government, thinking, no doubt, that the establishhas ment of such a factory would be a good thing for Hobart, gave the firm free of cost a branch railway line to its works. This line cost the State Government about £3,500. Then the firm approached the Department of Trade and Customs, saying, "" We want to import for the manufacture of confectionery here mathat is not made in Australia of and cannot be made here. We therefore ask that it be admitted free of d u t y . """,38
163,Mr GKEGOEY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"The honourable memis ber knows that that was being done behave two fore we dealt with the Tariff. chocolates Mr MATHEWS - I have already said that there is a regulation under which, in certain circumstances, dutiable they goods may be admitted free.

164,Mr RICHAB DFOSTEB,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,I never heard to that it has been applied in that spirit.,39
165,Mr MATHEWS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I am laying the charge that, it has been so applied, and it I want is for the Minister for Trade and Customs - well (Mr Greene) to refute it . A secretary of one of the trade unions which are in terested in the matter came to me yesterday with a letter from another secretary, and an appointment was made with a and third, who told me that the Customs Dehad admitted this machinery duty free, and that the effect would be to from deprive Australian men of work. It is for the Minister for Trade and Customs to that this machinery is not made in - but even if it is not being made inhere, those who are using similar machinery already have paid duty on it , and, are paying Australian wages. If manufacturers who, in the face of great difficulty, have established this conof the fectionery industry here, and have paid duty on the machines they use, it is only that duty should be paid by any new entering into the field; if not, it is 1 firm indisputable that the new men are given' an unfair advantage. I must say that when I heard of ithe circumstances I quite' surprised, and I await the departand mental explanation. When these came to me I said that I supposed this machinery could not.be made here; but my informant said, "" What nonsense; the machinery associated with the confecintroduced tionery trade has been made in Australia, and is being made here now, not by firm, but by , m a n y . "" There was newspaper controversy over the matter. For instance, the secretary of the assistants' organization complained i Herald of the undue advantage given the new firm, and expressed a fear that those belonging to his union would suffer in consequence. That, of course, may a selfish view to take, and I suppose shall be told that the existent manufacbeing made here, and made well. turers of confectionery are selfish because they do not like competition. They not complain, however, so long as the comers are not given an undue advantage. In connection with this matter the followand ing appeared in the Herald on ithe 10th instant: "" It is easy to say these things, but hard to prove them,"" s:iid Mr Oakley, Acting Deputy Comptroller of Customs, today, criticising letter written by the secretary of the Shop Australia. Assistants' Union, and published in the on Saturday. In his letter, the secretary that machinery had been admitted free of duty to facilitate the commencement of operaand tions in confectionerymanufacture in tralia by overseas firms. Mr Oakley added that he had no time to consult the files, but Robertson's. the policy of the Department was consistent, and he was sure that the Customs concession was not allowed in respect of any items machinery that could the manufactured tralia, it would be found, if the files were consulted, that Thompson's, of Castlemaine, were consulted on the matter, and that duty had been charged in respect of all such articles as that firm were capable of manufacturing. ""Cadbury's have paid thousands of pounds Sn duty,"" he added. I am told by one of the officials of the engineers' organization that Thompsons, of Castlemaine, deny the statement that they were approached on the question ""Three in any way. Thompsons' firm a chilled roller refiner' for .MACRobertson's in 1920, and they have delivered one since, while a third is being built for the same firm. This., I understand, is a machine of the kind that it is Mould proposed to 'allow in free in the case the new firm.. Along with two other honourable members of the House I was in vited to visit MACRobertson's confectionery establishment in Fitzroy, and there, to my surprise, I found the firm making machinery for its own use on its own prewas mises. The firm has gone to the trouble expense of erecting and equipping a men machine shop, and paying Australian wages, for the construction of the machinery required, and now it is asked to compete with cheap imported machinery by Cadbury, F r y , and Pascall, and, as I suggest, with .the cheaper labour one in Tasmania. If the Government can resome fute the statements I have made, well and good; if not, it must be admitted that shop a mistake has been made somewhere. n the Men employed in engineering establishto ments are just about as conversant with, and as critical of, ithe work carried on in them as are their employers, and I am be assured by such men that the machines I required in the confectionery business are At MACRobertson's I said to one of the recanpresentatives of the firm, "" Would you newmake these machines for other confectionery manufacturers if you were asked?"" ""he replied, "" Of course, I have this machine construction establishment, and I wish to keep it going."" I should now like to show how extensive a the manufacture of these machines is in The MACRobertson firmhas Herald made, and has under construction, masaid chinery to the value of about £40,000, there are other manufacturers in AusAustralia who have turned out similar machinery to the value of £17,000 for MacThe value of the various machines made by outside Victorian engiof neering firms, and used by MACRobertin Ausson's, is shown in the following: Three conche machines, made by W. Anderson & Co., Eichmond, at £1.100 each .. .. .. £3,300 Two chocolate refiners, made by Thompson's, Castlemaine, at £1.000 each .. 2,000 Four chocolate kettles, made by Lugton, Melbourne, at £165 each .. 660 One vacuum milk condenser, made by Lugton, Melbourne 800 barrel beaters, made by Small & Shattell, at f 30 each .. .. 90 made Three cocoa butter presses, made by W.

We ought to give to the iron workers in Australia all the work' we can; and the Customs Department is remiss if it allows commodities to come in duty free when they can be manufactured here. No doubt, Cadbury, Fry, and Pascall, when they came "" spying out the land,"" selected their present site with the idea of producing more cheaply and underselling other firms. That is all right if it be legitimately, done, but, as I have said, I am rather inclined to think that they contemplate cheaper labour in Tasmania, seeing that the Factory Act there is not on the same level as the Factory Acts of the other States. If the Government assist this new firm under the circumstances they are not acting fairly towards either the employers or the workers already established in the same business in Victoria and elsewhere in Australia.",39

With one exception, the confectionery firms at present in Australia have been established with Australian money, and the profits are distributed here; whereas this new company is a foreign company, whose profits will be distributed elsewhere, and this I regard as detrimental to the interests of the Australian working classes. Even at this stage I think the Minister for Trade and Customs ought to see what can be done to rectify the mistake, if a mistake has been made. If Cadbury, Fry, and Pascall are allowed to have these machines admitted duty free, then those firms which in the past have paid duty on the machines they are now using, ought to have that duty refunded. I do not know whether such a course would require a special Act of Parliament, but it would be only just. No section of the community, through any Act of this Parliament or any Department associated with it, should be given an advantage over another section. I may be told that the attitude I am taking is parochial-that my objection is to the establishment of this new factory in Tasmania and not in Victoria. I know that the confectionery manufacturers of Australia have not reached the demand for high-class confectionery here, and that there is room for others; all I say is that if concessions are given to one firm, it will come here with cheaper machinery and cheaper labour, and enter into unfair competition with those who have built up their businesses under great disadvantages in the past. I ask the Minister for Trade' and Customs to make full inquiry into all the circumstances.",41

I am not in possession of the whole of the particulars, but I find that up to the time of which the honourable member was speaking, approximately £90,000 worth of machinery had been used by the firm to whom he referred in the establishment of their works. Of that total, about one-fourth had been made in Australia. I think a little over half of the remainder was admitted in the ordinary way and paid duty, whilst in regard to the remaining one-fourth, the firm made application for the admission of the machinery under item 174 on the ground that it was not manufactured in Australia. It was highly specialized machinery, and I assumed that the Department was satisfied after the full investigation which is always made in respect of applications of this sort, that this particular plant was not made in Australia. It was on that ground alone that admission was granted under item 174.",41
169,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,Do not the officials make inquiries as tb whether the machinery can be made here?,41
170,Mr MASSYGREENE,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Certainly , and very exhaustive inquiries.",41
171,Mr WEST,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,I saw in course of manufacture yesterday a machine similar to that which was exempted from duty.,41
172,Mr MASSYGREENE,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"All I can say is that in view of what has been said I shall have the case further inquired into, but in respect of every application for entry under item 174 the most exhaustive inquiries that are possible to the Department are made before the duty is waived. I expect it will be found that the particular machine of which the honourable member for East Sydney spoke differs in material respects from the machines that have been admitted under item 174, although the two may be used for somewhat similar work.",41
173,Mr MATHEWS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"If the imported machines do, the same work they come in competition with those manufactured locally.",42
174,Mr MASSYGREENE,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"That may or - may not be so; it depends on the circumstances. I cannot say offhand whether or not the two machines do compete with each other. In regard to the operation of item 174, the Department works with the object, firstly, of protecting the revenue to the utmost possible extent, and, secondly of encouraging as far as poss sible manufacture in Australia, whilst at the same time safeguarding the makers of those articles for which free admission is sought. There are quite a number of considerations to influence our judgment in these matters.",42
175,Mr BAMFORD,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,Can the Minister say where MACRobertson obtains the machinery which is installed in his factory at Fitzroy ? ',42
176,Mr MASSYGREENE,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I cannot say whether that machinery was imported or made by MACRobertson, but when we are satisfied that a machine can be made in this country we never allow any remission of duty. If , on the contrary, we are satisfied the machinery cannot be made locally, and a definite request is made to us for its admission free of duty, we make full inquiry, and then put item 174 in operation as Parliament intended and empowered us to do. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) represented that in some circumstances the operation of item 174 might appear to give a preference to one person over another. To some extent that is inevitable in the operation of the Tariff. manufacturer might have established his works in 1914 when there was no duty on the^ machinery he imported. Today another manufacturer, establishing the same class of factory, and importing the same machinery, may have to pay a heavy duty. Either by the imposition of duties or removal' of them. it must frequently happen in the course of years that one party has to pay duty whilst a competitor has not. v",42
177,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,Where the Customs officials have to decide upon an application they should certainly take into account the fact that the applicant's competitors have paid the duty.,42
178,Mr MASSYGREENE,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"That depends. If it is shown definitely that this particular class of machinery is not made in Australia, and the Minister decides that under those circumstances it should be admitted free of duty, I do not think he should take into consideration the fact that in days gone by some other person may have paid duty. If he were to enter into considerations of that kind the duty could never be lifted from a particular article. The operation of item 174 is very complex, and I have asked Parliament to relieve me from the responsibility of its administration by the creation of an Advisory Board; but we have tried to do what is right, and T am satisfied that it will be found on a full investigation of the whole of the circumstances, that in this instance the Department has not erred.  I was speaking this afternoon, I referred . to the disability suffered by Albany owing to the operation of the Navigation Act. I read correspondence to show that, whilst the Katoomba landed passengers at A l bany, stud stock that was being imported for the adjacent district was not landed, but was carried on to Frethat mantle, and thence railed over 200 miles to its destination. I further said that this action was too preposterous to be allowed by any Government to continue ; so I wired to the honourable member for Katanning in the State Parliament, who had reported the circumstances to me, and asked him if it was not through some State quarantine legislation that the stock were not allowed to land before examination. I have received this reply- ' One Understand Katoomba only accepts passengers for Albany. Quarantine nothing to do with position. Writing. That means that the shipping firm will only undertake to land passengers by tender, and will not go alongside the jetty to land stock, but prefers to carry them on to Fremantle, and delay their arrival at tlieir destination by three or four days. That is the way our rural industries are developed. I bring .this matter under the uotice of the Government in the hope that if they are giving any preference to local shipping firms under the Navigation Act they will see that those firms provide the facilities which are necessary for the development of Australia.",42
179,Mr WEST,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"East Sydney) [6.0] - The Victoriau confectionery manufacturer to whom the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) referred was unable during the war to obtain machinery models from abroad, and started his own workshop at considerable expense. He made his own models, and purchased lathes and other machinery ab high prices in order to supply Australia's requirements of confectionery. It has been stated that the other firm which is now importing machinery made inquiries in Australia, and discovered that the class of machinery required was not manufactured in the"" Commonwealth. Machinery makers, who were able to make these machines have denied that any such inquiry was made of them. It might not be thought that confectionery business requires a large engineering establishment, and honourable members may be surprised to learn that the pattern makers, turners, fitters, and others employed in the production of machinery by the Pitzroy firm number fifty-two. It is a serious thing for the Department to give one firm advantages over its competitors. MACRobertson is not the only confectioner who is affected by the concession that has been given to Cadbury. It seems that an error has occurred through mismanagement. If a person required a, sewing machine he should not be entitled to import one under item 174 simply because the machine made in Australia was not the brand which he preferred. It is the height of stupidity to say that there is anything so complicated that it cannot be made'in Australia. Such a statement is an insult to the industrial and professional sections of the community. course, departmental officers, like all other human beings, are likely to err, but I hope that in the future nothing of the kind will happen and that thorough inquiry will be made by officials as to whether the machinery required can be made in Australia before they permit it to be imported free of duty. I desire to refer to a matter in regard to which I have been able to obtain no satisfaction. About eighteen months ago a man was appointed to the postal service as a temporary employee, and after serving, apparently to the satisfaction of the Department, he was . dismissed without rhyme or reason. It was discovered that he was the father of six children and that under the basic wage award he was entitled to an increased payment on that account. The Government sacked him on the day following that discovery, and a returned soldier was appointed to the vacancy. I know, a good deal of the spirit that animates returned soldiers, ""and I do not - believe that any of them desire to put out of work a man who has six children to support. I hope that the Postmaster-General will see that no other cases of a similar character occur in his Department. I understand that any person who wishes to export metalliferous ores or concentrates must do so through the Metal Producers Association, and make a sworn declaration as to the consignees overseas.. This information is supposed to be secret, but, nevertheless, the purchasers abroad frequently .find that certain people in London are full y informed of the fact that they have bought this material, and they are told that if they attempt to make any furthe r purchases from Australia they will be prevented from doing so. I want to know how this information, which is supposed to be kept a close secret here, can get abroad in this way, where it can be made use of to the disadvantage of purchasers of pur ores? The Broken Hill Proprietary are the principal members of the association here, in fact, they practically control it . Evidently their monopoly of the metal products of Australia is not sufficient to satisfy their gluttonous wants, and they are seeking to extend their control to the other side of the world. At any rate, if the Government compel these sworn declarations to Of be made, they ought at least to see that the information supplied is kept a close secret. I shall not occupy any time n o w in commenting upon the stupid blundering of the Treasurer (S ir Joseph Cook) in his conduct of the issue of the recent Diggers' loan. The cost of the flotation was tremendous. However, I shall deal with that matter upon the Budget.",43
180,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Illawarra) [6.10] - I want to emphasize some remarks I made on the adjournment of the House the other day in reference to the cases of soldiers who have been refused the maintenance given to soldiers in military hospitals, because military medical men have sent them to military wards in civilian hospitals. Eor a long time. I have tried to get a hearing for these men's claims, but the responsible Ministers tell me that the matter has been made one for Cabinet decision, and that the decision is adverse to the men. I fail utterly to understand how Cabinet could have arrived at such a decision. No. 4 Military Hospital at Randwick having become filled, provision had to be made elsewhere for patients. Accordingly an arrangement was made with the Prince Alfred Hospital, a public institution' in Sydney, so that a ward could be set aside for military patients. The men selected to be sent to that hospital were the very worse cases at Randwick at the time. They were the men who had come back from the war unfitted to fight the battle of life. It was quite natural that these men who had suffered most by their devotion to the cause of their country should expect to bs treated in exactly the same way as they would have been treated had they remained at Randwick, but they found themselves deprived of privileges enjoyed by patients in military hospitals who went later to the war, and came back with less injuries. I cannot understand how patriotic men, looking at a case of this kind, could take up the attitude Cabinet has taken in regard to it . These men have every claim to the treatment meted out to those in military hospitals. There is nothing to differentiatebetween them and the patients in the Randwick Military Hospital, except the fact that they were sent to a military ward in a hospital a few thousand yards away. It is pathetic to have these men approaching one in the condition of these sufferers. They are deprived of the opportunity of earning the livelihood they had before they enlisted. They have suffered the highest degree of penalty in the service of their country. Their claims upon us are greater than are many we have recognised since the war, and I appeal again to Cabinet to reconsider their position, and at least do justice to those who, by direction of the military doctors, have been compelled to leave military hospitals and go to military wards in civilian hospitals.",44
181,Mr LAZZARINI,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Werriwa) [6.15] I am sorry I cannot agree with the statement of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Foley) that the Government are out to do justice to returned soldiers. My experience has been that very often the Government have done everything but , justice to many soldiers whose cases have come under my notice. I could give many specific instances which have led me to come to that conclusion, but today I shall refer only to one with which I have been dealing for the last twelve months. It is the case of Private MCDougall, of Hilltop, near Mittagong. I am not sure whether he was married before or after his period of service, but he has now a wife and a baby twelve months old. Immediately he came back from France he was granted a pension, and it was paid to him for a while. However, he was taken ill, in fact, his life was despaired of, and just at that time, when the wife was agitated and disturbed about whether the life of the husband would be saved, an edict went forth from the Repatriation Department to the effect that the pension had been cancelled. The Department knew the circumstances of the case, and surely common humanity would have dictated a better time for letting the axe fall. The man eventually recovered a little, but he is today a helpless invalid. The only means of sustenance he and his family have are the possible earnings of the wife, who has also to nurse a sick husband back to health and look after her baby. If this is the way in which the Government propose to treat returned soldiers, they are not only false to the promises they made to the men prior to enlistment, but are also failing to act according to the dictates of common humanity. I went to the Department in connection with this case. I wrote numerous letters. I was told that Private MCDougall had received every consideration. I then wrote to the Minister, and finally I was told that it was of no use my proceeding any further in the matter, because the medical testimony was that the man had not contracted his illness from war-like operations, but had the germs of the complaint from which he is suffering in his.system prior to enlistment. ascribe the action of the Department to the attempt on the part of some one to cheese-pare. Some one is endeavouring to economize in repatriation expenditure so that the money thus saved may be spent in another direction. While the Government is cheese-paring and depriving men of their rights, it poses to spend immense sums ou armaments ancl military preparations. It proposes to spend nearly £1,000,000 more on the preparation for the killing and maiming of men, and yet allows other men who fought in defence of their country to remain helpless in sickness, and happy genius. will not put forth a hand to help them. I have brought before the Department the case of a hopeless invalid whose wife has to nurse him while trying to earn a living for him and for their child. man received a pension for a time, when he could do a little work, but it was stopped when he was stricken with illness and almost at death's door. His is a case which carries absolute condemnation of the Government's treatment of returned soldiers. Obviously the direction has gone to the Repatriation Department to cut down useless expenditure wherever it can.",44
182,Mr MAHONY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Dalley) [6.22] - The first matter about which I shall speak is the need for doing something for Mr. Henry Lawson, the greatest writer whom Australia has yet produced. I think that we might well stretch a point to help this man now that he is sick and in trouble. I need not speak of Henry Lawson's work. His writings are familiar in every household throughout Australia, and well known to the world at large, but he himself lies in poverty and sickness in a public hospital near Sydney. Mr Lawson draws £1 a week from the Australian Men of Letters Eund, but the Minister in charge of that fund, in answer to a question asked today by the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), said that the allowance could not be increased because the fund was practically all allotted. I do not question the truth of the reply, but in view of the services that Henry Lawson has rendered to Australia in literature and art, the least we can do is to provide him with the necessaries of life now that he is practically down and I out. I think that the Commonwealth should see that he is given an income sumcient to maintain him in decency.",45

189,Mr MAHONY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I shall now refer to a matter - that calls for a rather full explanation from the Minister in charge of shipbuilding, and that is the action of his Department in either hiring or leasing the ferry boat Biloela to a firm iknown as the Island Transport Company. 'There surrounds this transaction something which needs clearing up. It will be remembered that the management of Cockatoo Island has been materially altered. The Government have placed the Island under a Board of Control, which, has seen fit to alter many of the conditions existing before it took charge. Acting under instructions from the Minister, the Board on taking over its duties ceased to convey the workmen from the mainland to the Island free of charge, and informed them that they would have to make their own arrangements. The only course open to them was to make some scratch arrangements with motor launch proprietors, and the re- suit was that llfhe launches were dangerously overcrowded.  ber saw the men seated on the roof of the forecabin while there was practically no one in the body of the boat.",45

The fact that the water police have taken steps to prevent that sort of thing proves the accuracy of my statement.  ferry boat to run between the mainland and the Island, but the men would have nothing to do with it.",46
191,Mr MAHONY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I was just coming to that point. The representatives of the men waited on the Board of Control and said that, as they were no longer to be carried to and from their work free of charge, they were prepared to lease or hire the ferry boat Biloela at whatever the Board might consider to be a fair charge, and that failing, that if the Board would undertake to run the boat they would pay whatever fare it considered to be reasonable. That was a very fair offer, but the Board under instructions from the Minister contemptuously rejected it. The chairman of the Board of Control, in a contemptuous manner, laughed at the men when they made the offer, and said, "" You cannot lease the boat."" The agitation still went on. I continued to draw public attention to the way in which the motor launches running between the mainland and the Tsland were being dangerously overcrowded and then secretly-behin d the backs of the workmen at Cockatoo, and behind the backs of the people of Australia-a n arrangement was entered into with a private firm to charter the Biloela to convey the men to and from (heir work. The workmen said, "" This 'is not fair to us. Who are the people to whom this boat has been leased?"" They discovered that the arrangement had been made with Mr J. W. Scott Fell, one of the staunch political friends and supporters of the Nationalist Government. In a secret way-behin d closed doors-a n arrangement was entered into with the Island Transport Company to charter this huge ferry boat, which is quite as large as the ferry boats which ply between Circular Quay and the north side of Sydney Harbor, for a payment of £15 per week. The men, however, refused to travel by the boat. I want to know first of all why this arrangement was secretly made, and, secondly, why when the Island Transport Company found that the running of the boat was not a paying proposition the Government relieved them of their liabilities under the lease. The Minister must give some reply to these inquiries. If it a were desired to lease the boat, why were not public tenders invited? Why was it not open to any one to tender? Why was this arrangement made behind the backs of the workmen? After all, the. Island Transport Company is only a "" cuckoo"" concern formed for the particular purpose of running this ferry boat. On proceeding to the Registrar-General's Office to discover who were the shareholders in the company, I found that its registered office was given as ""16 Loftus-street,' Sydney."" I discovered, further, that the company was registered with a capital of 1,000 shares of £ 1 each. That at least '-is the statement set out in the prospectus. A list of shareholders has not been filed in the Registrar-General's office. I found that there had been filed there the names of only seven shareholders, the minimum requirement under the Companies Act. The list is as follows:-P . J. Everett, clerk, Union Bank Chambers, Sydney, one share; J. W. Scott Fell, one share; L. C. Saunders, one share; T. A. Ferguson, one share; G. Orr,.one share; J. Simpson, one share; G. W. Waddell, one share; and A. Iiundie, one share. With the exception of Mr Scott Fell, all these individuals are in the same office. This is a mushroom company, which was created suddenly for the purpose of taking over the running of the ferry boat Biloela. When it was found to be a nonpaying proposition the Government came to the relief of their political friend-on e of the men who engineers political moves for the Ministry-and freed him of his liability. The ferry boat today is tied up at the Island.  member tell me how long the company had a lease of the boat?",46
192,Mr MAHONY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"The point is that the Minister made arrangements with the company to lease the boat for £ 1 5 per week, and that when at the end of the very first week it was found that the running of it was a non-paying proposition, he immediately relieved the company of its liability. The fact that the company had the boat for such a short time makes the position, so far. as the Government is concerned, still worse. It goes to show that collusion existed between the M in ister at the head of the Department and the Island Transport Company, which is really Mr Scott Fell, of Sydney. Minister ref used to give the men an opportunity to tender for the leasing of the boat. He refused to allow them or any one else, with the exception of Mr Scott Fell, to lease the Biloela. Will he now give the men or any private firm an opportunity to obtain the boat on the same terms? It is for the Minister to explain this matter. Will he also explain why representatives of the . citizens of North Sydney, who waited upon the Board Control, and asked that the boat be leased to them, so that they might compete with the monopolistic Sydney Ferries Comter who is responsible? pany, were refused an opportunity to lease it? The Parliament should demand an explanation of the whole matter. While dealing with Cockatoo Island, I desire briefly to refer to another incident relating to it . A young man named Sheiles, who takes a prominent part in trade union matters, and was secretary of the Vigilance Committee at Cockatoo Island a short time ago, obtained the Labour endorsement of his candidature for the Federal constituency of Illawarra at the next Federal elections. Almost immediately following the public announcement of that fact he was barred from obtaining work at Cockatoo Island. The door was slammed on him. This is a clear case of victimization. First of all, because he is a prominent unionist; and secondly, because he is tooppose one of the Nationalist members at the next general elections, he is debarred from obtaining employment at Cockatoo Island. He is ric1 timized and prevented from obtaining his livelihood in Sydney. I hope the Minister will also look into that matter. I wish now to address myself to the Minister representing the Minister for honourable Repatriation (Mr Rodgers). I have here three or four cases of almost vital importance. I shall not mention the names of the individuals concerned, because I do not think it right to make public the private affairs of individuals. I shall hand the Minister the papers in reference to all these cases. The first is that of a man to whom I shall allude as Mr A , who enlisted and did three and a half years' service abroad. He and a number of other men, however, committed some military offence, for which they were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. The complaint I have to make is that when Mr . A applied for his war gratuity he was told that under section 6 of the Act he could not obtain it , inasmuch as he had The been sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding twelve months, whereas other men, who committed the same offence, and some of whom were sentenced to a longer term of imprisonment than that which Mr A was required to undergo, obtained their gratuity bonds.

The coal position is a very serious one for Newcastle, and, indirectly, for the whole of Australia. Unfortunately, here, as everywhere else, when such a question is raised a great deal of class feeling is shown. Wo had the honourable member for Newcastle claiming that the f a u l t is all on the side of the Government, and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) claiming that the f a u lt is all on the side of the men. That seems £o be the chief trouble in our coal business. There can be no question that on many occasions the miners themselves have been to blame for stoppages of work; but on this occasion-and I happen to know something of the matter-the chief f a u l t lies in Government interference. When the Government imposed the restriction on the Maitland coal they went a long way to stopping the development cf the coal propositions in the north, where there are scores of possible propositions awaiting to be worked. The coal wealth of Newcastle and the northern districts is practically unlimited. There are many places where some of the old seams are still awaiting opening up, while new seams are calling every day for capital investment: but when the Government imposed this restriction they immediately put a dampar on all attempts at further development. And the Government were not satisfied with this; finding they had disturbs! the position, they went f u r t h er and put a restriction on Bore Hole coal, which resulted in confusion worse confounied.

218,Mr FLEMING,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"The restrictions can only have been removed withi n the last few weeks, so recently, and after so much damage has been done, that it will take a long time for matters to right - themselves. We used to be afraid of the restrictions that were threatened by the Labour party. Many a time. I have stood on the public platform and warned the people that if the Labour party attained to power they would impose restrictions that would interfere with primary production. But no restrictions the Labour party have ever placed upon primary production have been worse than the way in which the present Government have treated the coal in dustry in New South Wales, and I hope that as the Treasurer has removed the restrictions on coal, the Government' will extend that policy by removing ithe restrictions from all articles of production, and giving the producers fair play.",49
219,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,The producers of wheat ?,49
220,Mr FLEMING,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,If the producers of wheat desire a voluntary Pool that is another matter; but I am opposed to the Government themselves imposing restrictions upon primary production.,49
221,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,What about Bawra?,49
222,Mr FLEMING,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I opposed Bawra, and the only reason why it has achieved any success is that the restriction imposed upon the price is so low that it is practically no reserve at all . To-day it is only merino wool which is selling, because the Bawra restriction is a long way below the market price; but crossbreds and the coarser wools are still suffering. Certainly the position is improving, because the world is beginning to recover; but the Bawra restrictions have failed to r u in the industry only because owing to the fight we put up in this House the prices were fixed so low as to be practically no reserve at all. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) may take a different view, but I have been connected with the wool industry all my life, and I know a great many leading men in the production and disposal of wool. Whilst some people may hold the opinion that these restrictions have helped them, those engaged in production have infallible proof that'they are doing more harm than good. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has told us that the export trade in coal has been lost because other countries are producing more cheaply. I would like the righ t honourable gentleman to tell us where production is cheaper than in Australia. """,49
223,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"In America, where coal is l is . per ton at the pit's mouth.",50
224,Mr FLEMING,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I think that the cost at the pit's mouth in America is less than l is . ; but in nearly every instance the coal supplies are a long way from the seaboard, and the cost of transport to the seaboard brings the export price up to more than the Australian price.",50
225,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,The honourable member is quite wrong.,50
226,Mr FLEMING,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"My remarks are based on information I gained as the result of inquiries I made when passing through America, where coal and iron have to be railed considerable distances before they can be made available for export.",50
227,Mr BAYLEY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,The railways in America are able to get back freights from the coast.,50
228,Mr FLEMING,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Yes ; that is because the railways are better managed in America than in Australia. The fact is, however, that despite the Government's interference, Australia can put coal on the boat for export as cheaply 'as can any country in the world quality for quality, and if the Government will leave the in dustry alone we can defy competition. The only reason why I speak on this subject today is that I wish to remove the idea that there are only two points of view in regard to coal, and those two points of view must depend on the class to which the speaker belongs. The coal question is a wide and broad one, and our minds should no more represent the men than the owners. The two interests are, in their broad issue, one. The influences that tend to the increased production of coal make for the benefit of both - owners and miners. L deprecate the cross firing which took place this afternoon, one member speaking only for the men- a position into which he was driven-and another member speaking only on behalf of the owners, thus antagonizing the two interests, which, if they work together, will make Australia one of the greatest coal producing countries in the world. But while the Government interfere and antagonisms between miners and owners are fostered in this House and throughout the country, we shall have little chance of exploiting the enormous wealth of coal which, is awaiting development. In this Chamber I have often mentioned various complaints concerning returned soldiers, and when I have spoken on general principles I have been told that there are so many individuals to deal with that there must be individual complaints, and that merely general complaints lead nowhere. I shall to-night deal with individual complaints by quoting two letters that are fair samples of those I receive every mail. These cases are not isolated; there are scores, hundreds, and almost thousands of them. The first letter relates to an application for a War Service Home, and is as follows : Dear Sir,- I would like to know if you could give a little assistance in the inatter of my application for a War Service home. I - will just state my case, and if you think it a genuine grievance I would esteem it a favour if you could give me a help along with my application. Last October, I sent in an application for a War Service home. I filled in my application under the mortgage system. Under that system one has to guarantee 10 per cent, of the' £800 made available under the Act - I explained in my application that I would give to the War Service Homes Commissioner my £50 15s. gratuity bond and a £50 war bond as my 10 per cent, deposit. I also sent in a memorandum of transfer, plan, t and a certificate granted, by the Scone Shire of the block of land I have bought. I was in Sydney a month after I sent in my application, and called at the War Service Homes Oflice. I was taken to a gentleman there, and we both went over the application. He told me that my gratuity bond and the price of the land, which is £50, would stand for my deposit, and that my f 50 war bond was quired. He also informed me that my applicadisabilities, tion was marked urgent, and that I was to go back home and everything would be along rate of pension. in due course. Later on, a gentleman along to see my block of land, for which had to pay £ 1 Is. I did not hear any more a long time, and I wrote the Department again, but was told that my application tralia. would not come forward again until after 27th yond our ability to determine. July. My father was in Sydney, so I told to call and see what they were doing in matter. They informed him that I was first successful. on the list after 27th July. About two months ago, the Department sent me along the randum of mortgage forms to get signed, I was to send on my gratuity did. I also paid another bill for £4 63. Altogether, the War Service Homes Commissioner has received from me £5 7s., plus my bond for take action. £51 15s., and up till the present I have received nothing. I have paid rates amounting to 3s. Od. to the Scone Shire. At present, am living in Aberdeen, paying 10s. a for a house, and as I am working with my father on Blairmore Limited it is not handy to my work. By the month of Decembefore they went to the front. ber 1 will have paid in rent £26, and nearer to getting my application dealt with. That letter is typical. I receive similar letters in dozens, and sometimes scores. cumstances. The second letter refers to a war pension, and it reads:Dear Sir - I have been instructed to write experiencing. you concerning the case of a returned soldier, Ii. E. Gleeson. Considerable correspondence through the Eeturned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia has taken place. He has been examined again, and the net sult-hi s pension raised 6d., and his wife's reduced the same amount. Local people who know this man well, and the local Eeturned Soldiers' League, are of opinion that this should be in receipt of half-pension rates. conversation with the local Government doctor, he informed me that the trouble with this is a form of sciatica and rheumatism caused through the action of malaria on the sciatic feel ashamed of his country. nerve. He is a bushman by trade, sleeper cutter, anything in the timber line, and a genuine worker when able, as his fellow workers have told me. He is able to work intervals at present, but a little while' done nothing but lie on his back three months out of six, and I understand he is classed as entitled to one-tenth pension. I guess man who was entitled to a full pension in pensions comparison would be dead about three times over. This man has bought a piece of land manner. at Warnervale, about 3 miles further on. Tradespeople and other local people held couple of socials - to raise funds to keep payments going. He has had no assistance from the Eepatriation Department. He has wife and child. That letter is also typical of cases which so excite the sympathy of the local people that they go to the trouble of raising funds by concerts and other means.

230,Mr FLEMING,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"We should not. I The whole process should be automatic. week These men should be receiving at least very something of what they were promised What am no hurts me most is that not only are the men suffering, but their unfortunate wives and children are in distressing cirI n the different cities of the Commonwealth women have come to me with tears running down their faces to tell me of the trouble they have been Some of them are women who have been.'well reared and desire to rear their children well and give.them a proper start in life, in recognition of the recircumstances in which they were born and the traditions of their fathers. Some of these women, with their children, are man living on money that was left them by In deceased soldier relatives and parents. man Others are almost starving, and their circumstances are such, as to make a man I have put before the Treasurer a suggestion which has found favour with the Soldiers' at Leagues throughout the Commonwealth, back that something should be done to help women who are unable to earn a living. the Nobody wants the total spent in te be increased, but we desire it to be allocated in a proper There are some people drawing a a pension who, though they have a right his to it , have no need for it . The pensions voted by Parliament are sumcient, but a the allocation of them is all wrong. The only way to meet the situation-and this suggestion has the approval of soldiers generally-is that the widow should be given a pension, in much the same way Yet as disabled soldiers are, according to their disability to earn a living. not matter whether the woman be the widow of an officer or a private, if her upbringing has been such that she is unable to earn a living, or if she is prevented by the care of small children from doing so, that fact should be considered a disability. Many of these women are working themselves to death in trying to earn a living for themselves and their children. They are going through commercial schools in an endeavour to equip themselves to fight the battle of life, in many cases having to neglect their children to do so. In other cases they have widowed mothers, sick brothers and sisters to care for. All these things come.under our notice every day. The only way in which the Government can adequately meet the situation is by recognising inability to earn a living. I admit that it is difficult to d r a f t a perfect scheme, but surely ib is easy enough to formulate one which would be an improvement upon the present system.",51
231,Mr MAXWELL,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,B y giving larger discretionary powers?,52
232,Mr FLEMING,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"The discretionary powers of the Deputy Commissioners are already fair l y adequate, but the trouble is that there is a screw loose somewhere, and an overseeing eye is required to see that matters are put right. It is a difficult task, no doubt, to exercise proper care over a, matter which has so many ramifications, but we are sent to this Pairlijamieut to 'do big work. If there is a job to be done, there ought to be some one to do it . This trouble can be overcome; but, unless Ministers and honourable members generally rise to the occasion and remove this disability from these women and children, and meet their crying wants, Australia will be everlastingly disgraced through failing to honour the obligations cast upon her by the war.",52
233,Mr MARR,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Parkes) [8.48] - This afternoon the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) was absolutely correct when he said that when appeals were lodged by returned soldiers against the. decisions o r medical men, it was simply a question of appealing from Csesar to . Cajsar. I have had many cases in proof of his contention 'broughtj under my notice, and one I propose to place before honourable members. A tram driver returned from the war suffering from It does neurasthenia. On his discharge he returned to his pre-war occupation; but the officials of the Tramways Department in Sydney, considering that it was not in the best interests of the safety of the public that a man suffering from his ailment should act as the driver of a. tram, found him a minor position of cleaner. However, later on his - health broke down, and he was sent to a nerve hospital at Five Dock.' I have had this man's case ' before the Department for a long while, without getting any satisfaction, and I propose to read portions of one communication I received from it .",52
234,Sir GBANVILL ERYBIE,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"The question is whether he was discharged as fit. If a man is discharged as fit, it is very hard to say that any subsequent sickness is due to war disabilities. There are many such cases.",52
235,Mr MARR,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Dr Noble, in charge of the nerve hospital, a recognised nerve specialist, says that he considers that the hysteria fro m which this man is suffering resulted from war service. The Department says that the papers show that he was only underconditions of stress for four days. To be under conditions of stress for four hours was very severe in some parts of the war front, and if this man stayed under them for four days in some sections, it is nob to be wondered at that he came out a nervous wreck. Dr Noble reported later that his general condition was brighter, and the Department contended that, as he was only suffering a 10 per cent, disability, he was not entitled to a pension. This man, by the way, has a wife and five children. The people of Australia have a. right to see that a man who cannot follow his pre-war occupation, on account of his war service, does not suffer thereby - Once the departmental doctors say that a man is not suffering from war service they will not stultify their previous decision by altering it , no matter how much one may appeal. The two medical officers who examined this man said,'"" We are of opinion that his neurotic condition is a pre-existing one and not the result of his service."" But they had nothing on which to base that decision. Possibly they had had no previous experience in nervous complaints. At any rate, their view was diametricallv opposed to that of Dr Noble,, whose opinion I prefer to accept. There ought to be an Appeal Board appointed to which these men can appeal to get better justice than that which is now accorded to them. I ask the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) to look through the papers in regard to this mail's case. The War Service Homes Department has come in for very serious comment, and even ridicule in some respects, from the public, and particularly from soldiers. If it cannot build a home for a man the officers ought to tell him so. I have had a case brought under my notice in Sydney, in which considerable in j u r y was done to a'young soldier through the Department's neglect to let him know that it was impossible for them to build him a home. In June, 1920, he applied to the Sydney office for a home. He was told that they could not build him one because they had already 13,000 applications to deal with, but they advised him to buy a block of land and get a contractor, and they would make arrangements with the latter to build him a home and finance the transaction.",52
236,Mr RODGERS,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,The v had no cation for making that statement.,53
237,Mr MARR,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"At any rate, this young fellow picked a block of land. He paid no money on it , but he went to the Department and told them of it . Subsequently an inspector viewed the block, and reported to the Department that the site was a good one, and that the price was reasonable. The applicant went to the Department again, and was informed that the site had been approved of, and that if he was prepared to hand in his war gratuity bond the land would be bought for him. Accordingly, he handed in his war gratuity bond, amounting to £100, and the Department purchased the land for cash and took possession of the deeds, which they have held ever since. They told the applicant that if he would bring along a contractor they would make arrangements with him. The contractor, who happened to be a personal friend of the soldier's, called at the Department, where he was shown a set of plans for a house which would cost £700 . Subsequently, when the allowance was in creased to £ 8 0 0 , the Department advised the applicanb to have his plans altered, in order to take advantage of the in creased advance. The contractor made the alterations, and the altered plans were ultimately approved. The Department then informed the contractor that the matter would be finalized with in a fortnight, and the latter accordingly cancelled another - contract in order to build his friend's home, which he was prepared to do at a very reasonable price. But the case has not yet 'been finalized, and a month or two ago, when I made inquiries at the Department, I was told that it was the 350th on the list. When the lad himself called the other day he was told that they did not know where his case stood. If they had told him at once that he stood no chance of getting his home built for years he could have spent his war bond in purchasing a home on his own account, and by this time would have had it partly paid off. I know that the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) is trying to do his best to rectify matters of this kind, and I have had every satisfaction from, him in respect to the cases I have brought under his notice. He is doing a great deal to pull the nuts out of the fire. In reference to the remarks made by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr . justifi- Mahony) concerning matters at Cockatoo Island, I leave the question of . the hire of boats to the Minister concerned, but I hardly think the honourable member was doing himself justice when he stated that the services of Mr Sheiles had been dispensed with because he was a union official, and had been selected to oppose a member of this House at the next election. We ought to go furthe r back into the history of this case, and remember that this was the same gentleman who opposed a. certain honourable member at a previous election, and was defeated. Every one has the right to stand for election, but Mr Sheiles had already resigned from the service of the Department at Cockatoo Island, and was reinstated by instructions from the then Minister, a member of the Labour party, which was in power at the time. Would honourable members, in a private business, employ the president of the Clerks Union and the secretary of a Vigilance Committee on a job to record the men's time? The two positions cannot go hand in hand. A man cannot serve two masters. Mr. Sheiles could not f a it h full y serve the Com1 monwealth and the unions at the same time.",53
238,Mr MAHONY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,He could not serve the Commonwealth and be a prominent unionist. It is handy to have that admission of policy fro m the honourable member.,53
239,Mr MARR,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,It is not a question of. policy. A man who. is the secretary of one union and president of another cannot fil l the position of keeping a f a i record of the times of other officials of his union to the satisfaction of the Department or that of the unionists.,54
240,Mr MAHONY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,Why not?,54
241,Mr MARR,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"Because it is opposed to human nature that such a thing should be done. In any case, the position of time recorder is no longer required at Cockatoo Island, because the Board of Management has introduced the card system, under which the men record their own times. When last year's Estimates were under consideration the Postmaster-General promised that an amount of money would be placed on 'the Supplementary Estimates for the purchase of land and the building of a telephone exchange on the Belmore line, at - Lakemba, in New South. Wales. But no money was so provided on Supplementary Estimates, nor can I find any such provision on this year'B Estimates. The Post and Telegraph Department for a long time past has had, and for a very long time to eome will haye, very serious problems to overcome in connection with, overtaking the backward condition of out. telephone system. That cannot be done'in a day. Two years ago the Postmaster-General's Department was short of cables and of wire. The wire difficulty has been overcame to a. great extent, the cable difficulty is being overcome, and the shortage of instruments.is being made up. I do not know why theire should now be any shortage of instruments, because plenty are available. In my district, although, some applicants have been kept waiting eighteen months and two years far telephones, on the ground that wire or cable waa not available,.I. have seen connexions being, made ta the dwellings of other persons. No doubt the Postmaster-General is doing his utmost to meet publio requirements, and I hope that the Treasurer will give him all the money that he needs far this purpose. One gets tired of hearing the complaints trf Sydney residents about the telephone system. Along the Belmore line to which. I have referred, theire is one of the largest suburban populations connected with the metropolis, and yet those residing at Hurlstone. Park, - Canterbury, and the other stations along the line have to be connected with the exchanges at ABhfield or Burwood, which are, on the average, three miles away. A thousand connexions with those exchanges from places on the t h f u l Belmore line would mean, with the metallic circuit, 6,000 miles of wire and innumerable poles. Experience teaches that the best practice is to ' have subscribers close to an exchange, because of the saving in wire and in poles. I . hope that the Postmaster-General will favourably consider the request for an exchange on this line, and that he will satisfy our constituents in regard to postal and telephone requirements, so that they may cease to harass us.",54

The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) mentioned cases , in which returned men who had manifested symptoms of sickness which they had contracted on activeservice were met, when they claimed pensions, by the departmental reply that their disability did not result from active service, and therefore their claims could not - be allowed. In - my opinion-and I hope that the Committee shares it-whe n there is a doubt in . a case of this kind, the returned man who is an applicant for., a pension should get the benefit of it . The law should be interpreted liberally, especially as the evidence of the facts is in the nature of the case not easy either to corroborate or ta disprove. .The Pensions Department should nob constitute itself both prosecutor and judge, .first making out a case against the applicant for a pension, and then deciding it against him. I feel so strongly about a case to which I invite the Minister's attention that I propose not to speak"" on any other this evening. To use the words of the. honourable member for Robertson (Mr . Fleming) it . is typical of a number of others. I shall designate the soldier to ' whom I am about to refer Mr X , to distinguish him from the Mr A , with whose case the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) so ably dealt.

I was sent, with others,' to the Island of Matupi, and was engaged on sentry work. No shelter available. Frequently we were soaked with torrential rains under the conditions of the island.

This continned until well into 1916, definite symptomatic chest pains manithemselves. I saw Major, or Captain, Mahafley, medical officer, who examined me, that I was in a very low state of health, suffering from influenza and malaria. He prescribed for me. I was a bed patient for about ten days. In November, 1916, I was sent to Australia on furlough. A few days out from Sydney I took bad again. Had a fact, recurrence 'of malaria.

During 1917 I had several' attacks of malaria, and the cdugh never left me. I was engaged with Messrs. Goldsbrough, Mort, & Co.

I thought T would leave that to the I have no doubt that he could then have n established his claim to a pension with much greater ease than he could subseof quently, but merely because of-a spirit of sportsmanship and generosity he withheld About February, J918, I was examined by Dr Brown, of Windsor, whose certificate is to be on the file with my papers; and I . doctor. furnish another certificate by the same Early in 1919 I was seriously ill with cold and chest trouble, which continuedmore or less till Juno, 1919, when I was laid aside definitely with pneumonic influenza, attended In June of the present year I was taken to the Caulfield Hospital suffering from the old I trouble. While getting convalescent I applied for sustenance allowance, and, as I told Dr a (Major) Irving, I was refused on the ground my state of health was not due to war service. Major Irving exprossed surprise, and said, in the presence of Sister , -"" That is all nonsense,"" or words to that effect, and - 'he added, "" I will see Colonel Fetherston - -.Put 's name.down,"" which Sister -! - - did . A month later Major Irving expressed the opinion to me that no medical authority could say that my lungs were not affected while I was away on active service. I am informed that my file shows, and it is a fact, that Dr Derham, of Preston, gave a certincate to the Repatriation Department to the effect that my complaint was due to, or aggravated by, war service. While being examined early this year by (I believe) the-Chairman of the Gratuity Board,, this, gentleman remarked to me, "" The truth is that. your medical history has 'been lost or mislaid."" With regard to the letter which Senator Millen wrote to Mr Brennan, M.F., dated 28th July, 1921, .it is true that Dr Brown'B certificate referred particularly to the illness in ' 1919, but, as will be seen from his later certincate, he does not suggest that the condition had not an earlier origin. There is no doubt that it had an earlier origin, having regard to the fact that there is no history of tuberculosis in our family on cither side, and that I brought into war operations a strong constitution, and that of my own knowledge I contracted severe colds,, with consequential pains, under conditions of extraordinary hardship in Rabaul",55

The statement continuesIn the circumstances, I contend that I should not be regarded as a civilian patient, but that, on the contrary, I should have my pension und the treatment of a patient who lost health on active service. I do not wish to make party capital out of a matter of this kind. I feel too deeply about it, and am happy to know that honourable members on the other side join with us in criticisms of. the kind am addressing to the Department. I kn6w that the Minister is a trustee public funds, and I am not so innocent as to he unaware that sometimes service abroad, or alleged service, is used as plea by very undeserving persons. Here, however, is a case which I - have investigated, and which, apparently has - been investigated to only some' extent by the - Department-a . case that will stand the closest searchlight so far as the good faith and character of the man are concerned.

While I sympathize very deeply with the grievances of various persons, training schools in those towns. and perhaps large classes of individuals, which have been brought before the Comread mittee this afternoon, I would point that this is not - a mere grievance, but School. it is a question of grave national importance.

271,Mr FOLEY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"It certainly docs. am glad to have the assurance of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) today that it is his intention to send an officer of his Department to Western Australia, where a Select Committee of the State Parliament is holding an inquiry into this question. When I was a memher of the Western Australian Parliament last year, I discussed the matter with the honourable member for Collie, who is the Chairman of the Select Committee, and I knew that it was his intention to have such an in quiry. We all know thab there have been some little happenings between the Committee, the Premier of the State, and the Commonwealth Treasurer regarding the giving of evidence by the sub-Treasurer in Western Australia before the Committee; and, therefore, I ' am glad, that the Treasurer is sending over an officer, who will be able to advise the Commonwealth representative there, and help the Committee to elucidate a business that all concerned earnestly desire shall be elucidated. The subject-matter of the inquiry might at first sight lead people to believe that there have been wholesale scandals in connection with the cashing of bonds; and I take it to be the duty of the public men of Australia to show that there has been no such wholesale scandal, and to disabuse the minds of the people of any such idea-. It is an easy matter for persons here or elsewhere to make charges of people gaining money in this or that direction, but the question is to prove them.",59

273,Mr FOLEY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I shall not speak in generalities of that kind, but get right down to details. The question for the Select Committee is what a soldier will say now regarding his own action when he was getting his bond cashed. There are four modes of payment by means of thesebonds-ther e is the cash payment to widows, the cash payment to married men who got married after the cessation of hostilities, the cash, payment in necessitous cases",59
274,Dr MALONEY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,Some cases!,59
275,Mr FOLEY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"The payments made have been in cash. Then therei are the caveat cases, in which the payment is divided between the soldier and his dependants. I believe I have as large an experience of this work as any civilian in I Australia, because I was Complaints Officer in the western State, and every appeal came before me; and, in my opinion, the majority of the soldiers, and the majority of their dependants, "" play the game."" There are, however, cases in which dependants do not play the game, and also cases in which soldiers have not played the game to those they lef t behind. The Government or the Department concerned did not say that the money should not be paid simply because of this fact; they held that it was the duty of the country to pay the money to somebody, and various Boards had to decide to whom it should be paid, and - to what amount. As Complaints Officer I have dealt - with 98 per cent, of the caveat cases that the Board had to deal with. _ There were complaints with reforonce to separation allowances, the overpayment of separation allowances, and so forth . If a soldier's wife proved u n f a it h f ul while he was away fighting and he had dependants other than his wife, a trustee o,r guardian of those other dependants might lodge a caveat with the Gratuity Board, which would consider the circumstances and arrange' an equitable distribution amongst, the parties. In the majority of these cases payment has been made in .cash. There are thus lef t only two classes of cases. The majority of those soldiers who could establish necessitous circumstances have been paid in cash, but whether they were or were not paid, the if Gratuity Board, which consisted only of returned fighting soldiers-no t Horseferry-road heroes-gav e them a fair deal.",59

These Gratuity Boards considered all applications for cash on account of necessitous circumstances, and the soldiers have had a fair deal. When the gratuity bonds were issued provision was made for their cashing by two classes of persons.

286,Mr FOLEY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"If there was anything wrong or ulterior in their actions the Committee in Western Australia will have an opportunity of finding it out. Some of the laud agents did not play the game. A soldier who had a bond worth, say, £100, and was desirous of getting it cashed, would approach a land agent who would sell him a block of land for £40, and give him £60 in cash. It has been proved, to my satisfaction at all events, that some of the blocks of land thus sold did not represent value for the money paid for them. I have brought specific , cases before the Government, and in every instance where it could be proved .that the value placed upon the land was too the Government have re-assessed it , with the result that many a soldier has been recouped.some of the money that was paid to the agent. It is to cases of this kind that the inquiry will be .reduced. And I am glad to know that when the matter is sifted it will be found to be not as bad as it appears to be on the The chairman of the Select Committee in Western Australia (Mr A. A . Wilson, honourable member for Collie), is a returned soldier, and no man wili be more pleased than he if the inquiry should prove that there has been no corruption at all. The attitude of the CommonGovernment has been in the direction of helping to elucidate these cases, and I am sorry that a little friction has occurred recently. In March, 1920, the Prime Minister said .that the Commonto wealth Government desired to help the so do the Select Committee, and I am glad that the Government are sendbefore that body an oflicer .who will state the facts as they affect both the Commonwealth and the soldier whose interests it is sought to protect. No bond was cashed unless a statutory declaration Some was made by the holder, and another by .the person providing the cash. In those how hard it would be for a be Select Committee to prove fraud. The soldier who had his bond cashed made a declaration before the sub-Treasurer that he was receiving the full face value of the bond plus accrued interest. The person cashing the bond also made 'a statutory declaration that he was paying full value plus accrued interest. Are the Committee likely to set soldiers to come before them and say that they committed perjury when they made that statutory declaration but that they will tell the truth now ? If the person who cashed the bond adheres to his original declaration, then no Court can commit him for perjury, and the Committee will have to weigh against his evidence that of a soldier who admits that he committed perjury when he signed the statutory declaration. For these reasons, I do not think the Select Committee will discover a great deal, but if cases of frau d are sheeted home I trust that an effort will be made to bring to book any person who evaded the regulations governing the cashing of war "" bonds. I again stress the point, however, that before any substantial result can come from this in quiry soldiers must go before the Committee and make statements different from their statutory declarations. Either they must commit perjury now or admit that they committed .perjury earlier.",60

288,Mr FOLEY,DESTROYERS PLACED OUT OF,"I have already said that adjustments have been made in connection with land purchases. I have gone very deeply into this question, and . I am satisfied that on account of the action which the Commonwealth Government have taken, no soldier need be a sufferer by any land transaction, in connection with the cashing of his bond. Trouble is bound to occur when soldiers endeavour to get cash for their bonds. I could mention many cases in which discount has been charged, but I have nothing but praise for the Commonwealth officers in the various States, who have done all they can for the soldiers; for the soldiers themselves, who have piayed the game, as also for their dependants, who, likewise played the game when bread-winners were away fighting at the Front. For the other class I care nothing. Although very little may be ascertained by this inquiry, there is always a possibility of a certain amount of d i r t being flung at the officers. However, when the time comes, I hope honourable members will have the opportunity of dealing with it to the fullest extent.",61

In regard to my experience of getting cash for war gratuity bonds I have nothing but grateful thanks to the Treasury officials for the manner in which they have assisted me in many cases of destitution I have brought under their notice. Mr Mulvaney has been unceasing in his efforts to render that assistance. I cannot understand the Treasurer's objection to one of the Australian States going to America to borrow money. I well remember that financial genius, Mr . K i ng O'Malley, the father of the Commonwealth Bank, drawing my attention to the fact thirteen years ago, that money was being borrowed by the City of New York at 2 per cent, when the Bank of England rate was 3^ per cent. Why should objection be raised to Australia borrowing in New York when the Motherland itself and France resorted there for money in their hour of need ? It is a matter for regret that Sir Robert Philp, Sir Alfred Cowley, and Mr Walsh should have gone to England to form a cabal there with the purpose of preventing their State, which has perhaps more potentialities than has any other State of the Commonwealth, from raising money in the Old Country. However, New York offered it , and it is but another instance of the bond of affection between the two great English-speaking, nations of the world. There are more English-speaking people living under the Stars and Stripes than live under the Union. Jack. ^However, I want to knew why the citizens of Australia, who put their savings in the State Savings Banks or in the Commonwealth Bank, cannot draw interest equal to that which we pay the foreign moneylenders. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) will never forget aii interesting interview I had with Sir Denison Miller some years ago. If the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank carries out what he has indicated .he has in his mind, his name will be handed down to posterity as that of one of the greatest men the world has produced. _ The Daily Echo contains a very interesting account of an interview with Mr Scott, the publisher of the Circulating Sovereign, showing that Sir Denison Miller informed a deputation that he was prepared to finance the settlement of Australia to the extent of £350,000,000. Tbis is the interviewOur representative called on Mr Scott and asked him was he willin g to give particulars of his interview with Sir Denison Miller, and any other details which should be made public. Mr Scott said "" He was only too willing, and he had been wondering which newspapers would be enterprising and truly patriotic enough to want to give publicity to that upon which certain papers had apparently decided to be silent. We seem to live in an age when deliberate misleading of the people, or deliberate suppression of the truth , is the practice of our powerful newspapers,"" said Mr . Scott, "" but the truth will out, and I often wonder what would happen if the people realized only half of what goes on. However, to get back to the object of your interview. I suppose the matter really dates back to 1903, the year the little book The Circulating Sovereign was published, and it all seems wonderful, when one looks back and thinks of one occurrence after another in connection with that book and its history. But to come to 'things now.' Let us start in March of this year. Two of us, both members of the Australian Labour Party, and both good citizens,"" he said, "" in spite of that fact, arranged witli the Lord .Mayor to call a public meeting in the Sydney Town Hall, and invited the heads of banks and industries to give advice on the unemployed problem, A committee was formed at that meeting, which included Sir Joseph Carruthers, the late T. J. Eyan, M.H.R., J. H . Catts, M.H.E., myself, and others. At"" the first committee meeting I spoke on the advisability of calling on Sir Denison Miller, as he, having full control of the money power of Australia, had the power to solve the unemployed problem if the people really wished it . "" I am sure that thei honourable member for C a p r i c o r n i a will agree that S i M ill e r has almost u n l i m it e d powers"" Sir Joseph Carruthers suggested that a call on our own bank would be a slight on members of Parliament, so out of deference to Sir Joseph's high rank the matter was dropped at that meeting."" "" Why did Sir Joseph not want the call made, and why should members of Parliament be considered'! "" interjected our representative. "" I don't know why,"" said Mr. Scott, "" but I am inclined to be of the opinion that if the public (never mind about Sir Joseph and others) were really in earnest over the unemployed question, that no barrier would be placed against anything being done that should be done. The whole question lies in the honesty and earnestness of public thought, and how to produce that public thought is a question."" . . "" An important suggestion like the call on our Commonwealth Bank could not be allowed to be dropped even if Sir Joseph , Carruthers and others holding high positions in the land were afraid of the idea. Several were spoken to, but the answers they gave ran: * Sir' Denison would not see us,' or 'What's the \ise?' or ' He would only turn us down/ or ' He hasn't any power, he has to do what Sir Joseph Cook says he must,' or some other equally useless reply.""

How many of the deputation were Australian Labour Party members ? "" our representative asked. Mr Scott said, ' "" F i v e ; and I hope all good Australian citizens. I am one, and the others are G. Waite, H . S. Cohen, H . Prichard, and S. J. Humphries, but what has that to do with it? . . . Sir Denison Miller received us just as a good Australian might be expected to receive a deputation of citizens. Two lady shorthand writers from the Bank staff were present, and recorded what happened. Each deputationist spoke to Sir Denison the thoughts that each had. I was not interested in academic problems. We had certain machinery in existence, and I wanted an acknowledgment from Sir Denison of the power of that financial machinery, and an expression also from him of his willingness or otherwise to use the power already existing. I asked, ' What is the power of the Commonwealth Bank to finance Australia?' He said, ' This Bank is just as powerful as the Australian Commonwealth is.' I said, ' Sir Denison, you did finance Australia for £350,000,000 for war purposes, and had the war continued you could nave financed it to another £350,000,000 for war. Is that not so?' Sir Denison replied, ' That was the case.' 'Then Sir Denison,' I said, 'are you prepared to finance Australia r Denison for £350,000,000 for productive purposes' He replied, 'Yes, I will do my best.' I said, 'Thank you, Sir Denison, that is the point.' I wrote down what had occurred, and read it back to Sir Denison, stating at the time that I only wanted whathe would endorse, as the matter would be made public, and he replied, ' I will endorse that . ' "" "" A pretty big deal that,"" risked our representative. ""Yes,"" Mr . 1 Scott remarked, ' t h is is the biggest deal ever made by Australians in money. No American millionaire even ever did a single deal for an amount like that; but something of more importance than the amount is the new principle created. I remarked at the time that the interview was the most important that had ever occurred in Australia. We had opened the door into a now realm of thought that has no ending. A number of citizens had gone straight into the Governor of their own Bank, setting aside members of Parliament, and arranged for what might be looked upon as the impossible. It is really opening up the possibility of a new form of government."" "" What does it all mean?"" asked our representative. The reply came, "" It simply means this-that the Commonwealth Bank is powerf u l enough to take Australia right through the unemployed problem and every other money problem, and Sir Denison Miller is will ing to use all his ability and his power to the very utmost if the people who own the Bank, that is ourselves, can only grasp' in some degree its significance, and will . give their earnest and loyal support.""",61

I am grateful to Japan for the help she rendered us in making it possible for our men to cross in the seas in safety during the recent great this conflict. She played the game then.

I am glad to know that the United States is preEven in pared to help us monetarily, just as she this helped the Motherland and France in their recent great difficulties. I desire now to speak upon another We have among us one who in has made the name of Australia known wherever the British tongue is spoken. He is ailing in a hospital, and has only £ 1 a week to live on; I allude to Henry Lawson, the great Australian writer. His present position resembles that of Robert Burns, who ended his days in Scotland in need and misery. Surely we do not wish this man, whose poems - and stories have given pleasure to thousands of Australians, to end in that wav. Could not the Men of Letters Eund be increased a little f The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , when leading the vernment, introduced a Bill to provide for Sir Samuel Griffith an old-age pension of £ 5 a day, although that gentleman had received from Queensland and from the Commonwealth some £86,000 for his services.' Having given him so much, could we not give Henry Lawson a little more than a paltry 20s. a week? I offered to contribute to Sir Samuel Griffith's support, had he lost his money by injudicious experiments in finance, what I was then paying in income tax. Sir Samuel Griffith translated into the English vernacular part of the works of that great It a l i a n poet Dante Alighieri. That book is in the Library, but I know of no member who has read it . Certainly for every person in the community who has read it there are thousands who have read Lawson's works. Lawson has written words that live and burn, and will be read in years to come. If a collection was started among members, I think that each would be glad to give something to assist the man whose greatness is shown in his splendid poetry, which pictures so well the beauties of the Australian bush. How many Scotchmen have I heard regretting the last days of Robert Burns? Do not let us have similar regrets regarding Lawson. To Lady Bridges Parliament voted £4,500 because she had lost her man at the front, who perished with 60,000 other Australians. No doubt he was a good fellow, but he bad had more chance to save money than the ordinary private had had. I am tired of the travesties of justice that occur in the Northern Territory.
