1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt Hon. Sir Billy Snedden) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. NA",13
2,Mr ANTHONY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,-I inform the House that the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) is on ministerial leave. The Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) is acting as Minister for Transport and Construction until Mr Hunt returns. NA,13
3,Mr BOURCHIER,CITY OF BENDIGO,"I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move: That this House (I) congratulates the City of Bendigo on being awarded the title of the Premier town of Victoria: (2) offers congratulations to the team headed by Councillor Campbell for their excellent presentation on behalf of Bendigo that ultimately led to Bendigo being awarded this high honour: and (3) calls on the Federal Government to (a) support in every possible way any efforts hy the City of Bendigo to develop this recognised Premier town even further. and (b) help promote the culating information about Bendigo throughout all Trade Offices and Embassies. NA",13
4,Mr SCHOLES,GOVERNMENT AIRCRAFT FACTORY,"Corio) 1 give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move: That this House condemns the Government for its decision to proceed with the sacking of skilled aircraft industry employees from the Government Aircraft Factories. NA",13
5,Mr MILDREN,UNEMPLOYMENT," I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move: That this House (I) deplores the appalling levels of unemployment in the following municipalities (a) City of Ballarat (15.5 per cent): (b) Daylesford and Glenlyon (16.9 percent), and (c) Talbot and Clunes (17.78 per cent), and (2) calls upon the Federal Government to initiate more realistic measures to alleviate unemployment in these municipalities. NA NA NA Mr JOHN BROWN1 direct a question to the Treasurer. Have a number of motor vehicle dealers been issued with assessments following recent allegations in the New South Wales Parliament? Did one of the dealers so named receive two assessments totalling approximately $16m? If so, what action is being taken to prevent the dealer transferring assets outside Australia or to other companies? Did the Australian Taxation Office know in 1980 of the participation in motor vehicle sales tax evasion or avoidance schemes of any of the dealers to whom assessments have recently been issued? If so, why have two years elapsed before action has been taken against them? Finally, are criminal prosecutions being considered against any of those involved in these schemes? if not, why not? Notice of Motion",13
6,Mr HOWARD,AVOIDANCE AND EVASION,"-I cannot answer some parts of the honourable gentleman's question because that obviously would involve providing information on the affairs of individual taxpayers. It may well be, because of the operation of the secrecy provisions of the Act, that he is in a better position to find out that information about those individuals. I shall refer the honourable gentleman's question to the Commissioner of Taxation and, within that limitation, see what further information 1 can obtain. With respect to the more general aspect of the honourable gentleman's Premier town of Victoria by cirquestion, 1 can assure him that the Taxation Office knew well before 1980 of certain sales tax avoidance practices because it was in 1978, in response to advice given to me by the Commissioner Notice of Motion of Taxation, that remedial legislation was passed by this Parliament to deal with the sales tax avoidance practices which 1 understand were the subject of an at times ill-fated outburst in the New South Wales Parliament by the member for Cronullaan outburst which led to that honourable gentleman being forced to withdraw many of his allegations and to do other things which have Notice of Motion caused him some embarrassment. Some arrests have been made in this area. Whether they relate to the particular offences that the honourable gentleman has in mind 1 do not know, and I cannot say on the basis of the information that he has given me. The Commissioner of Taxation has assured me, as recently as a few weeks ago, that he believes that the existing law is totally adequate to deal with these avoidance practices. He does not accept and, on the basis of his advice, neither does the Government accept, that large amounts of revenue, as alleged in the New South Wales Parliament, have been lost. The matter will be kept under very constant review because the Commissioner and I are as anxious as the honourable gentleman no doubt is to ensure that there are no losses to the revenue as a result of these practices. But we believe on the best advice available, including that of senior counsel, that the existing law is totally adequate and will be effectivelyenforced. GREAT BARRIER REEF WORLD: NA",13
7,Mr DEAN,BICENTENNIAL PROJECT,"Has the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment seen the proposal of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for the construction of Great Barrier Reef World as a bicentennial project? Is the Minister aware that recently in Townsville well over 22,000 people signed a petition in support of the project? When does the Government propose to announce details of plans for the celebration of the bicentennial year in 1988? When will projects such as Great Barrier Reef World be considered for funds? On what basis and by whom will it be decided what projects will or will not receive approval and funds? Is the Minister concerned that delays in announcing decisions about the bicentennial year put at risk the completion in due time of projects such as Great Barrier Reef World?",14
8,Mr MCVEIGH,BICENTENNIAL PROJECT,"The answer to the first and second parts of the question is yes. In answer to the third part of the question, the Government will announce details of the plans early in the new year. In answer to part four, the responsibility for recommending to the Commonwealth Government what projects mayor may not fit within the bicentennial guidelines is with the Australian Bicentennial Authority. It is true that, in the draft program that was sent to the States for their perusal, this project on which the honourable member for Herbert has done a great deal of work and for which he has displayed a tremendous enthusiasm was indicated as being one that could fit within the guidelines. However, that does not mean to say that it will be finally accepted. The Australian Bicentennial Authority recommends to the Government. It will then be necessary for the Commonwealth and State governments to discuss what are the available and appropriate projects to fit within the guidelines. The matter of funding is one for consideration by the Commonwealth and the States. In reply further to the fifth part of the question, I indicate to the honourable member that this afternoon I will be having a discussion with Mr John Reid, Chairman of the Australian Bicentennial Authority. He shares my view that, on account of the tremendous amount of work that has been done by the Bicentennial Authority, when we make the announcements early next year we should have sufficient time within which to ensure that the program and the plan for 1988 will be very successful and it will be a fitting ceremonial occasion to remind us of how much we have achieved in the 200 years in which we have been in existence. NA",14
9,Mr HURFORD,JEWELLERY INDUSTRY,"Has the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources received a submission from the Manufacturing Jewellers and Silversmiths Association, among others, whose members give valuable employment to many Australians in an industry which upvalues our raw materials, showing that foreign government subsidies to foreign jewellery manufacturing industries are responsible for Australian retrenchment rates running at about 30 per cent? Is it a fact that the submission indicates that the closer economic relations agreement with New Zealand, due to be signed today, will cause even graver problems? Does the Government believe that such an industry should survive in Australia? If so, as an example of the situation in many industries, what is the Government's response to the present crisis situation?",14
10,Mr ANTHONY,JEWELLERY INDUSTRY,"I cannot say whether a submission has come into my office. I am not aware of one recently, but it could have come in. There have been representations in the past, particularly relating to the cutting of precious stones, from people who have complained strongly that their industry has been undermined by allowing imports into Australia and therefore depriving many people in this area of jobs. I react immediately to the honourable member's remarks that they are concerned about closer economic relations with New Zealand. I would think that they are overreacting in that particular case. I think that their concern is more about imports coming from countries of the Asian region rather than from New Zealand. However, I shall take on board the honourable member's comments and see whether I can have a closer examination of the report. SMALL BUSINESSES: SALES TAX NA",14
11,Mr MCLEAN,PAYMENTS,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer him to my representations on behalf of small businesses experiencing liquidity problems because their sales tax payments to the Government must be made within a time frame shorter than the trade credit facilities prevailing in industry. Is the Government aware of the extent of this problem? Has the Government considered extending the time period for sales tax payments to the Government from the business sector?,14
12,Mr HOWARD,PAYMENTS,"I have received representations on this issue from not only the honourable member for Perth but also a large number of members on both sides of the House. It would cost about $300m to extend by a period of one month the time for payment of sales tax. What has happened over the years, of course, is that credit terms have moved out very significantly. That has been aggravated in recent times. I cannot offer the honourable gentleman any promise that the situation will be changed in the immediate future. It is one of a number of things that, within Budget capacity, a government might like to do, given changed circumstances. There have been some suggestions that the timing of the payment of sales tax within any financial year might be altered. One of the drawbacks of that would be that it could aggravate the seasonal swings in liquidity that occur during the course of anyone year. I can promise the honourable member that his concerns will be borne in mind in future if the Government has capacity to move in areas to ease the position of small business. But I also point out that the terms provided for the payment of sales tax are significantly more generous than those provided for the payment of the traditional excises, where payments must be made within seven days. NA",14
13,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PROPOSED WAGES FREEZE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I refer to the Government's proposal to freeze salaries and wages for 12 months. Will the Minister inform the House in what way, if any, this will affect Public Service salary increments, and what is the position with respect to wage and salary agreements presently being negotiated but which are not proposed to come into force until the new year?",15
14,Mr SPEAKER,PROPOSED WAGES FREEZE,"Before I call the Minister, I should indicate that the question asks for the announcement of policy, in the sense that the legislation has not come into the Parliament; but perhaps in the interests of the convenience of members of the House, I should call the Minister. Industry type 'Mature E.G. Car manufacture, steel making 'Innovative E.G. mainframe computers, instant photography 'Young High Technology' E.G. minicomputers, digital communications, microelectronics Mr MACPHEE I am quite happy to answer the question, although the matter will be debated later today. Yes, the wages pause covers all persons receiving employment from the Commonwealth but does not relate to increments that would be more in the nature of a management decision on the performance of duties. In respect of agreements, the position is, as we have said pubic1y, that the completion of the so-called community round of wage increases will be permitted in respect of public sector employment as with private sector employment, and in respect of any other agreements being negotiated we would expect that if they relate to a new community round they would be the subject of the pause. In the interests of the House, I think that any more technical questions and any more detailed answers should be forthcoming during the debate. NA",15
15,Mr SHIPTON,HIGH TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES,"My question is directed to the Minister for Science and Technology. What is the Government doing to promote the establishment of new technology and high technology industries in Australia and to help to introduce high technology into our current manufacturing industries? Will this help to promote employment and create jobs? Could the injection of new technology make Australian industry more competitive? Mr THOMSON There is no doubt that the establishment of high technology industries would help to create employment. A study in the United States of America over a five-year period showed, per million dollars of turnover in industries, that mature industries created 0.69 jobs, innovative industries created 5.05 jobs and young high technology industries created 40.48 jobs. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short table on this matter. Leave granted. The table read as follows CREATION OF NEW JOBS IN THE USA (1970-77) USA Department of Commerce, Five Year Study Combined New jobs New jobs Ratio of job annual created in created creation to sales last five per $Im mature (x$lm) years turnover industries 36,000 25,000 0.69 1.0 21,000 106,000 5.05 7.3 857 35,000 40.84 59.2 Mr THOMSONThe United States experience does show the importance of high technology industries. Their gains in labour productivity were twice those of low technology industries and they were better performers in the critical areas of growth, prices, productivity and employment. At present my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I are having discussions about how we may apply some of these lessons to Australia. There is no doubt that one of the most important factors is research and development. Our figures for government spending on research and development are good. About 80 per cent of all research and development expenditure in Australia is from government sources and only approximately 20 per cent is from industry sources. The reverse figures apply in most other highly industrialised countries. I am trying to encourage industry to invest more in research and development. I think that is most important. We must concentrate on areas of high technology where we have an advantagebiotechnology, robotics, the application of new materials and some micro-electronic devices. We must find niches in which we can compete and export because our own markets are too small to support some of these industries. There is Government support at the moment for high technology industries. I have cited the research and development support which the Government gives through the industrial incentives scheme. There is the patent system, the high technology purchasing preference, the defence offset programs, the research by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the various other technology transfer mechanisms. There is no doubt, though, that the transfer of technology to industry by Australia is not good and we must do more in this field. An innovations centre has been created in Victoria and it has been most successful. Other States are now looking at the creation of innovation centres to transfer technology and to assist new industries. At the moment the Government is accepting applications from the States on these new innovation centres. There is no doubt, though, that to create new industries we need an impetus from the Government. NA",15
16,Mr MORRIS,TRANS AUSTRALIA AIRLINES,My question is directed to the Minister for Aviation. Given the alarming decline in the demand for air travel brought about by this Government's economic mismanagement and the financial difficulties this has created for Trans Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia,16
17,Mr SPEAKER,TRANS AUSTRALIA AIRLINES,"Order! The honourable member will proceed with his question and not introduce argument into it. Mr MORRIS I ask: For how much longer is real TAA to be denied an adequate level of working capital, the denial of which has caused the airline to incur a massive interest charge burden? For how much longer is this valuable national asset to be handicapped in its operations by the petty and heavy-handed involvement of his bureaucracy?",16
18,Mr SPEAKER,TRANS AUSTRALIA AIRLINES,"If the honourable gentleman insists on introducing pejorative terms and argument, I will rule his question out of order. Mr MORRISFinally, will the Minister give a firm assurance that TAA, in accordance with the declarations of the Prime Minister and the former Minister for Transport, will not be sold?",16
19,Mr FIFE,TRANS AUSTRALIA AIRLINES,"Some months ago the Government took a decision in relation to Trans Australia Airlines and that decision involved a requirement to transfer TAA 's operation from a commission to a company. That move is taking place. The technical and legal aspects are being given attention by my Department and by the Crown law offices of the Commonwealth. I am not able to say precisely when this changeover will take place but I hope that it will be during the first half of next year. Another decision that is relevant to the honourable member's question was taken by the Government, and that is its decision to appoint consultants to advise upon the feasibility of selling all or part of the share holding in the company to be created. The consultants are about to report indeed they may have done so in the last 24 hours. I confidently expect that certainly within the next few weeks the Government will receive the report of the consultants and then early in the new year it will give consideration to that matter. It goes without saying that the Government has not taken a decision to sell all or part of Trans Australia Airlines; it has only sought advice from the consultants regarding the feasibility of doing so. The question still has to be faced by the Government and that question will be faced in the new year. The honourable member asked how long Trans Australia Airlines and the House will have to wait before being advised on the injection of additional capital into Trans Australia Airlines. I can indicate to the honourable member that the Government has decided to provide an additional $25m capital to Trans Australia Airlines and that the capital requirement will be further reviewed early next year when the consultants' report to which I have referred is before Cabinet. The decision has been taken along the lines I have indicated and that will provide sufficient funds for Trans Australia Airlines for the foreseeable future. NA Dr EVERINGHAMHas the Minister for Foreign Affairs decided not to launch a promotion campaign for disarmament in Australia because he sees no need for this in the free world? Does he support the world disarmament campaign only because of the great need for it among the Warsaw Pact countries? Has he reduced in real terms government funding for the United Nations Association of Australia and other nongovernmental organisations engaged in educating Australians in the development of peaceful means of settling international disputes and strengthening of the United Nations to provide for enforceable disarmament and international law? Can he suggest ways of increasing peaceful overtures from Warsaw Pact countries more effective than negative sanctions which selectively penalise less economically powerful interests on both sides of the Cold War?",16
20,Mr STREET,DISARMAMENT CAMPAIGN,"As the honourable member would know, the disarmament campaign which was decided as a result of the Second Special Session on Disarmament at the United Nations earlier this year is to be funded from within the financial resources of the United Nations. I also draw the honourable member's attention to the speech that I made to the Special Session which sets out in great detail the Australian Government's position in relation to disarmament. I further point out to him that it is true that, I think last year, there was a reduction in the funds available to the United Nations Association. Those funds were restored to their former level this year. The honourable member mentioned disarmament overtures--I think that was the word he used-from the Warsaw Pact countries. The preeminent requirement in any moves towards disarmament is the creation of an atmosphere of trust and confidence and truly verifiable measures. I suggest that all our energies should be directed towards achieving that atmosphere of confidence and proper verifiable measures for arms control instead of mere rhetoric. Mr SPEAKER I indicate to honourable members on my left that inadvertently I called two questions from the left. I will now call two questions from the right. SHIPPING DISPUTE: 'RIVER BOYNE'",17
21,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,DISARMAMENT CAMPAIGN,The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations will be aware of the demarcation dispute between the Seamen's Union of Australia and the Merchant Service Guild of Australia about the berthing requirements of the River Boyne. He will also understand that there has been considerable disruption to industry within the Comalco company and also employment opportunities in the north of Australia in this regard. Can he inform the House of any more recent discussions and negotiations with the unions over this matter?,17
22,Mr MACPHEE,DISARMAMENT CAMPAIGN,"I answered a question on this matter last week. I think we would all agree that this is one of the craziest industrial disputes one could imagine and one that is very costly to the industry and employment. Last Friday, as 1 mentioned to the House last week, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions convened a meeting of all interested parties, including union officials from Weipa and elsewhere. I am informed that the outcome of that meeting was a very hopeful one indeed. The meeting unanimously agreed that it would seek to resolve the matter within the trade union movement and resolve the demarcation argument over the particular classification. The meeting asked the Australian National Line to lift its current proceedings which were aimed at removing one of the classifications from one of the unions. I understand that ANL has said that, without prejudice to its right to reintroduce that action, it will do so in the interests of trying to settle the dispute. I believe that the ACTU deserves our congratulations. I hope that the mass meetings which are being held today will endorse the unanimous decision of the union officials and that not only will this matter be settled expeditiously but also this will set the pattern for the ACTU in future to be able to resolve demarcation disputes within the union movement and therefore minimise industrial disruption. NA",17
23,Mr BAUME,WELFARE HOUSING FUNDS,Can the Treasurer inform the House what the total increase will be in welfare housing funds available to the States as a result of the latest decision by the Commonwealth Government? As a result of the wage pause initiative has the Commonwealth decided to allocate $1 OOm of the $300m Budget savings expected to result from this pause for the construction of additional welfare housing? Does this mean that the Government is visibly doing something very significant to stimulate-,17
24,Mr SPEAKER,WELFARE HOUSING FUNDS,- Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. I call the Treasurer.,17
25,Mr HOWARD,WELFARE HOUSING FUNDS,"As my colleague the Minister for Social Security announced yesterday, the Commonwealth has decided that $IOOm of the $300m to be available for expenditure on employment-related activities, subject to the passage of the legislation that my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations will be introducing this afternoon, will be provided to the States for expenditure on a proportionate basis throughout Australia on welfare housing. This will result in about another 2,000 housing units being constructed in the public housing area. It is recognised by most people that this is a very labour sensitive area of the economy and it will have valuable multiplier effects. I should also say to the House that this will mean that the total expenditure on welfare housing in the current financial year will have risen by no less than 50 per cent.This is due not only to the additional money being made available by the Commonwealth directly for welfare housing but also to the willingness of the Commonwealth at the Loan Council meeting in the middle of this year to allow the States greater flexibility. I make only two further comments. In order to achieve the immediate implementation of the Government's decision two things are necessary: First, a speedy passage of the pause legislation to be introduced this afternoon by my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations; and, second, speedy action on the part of all State governments, in co-operation with the Commonwealth, to give immediate effect to this decision. RESEARCH: FUNDING",17
26,Mr HAYDEN,WELFARE HOUSING FUNDS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Science and Technology. I refer to the rather generous declarations of commitment he made on the part of the Government to the promotion of advanced technology and scientific research as a key propulsion mechanism to promote the economy and industry of this country and, indeed, of society. Has he noted the Report on Grants Approved for 1983 of the Australian Research Grants Scheme? In particular, I ask whether he noted, in relation to funding for 1983, the declaration in that report which states that it IS: less than the amount required to maintain the existing level of activity under the Scheme. This decrease. in real terms, in the funds available to the Committee has severely limited its capacity to give effect to its policy of providing increased tionally high quality and of strengthening research teams. Therefore, how does he reconcile this shabby treatment of Australian researchers with the inflated declaration he made a few minutes ago in this House on the matters to which I referred, his request to the Committee in 1980 'to develop strategies to give greater emphasis to excellence' and the Prime Minister's 1980 election promise that 'excellence will be fostered'? Mr THOMSON I have read the report mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition. The Government is very concerned at the level of funding. We have maintained it at the same real level since 1976. It has very much increased from the time when the Leader of the Opposition was the Treasurer of this nation. There have been budgetary restraints, so there has not been the increase in basic research which we would otherwise have wished. But there are other means of basic research, as the Leader of the Opposition-",18
27,Mr HAYDEN,WELFARE HOUSING FUNDS,I raise a point of order. The Minister is misrepresenting the report. It says that there has been a real reduction this year.,18
28,Mr SPEAKER,WELFARE HOUSING FUNDS,"The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. There is no point of order. Mr THOMSONThe Leader of the Opposition is correct. There has been a small reduction this year, but overall there has been an increase since 1976 and a very large increase since the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this nation. Basic research is funded in a number of ways. It is funded through the Australian Research Grants Scheme, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council and in a number of other ways. If we add all these together we will fmd that there has been a considerable increase in basic research in Australia. The Government is seized with its importance. There is no doubt that if it were not for budgetary restraints we would be spending more. But there are budgetary restraints and the Leader of the Opposition is aware of them. Basic research is only one area. We are certainly encouraging the Australian Research Grants Committee to fund excellence. This year it has increased the funding to excellent researchers and increased the research effort to support the excellent research that has been undertaken. I believe that that is a correct policy. NA",18
29,Mr DONALD CAMERON,LOGAN CITY COUNCIL,"Is the Minister support for projects of excepfor Industrial Relations aware that in 1979 the Logan City Council, in my electorate, came to a mutually convenient agreement with the building inspectors in its employ so that they would work from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. instead of from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.? Is he aware that the Municipal Officers Association has been pursuing that City Council recently on the basis that more than $85,000 at penalty rate must be paid to those men-Mr MOUNTFORD What has this to do with the Federal Government?",18
30,Mr DONALD CAMERON,LOGAN CITY COUNCIL,"The honourable member should hold his tongue and he will learn. That amount must be paid to those men for the award work period from 4 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. when those employees were at home, on their way home or even having a beer in the pub. Is the Minister aware that his Industrial Relations Bureau-",19
31,Mr SPEAKER,LOGAN CITY COUNCIL,Order! The honourable gentleman will cease giving information. He will make his question relevant. He appears to me to be forming a basis on which to ask for a legal opinion.,19
32,Mr DONALD CAMERON,LOGAN CITY COUNCIL,"No, definitely not, Mr Speaker.",19
33,Mr SPEAKER,LOGAN CITY COUNCIL,The honourable gentleman will now proceed with the question and will cease giving information.,19
34,Mr DONALD CAMERON,LOGAN CITY COUNCIL,"ls the Minister aware that his Industrial Relations Bureau is now threatening the Logan City Council with court action if it does not pay up the $85,000 immediately? Does the Minister agree that it is time the Federal Government and the State governments together went beyond a wage freeze and came to grips with some of the ridiculous industrial procedures and practices which have been allowed to grow up in this country during the last 81 years?",19
35,Mr MACPHEE,LOGAN CITY COUNCIL,"I am not aware of the details of the agreement referred to by the honourable member, nor am I aware of what the Industrial Relations Bureau might have said to the Council in this case. I am aware, though, that in the annual report of the Industrial Relations Bureau, which I tabled a few weeks ago, the Bureau was at pains to ask employers who wanted to vary awards of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to go to that Commission to have them varied and not simply make arrangements with their own employees. Mr Donald Cameron- Why?",19
36,Mr MACPHEE,LOGAN CITY COUNCIL,"Simply because the award of the Commission has the force of law. It is the law of the land and that law has to be varied. People have to act in accordance with the law. The honourable member mentioned 1979. I would have hoped that the Council was well enough advised to go to the appropriate tribunal-which I assume from the question was the Federal Commission. However, the important point, if I may just generalise slightly, is that with the state of the economy as it now is and with employers around the country coming to private arrangements with their own employees to have different patterns of working they really would be very wise to consult the appropriate employer organisation and to go through it to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to have the award varied because they are technically liable for payments due. When the Industrial Relations Bureau said that in its annual report at least one newspaper report suggested that the Bureau was being somewhat legalistic. In fact the Bureau said in its report that it exercises the limited discretion given to it and does counsel employers to have the awards varied in that way. I know some people in private industry have simply asked their employees to apply for leave for the days off if they are working four-day weeks, and that is quite within the law as well. All I say to the honourable member is that I will look at the matter, find out what the facts are and speak to him later. I again urge that all employers recognise the importance of acting in accordance with the law. If they come to an arrangement to vary awards they should get it ratified by the appropriate tribunal. NA",19
37,Mr KENT,PROPOSED WAGES FREEZE,"I preface my question to the Acting Prime Minister by asking whether he has ever come across the name of Sir Otto Niemeyer and whether he is aware that Sir Otto was sent by the Bank to England during the Depression of the 1930s to tell Australian workers to tighten their belts. Is he aware that Sir Otto's visit was followed by a 10 per cent wage cut, the so-called Premiers Plan? In view of the Acting Prime Minister's claim that the recent Premiers Conference produced an unprecedented agreement, can he advise the House as to the fate of the 1932 wage cut and the fate of the Premiers who introduced it?",19
38,Mr ANTHONY,PROPOSED WAGES FREEZE,"We have a very different set of circumstances today from what we had during the 1930s. During the 1930s this country, along with the rest of the world, was in a state of depression. Prices were going down; there was no inflation at the time. Today part of our problem is inflationary pressures. Any consideration of increasing our deficit to stimulate activity will have a direct consequence in stimulating inflationary pressures. Therefore, any stimulation of work activity by an extravagant increase in government expenditure can have adverse consequences. Our Budget program has already been extended as a result of adverse factors such as the drought and growing unemployment. That extension has been required. To go beyond the measures that we are compelled to take would be to engage in irresponsible action, which this Government is not prepared to do. We have decided that one of the single most important ingredients in stabilising our economy in 1983 is to try to bring about a wage pause. I think there has been a great deal of acceptance throughout Australia that the undertaking entered into between the Commonwealth and the Premiers goes a long way to achieving this pause in 1983. It will give a great deal of heart and confidence to the business community of Australia which, at the moment, is the area that is suffering because of its loss of competitiveness and the rapid increase in wages in the past year over and above the consumer price index, which has meant a real increase in wages of some 5 per cent and also a considerable reduction in profitability, making it difficult for people to be able to retain their employment levels. We want to give further help not only to the private sector but also to ments, whose budgets are also under pressure because of increasing wages. I hope that when the legislation is brought into the Parliament this afternoon, as I perceive it will be, it will have earnest consideration and support of the Australian Labor Party. It is absolutely critical that this country get more stability in its costs and prices in 1983 than we have had in the last year. NA",19
39,Mr BURR,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Does the Government plan to introduce a capital gains tax? Mr HOWARD The Government's position on such a tax was stated during the 1980 election campaign. No proposals are under consideration to alter that policy. NA,20
40,Mr FRY,LOW ALCOHOL CONTENT BEER,I refer the Treasurer to a question asked by the former member for Burke in 1979 as to whether the Government would consider reducing the excise payable on low alcohol content beer. At that stage the Treasurer indicated that he would consider the question. I have not heard anything further as a result of that consideration. I ask: In view of the extension of random breath testing will the Government now reconsider the question as a contribution to reducing the road toll which is associated with drink-driving?,20
41,Mr HOWARD,LOW ALCOHOL CONTENT BEER,"I do recall that some years ago, when low alcohol beer became more popular, this question was raised. I did have some examination made of the experience of differential excise rates in other countries. That examination did not indicate that there was a marked consumer preference for low alcohol beer as a result of excise differentials. It would appear that attitudes towards low alcohol beer tend to be determined, in those countries, other than by economic considerations. I do not rule out the possibility of some change of that kind occurring in the future but I will not commit myself to it for the very good reason that somebody in my position ought not to be making forward commitments about what may or may not be done in discretionary revenue areas. I can only say in conclusion that I welcome very warmly the extension of random breath testing to both the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. I believe those moves are long overdue.

43,Mr HUMPHREYS,AIRCRAFT NOISE,"Is the Minister for Avithe ation aware that air traffic control to minimise noise will be introduced at Maroochydore Airport under a similar system to that used in Cairns? What plans has the Minister in mind to minimise aircraft noise in Brisbane, both now and when the new Brisbane Airport is completed? If there are no plans to minimise aircraft noise in Brisbane, will he immediately implement discussions about doing so?",20
44,Mr FIFE,AIRCRAFT NOISE,Recently I referred the question of aircraft noise to the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. I suspect that the honourable member who asked the question is a member of that Committee. Mr Humphreys-No.,20
45,Mr FIFE,AIRCRAFT NOISE,"I am assured that he is not. I apologise for that. I thought he was a member of that Committee. In any event I know that the honourable member has a keen interest in this area, particularly in relation to matters associated with Brisbane Airport. I referred the aircraft noise question to the parliamentary committee because I wanted the advice of that Committee in relation to all our major airports. I will not be taking any substantive decision to alter the present arrangements at airports around Australia until I receive the report from that Committee. I have indicated on more that one occasion that I am very sensitive to the noise issue at airports. People who live in close proximity to them, of course, have a problem. It is the responsibility of the Government and the Parliament to ensure that the facilities are available for the travelling public and that at the same time the inconvenience, and particularly noise nuisance, is kept to a minimum. That policy is well in place and it will be maintained by me. I hope that the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation will be able to make some worthwhile recommendations to me and to the Government. TASMANIA: ELECTRICITY SUPPLY",20
46,Mr BURR,AIRCRAFT NOISE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. Have any discussions been held with the Tasmanian Government regarding compensation or joint funding if the Tasmanian Government were to proceed with another power scheme to produce the same amount of electricity as that to be produced by the Gordon-below-Franklin scheme? If the Tasmanian Government were to decide on another scheme would the Commonwealth be prepared to offer financial assistance? If so, how much?",21
47,Mr SPEAKER,AIRCRAFT NOISE,The question is hypothetical and out of order. If the Minister wishes to answer it I will permit him to do so. Mr MCVEIGHThe answer to the first part of the question is no. The answer to the second part of the question is that it is hypothetical. NA,21

61,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I claim to have been misrepresented in a statement made by the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) last Thursday.,22
62,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"lf the honourable member wishes to make a personal explanation he may proceed. Dr THEOPHANOUSLast Thursday in the debate on the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the Minister for Health said: I was a little disturbed, if I may say so, by the fact honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) named an officer of my Department earlier of the recommendations in the progress report, that this officer's name is not mentioned. I am referring to Dr Webb, the head of the Victorian division. recommendation put forward by the Committee relating to Dr Webb. I was a little disturbed that the honourable member for Burke named that officer, who cannot defend himself in this House. Other officers will be criticised. I merely ask honourable members of this House to observe the necessary proprieties and courtesies about those people, to understand that they are civil servants by members of parliament as they cannot defend themselves. This suggests that I was guilty of a breach of propriety in relation to this matter. As I shall demonstrate, my comments were indeed supported by the report. In my remarks, I made two points: Firstly, that there was evidence of substantial inactivity in relation to fraud and overservicing by the Victorian office and that there was an atmosphere of refusing to believe that doctors would engage in this sort of thing. Secondly, I said that the Victorian Director of Health should be held prima facie responsible and should be asked to stand down until the inquiries of the police are completed. Both these points are directly supported by the report. I quote from page 49 of the report: Examination of these cases suggests there was an atmosphere in the Victorian office that certain activities of doctors should not be investigated thoroughly, for example where a doctor claimed that errors were unintentional (no matter how frequent). That supports the first point. Immediately afterwards, the report goes on to say: The Committee believes that, under the Department's decentralisation policy, Directors of the state offices must be held responsible for the performance of their staff, although this does not obviate the Director-General's overall responsibility. SECRETARIAT As you can see, Mr Speaker, this section, when read as a whole, does in fact refer to the Victorian Director of Health.",22

67,Mr MACPHEE,ORGANISA TION,"-For the and that they have to be defended information of honourable members, I present the texts of the following International Labour Organisation instruments adopted by the 67th Session of the International Labour Conference held in Geneva in June 1981: Convention No. 154 Collective Bargaining, 1981 Recommendation No. 163-Collective Bargaining, 1981 Convention No. 155-Occupational Safety and Health, 1981 Recommendation No. 164-0ccupational Safety and Health, 1981 Convention No. 156- Workers with Family Responsibilities, 1981 Recommendation No. 165-- Workers with Family Responsibilities, 1981 I seek leave to make a brief statement regarding these instruments. Leave granted.",22
68,Mr MACPHEE,ORGANISA TION,"Honourable members will be interested to learn that the six instruments have been referred to the appropriate Commonwealth and State authorities for examination and comment. Preliminary examination has indicated that there are difficulties within both Commonwealth and State jurisdictions in relation to all instruments. Ratification of the Conventions at this stage is therefore not possible. The question of what future action may be appropriate in relation to the six instruments will be considered by the joint Commonwealth-State consultative machinery on ILO Conventions and by the National Labour Consultative Council, through its Committee on International Affairs.",23
69,Mr HAWKE,ORGANISA TION,"by leave-I wish to make a few observations in regard to the issue covered by the statement by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee), that is, the question of ratification or non-ratification of Interntional Labour Organisation instruments. It has to be said at the outset that Australia's record in this regard is poor. There are more than 160 ILO conventions, as you are well aware, Mr Speaker, and Australia has ratified only 43. The record of this Government in particular is a very poor one and it certainly contrasts very badly with the record of the Labor Government in the period between 1972 and 1975. In 1972-75, the Labor Government ratified nine ILO conventions. Those conventions are: Convention No. 81 Labour Inspection. 1947 Convention No. 83 Labour Standards (NonMetropolitan Territories), 1947 Convention No. 86 Contracts of Employment (Indigenous Workers). 1947 Convention No. 87 Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise. 1948. That convention, you will appreciate from your own experience, Mr Speaker, is one of the foundation conventions of the ILO. Similarly, in that category, I mention also: Convention No. 98 Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining. 1949 Convention No. 100 Equal Remuneration. 1951 Convention No. III Discrimination (Employment and Occupation). 1958 Convention No. 131 Minimum Wage Fixing. 1970 Convention No. 137 Dock Work. 1973 That was a record in a very brief period of which I believe the Labor Government can be proud. Against that background, I remind the House that, in a period of seven years of this Government, we have seen the extraordinarily poor record of only one convention having been ratified, that is Convention 144, Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards), 1976. When we look at those facts we see that the Government has an appalling record which reflects very little credit on the Government. I hope that the Minister now in charge of this area will bring his best endeavours to bear to try to improve that record. I am sure that he would agree that it is not a good record to have ratified only one convention in seven years. I wish to refer briefly to the subject matters of the instruments that have been put before the House by the Minister and referred to in his statement because they are extremely important instruments, ones in respect of which I believe that the Government, in conjunction with the States, should use its best endeavours. I know about the discussion and the consultations that have to take place. But I hope that, given the intrinsic importance of the matters covered by the instruments, the Minister will undertake to try to facilitate the processes of ratification. Very briefly, I remind the House of the subject matters of the Convention. The first one, Convention No. 154, passed by the ILO Conference in 1981, deals with the promotion of collective bargaining. I suppose there is a certain",23
70,Mr NA BROWN,ORGANISA TION,-Irony.,23
71,Mr HAWKE,ORGANISA TION,"Irony, if the Minister likes to put it that way, or whatever word he believes is most appropriate. I would say to the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) that it is certainly not an inappropriate word. There is a certain irony that this instrument should be before this House on a day when, in a few hours time, the Government will bring in legislation to smash the possibility of any collective bargaining at all for 12 months. I refer to the provisions of the Convention passed by the ILO in June of last year. Convention No. 154 concerns the promotion of collective bargaining. It is said that this Convention is aimed at promoting free and voluntary collective bargaining. Article I of the Convention applies to all branches of economic activity. Sub-section 3 of Article I has its own very special irony in respect of the dabate to take place later today. Subparagraph 3 of Article I states: As regards-'the Public Service. special modalities of application . I ask honourable members to note the lovely language of these international bodies-of this Convention may be fixed by national laws or regulations or national practice. The particular modality of application for collective bargaining in the Public Service will be seen later in this House today and, as we understand it, the particular modality of application will be to deny the possibility of any bargaining whatsoever in the Public Service for a period of 12 months. But while there may appear to be some levity in the circumstances in which we refer to that Convention, [ hope that no honourable member would attach any levity at all to Convention No. ISS. [ believe that this is one of the most important conventions ever passed by a conference of the [LO. This Convention is headed 'Converting Conventional Occupational Safety and Health and the Working Environment'. On a totally non-partisan basis, [ put it to the Government and to the Minister that they really should bring their very best endeavours to bear to try to get the support of the States and give this Convention the support it needs. The Convention deals with a matter of fundamental importance in industry. [ have often had cause to mention, as the Minister knows-to his credit [ think he has made the comparison also-that much more time is spent in this country talking about industrial disputes and the time and production lost by industrial disputes than is ever talked about the time and lives lost in the area of industrial safety and industrial health. The statistics, such as they are, show that considerably more time and lives are lost in this country as a result of inadequate practices in the area of industrial safety and health. [ do not intend to take up the time of the House by going into the details of the Convention but it is appropriate that [ should go to the thrust of it in terms of showing the intrinsic merit of what the [LO is about, and the intrinsic importance in terms of the Australian experience for us to pick up the recommendations and the thrust of these conventions and their associated recommendations. Convention No. ISS dealing with this matter has its particular thrust, if we like, contained in Article 4, to which I refer briefly. It states: Each member shall, in the light of national conditions and practice, and in consultation with the most representative ganisations of employers and workers. formulate. implement and periodically review a coherent national policy on occupational safety, occupational health and working environment. The second part reads: The aim of the policy shall jury to health arising out of, linked with or occurring in the course of work, by minimising, so far as is reasonably able, the causes of hazards inherent in the working environment. The essential point made in that is the call for the implementation and periodic review of a coherent national policy on occupational safety, occupational health and the working environment. I think the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and any other member of the Government, including the Minister for Communications, who previously held this portfolio, would agree with me that one of the basic problems we have in this country is the absence of a coherent national policy. For constitutional reasons-- but not just constitutional reasons-we have a division of responsibility between the States and the Federal Government. Frankly, I believe there has not been the application of will on the part of the Federal Government to try, in consultation with the States and with persuasion, to bring about the situation where in this country we would have something which would at least approximate the stated objective of this convention-that is, a coherent national policy on occupational safety, occupational health in the working environment. One of the great problems we have is that because of the absence of anyone centre of power in this regard we could have the most shocking situations occurring in which manufacturers would be able to bring in and use in industry toxic substances which could not only endanger the immediate lives of people using them but also have dangers into the future in regard to unborn offspring without there being adequate protection in terms of prior inspection and certification of these materials. The matter is of such importance that [ think the Minister will appreciate that I am not trying to speak in partisan terms. I simply say that [ hope the Government will take the opportunity presented by Convention No. ISS to redouble its efforts, in consultation with the States, to see that we in this country can achieve, at the earliest possible time, the stated objective of that convention --a coherent national policy in these areas. [ would like to refer very briefly indeed to the final convention mentioned, which is Convention No. 156 dealing with workers with family responsibilities. The fact that I will not spend any time or- dealing with that convention should not be taken to mean that we do not attach importance to it. Mr Speaker, [ say to you and to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, who is sitting at the table, that if we had to pick one convention which has - as [ think it does - a be to prevent accidents and inpressing human relevance in this country and one practicwhich I believe we can get a bipartisan approach to and support for what is a real problem, it would be the convention dealing with occupational health and safety. I recommend that the Minister take whatever steps he can to try to get the agreement of the States towards the ratification of this convention and then take the practical steps in this country which will reflect in practice the ciples properly outlined in that convention.",23
72,Mr MACPHEE,ORGANISA TION," by leave-I have much pleasure in saying that I will endeavour to facilitate and expedite the process of consultation, as requested by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). The Government certainly shares his view on the matter of occupational safety and health. He pointed out that there are constitutional barriers in the way of Commonwealth action. Over recent years we have made efforts--I recall particularly efforts made during my three years as Minister for Productivity --to publish codes of safety and codes in relation to the working environment more generally which were for application in public sector employment and beyond. We worked also with the States to devise some model legislation which the States could implement. I think three of them did. Having said that, I think it is fair to say that there has been some inertia it certainly crosses party political lines and to some extent rests in certain bureaucratic circles. More recently, I should inform the House, the Ministers for labour met in Brisbane on 2 December. They agreed to extend and, if you like, to re-energise work being done by the Department of Labour Advisory Committee which is a committee of permanent heads of the various portfolios concerned with occupational health and safety. That Committee will now become much more active in terms of the co-ordination and stimulation of activity by the State governments which have the responsibility in this area. At the same time it was agreed that the chairman of that Department of Labour Advisory Committee who, in fact, for the time being is a permanent head in the Victorian Public Service, would be a member of the National Labour Advisory Council's Committee on Occupational Health and Safety. That committee is chaired by an assistant secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and, of course, has members of my Department and the Confederation of Australian Industry on it. It will be joined by the chairman of what is really the State committee on this area to ensure that there is maximum co-ordination in the preparation of policy and in the implementation of policy. That will go a very long way towards achieving the objectives which the honourable member has expounded. Certainly, I envisage that they will be looking at this Convention in particular. I again assure the House that this will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible because there is no doubt that the cost to Australia in prin- human terms and in economic terms of bad industrial health and safety is an horrendous one and totally unacceptable to a community which calls itself civilised. NA NA Report and Ministerial Statement",25
73,Mr NA BROWN,ON INSURANCE CONTRACTS,Diamond ValleyMinister for Communications) Pursuant to section 37 of the Law Reform Commission Act 1973 I present the Law Reform Commission's report on insurance contracts. I seek leave to make a statement concerning the report. Leave granted.,25
74,Mr NA BROWN,ON INSURANCE CONTRACTS,"The Government is grateful for this comprehensive report of the Law Reform Commission which recommends significant changes to the law of insurance contracts and the dealings by the public with insurance companies. These are matters within my own area of ministerial responsibility as well as within the area of responsibility of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). The reforms proposed by the Law Reform Commission embody several principles: The need for uniformity and modernisation, assurance of fair competition, promotion of informed choice, preservation of the concept of good faith, the need to avoid unfair burdens and the need to avoid catastrophic losses. Its ultimate objectives are the creation of a fairer insurance environment and the improved operation of the insurance market, both of which promote the interests of insurers and insureds. At the same time, the Law Reform Commission has given consideration to the need to balance the costs and benefits of reforms. Careful study is clearly required in respect of this report on insurance contracts. As nearly every recommendation of the report deals with the legal policy of the law of contract in relation to insurance I will be arranging for the officers of my Department to consider the report in detail. As the recommendations are also relevant to the Treasurer's responsibilities in the area of insurance his officers will similarly examine the report. An important part of the assessment process will be to consider the report against the background of the Government's general philosophy of avoiding undue government involvement in the affairs of the insurance industry. Appendix D of the report details the many industry and consumer organisations and private persons and State governments who made submissions on the Commission's initial views set out in a discussion paper published in 1978. Notwithstanding those submissions the Government will be consulting State governments, the insurance industry organisations and consumer organisations in developing its options in relation to the recommendations in the report. The Commission has experienced printing problems with this report and there are insufficient numbers of the report available at the present time for it to be distributed in the normal manner. The Commission will provide copies of the report to parliamentarians and the public as soon as they are available.",25
75,Mr JACOBI,ON INSURANCE CONTRACTS,"by leave-I would like to place on record my appreciation to the former Attorney-General, the Honourable Bob Ellicott, for approving this long overdue reference to the Law Reform Commission which has culminated in this much needed report. I made a full submission to the then Attorney in May 1976. It was as a consequence that he approved the reference on 9 September 1976. This is what he said in answer to my question: I have referred the question of inquiry into contracts to the Law Reform Commission. This is an area of the law that developed at a time when there was a complete freedom of contract. There has tended to be a degree of inequality between the insurer and the insured. I do not subscribe to the view that there are grave abuses evident in this area. At the same time, however, it is an area that needs consideration. He went on to say: The terms of reference will of insurance. They will exclude third party insurance and workers compensation because those are matters which are the I say at the outset that Professor David St Leger Kelly had the brief for this detailed report. I would like to quote three simple sentences from a newspaper report which [ think sum up the situation. The article stated: Mr Kelly said the commission wanted to 'repatriate' insurance law from English casebooks into 'an Australian state available to all Australian citizens.' 'Much of the basic law of insurance was developed 200 years ago in social and commercial conditions that are very ditTerent from those existing today,' he said. 'Insurance law just grew like Topsy.' The Australian Law Reform Commission's report on insurance contracts will be welcomed by all those who, like myself, have had to deal with numerous complaints from members of the public concerning the conduct of insurers in rejecting their claims, particularly on the grounds of mere technicality. There would be less need for reform of the law if all insurers were reputable. But all insurers are not in fact reputable. It is to control their conduct that reform of the law is long overdue. While we all welcome the completion of the Commission's report, [ personally may be forgiven a certain scepticism in relation to whether anything will come of the Commission's recommendations while the present Government is in power, although I must confess I have some confidence in the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown). The Government has an appalling record with respect to the implementation of the Law Reform Commission's reports, particularly in this area. The first report on insurance agents and brokers was rejected in part on the basis of the philosophy of deregulation. But the States have acted to regulate insurance brokers and we now have inconsistency, duplication, unnecessary expense and fragmentation --quite frankly, as the Acting Minister will concede, the law will shortly be a shambles-quite apart from the very anticompetitiveness which the Law Reform Commission's proposals were designed to avoid. As for the rest of the report dealing with the responsibility of agents and brokers, we will still have to await the decision of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). insurance Meanwhile, expensive litigation goes ahead on matters which the Law Reform Commission's proposals would have solved, particularly the vexed question of responsibility for receipt of premiums. Let me quote what was said by the Treasurer last week in connection with a ministerial statement on amendments to the Insurance Amendment Bill 1982. He said: relate particularly to contracts contracts of marine insurance, Premiums owing by brokers to insurers frequently involve substantial sums of money. If the financial strength of an insubject of specific contracts. surer is marginal the loss of those moneys could endanger its ability to meet its commitments to policy owners. Thus, paragraph (I) (d) concerns a judgment about balancing the objectives of protecting the basic interests of policy owners through appropriate prudential regulations against the need to limit the degree of interference in the efficient operation of the industry. It is of particular relevance that the restrictions incorporated in paragraph (I) (d), as proposed to be modified, have been developed in the light of strong concerns expressed by successive insurance commissioners about the large amounts of unpaid premiums due to insurers from brokers and the implications those amounts can have in assessing an insurer's financial strength. Somewhat comparable restrictions have been in force in the United Kingdom for many years. As mentioned, the paragraph has received the overwhelming support of insurance underwriters. Let me make a couple of simple observations. The proposed amendment is a clear case of where the Government has been steamrollered by big insurers. Clause 15 (I) (d) of the Insurance Amendment Bill is anti-competitive. It is utterly unnecessary to the insurance broking industry. The real solution to the problem of providing effective and efficient regulation is set out in the Law Reform Commission's recommendations on the regulation of brokers and agents. This measure is contained in the Bill which was presented to the Parliament by the shadow Attorney General. We are now awaiting a government decision. The Government should have and could have eliminated the problem by the simple constructive measure of requiring insurance moneys to be lodged and kept in separate accounts-not the messy procedure trumped up in this amendment. Frankly, I doubt that the Department of the Treasury has the capacity to assess the Law Reform Commission's proposals dealing with insurance. They are legal matters and not financial ones. The legal experts of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) would surely be better placed to advise the Government on these matters than the Treasury Department. Let me also remind honourable members opposite that the present report follows more than five years of consultation and discussion with the insurance industry. The report will, no doubt, indicate where there is conflict with the views of the industry. Let us hope that the Treasurer, quite apart from the Attorney-General, does not decide, as he did in the case of the first report, to go through the consultative process all over again. The Government has intimated that it will. God bless us! It is an utter waste of time. To be fair to the Treasurer, I suppose, it should be pointed out that he consulted only the industry-as the Government invariably does-and not the consumer organisations or representatives throughout the community. We are tired, as the Law Reform Commission itself must now be tired, of unnecessary duplication of consultation. We are tired also of the Treasurer bowing to the whims of the industry or any vocal part of it. He must remember that it is the Government's task to legislate, not to procrastinate. But the Treasurer, in the area of insurance, is governed by the very simple dictum: He is a conservative. I concede that. He believes in reform provided it changes nothing. Let us all hope that the Commission's draft legislation will not suffer the same fate as the amendments to the Insurance Act. Honourable members may believe it or not but the amendments were first proposed in 1978. They were introduced to the House this year. They now languish at the bottom of the Notice Paper because the Treasurer cannot make up his mind whether to listen to underwriters or brokers on the subject of outstanding premiums. Let the Commission's draft Bill be introduced quickly. Let it be debated frankly. Let reform be achieved, at least before the next federal election. Let me conclude by placing on record my appreciation to the staff and, in particular, Professor David St Leger Kelly for their years of painstaking investigation and consultation. Collectively, they produced this most important report whose recommendations must be placed on the statute book. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance Mr SPEAKER ··1I have received a letter from the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to honour its national and international obligation to protect the Franklin River in South West Tasmania. and its failure to offer Tasmania assist· ance to stimulate alternative employment. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",26
76,Mr WEST,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,"1 thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this very important matter. Today people who care about the environment are gathering in South West Tasmania to express a legitimate protest against the inactivity and the derogation of Federal responsibility by this Government on this very important matter. Let there be no mistake, this Government has shirked its national and international responsibilities. As a result of the Government's failure to intervene against the deplorable intransigence of the Tasmanian Government on this matter Australia is now held in contempt and has been and will be continually subject to world ridicule, because of the Federal Government's inactivity and its shirking of its Federal responsibility on this matter. There is a basic contradiction in the position of the Federal Government. Australia is a signatory to the world's Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. The Government has nominated South West Tasmania, of which the Franklin River is an integral part, for listing on the World Heritage List. Having done that, it has abrogated its responsibilities, and proceeds to allow the Tasmanian Government to dam the Franklin and the Gordon rivers to the extent of 36 kilometres along each flver. Last week the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr MCVeigh), who sits opposite, made a most incredible and facile attempt to explain to the House this Government's lack of action. I do not wish to dwell on the absurd distortions in the Minister's speech, but because it is so incredible, let me just repeat what was said. He stated: The Government does not intend to intervene in the construction of the (Franklin) Dam. He went on to refer to Fraser Cave: Whilst Fraser Cave and other caves of archaeological significance will be flooded by the dam, let me assure the House that every endeavour will be part of our heritage. Yes, that is incredible. He will both flood the cave and preserve the cave, which contains Aboriginal artifacts and relics going back 20,000 years! To justify that action he comes forward with the most dubious assertions that new archaeological procedures have been discovered that will somehow miraculously preserve that cave for our heritage. For that, he earned the contempt of some of the most leading archaeologists and the Australian Heritage Commission. Professor Mulvaney, a most eminent Australian prehistorian, had the following to say when he tendered his resignation last week from the Interim Council of the Museum of Australia: This must rank as one of the cultural and natural heritage of Australia. I had never expected what I had assumed to be an honourable government, for sheer political expediency. to act in the manner of vandals in total disregard of future generations of Australians. I inform the House of what was contained in the report of the Australian Heritage Commission tabled last week to establish once and for all what that organisation thinks about South West Tasmania as an integral part of our natural heritage. The report stated: The South West is one of tifically valuable areas of for future generations, and for the world as an outstanding example of the unique Australian environment. Representative examples of each of our various ecosystems should be preserved. South West Tasmania represents a distinct land form. with a wide range of plant communities South West region comprises the last great temperate wilderness remaining in Australia, the world. It is substantially 83 per cent of Tasmania's wilderness area. This is not from the Tasmanian Wilderness Society or the Australian Conservation Foundation; it is from the Australian Heritage Commission, in a report made to this Parliament. The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment did not even speak to this report last week when he dropped it on the table of this House. The document from the Commission, which is signed by the Chairman, Kenneth Wiltshire, addresses the Minister thus: The Commission seeks your urgent support and action to protect the Western Tasmania wilderness National Parks. We request that this report Parliament It should have been considered and debated by the Parliament. What is the position now'? Today, in Paris, a meeting of the World Heritage Committee is being asked by this Government to consider this priceless area, under the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation's Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, for inmade to preserve this important clusion in the World Heritage List. This, despite the failure of the Government itself to take action to protect the area. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party and the incoming Federal Labor Government, I say to that meeting in Paris that we urgently request it to list the area. We say that although this Government has shirked its responsibilities as a national government, an Australian Labor government will not do so. The responsibility, and the power, exists to protect this area. We are a signatory to that Convention and, as a nation, have nominated the area for inclusion in the World Heritage List. Let me establish, then, the responsibility which is outlined in the report of the Attorney-General's Department to the Minister. The report states that under the darkest days in the history of Article 4 of the Convention, to which we are a signatory, parties are obliged to the utmost of their own resources and, where appropriate, with international assistance and co-operation, in particular financial, to take all steps necessary to protect the area. Under Article 5, we agree to take the appropriate legal, scientific, technical, administrative and financial measures necessary for the protection of this area that we have so nominated. So the moral obligation exists. It is only necessary in this area to point out further what the Attorneythe most impressive. most scienAustralia and should be preserved General's Department said to this Government: As outlined above. the Commonwealth has substantial constitutional powers that could be used to preserve South-West Tasmania. Any decision not to intervene must therefore be based on political grounds, not on constitutional impediment. The So the Attorney-General says that the Commonand one of the last remaining in unmodified by man. and contains wealth has the responsibility and the power. I will not dwell on what those constitutional powers are, as outlined, but they involve the trade and commerce powers, the power to make grants to States under section 96, the implied or inherent power now established in the High Court which allows the Federal Government of Australia to do all those things necessary in a national sense which State governments, acting either on their own or in concert, are not able to do, and the external affairs power under section 51. As I have said, all of these powers exist. However, on grounds of political expediency, the Government has chosen not to use them. It has chosen not to be tahled in intervene. The Government says to UNESCO that South West Tasmania is a vital part of the world's herigate and should be listed as such on the World Heritage List but, on the other hand, because it will not use these undoubted constitutional powers as outlined by the Attorney General's Department against the Government of Tasmania to protect the area, it is saying that it is not worthy of preservation. They are the horns of the dilemma on which this Government is now impaled and for which it will never be forgiven by environmentalists throughout Australia. Why is it doing this? The Government justifies its lack of action on the altar of State rights. That is most peculiar, as many back benchers know-particularly those from Queensland-because the Government did not take that view with respect to Fraser Island. It took the view that it was essential that Fraser Island be preserved from the depredations of sand mining.",27
77,Mr COHEN,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,-lt is far more important than Fraser Island.,29
78,Mr WEST,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,"That is right. The honourable member for Robertson, who will speak in a minute, says that this area is even more important than Fraser Island to our natural and world heritage and although Fraser Island is important he is right. This Government says that if the BjelkePetersen Government in Queensland wished to drill for oil along the coast in areas covered by the Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act it would invoke the provisions of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act to declare the area a national marine park and so protect it. Of course, that would be justified, just as this Government was justified in refusing to grant the continuation of export licences in respect of Fraser Island. The point is that this Government did not allow the State rights argument to impede what it should have done then, but it is allowing it to impede its proper responsibility now. Why? Obviously the reason is again political. The political reason is that, having misled the electors of Flinders by allowing them to believe that the Government would really act, it now judges that the time is appropriate to act in the interests of saving itself five seats in Tasmania. In that political exercise it has again reaped the contempt of all in Australia who care about the preservation of the environment. But I wonder whether everyone in the Government takes that view. I have established that the case exists, that the responsibility exists and that Federal power exists. Yet this Government will not act. Labor will, because there is a clear national and international obligation to act. If there is an obligation on Labor to save South West Tasmania, as indeed there is, there is an obligation also on all who argue for that, including the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Tasmanian Wilderness Society and 2,000 environmental and conservation organisations throughout Australia, to support the Australian Labor Party federally at the next election and to campaign against this Government and for the return of a Federal Labor government, because we are the only people who have the demonstrated capacity and the will to save the Franklin River. In the remaining minutes available to me I want to expound on the economic arguments against the dam and in favour of alternative employment generation. Certainly before $1 billion is spent to provide 180 megawatts of power the justification has to be established, especially when an irreplaceable area would be destroyed in the process. Surely the criteria must be: Is the power needed? Are alternatives available? How many permanent jobs would be created? Could the precious capital be directed elsewhere to create more permanent employment? The Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania recently found that no decision need be taken for three years. That Committee was given a great deal of evidence from expert opinion that after three years it would still be possible to take a decision on an alternative power scheme which would fulfil Tasmania's demands until the year 2000 and still allow time to construct it. Those alternatives obviously are to some extent: Thermal power, an alternative hydro scheme such as a scheme on the King or Anthony and Henty rivers and possibly a cable to deliver power from Victoria. How many jobs are involved? There will be an average of 600 during the construction period with a peak of 900, but finally only 30 permanent jobs. We support capital works to ameliorate unemployment, but they have to be economic in their own right. Tasmania has 10 per cent unemployment, but in my electorate of Cunningham unemployment is 20 per cent. Yet I do not advocate that we construct a replica of the Great Pyramid of Cheops or something stupid like that simply as a capital work to provide jobs. Such projects have to be economically useful in their own right, and then we will support them. This project is not economic. It is sopping up precious capital-last year 60 per cent of all Tasmanian loan funds, 94 per cent of State semi-government funds and 95 per cent of the special infrastructure program. Only 7 per cent of total Government capital funds went to housing and 7 per cent to construction. What is the sense in that when there is no obvious need for the power to be produced from the Franklin scheme? We say that the Australian Labor Party will offer a special financial package of assistance to Tasmania for alternative power generation. We will if the need is established, ensure that federal payments to Tasmania do not fall in real and total terms, the Australian Labor Party will co-operate with the Tasmanian Government and the proposed Tasmanian development corporation to set up and to finance a south west Tasmanian management authority and give it financial and managerial assistance. We will examine new projects, meaningful and economic public works, that will generate real permanent jobs in Tasmania. Real job creation is what is required, not the illusion that large numbers of permanent jobs will be created by the destructive Franklin project.",29
79,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,Mr Millar) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,30
80,Mr MCVEIGH,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,"Darling Downs-Minister for Home Affairs and Environment) (I 1.41) The Opposition, in the second part of its matter of public importance, alleged that the Government has failed to offer Tasmania assistance to stimulate alternative employment. I propose to lay that allegation at rest now. I simply say that last week the Premier of Tasmania, the Honourable Robin Gray, met with the Commonwealth Government to discuss measures to stimulate employment. Those discussions are continuing. In order to deal with the first part of this matter ance one would have to consider every point of the Government's decision in more detail than time would permit this morning. One must look at the role played by the Tasmanian Government in reaching the decision to construct the dam. The initial decision, which was made by the Lowe Labor Government, was supported by the State Opposition. The State election in Tasmania earlier this year showed that both major political parties campaigned vigorously in favour of the construction of the dam and between them commanded 85 per cent of the vote. The 'no dam' candidates polled poorly. Throughout that State election campaign the Tasmanian people were led to believe that the dam issue was a State matter and that they were electing a government to resolve the matter finally. If the 'no dam' issue had support at that time from the Federal Labor Party, that party had a full opportunity to intervene and to seek a policy change within its Tasmanian branch. The Federal Labor Party did nothing; it ran way. Clearly at that time it was willing to port its State colleagues in pro-dam advocacy. The Federal Labor Party, no longer gagged by its State counterpart because it was no longer in government -- it got rolled-started to champion the cause of the environmentalists and the conservationists. Quite frankly its eleventh hour show of support for the 'no dam' cause is one of the worse examples of political grandstanding and opportunism. It borders on sheer hypocrisy. The Federal Labor Party now hopes to rally the 'no dam' conservation vote against the Federal Government in mainland seats. It will be interesting to note its stance in the five Federal Tasmanian seats. Let the Opposition now state its policy for those five seats. Let us hear what its stand will be on the dam issue. The Federal Labor Party is in the happy situation of not having to back its words with actions. One might ask the Opposition spokesman on the environment, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), how the Labor Party would intervene on the issue of the dam. Do the utterances of the honourable member for Cunningham mean that the Federal Labor Party is moving back to the centralist policies of the Whitlam era? If so, the electorate should be told about the policies that would be adopted if a Federal Labor government were formed. Under our Constitution the States primarily have responsibility for land use and land management decisions. This was an important factor which the Federal Government took into consideration when making its decision on this issue of public importof the dam. The Government is conscious of its national and international obligations. This was conveyed in the announcement I made in this House last Wednesday. It is opportune for me to repeat the essential aspects of that announcement. It is the Government's wish that western Tasmanian wilderness national parks be inscribed in the World Heritage List. The Government has provided to the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee additional information sought by it on the nomination. The Government has indicated to the World Heritage Committee that the Tasmanian Government is conslructing a hydro-electric power scheme in the nominated area and that the Commonwealth has been and is discussing the scheme with the Tasmanian Government with a view to minimising damage caused by the dam and associated construction activities. The World Heritage Commitee is currently meeting in Paris. I would expect a decision on the listing to be known early tomorrow morning. The Governsupment stands by its commitment to provide financial and other assistance in the establishment and management of a national park of world significance which includes a substantial wilderness component. The final decision of the Government took careful account of all the many and complex matters involved, weighing and balancing them and finally making a judgment on the grounds of perceived overall public interest and responsibility. The Government recognises that the demands of conservation must be balanced with those of development, and sometimes decisions must be taken which might not be universally popular. In this case, the controversy is between the responsibility of the State of Tasmania, as expressed through legislation and executive decisions of its Government, and the important responsibility of the Commonwealth under the World Heritage Convention. The Government has been accused of hypocrisy, but that is a very hollow charge. The World Heritage Committee has been given the situation quite plainly, definitely and honestly.",30
81,Unknown,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,Opposition members interjecting,31
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,"Mr MiIlar)Order! The honourable member for Cunningham has had an opportunity to address the House. I ask him now to contain himself. Mr MCVEIGH As I said, there has not been any dissembling of our position. The Government has given assurances of financial and other assistances for the establishment and management of a national park of world significance in South West Tasmania. Only a relatively small part of the total area will be affected by the dam and construction works. I believe that, through discussion with the Tasmanian Government and with the best advice available to each government, the effects of the hydro-electric scheme will be minimised. In respect of the cultural heritage value of the area, I have asked the Australian Heritage Commission to develop a plan to obtain as much information on the cultural significance of the area as possible. The Heritage Commission has also been asked that any program of work considered necessary by the Commission in its development of the plan should take into account any likely Aboriginal concerns. The Shadow Minister-the honourable member for Cunningham-for his own purposes, has stretched the words that I used in my statement on the preservation of the cultural heritage of Fraser and other caves. Of course, any person with any degree of intelligence would see that I had in mind detailed survey and investigation of the cultural significance of the area and appropriate archaeological activities to record the archaeological information in these caves. Thus the Commonwealth is seeking to minimise any damage to the heritage value of the region. These actions are quite consistent with its wishes to have this region inscribed on the World Heritage List. Under our federalist constitutional system, the Commonwealth will fulfil to the maximum extent proper those obligations that it has under the World Heritage Convention. The obligations require that each party to the Convention shall endeavour to take measures for protection and conservation of its cultural and natural heritage insofar as possible -- and these words are particularly important and as appropriate for each country. We believe that these obligations do not require the Commonwealth to take measures at all costs regardless of any other considerations appropriate to our Federal system of government. There have been claims that the Government has powers and should use them to intervene to prevent the construction of the dam. It is the Government's contention that the mere existence of potential legal powers is not in itself a reason demanding Commonwealth action on any particular issue. In accordance with the Government's federalism policy, certain responsibilities, traditionally and properly, reside with the States, although generally they are ar.proached on a cooperative basis. It has been suggested that possible legal action might be taken by those opposed to the decision. That is a matter for those concerned. The Government's position cannot be speculated on ahead of such action. Suggestions of possible violence, too, are of concern. As I stated previously, confrontations between the Commonwealth and the States and between individuals in the community are not the road to prosperity, development or the conservation of our heritage. The Government has made a responsible decision and it would hope that it will be accepted with responsibility. Calls for people physically to resist development and promote violent confrontation cannot be condoned and will not be condoned. Let me restate some of the facts. It is interesting to note that Professor Mulvaney agrees with these facts. Only 1.7 per cent of the area nominated to the World Heritage Committee will be affected by the hydro-electric scheme. That is non-debatable. That is a fact. Responsibilities under the World Heritage Convention will be carefully considered in conjunction with the Tasmanian Government during the formulation of a suitable management plan for the area. The hydro-electric scheme will take at least 10 years to complete and during this period work can be undertaken to study and preserve archaeological material. The Australian Heritage Commission has the responsibility for advising the Government on matters relating to the national estate, including identification and preservation of places associated with the history, culture or beliefs of Aborigines. It has been asked to advise on a program to identify and preserve the maximum information and material on this matter. This Government has a record it can be proud of on conservation matters. I will list them: We have banned whaling in Australia and supported strongly the international ban on whaling which has been instituted by the International Whaling Commission; we have established Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory which has been inscribed on the World Heritage List in recognition of the universal value of its cultural and natural heritage; we have developed, in conjunction with the Northern Territory Government, a plan of management for Uluru (Ayers Rock) National Park. Honourable members will recall that this plan of management was tabled in this House recently. The Government has proclaimed the Capricornia, Cairns and Cormorant pass sections of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and has recently committed itself to an accelerated program of declaration and zoning of further sections of the marine park; the Government has recognised the world conservation strategy and is in close co-operation with the States and the Northern Territory developing a national conservation strategy for Australia which aims at providing for living resource conservation in sustainable developments; the Government has introduced the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill, which has been passed by this House and is currently before the Senate and has been there since August. The aim of the Bill is to consolidate the range of regulations and ordinances presently used to control Australia's international wildlife trade and will allow Australia to implement more effectively the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild flora and faunathat is, CITESother international agreements and the long standing controls on the export of Australian species. We have established the world wildlife fund in Australia and we have recently launched the national tree program. Our record is a good one and we are prepared to stand on our record. The Opposition's matter of public importance must fail. Its new found interest do neither it, nor any of its members any good. Its views do not reflect, I suggest, those of its Tasmanian members, nor of this House. For the information of the House, I would like to read from a speech delivered by the Leader of the Tasmanian Labor Party, the Honourable Ken Wriedt, in the Tasmanian Parliament in June when the Parliament was debating the dams issue. He stated: We That IS, the Australian Labor Party of Tasmaniasupport the legislation and the Tasmanian people have spoken very clearly in my view. That is the view of former Senator Wriedt a former federal colleague who is now the Leader of the Labor Party in Tasmania. He continued: My reading of the election results is that they want this dam and I believe this Parliament is obliged to accept that decision. That is a slightly different view from that held by the Labor Party people here, the Johnny-comelatelys on the issue. They did not say anything previously as to the position with their colleagues in the Tasmanian Parliament. The Tasmanian members of the Labor Party fully supported this legislation to build the dams. In the records of Hansard in that State is recorded the name of every member of the Australian Labor Party in the Tasmanian Parliament who supports the construction of this dam. The Government does not believe that the Opposition has established a case as outlined in the terms of this matter of public importance. I want to deal very briefly with a couple of the other matters raised by the shadow Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. He has taken great notice of a statement on archaeological matters raised by Professor Mulvaney recently. I believe it is appropriate to remind the House that Professor Mulvaney agrees that there are methods of taking casts, in plaster or latex, out of the surface of ancient camping floors within the caves, preserving a complete record of the distribution of cooking hearths, stone tools and bones, et cetera. For the information of the House, I point out that this has been done successfully at the site at Fontainebleau in France, just outside Paris. Professor Mulvaney knows of the existence of that technique. It is therefore wrong for people to say that in 10 years we cannot do something about preserving these archaeological projects, just as they have been preserved in the modern city of York, which was built above a Viking settlement.",31
83,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,Mr MiIlar)Order! The honourable member's time has in the subject will expired.,32
84,Mr COHEN,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA," The decision of the Fraser Government not to use its powers to intervene to stop the flooding of the Franklin and Gordon rivers by the Tasmanian Government will undoubtedly go down in history as the worse environmental decision made by any government in the world in modern times. I heard the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr MCVeigh) say that only one per cent of the area will be affected. That is like someone saying: 'We are going to cut out only one per cent of you, but unfortunately it will be your heart'. There is no need to sing the praises of South West Tasmania. The Government has indicated how it values South West Tasmania as an environmental asset by nominating it as the fourth area in Australia to be placed on the World Heritage List. By its own admission South West Tasmania now ranks alongside the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu National Park and Willandra Lakes as our greatest assets. Yet, on the grounds of States' rights, the Government has abdicated its responsibility by allowing the Tasmanian Government to proceed with this grotesque act of environmental vandalism. I am sure that I speak for the majority of Australians when I say that I am becoming heartily sick of those State politicians and the politicians in this place who scream about States' rights every time they want to do something with which the rest of Australia disagrees. There is no doubt that whatever the majority of Tasmanians believeI concede that the majority, albeit narrowly, want the dam to proceed-the overwhelming majority of Australians are totally opposed to this awful vandalism. I have nothing against parochialism by politicians. Every politician worth his salt comes to Canberra to represent the constituents who elected him. A politician who did not represent his electorate's views would be recreant in his duty. But there comes a point when national interest takes precedence over parochial and State interests. I would have hoped that all honourable members would place Australia first and the interests of their own electorates and their own States second and third. I would have hoped that the Fraser Government would show the same courage over the Franklin and Gordon rivers as it showed over Fraser Island. Perhaps if the Franklin River were renamed the Fraser River, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) would have acted to protect his own immortality. We are all aware that this has not been a matter where the battle lines have been drawn on normal political affiliations. The Tasmanian branch of the Australian Labor Party was deeply divided on this issue and the result was the resignation of one of Tasmania's most talented Premiers and the defeat of the party at this year's election. There has been a ferocious debate in the Labor Party during the past three years which has resulted in an annual conference endorsing a view that many of us have held since this debate started, so honourable members opposite should not accuse me or the shadow Minister for Home Affairs and Environment of being inconsistent because our views have been consistent for a long time. The divisions in the Labor Party are mirrored in the Liberal and National parties and all of us are aware that many Liberal-National Party politicians are strongly opposed to the damming of the Franklin and Gordon rivers. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) has expressed strong views in opposition, as have the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) and others. Now they must make a choice and take a stand. I believe the Government would secretly welcome such a stand. The Minister was rolled in Cabinet. He went down fighting with the platypus. The Minister is one of the last of the endangered species. Sir Les Patterson is alive and well! I suspect the Cabinet's only reason for not intervening was the fear that Premier Gray and his colleagues would have gone ape over Federal interference. If sufficient Government members support the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill 1982 which is now in the Senate, it would be possible for the dam to be stopped and for the Government to get off the hook. One of the arguments used by the pro-dam lobby is that those who oppose the dam are middle-class trendies who, having gained economic security for themselves, care nothing for those workers who will lose employment if the project does not proceed. There may be an element of truth in that. I know from my experience as shadow Minister for the environment, prior to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), that I occasionally found myself at odds with the conservation movement when I believed it had over-reacted on some particular project. In one instance I suspect that it cost me very dearly. However, in the case of the South West there is no dispute on the environmental significance of the region. The major argument against the dam is the economic argument. I am indebted to my colleague the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) for the persuasive case he put together against the dam by pointing out in his submission to the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania that Tasmania now has the highest consumption of electricity in the world, coupled with a continually declining industrial base. The honourable member stated in his submission that four common myths were repeated regularly in letters to the editor and by Tasmanian spokesmen. His submission stated: (I) That Tasmania has a chronic shortage of electricity. (2) That Tasmania's per capita electricity usage was lower than that of the mainland States, (3) That it is axiomatic that the number of jobs in manufacturing industry is dependent on the availability of electricity and (4) That Tasmanian economic prospects v.ere completely dependent on increased volume of electricity. The honourable member pointed out that these four myths could hardly be further from the truth. He stated: Tasmanians use electricity per capita at a rate which is more than three times that of New South Wales. four times that of Victoria and five times that of Western Australia. In international comparisons, Tasmanian electricity usage per capita is twice that of the United States. three and times that of West Germany and nearly five times that of France. He demonstrated that as Tasmania's generation of electricity has increased its manufacturing sector has declined. In 1947 Tasmania generated 172,500 kilowatts of electricity and by 1980 this had grown to 1,780,000, an increase of over 1,000 per cent. During that same period its manufacturing base declined from a peak of 23.04 per cent in 1966 to 16.05 per cent in 1976 and approximately 14 per cent in 1981. It may well be that it would have declined even further if it had not been for the fact that Tasmania has the cheapest electricity in the world. However, what the honourable member for Lalor was really saying to all those who believe that cheap electricity is the answer to Tasmania's problems is that they are simply not watching what is happening around the world. There is a decline in the manufacturing sector and it will continue to decline. With the increase and improvement in technology the manufacturing sector is going to decline everywhere, not only in Tasmania. The areas where growth is occurring are the service area, the communications area, and the recreation and tourism areas. The damming of the river is not really about the manufacturing sector of Tasmania; it is really about the 1,200 jobs involved in the construction of the dam. When I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation the Committee went to Tasmania and spent two or three days in the Franklin River area. Committee members talked to the Hydro-Electric Commission people. We said to them: 'What are you going to do after you have finished the dam?' They kept saying: 'There are 1,200 jobs involved in this for 10 years'. We said: 'What are you going to do afterwards?' They said: 'We will worry about that afterwards'. This matter is really about the construction of the dam. The HEC knows nothing else but to go on building dams instead of facing the fact---what is it going to do in 10 years' time? Is it going to keep on damming? Tasmanian will be one bloody great lake and dams will still be built. Jobs will still have to be found for people then. This dam will provide 27 permanent jobs. Tasmania's future lies in the areas of tourism and recreation. I am an unabashed Tasmaniaphile. I think it is one of the most beautiful areas in the world and certainly the most beautiful State in Australia. I go there as often as I can. One of its great charms is its lack of development. Because there has not been a lot of development, we still have many of the old buildings for the a half environment that existed 100 years ago. I refer to Hobart, Launceston, Richmond and New Norfolk. That is its great charm. That is why it will continue to be an area which will attract thousands of tourists. If a fraction of the money over $1 ,000m-now being spent on this dam was to be spent on the type of tourist development that is occurring in Australia and other parts of the world, Tasmania would have no problems about employment. Those same dam workers could be employed on that type of construction. I mention for example, the Yulara Village at Ayers Rock, which is a classic example where the Northern Territory Government and the Australian Government are spending many millions of dollars to create a village for 2,000 people. Time does not allow me to expand on this subject. I conclude by saying that that is the area in which Tasmania's future lies. Finally, I pay tribute to those people who have fought this fight and will continue to do so. I have not met a finer Australian than Dr Bob Brown, a very wonderful human being who has fought this fight with courtesy, politeness and common sense. I wish him, Peter Thompson and all the others who are involved in the blockade, all the best in the fight that is ahead.",32
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,"Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. MrGROOM (Braddon) (12.6)-Asoneofthe Tasmanian members in this place I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. I make it very clear that Tasmanians see this as a Tasmanian issue and that mainlanders should keep out of it. We do have a federation. States have certain responsibilities and the Federal Government here in Canberra has certain responsibilities. Honourable members opposite believe that all wisdom resides in Canberra, that Canberra can do no wrong and Canberra knows best. Sometimes mistakes are made in Canberra. Sometimes judgments which are made here in Canberra are wrong. The issue has been decided by the Tasmanian people. If honourable members believe that the issue has not been looked at carefully by the Tasmanian people, they have not considered the facts. We have had this debate in Tasmania for about four years. We have heard both sides of the argument. Mainlanders have heard only one side of the story from the so-called Tasmanian Wilderness Society, which is essentially mainland-based and which has come to the mainland and spent all of its money on a very expensive campaign. Recently on Nationwide the Treasurer of the Wilderness Society said that its financial turnover for the last 12 months was half a million dollars. The Wilderness Society is really an industry. Its Treasurer admitted that. She said: 'This is an industry, and it is an industry here to stay'. I suggest to honourable members from the mainland that they should not be conned by the Wilderness Society or by the emotion which has been generated. They should consider the facts. Ordinary Tasmanians-the ordinary working men and women of Tasmania--know that the dam is the best option for Tasmania; that hydroelectric power is the best option for Tasmania. In the referendum 64.5 per cent of Tasmanians clearly indicated that they wanted one or other of the two dam options proposed in that referendum. We then had the State election. Honourable members opposite are saying that the matter has never been considered by the Tasmanian people but they should remember the State election. Members of the Wilderness Society, Dr Bob Brown-who is praised by honourable members opposite-and the Australian Democrats said: 'We will hold the balance of power. This election is fought on the dams issue. This is the main issue. After the election there will be no dam because we will hold the balance of power'. What happened in that election? The opponents of the dam were totally destroyed. Dr Bob Brown himself, who is a mainlander and an aspiring politician, stood in that election for the seat of Denison. One would have thought that the leader of this campaign would have won a seat, but he failed to do so. He was rejected by the Tasmanian people on his no-dam stance. As has been mentioned, members of the Australian Labor Party in Tasmania support the dam. Mr MCVeigh---And voted for it.",34
86,Mr GROOM,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,"They voted for it, as the Minister said. The Liberal Party in Tasmania-now the Government-supports the dam. There is no doubt that a majority of Tasmanians support the dam. They know the facts. They know the area. They know the needs of Tasmania. They know the aspirations of Tasmanians. A person needs to have an appreciation of Tasmania, its history and its problems, to understand what this issue is all about. People say we do not need more power in Tasmania. What utter nonsense! Of course we will need more power in Tasmania. I ask honourable members to tell me one State which will not need more power in the future. Every State will need more power in the future. Therefore, the only question to be considered is where we get this power from. Do we have nuclear power?",35
87,Mr HODGMAN,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,-That is what Labor wants.,35
88,Mr GROOM,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,"I do not know. Maybe the Labor Party does. Nuclear power has been suggested. Do we have a coal-fired thermal station or an oil-fired thermal station? The problem is that we do not have oil in Tasmania or enough coal of the right quality in Tasmania. Therefore, the coal or the oil would have to be imported. How would we get it into Tasmania?",35
89,Mr LUSHER,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,- You haven't got too many wild rivers either.,35
90,Mr GROOM,SOUTH WEST TASMANIA,"-- We have II wild rivers. I ask the honourable member a question: Where is the Arthur River, which is the biggest, best, most wild and remote river in Tasmania? I have asked many conservationists, such as the honourable member for Hume, what they think of the Arthur River. They have not got a clue where it is and they do not know anything about it. There are II wild rivers, apart from the Franklin, of more than 50 kilometres in length in Tasmania. How many people know that the Lyell Highway has a bridge crossing the Franklin and that there has been a flying fox over the river since 1957? It is all very well for people to sit back in their armchairs in Sydney and Melbourne and say, 'no dam'. If people do not know all the facts of course they will say, 'no dam'. Who would want to dam an attractive river? There is a need for power in Tasmania. There is a need for jobs in Tasmania. We have the highest rate of unemployment in Australia. Are we not entitled to some development in Tasmania? The Australian Labor Party will realise in due course that it has made a grave mistake in the stand it has taken. It will find that there will be five Liberal members of parliament following the next election. Probably there will be one less Labor Party member of parliament because of the realisation in Tasmania that hydro-electric power is the best for Tasmania and Tasmanians. The situation is nothing like that of Fraser Island where the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act had a direct application because the Commonwealth has the power over the export of minerals. It is quite a different situation. It is very different from that of the Kakadu National Park which was Commonwealth territory at the time. It is a totally different situation. Here we are dealing with water and land resources within the State boundary. Some honourable members are saying that Canberra should stand on the Tasmanian Government and the people of Tasmania and tell them how to run their own affairs and how to manage their own land and water resources. I suggest that honourable members have not thought the issue through. What would happen if the Government in Canberra said, 'We will stop the dam; we will make 2,500 men and women lose their jobs as a result of our decision; we will take over almost a quarter of the State of Tasmania and run it'? That would cause the biggest battle since Federation. Tasmanians do not mind being left off the map every now and then, which sometimes happens. However, we will not be trodden on by people on matters within our own responsibilities. This is something we must manage ourselves and we will do so. We have heard praise for conservationists, such as Dr Bob Brown, from honourable members opposite. He is leading a bunch of stirrers. I am sorry to say this because many genuine people are involved in this issue. It is a sensitive issue. Radical conservationists have set up a big camp with big signs up the Gordon River towards Warners Landing. They are out to cause trouble. They are stirrers and radicals. Among them are some decent people, but there are also stirrers. Most of them are students. Most of the people who go down the Franklin River on their rafts --some of them get into trouble are students. Maybe some of them are teachers. If honourable members opposite look at the desires of the ordinary Tasmanian people--the workers; not the dreamers, but the people who do things in Tasmania and around Australiathey will see that they realise what is best. They do not have time to spend a month going down the Franklin River and up the Gordon River. They do not have the time to get on Morrison's boat to go up to Strahan; they are working hard. Members of the Australian Labor Party, with their attitude, have let them down. They have been conned by a few intellectuals and academics. I do not rubbish them all. When was the Fraser Cave found and its scientific importance recognised? Only a year or two ago. If these people, with their zeal, spent the same time visiting where most of the Tasmanian Aborigines lived-- that is, on the north-west coast and down the midlands on the east coast-they would find much more significant evidence of Aboriginal settlement in Tasmania, but they have concentrated on the Franklin River because it is a political issue. Those people are grandstanding. This is a philosophical issue. Most of the people involved--not all of them; there are some decent people among them are against development. That is the issue. They are using the Franklin River as a vehicle and as a weapon to fight development.",35

93,Mr HURFORD,COMMONWEAL TH PARLIAMENTARY,"-by leave present an interim report of the Commonwealth of Australia Branch Delegation to the Twentyeighth Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference, held in the Bahamas in October 1982, and seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted. operating facilities from a large Mr HURFORDThis is a report of the Chairman, not the members, of the delegation. However, as deputy leader of the delegation, I am happy to put my imprimatur on it. Some of the issues dealt with in this interim report need to be brought to the attention of the House and, for people of Australia through it, to others. That should not await the autumn session as it would then be late February or early March before a report would be presented to the House. The Australian Parliament's delegation was service to meet the needs of instructed to raise a number of issues before the annual conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The main issue that affected this Parliament was its total under-representation on the executive of the CPA. It is a fact that this Parliament is a major contributor to the CPA, yet is it able to get a member on the Executive, via the region to which we belong, only every 21 to 27 years whereas the other major contributors to the CPA, such as the United Kingdom and Canada, have virtually permanent representation. The United Kingdom has a permanent representative in the Treasurer and indeed on many occasions has a second representative on the executive. Canada's national parliament is given represenatation continuously by its region. So we could go on in regard to the major contributors, but not Australia. It is my view that there is need for a far greater study of the CPA's method of working than has taken place hitherto. The delegation was instructed to raise these and other administrative matters at the conference, which we did most vigorously. Frankly, I think the CPA has become ossified and needs a good shake up. This problem of Australia's representation, as I have indicated, is only one of many problems. I believe that the work of this Parliament's delegation at the Twenty-eighth Conference in the Bahamas will achieve our purpose. In short, our work resulted in the setting up of a study group on the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and its future. Details of the terms of reference of the study group are set out in the report from page 4. We hope that our Speaker will be elected to the study group by our region because vigorous representations by this national parliament are needed for the proper changes to be recommended to the next conference, and the following conference, of the CPA. In short, we are proud of what we achieved. I congratulate Senator Don Jessop, the leader of the delegation, on the way in which he led it. It was a very happy delegation. I thank him for his references to me in the report. I endorse much of what he said in his acknowledgments at the end of the report as to the help we were given, for instance, by the Clerk of this House, Mr Blake, as secretary of the delegation. There are many other acknowledgments in the report which I draw to the attention of members of this House. I am happy to support the presentation by Senator Don Jessop of this interim report to the Parliament. NA NA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",39
94,Mr FIFE,INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT,"Farrer Minister for Aviation and Acting Minister for Transport and Construction) (12.24) - - I move: That. in accordance ""'ith the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969. it is expedient to carry following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Redevelopment of Brisbane International Airport Remainder of works of phase I Domestic passenger terminal and Department of Aviation hanger. The proposal involves the construction of the domestic passenger terminal building and a hanger for the Department of Aviation. This proposal was reported on by the Public Works Committee in August of this year as part of the total of the remainder of works for phase I of the redevelopment of the Brisbane International Airport. The Committee at that time recommended further examination of the passenger terminal building when issues relating to operation had been resolved. Re-appraisal of the need and the design of the proposed Department of Aviation hanger was also recommended. These matters have been resolved and the Committee has now recommended that construction of these works proceed subject to modifications to the terminal building's central satellite and its associated elevated walkway. This change will be incorporated in the design. The estimated cost of the work is $44m at January 1982 prices. If the House agrees to support this motion, detailed planning and design can proceed in accordance with the Committee's recommendation. Question resolved in the affirmative.

95,Mr SINCLAIR,ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"- - I seek leave to mak- a short statement to this House in answer to the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence entitled Threats to Australia's Security-Their Nature and Probability', presented to this Parliament in 1981. Leave granted. Mr SINCLAIR As my predecessor advised honourable members on 29 April this year, the discussion in this report makes a very useful contribution to the defence debate. The Government is pleased to note that the report supports the thrust of its defence policy, especially in highlighting the difficulties inherent in mounting a major attack on Australia. The Government does not propose to respond to all the points raised, which are, of course, the subject of detailed consideration within the Department of Defence, but will take this opportunity to detail its view on the main types of threat addressed in the report out the namely, the global threat; the prospect of major attack on, or invasion of, Australia; and, finally, the likelihood of lower level threats to this country. We need to monitor the international environment continuously in order to identify potential risks to our security, because much that contributes to Australia's strategic circumstances and prospects does not directly affect or involve us and is beyond our direct influence. It needs to be remembered that present world economic difficulties, the downturn in international trade, rising unemployment in the major industrial countries, the failure to reach agreement at the recent meeting of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between countries, the increasing international indebtedness of COMECON countries, and balance of payment difficulties particularly in the Third World, can lead to political instability and possibly to radical political change within countries. Were these events to lead to regimes resorting to military threat as a way out of their economic and political difficulties, the result could contribute to global instability. The regions of primary security interest to us-the South West Pacific, South East Asia and our maritime approaches and surrounds-are affected by international and external influences, and the Committee's report effectively highlights that. Surveying the international scene, the United States and Soviet Union, as superpowers, are in a class apart from other States because of the global range of their strategic interests and capabilities. The Soviet Union has developed military capabilities that in some significant aspects exceed those of the United States. This Soviet build-up continues. The Soviet Union has also demonstrated in Afghanistan its willingness to use force against an independent, non-aligned neighbour. In Poland, the Soviet Union has demonstrated its intention to continue to determine internal political developments within its COMECON satellite states. Through Cuba and Vietnam, the Soviet manipulates its military and civilian aid in Third World countries in widespread and different geographic regions. Soviet military capability and political interventionism have fundamental implications for the stability of the global balance and for regional stability in many parts of the world. In spite of heightened international tensions, the Government's assessment of the likelihood of global nuclear warfare is that it continues to be low. The Government considers that the penalties attaching to nuclear warfare are a formidable constraint on both powers. It supports the efforts of these powers to find a basis for strategic arms control through agreed and verifiable measures to limit and reduce nuclear forces. The Government also supports United States efforts to reinforce the credibility of its nuclear deterrent force through measures designed to enable an adequate response to the Soviet Union's continuing improvement of its nuclear capabilities. The Government points out, however, that continued avoidance of nuclear war does not mean stability in the global order or in the various parts of the world. Nations that value their independence and that wish to protect their interests must be prepared to be active internationally and to command military strength to support their efforts. The Committee's report devotes, rather disproportionately, some 26 of the 54 pages in the body of the report to the possibilities and implications of global conflict. The Government does not disagree with the broad thrust of the Committee's conclusions in this area, which are consistent with its own: That is, that global nuclear war remains improbable and that Australia would not be a principal theatre in such conflict. However, the Government is not persuaded by the Committee's discussion of the consequences in such conflict for the defence facilities we operate jointly with our United States ally. Much of the Committee's discussion in this respect lacks precision and rests heavily upon speculation. In May 1981 my predecessor endorsed in the House the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, who, following his tour of the joint facilities, said: In certain conditions, industrial centres and military installations in Australia could-I repeat, could-become nuclear targets. Pine Gap and Nurrungar would be unlikely targets. There is nothing in the present report that would cause the Government to alter or qualify the earlier endorsements by my predecessor and the Leader of the Opposition on these matters. In respect of the facility at North West Cape, the Committee concludes that it is possible to develop arguments both for and against the proposition that the naval communications station would be a target in circumstances of nuclear conflict. The Government notes, however, that practical military men on both sides acknowledge that, in the event of global nuclear war, each side's first priority would be the destruction of the other's war-fighting capacity. Given the multiplicity of command and control channels now available, attacks on communications relay facilities would be unlikely to command military priority as a means of limiting the destructive capability of the other side's forces. Moreover, such attacks could limit the ability of either side to prevent an escalation of the conflict to total war. As successive governments have acknowledged, it cannot be claimed that Australia's involvement in support of the United States deterrent is without any risk at all. The Committee properly asks this important question: 'Are the risks associated with nuclear attack on Australia more than outweighed by the advantages of hosting the facilities as part of the alliance with the United States?' The Committee, however, fails to give an answer. The Government's answer is an unequivocal 'yes'. While we acknowledge that risk of nuclear attack against targets in Australia, and specifically the joint Australian-United States facilities, cannot be completely excluded, we agree with the Committee's assessment that these risks are low. It is the Government's view that the balance of advantage rests clearly with the contribution we make to stability; that is, the maintenance of world peace. This was also the conclusion of the Labor Government of Mr Whitlam, as is clear from various statements which both he and his Defence Minister made. The Government considers that the incremental risk of nuclear attack which might attach to its hosting of these facilities is small and it rejects any proposition that Australians should avoid helping to deter nuclear war if our contribution involves some element of risk. It is consistent neither with our national interests nor our international obligations simply to leave all risk-taking to others. In the first paragraph of its report the Committee acknowledges that 'in the absence of a fundamental change in the relationship between the superpowers, the democracies must continue to bear the unwelcome burden of arms for defensive purposes, and accept the difficult task of gaining agreement between democracies on a united response to a threat from a totalitarian government'. The Government endorses this view, which accords with its own policies and activities. My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr Street recently summarised the broad nature of Australia's contribution to the effectiveness of the Western alliance in his Roy Milne lecture delivered in Brisbane on 21 October. He noted that we contribute through diplomacy as well as our military forces, and that the latter-while relatively small are sufficiently sophisticated to deal with a wide range of local threats and to strengthen regional security. He referred to the Five Power Arrangements and the bilateral defence cooperation programs with the Association of South East Asian Nations and in the South Pacific. He noted the contribution made by maintaining access to our ports for naval ships, our own surveillance activities, and our facilitation surveillance and training flights by United States B52 aircraft. I turn briefly now to the ANZUS alliance. The joint defence facilities are an important, but not the only element in our contribution to the ANZUS alliance. The Government thoroughly supports the Committee's view that 'the ANZUS Alliance acts as a deterrent against those potentially hostile actions against Australia which are of such magnitude that they are beyond Australia's own capabilities'. The centrality of the ANZUS alliance to Australia's defence strategy in this context was recently restated by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) in his statement on consultations with the United States Secretary of Defense, Mr Caspar Weinberger, only a few weeks ago. I would, however, draw to the Committee's attention that the Acting Prime Minister also observed that Australia makes an important contribution to the alliance, and that Mr Weinberger emphasised the United States appreciation of Australia's defence efforts. As already mentioned, the United States and the Soviet Union are the two most powerful nations, but they by no means control the international order. International tensions often have a regional basis, and regional problems attract the attention of the major powers in pursuit of their interests. The Middle East is one such region. There, uncertainties in oil pricing following the downturn in world demand, the war between the Ayatolla Khomeini-led Iran and Iraq, the conflicts within Lebanon, the consequences of the change in leadership in Egypt following the assassination of President Sadat, and the continuing Palestinian problems are sources of tension in that region which are by no means controlled by either of the super-powers. Instability in the Middle East is a matter of concern to Australia in spite of its remoteness from us. The Committee's report recognises that the Asian-Pacific region is the area of most direct security interest to Australia and, within that region, the security of South East Asia has particular bearing on Australia's interests. Australia's South East Asian and South West Pacific neighbours have, in the main, concentrated on the development of political relationships which foster mutual cohesion and support regional political and economic resilience. They see in this a means of frustrating efforts by others to divide them and to subvert their sovereignty. Likewise, many of Australia's neighbours are improving their independent military capabilities to defend themselves. Australia's policies have strongly supported these regional endeavours. We seek to provide what help we can to improve the of independent capabilities of our neighbours to safeguard their own security and, particularly in the South West Pacific where military potential is bound to be limited, we try to support efforts to promote a sense of regional interest and cooperation resistant to external interference. This activity commands priority in our policy not simply as a goodwill gesture at the expense of Australia's own defence effort; it is a direct investment in the security and stability of the region and is of significant importance to our own security. It complements our foreign aid program in this region, which has the specific objectives of advancing social economic development. Australia is fortunate in respect of its strategic position. Distance from the centres of world power insulates us from much strategic competition; our surrounding water barrier affords substantial security against major attack or invasion; and our continent's sheer size makes its subjugation a difficult proposition even could we conceive realistically of the necessary combination of capability, advantage and strategic circumstances necessary for such a major enterprise by another state. The Committee rightly observes that the large armies in our region are largely irrelevant to consideration of Australia's defence problems because they are currently unsupported by the substantial maritime and air resources that would be needed to launch and sustain a major military action against Australia as an island nation. It would be rash to conclude that major conventional attack or invasion could never occur for, after all, it nearly did so once-but the degree of difficulty would be high, as would the cost and, by our own defence competence and preparedness, we can raise both significantly. The Commiittee's report states that even the Soviet Union would face considerable difficulties if it attempted an opposed landing on such a distant continent as Australia. If the Soviet Union undertook a major military operation against Australia or launched a nuclear attack on it alone, there would be worldwide strategic implications. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics would have to weigh the risk of a major and sustained world, and in particular United States, reaction against what would seem to be very doubtful benefits. These fundamental considerations provide us, therefore, with considerable assurance for our own future security, at least pending the development of the major maritime and air capabilities which most nations, other than the Soviet now lack. The development of such major military capabilities by regional countries would, of course, be noted by Australia's intelligence agencies at an early stage. We could also expect warning of the development of motivations for military action against us, of which there is no indication at present. Nevertheless a major consequence of the communist victory in Vietnam is the establishment by the USSR of a warm water naval base at Cam Ranh Bay and an air base at Da Nang. This is a matter of concern to all nations in the Pacific. In spite of these circumstances the Government does not believe that it is absolved from the need to consider the contingency of a major threat in its defence planning. Lead times for major equipment acquisition alone dictate this. But however important it is to address the contingency of major threat, it would be quite unrealistic to give it undue emphasis. In particular, the range of circumstances in which limited military operationsmight occur against Australia, perhaps motivated more by political than military considerations, deserves careful attention. The Committee's report identifies many of these under its general headings of 'Intermediate Level Threats' and 'Low Level Contingencies '. The Committee notes that, although difficult to visualise at this stage, countries could, in the future, develop numerous motives for mounting intermediate-level threats against Australia. They might, for instance, mount such attacks in an effort to weaken Australia's commitment to the Western alliance; to achieve short or long term political or economic concessions; to attempt to control directly the resources of what might be claimed as under-utilised or less populated parts of Australia; or to attempt to exploit ideological divisions within Australia. In 1982 such contingencies appear fanciful and remote. Yet the politics of the future inevitably have their uncertainties. The Committee's report proposes also a wide range of low level contingencies with which Australia could conceivably be confronted in the shorter term. Instances of these include sporadic attacks against key installations; harassment of our shipping; intrusions into Australia's airspace; military support for the illegal exploitation of our off-shore resources; support for dissident elements in a regional country, the security of which is important for Australia, or even in Australia itself; or providing assistance to overseas based terrorist groups using violence in Australia. Even though such situations are improbable, they are possibilities less unlikely than other levels of threat to which the report devotes so much attention. Limited operations of this type would require of an adversary less military capability, less preparation time and less powerful motivation than would be required to mount a major conventional attack on Australia. Furthermore, it is in relation to this type of situation, as distinct from that of global war or major attack, that Australians most likely would need to be able to defend themselves with their own resources. The Committee's report concludes that we should place continuing emphasis on self-reliance, which is, of course, a basic element of the Government's defence policy. Australia is able, with its present and planned military capabilities, to make low or intermediate level attacks against it costly and hazardous. Furthermore, we are well equipped to expand these capabilities in the face of an emerging threat because of our alliance relationships; our economic circumstances and potential for growth; our industrial, transport and communications expansion base; and the whole Australian community's level of education and skill, including our capacity to absorb new civil and military technology. Although Australia's closer regions, by comparison with many other parts of the world, do not possess extensive capabilities to project military power, the Government does not dismiss the possibility of problems of the more substantial kind detailed by the Committee developing in the future. It is therefore taking, as long term insurance, a number of measures to develop Australia's defence presence and preparedness in the north and west of the country, as well as in the east. These measures have value, not only for more substantial contingencies, but against lower level ones also. In recent times the activities of the Defence Force have increasingly been directed to tasks relevant to these lesser contingencies. In particular, maritime surveillance and patrol operations in the northern and western ocean approaches to Australia have been expanded. An Army Operational Deployment Force has been established at Townsville, capable of quick reaction to low level events. The Army has established a new northern surveillance unit, Norforce, and founded a new regiment in the Pilbara in north-west Western Australia. Longer term infrastructure developments in the north and west include a new airfield at Derby in Western Australia and a much improved one at Learmonth, new patrol boat bases at Darwin and Cairns and planning for an additional one near Port Hedland. Also the Government is developing facilities in the Northern Territory to accommodate a squadron of Australia's new tactical fighters. There are other initiatives under way, many of them around the northern and western coasts of our continent. Clearly we cannot afford to ignore the possibility of any level of threat to Australia. If there is one consistent lesson in the history of military conflict it is this: Undue reliance on the theory of perceptible threat is very dangerous; time and again forecasting has proven defective, with serious consequences. Many people will remember, for example, that even so distinguished an Australian statesman as war-time Prime Minister John Curtin made this observation from the Opposition benches only 10 months before the outbreak of World War I I: any increase of defence expenditure after the Munich Pact so far as Australia is concerned appears to me to be an utterly unjustifiable and hysterical piece of panic propaganda. The long lead time in years necessary for personnel recruiting and training and the manufacturing and acquisition of military hardware determine our defensive capacity in at least five and almost certainly 10 years hence. It is the Government's view that this period is within the time frame necessary to identify possible threats ahead and so permit timely expansion, should it be believed necessary, of the Australian Defence Force. The Committee's report on threats to Australia's security is a useful contribution to discussion of our defence problems. The Government thanks the Committee for the work it put into the analysis of the problems and preparation of the report. I present the following paper: Response to the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial statement, 14 December 1982. Motion (by Sir James Killen) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",40
96,Mr SCHOLES,ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"It is pleasing that the Government has chosen to respond to this report of the defence sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Unfortunately, some other reports have not been responded to and this response is well outside the time limit which was set out for responses in the Government's statement of some time ago. I draw attention to the report on procurement, which is now more than two years old. The Government has not deemed it important enough or has not felt impelled to provide any response whatsoever to that report. Yet procurement and the relationship between the Department of Defence and Australian defence industries are long-running problems which may have been reduced to some extent in recent times but which certainly have not been resolved. At a time of economic crisis that is an area which one would have thought the Government would consider to be of some importance, if not of total importance. I also draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Government will not permit the Chairman of the Committee or the members of the Committee who worked long and hard on this report to participate in this debate. I think that is unfortunate. The work that goes into the preparation of such a report, with extremely limited resources, is time consuming and requires considerable dedication by the members of the Committee on both sides of the Parliament. Having served on the Committee some time ago, it is my experience that every endeavour is made for committee reports to contain, as near as possible, unity of decision, unity of purpose and unity of recommendation. I think this report highlights a number of aspects of Australia's defence and foreign policies which are worthy of debate in this Parliament. After all, it is ultimately this Parliament which will accept the responsibility for the success or failure of our defence policies should those defence policies be put to the test. It cannot be assumed that the government of the day will, in fact, be the government which is required to apply the defence policies or to accept the liabilities for any lack of preparedness or ill-judgment which may occur. I note that the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) used John Curtin as an example of the need for constant vigilance and the need for constant preparedness and maintenance of our defence forces. It should be remembered that John Curtin was brought to office in this country because the rhetoric and the talk of the tory governments in the 10 years prior to his coming to office had resulted in total neglect and lack of any preparedness of our defence forces for actual participation in combat. That blind faith syndrome still exists. In my opinion our defence forces today are less prepared to cope with an emergency than they were in 1939. The rhetoric of the present Government is no different from what went on during the 1920s and the 1930s in this country. The Minister cited a former Prime Minister, our wartime leader, as an example of lack of consideration of the need for preparedness. Might I just remind the House that in 1938 the Prime Minister, the late Joseph Lyons, told this country that the building of fortresses at Singapore and the guarantees of the British forces would ensure the security of Australia for the foreseeable future. At a much earlier time Matthew Charlton raised the question of the need for air power and was poohhoohed inside and outside this Parliament by the conservatives who could not see that what he was saying was relevant. The report sets out I think reasonably accurately the possible threats to Australia. The Minister has added nothing to the defence debate and certainly has not clarified the many areas in which there are now doubts about government policy and government intentions in the defence area. Over the last two of three months we have had a myriad of statements about what our defence policies and decisions are going to be. In fact, it is almost as if our regional defence policy is based upon where the Minister happens to be speaking at a particular time. I am sure that those people in the Department of Defence who are responsible for policy development are having nightmares trying to change yesterday's policy to suit today's speech. It is not that long ago that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had a little bit of leaking done about the dangers of Cam Ranh Bay. But that was pretty quickly forgotten when it was pointed out that if the Cam Rahn Bay area were used for Backfire bombers, which was being suggested, Australia would have no defence at all. We had no capacity at all to intercept or to deal with these aircraft. Even if we could get our fighter aircraft into the air they would be inferior and our missiles could not catch up. In fact some of the missiles could not be fired because of the dangers to the pilots flying our aircraft. I think we should realise that the Minister has failed altogether to respond to two matters. Firstly, the Committee pointed out the fact that if we are spending low amounts of our Budget on defence, there is a great need for adequate intelligence gathering and performance at the intelligence level. It has to be said that the Committee expressed some doubts that that capacity existed. Secondly, the Committee made mention of the need for surveillance of Australia's coastline and the ability to ensure its security. Only two weeks ago we had the most recent report of incursions over Australia's coastline. This incident involved an aircraft. No one knows where it came from, where it went or what type it was. We have some forms of coastal surveillance-probably attuned to low level civilian activities and probably geared to a no-incursion situation. It has to be said that most of our efforts in this regard look like padding and window dressing. The facts are that sitting over at Nowra we have Tracker aircraft with sophisticated equipment which are not being used for military purposes at the moment but which could be used to extend our capabilities and to improve our coastal surveillance capacities, to protect our coastline not only against military threats but also the insidious threats of drug smuggling, illegal migration and other forms of invasion of Australia's coastline which also must include the threat of quarantine breaches which could devastate our primary industries should such breaches occur. There are regular landings on Australia's coastline and it is pretty widely known that there are regular incursions of drugs and other illicit materials which endanger our population. It seems that this is not important. Aircraft which could be used for surveillance purposes are being tied up. We waste millions of dollars on pilot training in those aircraft for no better reason than to save a few dollars of the Defence vote this year. It is true, and I think it has been true for some time, that it is difficult to identify a specific, mediate or reasonably imminent threat to Australia's security. That, I think, is beyond question although I seem to remember the noise which was made in this House by the honourable gentlemen opposite including the former Minister for Defence when that first report was made. The former Chief of Defence Force Staff when before the Committee made that statement quite clear. He made one other statement which I do not think this House should ever forget either. It was with respect to the political rhetoric which people attempted to use about Cam Ranh Bay at that time. We all remember the story leaked from the Prime Minister's staff about Backfire bombers. I mentioned it a moment ago. The Chief of Defence Force Staff was asked about our surface-to-air capacity to protect this country against any such incursion. The Government at least thinks that this is politically important even if it does not take it seriously as a realistic prospect. The Chief of Defence Force Staff said: 'Yes, I think we did have a surface-to-air missile but I think we gave it away'. We have no capacity whatsoever to deal with any such incursion over Australian soil if it were to occur. The Minister mentions some of the major facilities around the Australian coastline and the necessity for their protection. I point out that the incursion over north-west Australia was within a couple of hundred miles of North West Cape and we still do not know by whom it was made. If, in fact, an aggressor were to undertake to deal a blow to any part of Australia using modern equipment-the Minister at least sees the Soviet Union as the major threat in this area-that could be done without any means whatsoever available in Australia for protection or detection. We have no adequate radar. lindalee is 'gonna' project-it is 'gonna' be in service some time and it has 'gonna' be in service for as long as I can remember. We have no early warning aircraft. Those aircraft are still in the five-year program. They have been in the five-year program for several years. Certainly the results of Kangaroo III suggest that that type of surveillance is necessary and should have a high priority. But the Government is playing around with the policies of the 1920s and the 1930s. It cannot make up its mind. It has been trying for five years to decide what it will do about an aircraft carrier. The Government is still playing around with the decision on whether we should build, in Australian or elsewhere, the naval vessels which are urgently needed to replace the older units. We still have minesweepers in service that were constructed in the early 1950s. They are clearly inadan imequate for modern warfare. The Government has issued notices to sack skilled aircraft workers in our aircraft factories. There will be plenty of work there in five years' time but the skilled people will be elsewhere. If they have the competence, which 1 believe they have, they will get jobs because of their high degrees of skill and competence. Other will suffer because of those dismissals. It is unfortunate that the Government considers the defence of Australia and the security of Australia to be so unimportant that it treats this as an area for political rhetoric rather than serious consideration. The fact that we will not debate the implications of the Minister's response indicates quite clearly that the Government is not seriously concerned about defence. Rather it is concerned about the political pluses or minuses which it can obtain in the short term from prostituting the debate on defence in this country to the level of the gutter.",44

99,Dr BLEWETT,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL," The Opposition welcomes the introduction of the Social Security Amendment Bill, which is designed to correct some obvious anomalies in the administration of the Social Security Act. The first of the three anomalies dealt with in this Bill is the existing six-week gap for school leavers. At present school leavers cease to be entitled to receive any family allowance once they leave school but they are not, of course, entitled to any unemployment benefit for six weeks. So there is a six-week gap in which school leavers while living at home, often with their parents, are not entitled to any family allowance but are not entitled to unemployment benefit. This Bill deals with that obvious anomaly which has been in the system for some six years. Of course that anomaly was introduced by this Government; nevertheless, after six years, we welcome its correction. Motion to take Secondly, the Bill will extend eligibility for sickness benefit to those who, but for incapacity, would have been entitled to unemployment benefit, rehabilitation allowances or employment allowances. Indeed, there seems to be a bit of a problem with the Bill because something happened to it after the speech to be delivered by the Minister for Social Security (Senatory Chaney) had been written, but before it was delivered, so that the Minister's speech does not quite coincide with the Bill. In fact, the Bill is somewhat more generous than the Minister's speech indicates because the sickness benefit provisions are extended to include the wife's pension, widow's pension and supporting parent's benefit. None of them were mentioned by the Minister, and it is unusual for this Government not to boast of its corrections. The corrections regarding the rehabilitation allowance and invalid pension were, of course, noted by the Minister. This provision, however, relates to eligibility for sickness benefit and it has arisen primarily out of new interpretations of the law, about which I will have a little to say later. The third anomaly corrected in the Bill is that there will now be immediate continuity of supplementary allowance to pensioners entitled to it if they are transferred to sickness benefit. In the past, a pensioner may have been collecting supplementary allowance but if that pensioner was transferred and became a sickness beneficiary, even though he was entitled to a supplementary allowance he had to wait six weeks before he could coll-ct it. That anomaly is also dealt with in this measure. As I say, the Opposition welcomes this correction but we have some regrets that in the consideration-particularly of the payment of sickness benefits--- the opportunity has not been taken to widen eligibility to a small number of people who are at present ineligible. At a later stage I shall move an amendment concerning the inclusion of these groups in the sickness benefit provisions. I want, too, to say a little about the origin of the legislation. It is rather peculiar that we should be getting this legislation at this stage, becaus- the issues dealt with are those usually taken up 10 relation to the Budget and the social services legislation that emerges from it. It appears very much that these anomalies were simply forgotten at that stage and have been rat?er belatedly.recognised by the Government. I thmk that: as Liberal back benchers have a tendency to claim that they are responsible for these corrections of anomalies a-d that somehow it was their pressure upon the Mmister that produced them, I should take the evidence that fortunately is available in this case to show quite clearly that the major adjus-ment made in this legislation-that is, the correctlOn of the gap for young people leaving .school before they get a job or before they are entitled to unemployment benefit-is the direct result of th- Australian Labor Party's action in this field. First of all, this anomaly was created six years ago; so it is rather odd that any Liberal back bencher should claim-some of them have already done so-that somehow its correction is the result of their pressure, because that suggests that it takes an enormous amount of pressure on this Government to produce even a minor change of this n.ature. As the Minister himself has clearly admitted, the legislation derives directly from the Labor Party again bringing attention to this issue. In the October Social Security Bulletin, published by my colleague, Senator Grimes, attention was drawn to this issue. I quote what he said then because, according to the Minister in the other place, that was the first occasion on which this issue was brought to his attention. Senator Grimes stated: In 1976 the Fraser Government, obsessed with its war against so-called 'dole bludgers', decided to sWp unemployment benefits to school leavers who could not find Jobs. They are not paid until six weeks after their final examination or when they leave school, whichever is the later. But, in spite of promises made by Senator Guilfoyle at the time, family and student allowances are also stopped period. This year family allowances finish upThat is, before this Bill came in-on the first or third Tuesday in December. What are these teenage children to live on in their first six weeks of unemployment') How are parents supposed to feed grown young people with no less than averge appetites when the Department of SOCial Security, which has paid family allowances to those chddren since birth, cancels all payments at the very time they need new clothes, transport and telephone money to hunt for work, and food to sustain them for it 1 Government members and senior public servants have no problems with the policy. They can manage family holidayS and lavish Christmas spending without dependlllg on SOCIal security payments. It is poor families - including unemployed parents in .:'-oIewcastle and WOllongong who have to explall1 to theIr chddren that presents and food are scarce. Can even this Government derive satisfaction in saving a few thousand dollars by leaving teenage school leavers stranded without family allowances') If not, the Minister should order that payments be made until the end of January so their families have a marginally less bleak Christmas. Of course, that was published after the Budget legislation had been drawn up. The Minister for Social Security acknowledged to my colleague, Senator Grimes, that he had not been aware of this particular injustice until the Bulletin had drawn it to his attention. I think considerable credit is due to my colleague Senator Grimes and to the publicity that the Labor Party has given to this issue for the introduction of this legislation. I therefore commend the Minister for responding quite quickly unbelievably quickly, in many ways, for this Government - to ourexplammg that issue to them. I want to deal with {his whole issue because I think that the Government has a very sorry record and is now making only belated amends for the past five years. I deal first of all with the payment of family allowance on behalf of unemployed school leavers until such time as they are eligible for unemployment beneflt. The history of this matter certainly reflects no credit on the Minister who presided over the area of social security for most of this Government's tenure, that is, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle: nor, I am afraid, does it reflect any credit on the Department of Social Security. When the Government legislated in November 1977 to stop unemployment benefit going to school leavers who could not find work, Opposition members raised the unfairness of leaving poor families at Christmas time and during the January holidays with no money for their teenage children who had left school and were not yet entitled to unemployment benefit but who, from the point they left school, were denied family benefits. My colleague the honourable member f-r over thIS Prospect (Dr Klugman) raised the Issue 10 thiS House. He said: What I find particularly unpleasant is the fact that the fam-. ily allowance stops when the child leaves school. In the case of pensioners the dependant benefit stops when school finishes; yet those children do not become eligible for anything else Later in the same speech he said: There may be a sudden drop in income of $11 or $12 for that family, which is probably a very large proportion of the total income. That child then to find a job the costs of going to the Commonwealth Employment Service office, going to the office of the Department of Social Security, ringing up, buying newspapers which advertise jobs and that sort of thing. Yet not one Government member in this House concerned himself with the impossibility of a low income family or a widowed pensioner being able to find money out of non-existent savings to feed and properly clothe that teenager for job interviews. One can understand why some members of the Opposition feel a little annoyed when Government back benchers claim that somehow they have corrected this five-year anomaly. When the issue was brought up in this House five years ago not one Government member bothered to speak about it. The Minister in charge of the Bill at the time in this House, the present Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt), did not even try to answer the Opposition's criticism that poor families are hurt by the policy of paying nothing to school leavers, not wealthy families who can still have family holidays and buy new clothes for the school leavers. When this unfair policy was debated in the Senate the Minister for Social Security at the time, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, committed herself and her Government to continuing family allowances until the ex-students secured work or became eligible for unemployment benefit. When the issue was raised in the other place the Minister made a commitment that the family allowance would continue until the young person became elgible for unemployment benefit or found a job. On 7 November 1977 she said: Where a parent was receiving a rate of unemployment benefit which took into account dependent children, that additional payment would be continued during the period of six weeks before eligibility for unemployment benefit had been achieved. The family allowance about which Senator Donald Cameron asked also would be continued during that period. If it were a family allowance for a student child, that would be continued until the period of non-payment of the unemployed benefit was covered. A clear commitment was made in the Senate by the Minister concerned to ensure the gap did not occur. She committed herself to the continuance of family allowance, student allowance and payment on behalf of dependent children, but she simply betrayed those people by her inaction. I do not know whether this was done by intent or neglect. We just do not have an answer to that. Either way, the Minister was culpable for the failure to ensure that that gap was not closed. In this rather secretive Government we do not know whether the Department, which had a responsibility to prepare the legislation and to design the appropriate administrative procedures to get that commitment translated into action, ever did so. Whilst the Minister must remain culpable, at least has the additional costs of trying we cannot discover how much specific blame attaches to her and how much blame attaches to the Department for its failure to deal with this problem by preparing appropriate legislation and designing appropriate administrative procedures. What we do know is that the Government has not paid those allowances for the past five years and thereby has saved millions of dollars at the expense of very poor families. It is, I am afraid, a record of contempt for promises. We know that this Government has a splendid and unbelievable record of making promises at election time which it never keeps. Usually it has managed to keep at least the promises it has made in the House, but this is a clear occasion on which a promise made in the Parliament, in the Senate in this case, was not honoured. That is a record of indifference to the interests and concerns of thousands of relatively poor families. My collegue Senator Grimes raised this matter many times. Each time. I am certain it was brought to Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle's attention. Each time she ignored both the promises she made in the Parliament and her undoubted responsibilities. As an Opposition we appreciate the prompt response of the new Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, to our attitude which was reflected in the article I read from the Labor Party's social security bulletin. He took immediate action to check with his Department and then to instruct his Department that family, student and dependant allowances were all to continue. Of course, this legislation is the product of his immediate response. He has certainly displayed a sensitivity to and understanding of the issue which were not characteristic of his predecessor. This year, as a result of this legislation, something like 100000 schoolleavers will have a better deal over these holidays than school leavers have had over the past five years as a result of that neglect by Senator Chaney's predecessor. We are not given any figures by the Minister, but we understand this part of the legislation will cost between $3m and $5m. We believe it is money well spent. I note also in relation to this matter that the Government is taking the opportunity to raise the income limits for students. We welcome the increases from $1800 to $2500 for those living at home and from $2500 to $3600 for students living away from home. Let me now turn to the second correction of anomalies. This relates to the sickness provisions of the Social Security Act. This has been a matter of grave concern to the Opposition since we learned of the implementation of new instructions which were sent to all offices of the Department of Social Security last July. It seems that these newest instructions arose out of a legal opinion given to the Department earlier in 1982 that procedures for paying sickness benefit to certain classes of people were not in accordance with the Social Security Act. These provisions had been in the Act since 1945 and sick persons had received these benefits for the past 37 years, but the new legal opinion, it is said, required that these payments be outlawed. The interpretation mostly revolved around the issue of loss of income. For instance, the pension was deemed not to be income for those purposes so that a person taken off the invalid pension, as in the notorious case of Mr Darrell Cart hew, a double amputee, was considered not eligible for sickness benefit when his invalid pension was cancelled. A widow pensioner who lost her widow's pension because a qualifying child turned 16 was not eligible for sickness benefit. An unemployed person who was surviving on his or her last few dollars before claiming unemployment benefit was also deemed to have lost no income if he or she became sick or had an accident and, therefore, had no right to sickness benefit and, of course, no right to unemployment benefit because he or she could not qualify on grounds of fitness to take a job. This legislation extends eligibility for sickness benefit to people able to show that, but for their incapacity, they would have received unemployment benefit. This takes care of the unemployed, except for some cases which I will mention and which I hope the Government may be able to take up. It will extend also elgibility to former invalid pensioners and former recipients of sheltered employment allowance and rehabilitation allowance who are incapacitated for work, which takes care of the case of a person such as Mr Carthew and many other invalid pensioners, including those awaiting appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal whose invalid pensions are discontinued at that point. As I said in my opening remarks, once we read the Bill, as distinct from the Minister's speech, we see that the Government has corrected some other anomalies relating to that sickness benefit extension, which we welcome because it also covers the problems arising in relation to wife's pension, a widow's pension and the supporting parent's benefit. We are grateful for the extension of the legislation in those fields. The final part of this legislation will allow pensioners transferring to sickness benefit to transfer their supplementary assistance at the same time instead of undergoing a waiting period of six weeks. If a person were transferred from the pensioner category to the category of a sickness beneficiary then even though that person were entitled on income grounds to a supplementary allowance this would not be paid until a waiting period of six weeks had elapsed. The changes in this legislation ensure that those payments are continuous. As we understand it, this will also give unemployment beneficiaries transferring to the sickness benefit a right to the supplementary allowance, although I presume that in their case they would have to wait for six weeks because they would not have been entitled, as an unemployment beneficiary, to a supplementary allowance under the present rules. I hope that this matter will be the forerunner to amending legislation to give the unemployed supplementary assistance. As I have argued before in this place, this denial of supplementary assistance to the unemployed is one of the many discriminations which we find against the unemployed as compared with other beneficiaries under social security legislation. I finally come to the deficiencies which the Opposition sees in the legislation, which in general we have welcomed. This Bill does not provide sickness benefit to three classes of beneficiary who would have received the sickness benefit if they had qualified on incapacity grounds before the Attorney-General's opinion was translated into departmental instructions-that is, before this year. Back in 1981 the three groups about which I am now going to talk would have been entitled to a sickness benefit. When the ruling came in they were denied this benefit and this Bill has not corrected that denial. Firstly, there are those persons involved in industrial action. As the House is fully aware, these people are presently precluded by law from receiving the unemployment benefit or the special benefit if they are unemployed by virtue of action taken by a union of which they are members even if they have no knowledge or have given no approval to that action. That relates to the provisions that this Government has imposed on the unemployment benefit. Because we were able to defeat some of this Government's legislation in the other place at least wives of these union members can claim the unemployment benefit or a the special benefit. But what about single persons in this situation? I am referring to single persons who have had an accident or a disabling illness which has prevented them from trying to find temporary work. They are not even entitled, despite the corrections in this legislation, ness benefit; they get no provision at all under the present situation. How are they to eat, to pay rent and fuel bills if they are prevented by law from receiving the unemployment benefit, the special benefit or the sickness benefit? I ask the Government to reconsider this small group that has been singled out for particularly harsh treatment. Mr Donald Cameron-What about workers' compo?",47
100,Dr BLEWETT,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL,"It would not apply in the period in which they immediately require the sickness benefit. They may of course get it in two years' or three years' time. Secondly, there are the unemployed whose unemployment benefit has been postponed or cancelled because they have allegedly failed the work test or have left a job voluntarily. All honourable members know that there are lots of problems with this aspect of the work test. A lot of problems have been created in relation to people allegedly leaving their work voluntarily. Indeed, the extent of these problems is proven by the fact that a very high percentage of these cases were reinstated to the unemployment benefit after an appeal. As soon as these appeals have been decided their punishment is a suspension of from six weeks to 12 weeks which in itself is a severe sentence, meaning the loss of from $400 to almost $1,000 in the case of married unemployed persons. But if in that period of suspension a person has an accident at home, a road accident, or suffers a heart attack, he or she is prevented by the Social Security Act from receiving either the unemployment benefit or the special benefit. He or she will now be prevented from receiving the sickness benefit following the interpretation of this legislation given at the beginning of this year. That position has not been corrected by this legislation. It seems to me that really it is a question of justice and humanity, as that person is being deprived of the means to feed and shelter himself or herself. In many cases he or she would be reinstated after an appeal. But if these people become ill during the period that they are lodging the appeal even under this legislation they are not entitled to any provision for the sickness benefit. The third group I want to mention is the young unemployed school-leavers who are not entitled to the unemployment benefit. In the course of this legislation they are now to be covered by the family allowance. But still there are situations of independence for some of these young people or those young people from a very poor family who should be able to transfer to the sickness benefit. I believe that they should not be excluded by this to the sick- legislation. These three elements involve very small amounts of money. It seems to me that, as the Government has rightly set out to correct some of the major implications of those legal interpretations given at the beginning of the year, it would be a relatively easy task, certainly not a financially demanding task, for the Government to complete that operation by dealing with the three groups that I have mentioned. While we generally welcome the Bill, because of these limitations we move the following second reading amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Bill should be amended to extend the payment of sickness benefits without a waiting period to persons who are ineligible to receive unemployment benefits because of(a) sub-section 107 (4) of the Social Security Act 1947, relating to persons engaged in industrial action, or (b) section 120 of the Social Security Act, relating to postponed Or cancelled unemployment benefits'. Of course, under the Constitution we are not able to move that amendment in the Committee stage. But I indicate that we see it as the kind of amendment that is to improve this Bill.",51
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL, Is the amendment seconded? Mrs Child-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,51
102,Mr DONALD CAMERON,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL,"Having listened to the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) speaking to the Social Security Amendment Bill one would think that the Government was in the midst of taking benefits away from people rather than assisting them in the way in which it has. I suppose that the only positive compliment the honourable member paid related to the extension of the amount of income that students can receive without affecting the special benefit. The honourable member for Bonython has moved an amendment on behalf of the Opposition. He knows that in these dying stages of the Parliament there is no chance of the Government being able to consider the suggestions that he has made. But I am confident that if there is any merit in his amendment this Government is sufficiently responsive to introduce changes. The Bill before us today is a Government initiative. It was brought in by a responsive government. The honourable member for Bonython outlined a series of things which the Opposition would do if it were in government. I recall very clearly, when I first became a member of this Parliament in the late I 960s, how the total expenditure in the field of social security was in the vicinity of some 17 per cent of the nation's budget. After the Whit lam Government was defeated in 1975 we saw an increase, from a figure a little bit above 17 per something like 28 per cent. Whilst members of the Opposition have stood up in this House and have said that they would do this or that, I believe that they still have not indicated that they have learned the lessons of 1972 to 1975. The national income is not a bottomless pit. It is all right to criticise the Government for doing this or that but there is only one way in which the Government gets its income-that is, to take money from the taxpayers. We have to balance the question of whether we rip more out of the working man's pocket to pay for social security against whether there are some limitations on the nation's ability to provide for all those things that we, as people with hearts, feel would be good if they could be done but which cannot always be done. Dr Blewett There are lots of big pockets, not just working men's pockets.",51
103,Mr DONALD CAMERON,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL,"There are big pockets and little pockets. I have said before in this House, when referring to areas of tax evasion and the medical profession ripping off people in the system, that there are two types of dishonesty in this country. There are those who can afford not to be dishonest-those who are into it-and those who are pushed into being dishonest because of certain situations. Governments of my political persuasion, even the persuasion of honourable members opposite, if they were elected to power, have an obligation to ensure that the system is watertight and that the watertightness applies to all levels of society. When people see that one particular group cannot rip off the system, they are less inclined to try to get into the system themselves. I have expressed the view that the amount of money being ripped out of social security amounts to some hundreds of millions of dollars. The system is not tight enough to stop this. Nevertheless, work is being done to tighten the system. I want to raise another subject today. I am pleased the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) is in the House as I advised her that I would be speaking. I suppose it is a matter of professionalism in this House that generally if a member from one side is going to make life unpleasant for a member on the other side, the member concerned will let that particular person know that he or she is about to endure some pain. Nevertheless, that is the name of the game. I refer particularly to an article which appeared in the Brisbane Sunday Mail of II July with the big headline-if I hold it up even the honourable member for Lilley and the people in the Press cent to Gallery can read it - 'Pensions hit'. Mrs Darling-Quite true.",52
104,Mr DONALD CAMERON,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL,"- The honourable member interjects: 'Quite true'. I will continue with the article. She has confirmed that it is not misreporting, that the article correctly reports what she stated. She is reported as saying: The Federal Government has transferred about 40.000 people from invalid pensions to unemployment benefits. She descrilbed the Government as indulging in a 'penny pinching exercise'. She goes on to refer to how these people are going to suffer reductions in incomes, et cetera. She then states: . recipients of unemployment benefits. This is in line with her alleging that people have transferred overthese invalids were now forced to report each week to a Commonwealth Employment Service Office and prove they were looking for work. I will not continue quoting from the article. I have quoted a couple of sections which I think is sufficient for the exercise. That exercise is to refute the claim by the honourable member for Lilley on II July, made to all and sundry, that 40,000 people had been made to join the dole queue. She said that these 40,000 people had previously been invalid pensioners but this heartless government, according to her, had ripped away their crutches and said: 'You get back to work'. That is the picture that was painted by the article from the honourable member for Lilley. Several months have passed since this article appeared. I suppose one could justly ask: 'Why is he raising it only now?' The article so concerned me that in August I wrote to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) asking him whether these claims which had been made by the honourable member for Lilley were correct. The reason I wrote to the Minister was because I felt that if what the honourable member for Lilley had said was true, my government was indulging in an exercise of gross unfairness. Therefore, the truth had to be flushed out. I was concerned that the claims that were being made by the honourable member for Lilley were putting fear into the hearts and minds of hundreds of thousands of invalid pensioners in Australia. When an article states that 40,000 people had their crutches ripped away and that they were made to join the dole queue, it understandably causes grave concern in the community. I wrote to the Minister asking him to explain what this was all about. I got a pretty wishy washy reply on 10 November. In the game of selecting people for special treatment, I want to select the person who prepared this letter for the Minister insomuch as he said to me: There does not seem to be any sound basis for this claim and it certainly does not follow that these people have been transferred from invalid pension to unemployment benefit. I regard that as a bit weak. The letter goes on to state: I do not have statistics on the number of people whose invalid pension claims have been rejected or cancelled and who have subsequently claimed unemployment benefit. So it goes on. I was informed that officers of his department were continuing to give their attention to the guidelines to ensure that they were applied uniformly throughout Australia. Mrs DarlingThere were 40,000.",52
105,Mr DONALD CAMERON,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member said: There were 40,000'. She has compounded the felony in this chamber. I acknowledge that the honourable member for Lilley has a kind of honest, caring approach to the less fortunate people in the community. But I do not concede that she has complete monopoly in that area; that concern is shared on both sides of this House. I have the figures on this matter here. It took 1t days of work to find out the facts to put the honourable member's claims to rest. I have established that as at September 1982, very recently, there were 216,207 recipients of invalid pensions in Australia. In addition, another 54,866 wives were being paid an additional allowance because of their spouses inability to work. The honourable member for Lilley's figure of 40,000 invalid pensioners represents almost 15 per cent of the total recipients of invalid pensions in Australia. So we are talking about a sizable number of people. Fifteen per cent of these people apparently are having their crutches ripped away. Since the preparation of this matter, the 1981-82 report of the Department of Social Security has been presented to the Parliament. When we examine that report we find that a lot more interesting figures can be used. I will turn to my home State of Queensland where I prepared my work in order to prove that the honourable member for Lilley's claims were disgracefully exaggerated. In October 1982, 33, I 00 Queenslanders were in receipt of an invalid pension with an extra 7,700 wives in receipt of the support pension. Therefore, one invalid pensioner in slightly less than seven lives in Queensland. This is in line with how Queensland's population relates to the rest of Australia. About one receipient in seven on a wife's pension also lives in Queensland. With that established I hope I can now show, from the Queensland experience, what has really happened with invalid pensioners across Australia. I want the honourable member for Lilley to listen to this very carefully. A total of 3,094 Queensland invalid pensioners who were in receipt of the invalid pension as at 20 October 1981 were no longer receiving a pension on 20 October 1982; that is, 3,100 people, to use a round figure, were no longer receiving the pension one year later. Let us be extravagant, multiply that figure by seven and say that there were 21,000 people across Australia-if we use that one in seven average-- who would no longer have been receiving the invalid pension one year later. Let us turn again to Queensland to see what happened to the 3,100 people who were no longer in receipt of a pension. A total of 1,194 of the recipients had passed away. That is in excess of a third of those who were no longer given the pension. They had not, unfortunately, been able to go to the dole queue that the honourable member for Lilley was talking about because they were beyond hope. The Government, surely, cannot be blamed for that. A total of 334 had been removed because their income levels had grown to a point where they no longer qualified financially. That does happen to people. In fact, in Queensland it happened to 334 people. Their income from other sources exceeded the limits in terms of what they could receive while still receiving a benefit. Thirteen of those people no longer reside in Australia. We do not deport people to that extent. But that is the explanation for another 13 people. Some 299 people had become eligible for the Department of Veterans' Affairs service pension and transferred to that. Taking into consideration the fact that that pension has more benefits than the invalid pension, why should they not transfer? Some 285 people voluntarily surrendered their pensions. Probably many of them were grateful for returned health. In the Department's coding 185 people were listed as having relinquished their pensions for 'other reasons'. That leaves 787 accounted for in Queensland. Their classification is under the 'not permanently incapacitated' or 'husband not permanently incapacitated' categories. Therefore that 787 includes a number of wives whose eligibility would also have ceased along with that of their husbands. I turn to the 1982 report of the Department of Social Security. Right across Australia we find a total of 5,512 people who have had their invalid pensions taken from them, pursuing the matter to the extent that they appealed to the Department and to the tribunals. So 5,512 of them were not satisfied. Of course, we come back to the figure of 40,000 which was claimed by the honourable member for Lilley. We see that of that 5,512, 2,313 of them appealed and the Department later conceded their appeals and restored the benefit. The remainder went to the tribunal and of that remainder 1,029 had their invalid pensions restored by the tribunal. I point out to the honourable member for Lilley that this is the Australia-wide figure. A number of claims-420 of them-were withdrawn or finalised in other ways. Some 1,750 applications Australia-wide were disallowed. Eligibility for invalid pension is determined by medical practitioners. In the honourable member's case and in my case, M.P. stands for member of parliament, not medical practitioner. How any honourable member can set himself or herself up in judgment on the ability of medical practitioners to make decisions in relation to a person's health is absolutely beyond me. Maybe the honourable member has experience that is unknown to me. She may have been to a university and studied medicine for one or two years or she may even have been a nurse in her early days. This may have given her some special knowledge of individuals' health. I do not for a moment suggest that there are not instances where the system I believe there would be people who are receiving an invalid pension who should not be receiving that pension. I believe there would be people who have applied for an invalid pension who have been knocked back but who should have got the pension. There would be others who have been given the pension and who have had it taken from them but who perhaps should still have been on the pension. The system is not infallible, even though medical interpretations and opinions are advised. Mr Leo MCLeayYou should get one.",53
106,Mr DONALD CAMERON,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL,"I point out to the honourable member for wherever who is jumping up and down like a jackrabbit with whiskers that the honourable member for Lilley claimed that 40,000 people have been ripped off the invalid pension list and turned back to the dole queues. As I said, my interest in this subject was motivated by an equal concern to that felt by the honourable member for Lilley. In my view, the 40,000 people that the honourable member for Lilley claims existed-I notice the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) giving the honourable member for Lilley advice; I wonder when he is going to answer my letter-are a figment of her imagination.",54
107,Mr GOODLUCK,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL,She is a dreamer.,54
108,Mr DONALD CAMERON,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL,"I am not saying that; I have some respect for her. However, I do not believe it is fair for her to go to the Press saying that 40,000 people-she has confirmed that was the figure she used-were ripped off the invalid pension and put in the dole queues when no such figure exists as is obvious if we closely scrutinise what has happened to all those people who have transferred from the invalid pension to other pension areas. Above all, I think even the honourable member for Lilley should concede the fact that the present Liberal Government cannot be responsible for death.",54
109,Mrs DARLING,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL," The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) speaks so well; it is such a pity that he loses track of the facts when he is speaking. He got so tied up, running around in little circles with those figures that he cited, that he evidently quite overlooked the experience which I have. He asked whether I had experience unknown to him. Most certainly I must have had. My experience was that these figures followed on from my initial response to scores of people who came into one federal electorate office in Australia---my office in the electorate of Lilley. These were frail people, people in their fifties, visibly ill. They came into fails. my office and broke down and cried on my doorstep. Mr Donald Cameron-Forty thousand of them? Mrs DARLINGI will come to that. I represent only one electorate in Australia. These people, after being on the invalid pension for a number of years, came to my office because they had been told in a letter that the 85 per cent criterion for eligibility for receipt of that pension had been applied to them; they had been found wanting and were now to report to the Commonwealth Employment Service to apply for work. Before talking about those figures I state that this is just the reason why we need an opposition to move amendments to social security legislation in this House. At a time when everyone would admit there are not jobs for the healthy, it is nothing short of criminal for a government to be applying the 85 per cent criterion in the first place. I ask honourable members to consider for a moment that that criterion was meant in spirit to relate to a disabled person of a certain sex, with certain skills, in a certain area being rendered by these circumstances 85 per cent disabled and unable to obtain work. In these days that is reasonable enough. The whole basis of this government crackdown was that instructions were issued through the Department of Social Security to apply the criterion in another way-a blank, flat, across-the-board 85 per cent disability. If honourable members consider it for a moment they will realise that anyone who is 85 per cent to 100 per cent disabled would hardly be able to crawl across a room let alone work in an office, let alone compete with healthy people in a situation of chronic unemployment. The whole thing disgusts me. I now return to the figure of 40,000. First of all I say that there are other people in Australia who share that dream which the honourable member for Fadden claims is a 'dream' figure. I quote from a Press release of 15 September of the apolitical organisation, the Australian Council of Social Service Inc. which stated: The crackdown continues: 45,000 people 'lost'. That is a claim by the Association not politicians. The Press release continues: The income security of thousands of disabled people on, or seeking, the invalid pension is at risk. Despite. the new guidelines announced in May 1981 the current statIstIcs show that up to 45,000 people have already been denied or taken off the invalid pension since 1980. The crackdown contmues despite government claims to the contrary. The honourable member for Fadden will now have to take on an apolitical organisation which is devoting all its research resources and its energies to assisting people in Australia who need its help. I continue with my basis for the figure of 40,000. That is the implication in the statement that 40,000 are going to the Commonwealth Employment Service. The honourable member for Fadden knows that I would have rung through and given this story that I am giving now. That was the whole spirit of the story. It was right in spirit. I do not make claims that I do not substantiate. I do not go around scaring pensioners. It is strange that some Government members appear to think that a happening which affects pensioners will not scare the pensioners but that someone-I am not speaking of the honourable member now-trying to publicise the injustice and to have it rectified will scare the very people who came to me and ask me to do this. Mr Donald Cameron .. You scared many. You scared me, too.",54
110,Mrs DARLING,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL,"I think quite a lot would scare the honourable member. I read from some of my previous statements: The guidelines for granting invalid pensions which were tightened after the infamous Lanigan memorandum 'Control of Invalid Pensions' resulted in an actual drop in the numbers on invalid pension during 1980-81 of 7,256, at the time all other social security payments were rising. I point out to the House that a normal growth pattern is about 8 per cent per annum. I continue: Ifinvalid pensions had continued mal growth' there would have been another 13.753 on pension. This makes a total of around 21,000 people knocked back when they would reasonably have expected to be receiving invalid pensions. In the year just ended the guidelines were 'relaxed', but the numbers have dropped another 5,032. If we take the 'normal growth' pattern, there would have been 42,130 more people on invalid pension if the tough guidelines had not applied. That is the basis of my research. I point out that, following these revelations, mainly by the shadow Minister for Social Security, Senator Grimes, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in fact instigated an investigation. He told his Department to investigate why there had been such a tremendous drop off in the amounts being paid out on the invalid pension. Another point I may not have got around to putting in the paper is that the medical officers were making these evaluations without actually seeing the invalid pensioners. Evidently, there was something wrong there. People in the Department who were concerned that this was happening in Queensland reported to me that people were being taken off the invalid pension without actually being examined by a particular medical officer. The honourable member for Madden -- I am sorry that was a Freudian slip--the honourable member for Fadden asked what was the basis of my medical qualifications. Another thing which I think is absolutely wrong is the lack of staffing. There have been problems regarding staffing in the Department of Social Security. We have not had the doctors necessary to do this job. Therefore, a directive came down through the Department to apply strongly the 85 per cent criterion. The result was wholesale injustice. There were not enough doctors to see everyone who came through. They were most definitely writing asking for those pensioners to be taken off the pensIOn because they did not meet the 85 per cent criterion. I would not have been wasting my time saying these things if I did not think that there was something wrong, something which I would like to see rectified. Mr Falconer-Could you give us that ACOSS wording again? Mrs DARLINGI think I should not take any more time; [ can always table the information. But I will quote this segment: 'Current statistics show that up to 45,000 people have already been denied or been taken off the invalid pension since 1980'. However, [ think I have covered the whole point. There has been a scandal. A tremendous inwhat Lanigan called 'norjustice was done to these people between I -80 and 1982. This situation would have been bad In a time of full employment; in a time of lessening employment it is scandalous. 1 thank the honourable member for Fadden for bringing to my attention the fact that he intended to bring up this ter in this manner. That was professional. I am sure that if the honourable member, with his penchant for figures, goes over these figures he also will see the enormity of the injustice. me, might find it impossible to keep still on this matter. He might, as 1 and other members of the Opposition have done, try to have something done. In a country which is meant to be healthy, this should not be allowed to happen. A nation is only as healthy as its weakest person. 1 assure honourable members that 1 was not seeing things. Not a week goes by without numbers of people coming through my office in this situation. No one could have looked on them without realising that they had been incorrectly taken off that pension. Those people were going down to the Nundah CES. They are indicative of the numbers that 1 cited and ACOSS has cited, which motivated the Minister to ask the Department of Social Security to investigate what is happening. 1 stand by what I have said. I ask honourable members on both sides of the House to consider what we in opposition say when we debate social security legislation and to support the amendment at hand. 1 thank the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) for allowing me this time to speak.",55
111,Mrs CHILD,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL,"1I have seconded the amendment to the Social Security Amendment Bill. 1 point out that the contents of this could have been and should have been dealt with in the context of this year's Budget, in fact, they should have been dealt with in the 1978-79 Budget as that was when my colleague, Senator Grimes, drew to the attention of the then Minister for Social Security the scandalous fact that the Government would not pay family allowance to the parents whose unemployed children could not get unemployment benefit for six weeks after leaving school. Six years ago we were urging the Government to recognise this anomaly. We are all aware that this year's Budget was not designed to last 12 months; it was designed to win the Government an early election and then to self-destruct. Of course, events of more recent times have torpedoed this strategy. 1 draw the attention of the House to the statement by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, the then Minister for Social Security. I am reiterating what the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) said, but 1 think 1 should reiterate it. On 7 November 1977 Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle said that the family allowance would be continued until the period of non-payment of the unemployment benefit was covered. She committed herself to continue the family allowance. She mat- did not fulfil the commitment. This is another illustration of the lack of integrity and untrustworthiness of this Government. I am reminded of the line from the Wizard of Oz when the ruler He, like asked his chief flunkey how many campaign promises he had made in the previous election. The reply was: 'Eighty-five'. 'How many of them have 1 kept ?', he asked. 'None of them "" came the answer. 'Great', he said, 'I will be able to use them all again'. That is what this Government does. We know that the Government saved millions of dollars over the five years at the expense, as usual, of low income families. Senator Grimes has raised this matter over and over again. We on this side of the House are appreciative of the act that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has demonstrated some concern in this area. The unemployed young and their families can thank Senator Grimes and the Australian Labor Party for this change of heart on the part of the Government. Senator Chaney checked the details of Senator Grimes's statement with his Department and then gave instructions that family, student and dependent allowances were to continue throughout the period during which they were not entitled to unemployment benefit. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, the Minister for Aboriginal Bill Affairs (Mr Wilson), to ask the Minister for Social Security to look at the family allowance for those who are leaving school and are taking up tertiary courses. When they actually commence their tertiary courses they get the family allowance backdated to when they left school, but in that period between leaving school and starting their tertiary courses they are left entirely without income. Rectifying that anomaly would be of no cost at all to the Government. It is purely, 1 think, a practical way of bringing the proposed tertiary students in line with everyone else now that the Government has recognised that family allowance will be paid to schoolleavers. 1 urge the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who is at the table, to take that up with the Minister for Social Security. 1 do not believe that Government members can have been aware of the problems that face a pensioner family or a family the breadwinner of which is on sickness, special or unemployment benefits when that family has a school leaver without any income at all over the six weeks Christmas break while that school leaver awaits unemployment benefit. That person cannot even go job hunting under these circumstances. The Commonwealth Employment Service can give people travel vouchers only when it actually sends them for job interviews; it cannot give them to those who are doing their sentence of waiting six weeks before they get some money. The Victorian Labor Government has generously produced concessional travel vouchers but, again, they are not available for school leavers during that bleak period between leaving school and when they actually qualify for unemployment benefit. The low income family not only had to keep the school leaver who had no income but also it had to produce a substantial amount of money for him or her to chase around on public transport looking for a job. We welcome this move albeit that it is too little too late. The Government has taken five years to acknowledge that its indifference to impoverished families and its record of contempt for promises made in Parliament was wrong. This Government has treated the legion of unemployed with contempt. Ministers in this House cite unemployment figures as if they were no more significant than numbers on a page or mere indicators of economic activity. The unemployed should be more than that. They should be permanently in the forefront of the minds of those of us who are secure in the comfort of a regular, living wage as reminders that hundreds of thousands of Australians have been disqualified from being part of the Australian dream. As the Minister said in his second reading speech, it has been necessary to amend the Social Services Act to assist people who are adversely affected by extending sickness benefit to groups of people who formerly have been excluded. For the first time all sickness beneficiaries will be able to claim supplementary allowance The original Act did, as the Minister admitted, cause hardship to many families in the community. My colleague the honourable member for Bonython has already drawn attention to further groups of people who will still suffer hardship even under the amended legislation. I join with him in urging the Minister to take action on their behalf. I point out that the Government's amendments are again a very late realisation of the hardship in the community, much of which has been brought about by the Government. In July this year new guidelines were introduced which made life almost impossible for persons claiming sickness benefit. They spelt out that sickness benefit payment should stick tightly to the 'loss of income' provisions, that is, no one could be paid sickness benefit at a higher rate than the income being received before illness or injury occurred. Sickness benefit was paid to people who were temporarily incapacitated for work because of sickness or accident. It used to be paid at the same rate as unemployment benefit. It was never envisaged that sickness benefit should be paid at a rate less than unemplo-'ment benefit. The 'loss of income' provisions should not have meant that no money at all should be paid to sickness benefit claimants without any other resources. This Government has been steadily applying tougher rules to sickness benefit applicants. The new instructions that were issued earlier this year almost reduced sick people to starvation levels. The way in which the Government plays with the lives of people in hardship has become a public disgrace. The earlier decision to apply the new directive in such a severe way, to save millions of dollars by scrapping sickness benefit to thousands of helpless and sick people, disgusted all humane Australians. These amendments are welcome as they right an obvious wrong. They do not go far enough; they are very late and there are still some glaring anomalies. I urge the Minister to continue to monitor the effects of hard times on the disadvantaged and to continue amending legislation to give the unemployed supplementary assistance and to give some relief to the thousands of young unemployed who are struggling to exist on $40 a week. I further ask the Minister who is at the table, whether he will speak to the Minister for Social Security about the fact that parents receiving sickness benefit are facing large income tax bills merely because they have children. If a single person, a married couple, a mother and her child or a father and his child are receiving sickness benefit their income is below the level at which taxation is attracted but when people have two, three or four children their income goes above the untaxable level and they have to make arrangements with the Department of Social Security to deduct fortnightly so much of their income from their cheque to make arrangements to pay their income tax at the end of the year. This is one of those anomalies that should not exist. We do not tax most of our pensioners unless they have extra income. Sickness beneficiaries get a base income. Senator Chaney has shown himself willing to look at amendments which the Opposition has moved and to take action. I urge him to do the same again.",56
112,Mr WILSON,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL,"1 draw the attention of the House to one or two matters that were referred to by both the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) and the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) and put the record straight. The honourable member for Bonython drew attention to an alleged failure on the part of the former Minister for Social Security to fulfil a commitment. Firstly, I point out that notwithstanding what was said by the honourable member for Bonython the practice has been to pay additional pension for children of a pensioner, unemployment beneficiary or sickness beneficiary after the child has left school during the six week deferment period for the payment of the unemployment benefit to which the unemployed school leaver may become entitled. The honourable member for Bonython and also the honourable member for Henty alleged that those payments were not made and hardship flowed as a consequence. That is not the case because those payments have continued and the law permitted them to be continued. However, family allowances were not paid because the law did not permit them to be paid. The purpose of the Social Security Amendment Bill which is now before the House is to enable family allowances to be paid during that six weeks deferment period after a child leaves school until he becomes entitled to unemployment benefit or earlier if he or she obtains employment. Three other points were made by the honourable member for Bonython. Firstly, he commented upon the fact that a person who is involved in industrial action is not entitled to unemployment benefit during the continuance of that industrial action. He pointed out that if a person, during that period, were disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit and became sick he would be ineligible for sickness benefit. This true because it is believed that similar circumstances should apply during that period of industrial action and that someone who is involved in such action should not be advantaged merely because during the period while the industrial action continued he happened to become sick. Of course, once the industrial action is concluded, if the person remains unemployed because his employer is not able to employ him in the future or remains sick and is not able to return to work, in each case he becomes eligible for unemployment or sickness benefit as is appropriate. Secondly, a person whose unemployment benefit has been postponed because he or she fails the work test can be granted a sickness benefit during this postponement period if, during that period, he or she becomes sick. The honourable member for Bonython alleged that that was not the case. I bring to his attention the fact that in those circumstances when a person becomes sick although not eligible for unemployment benefit he can claim and will be granted, if the circumstances warrant, sickness benefit. Thirdly, in relation to unemployed school leavers who become sick during the six weeks deferment period between leaving school and, if they have not obtained work, becoming eligible for unemployment benefit the same situation also applies. If a school leaver becomes sick he can apply and be granted sickness benefit which can operate within six weeks from the leaving of school. I point out that, as a consequence, any family allowance that would otherwise be payable or additional pension or benefit that might be due to a pensioner or beneficiary parent would, of course, terminate from the time that the sickness benefit become payable. The honourable member for Henty expressed some concern about the family allowances paid in respect of students who continue on to tertiary education. If a student leaves secondary school with the intention of going on to a tertiary institution the parent continues to be entitled to family allowances. One of the difficulties that arise is that very often parents do not report to the Department of Social Security in response to the questionnaires that are sent out as to the intention of their children. As a result the family allowance is stopped. When, early in the new year, the child takes up a tertiary course the family allowance can be claimed and paid as a lump sum. If parents want the family allowance to be continued to be paid on a monthly basis they should advise the Department of Social Security. It is not a problem other than a problem in communication. I urge all honourable members and members of the public is to note that they should keep the Department of Social Security informed so that those benefits can be continue to be paid, either until the student becomes eligible for tertiary education assistance scheme payments or, alternatively, changes his mind and seeks to enter the work force and becomes eligible for the unemployment benefit. As to the final point made by the honourable member for Henty, I will take up those matters with my colleague the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and ask him to look at the question of the taxation impact on social security beneficiaries. As I am sure the honourable member for Henty will be aware, one has to look at that tax question in the context of achieving equity between low income beneficiaries and low income members of the work force. I will refer that matter to the Minister so that it can be examined. The Government, in difficult circumstances, is anxious to review as sensitively as it possibily can anomalies that result in hardships. This Bill is a clear illustration of the manner in which the Government is desirous of ensuring that the social security system aims to assist those in need, and does so in a fair and equitable way.

113,Mr MACPHEE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have your indulgence to suggest that the House have a general debate covering the Conciliation and Arbitration (Complementary Industrial Relations System) Amendment Bill and the Conciliation and Arbitration (Government Service) Amendment Bill 1982 as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.",59
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"ls it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these two measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",59
115,Mr HAWKE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Opposition supports this legislation. Given the circumstances, which I will make clear, I am able to state the position on behalf of the Opposition in a relatively brief period. The Minister for Employment and Indusrial Relations (Mr Macphee) spoke on this Bill, the Conciliation and Arbitration (Complementary Industrial Relations System) Amendment Bill, on 21 October. I find myself very substantially in agreement with the observations then made by the Minister. I think he would, however, understand that we find it difficult to read without some semblance of mirth his reference to the events of 1979-81 as representing some constructive period on the part of the Government in pursuing proposed national inquiries into wage determination and industrial relations. I will not visit upon him the sins of his predecessor; they speak for themselves. Much more is it to my concern and the concern of the Opposition that we indicate that the specific provisions before the House meet with our approval. The realities of the problem to which this proposed legislation addresses itself cannot be denied; that is, the problem that arises from the fact that we have conflicting jurisdictions in regard to industrial relations. As in so much of our current Third Reading affairs, we have inflicted upon us the inadequacies that result from constitutional arrangements made in another day which, whilst they may well have been relative to the minds of those drawing up the arrangements in the last decade of the 1890s, cannot be said to be appropriate to the needs of an economy and society as we come to the end of the twentieth century. We as an Australian community pay a very heavy price in so BILL 1982 many respects for the fact that the division of powers between the Federal and State governSecond Reading ments represents a division of powers which in another place and in another time, as I have said, represent the meanderings of British explorers some 150 years ago. I guess it is very hard to find another area of our affairs in which this observation is so true. Without burdening the House with a detailed recitation of the events of that time, it will be in the minds of many honourable members that in fact it was almost an accident at the end of the third Constitutional Convention in 1898 that any power was given to the Federal Parliament. A switch of two votes at that 1898 Convention would have meant that no power was to be available to the newly-created Federal Parliament. Indeed the terminology of section 51 (xxxv) of the Constitution gave rise to the variegated nature of industrial jurisdictions in this country. It was not a power, as we know, directly over wages, salaries and conditions of employment but over conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of anyone State. In the process of interpretation by the High Court of Australia that power had a coverage far beyond the anticipations of our Convention fathers who imagined that that Federal power would probably be confined to three industries. If we read the Convention debates we will find that no speaker really identified any more than one of three industriesthe maritime industry, the coal industry and the shearing industry. Apart from those it was anticipated that the State jurisdictions would cover industrial relations. The High Court ruled that a dispute was constituted merely by the serving and receipt of a paper of demand and the rejection of that demand. The concept of inter-Stateness occurred when a dispute happened in more than one State. Given that sort of interpretation developed by the High Court, the powers and coverage of the Federal jurisdiction became much more extensive than had been anticipated. Nevertheless, that being so a very real power has been left to the States. Hence, on so many occasions this community has had to pay a high price for that conflict of jurisdiction. I guess there is no area of the economy in which that has been more pressingly obvious than the oil industry, particularly in regard to New South Wales. Therefore, it is with an understanding of the problems created by this actual and potential conflict of jurisdiction that, as the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations said in his speech on 21 October, we have before us this legislation which essentially seeks to do three things. They are pointed out in the explanatory memorandum. The proposals state: (i) provide a procedure for the conduct of joint proceedings of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission with a prescribed State Industrial Authority; (ii) provide for an expansion of the powers trial Boards to enable the Commission dispute to a member of a State Industrial Authority; (iii) provide for the nomination of a member of the Australian Commission to act as a member of a State Industrial Authority. As the Minister has said, the provisions of this Bill reflect, as they should, the processes of consultation between the Federal Government and the State governments through the mechanisms which have been appropriately established. The legislation also represents the outcome of full discussions with the trade union movement and the national employers through the National Labour Consultative Council. That is the way in which a consideration of industrial relations ought to operate. In these circumstances, the Opposition has considered the proposals contained in the Bill. We, in turn, have discussed the legislation with our colleagues in the industrial movement. We are able to say that the legislation has our approval for those reasons. I conclude my remarks on this Bill by expressing the hope that in the time ahead there may develop a degree of bipartisanship on this issue of the division of industrial relationships. There is no virtue or advantage for the Labor Party or the non-Labor parties in this country in maintaining this source of division and conflict in the industrial relations field. It does no one any good; it certainly does not do the people of Australia any good at all. I hope that the consensus that exists between us on this issue today may be reflected in future attempts to try to eliminate, as far as possible, the industrial disputation that can arise from this conflict of jurisdiction. The second Bill which we are considering cognately with the Conciliation and Arbitration (Complementary Industrial Relations System) Amendment Bill is the Conciliation and Arbitration (Government Service) Amendment Bill. I say on behalf of the Opposition that, as with the first Bill, we support this legislation. The proposal before the House represents the outcome of consultations with the trade union movement and the employers which began-at many times it seems almost prehistory days to me-in the days when I was President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It represents the outcome of very detailed considerations by the industrial parties and the Government. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will appreciate and as the Minister said in his second reading speech on 10 November, the Bill essentially represents the logical outcome of a process which really began in the 1950s when provisions were made to try as far as possible to get a degree of integration of Local Indusbetween the two major federal arbitral to refer an industrial jurisdictionsthat is, the conciliation and arbitration system proper and the area of arbitration under the Public Service Arbitrator. The proposals for gradual integration of those two jurisdictions, as the Minister said in his speech, commenced in the 1950s. The proposals now to vest the jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission are the logical outcome of those developments during the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s. I repeat that this legislation represents the outcome of consultation between the Minister, the Government and the parties. As I believe the Minister will be indicating in a moment, that process of consultation which was reflected in the legislation as it now stands before us, has also been reflected in an amendment which I understand the Minister will be moving. The amendment arises from the fact that when the parties looked at the legislation a consideration arose as to the founding of jurisdiction for organisations in the Public Service. I understand that the Government has agreed to amend the proposal to meet that point. I have to say, Mr Deputy Speaker, as probably will not have escaped you, that there is a certain irony in the situation confronting us. At almost 3.30 in the afternoon we are considering a proposed amendment to the main legislation, which proposed amendment is based upon the implicit premise that there should be no ground for distinction or differentiation between the Commonwealth public sector employees and those of the private sector. That is obviously the implicit assumption in this amending legislation we are considering now. I think it is a valid, implicit assumption. But within another hour or so we will be considering a further amendment the Minister will be moving which will ensure the possibility of there being a very distinct differentiation between employees in the Commonwealth public sector and those in the private sector-- that is, if the Government and those associated with it are not successful when they go before the Arbitration Commission later this week to try to get a wage freeze in the private sector the result of the legislation to be introduced later today will be to put employees in the Commonwealth public sector in a distinctly different category from those in the private sector. As I have said, the irony of that situation should not escape us. However, it is not appropriate to develop that point in this debate. Rather I am concerned about making it clear to the House at this stage that the proposals and the thrust of this legislation not only have the support of the Opposition but also are welcomed by us.",59
116,Mr SPENDER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I wish to confine my remarks to the Conciliation and Arbitration (Complementary Industrial Relations System) Amendment Bill. This Bill is a modest but, nonetheless, important move to coordinate the work of six State industrial tribunals with that of the federal tribunal. As the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) have pointed out, the Bill has three aims. The first is to provide for joint sittings of Commonwealth and State industrial tribunals. Secondly, in the Bill arrangements are proposed which, as the Minister has stated: . . . will permit the President of the Commission to refer a matter to an industrial board constituted by a State industrial authority, and that authority the dispute Thirdly, the Bill empowers the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to deal with disputes in State jurisdictions, when requested to do so by a State industrial authority. By these means it is hoped to overcome some of the jurisdictional problems that bedevil our systems of industrial relations and to promote a greater degree of co-ordination between State and federal tribunals. But the very need to propose these innovations, as the honourable member for Willis has pointed out, illustrates how ill-constituted the present systems are to our times and how overdue they are for reform. Regardless of how the world looked in 1901, we have travelled a long way since then and the well-intended proposals to divide industrial powers between the State and Federal governments which have been enshrined in our Constitution have fostered rather than prevented disputes and have produced a vast body of technical and costly law. Let us consider, for example, the provision in the Bill for the joint sittings of a State tribunal and the Commonwealth Commission. The Minister has stated: It is envisaged that each tribunal. while it would sit with the other and hear the matter simultaneously would exercise only the powers conferred by its own constituative legislation and would make a separate decision though ideally in identical terms in its own jurisdiction. The appeal. reference and review conditions applicable by reasons of the constituative legislation of each tribunal would apply to each decision made in the jurisdiction. While it is constitutionally unavoidable, is it not absurd that after joint sittings separate decisions should be given and separate appellant procedures should be open? What if the decisions differ either at first instance or on appeal? What of the proposal-which I welcome that the Federal Commission, when requested to do so by a State authority, is to deal with disputes in a State jurisdiction? The States have apparently agreed to enact legislation to give effect to this proposal and to the two other proposals contained in the Bill. This means that we are depending for the putting into effect of this proposal and the other proposals on the enactment of legislation by the various States, presumably travelling at different speeds and with a greater or lesser sense of urgency. In the end problems arise. We cannot force the States to legislate; we can only persuade, cajole and pray. Whenever the subject of jurisdictional problems between State and federal industrial tribunals, or that of co-operative legislation in the field of industrial relations, arises, I am reminded of the inquiry conducted by His Honour Mr Justice Sweeney. The terms of reference of the Committee of Inquiry into Co-ordinated Industrial Relations, which was set up in February will be empowered to settle 1974, required the Committee to inquire into, amongst other things: A. The desirability of a system of organisation and/or registration of employee and employer organisations which would enable the one body to represent in terms of legal personality. structure, organisation and otherwise its members in both Australian and State arbitration systems. B. Means by which such a system if desirable may be achieved. The terms of reference finished with the following words: The Committee will conduct its enquiries with a view to recommending such action as is necessary and desirable in the light of its enquiry so as to enable the efficient functioning of employer and employee organisations under systems of Australian and State conciliation and arbitration and the efficient functioning of such systems. The Sweeney inquiry resulted from the decision of the Australian Industrial Court in Moore v. Doyle, a decision of 1969. I shall quote three excerpts from the judgment, as the problems there outlined are as real, as relevant and as pressing now as they were then. The judgment stated: Cases referred to earlier in this judgment are further illustrations of the web of problems and technicalities which have developed in the system of trade union organisation in Australia It stated further: The system as required to lation and as it has evolved under that legislation in practice technical. productive of artificialities and in urgent attention of the law reformer It went on to state: A system of trade union organisation is urgently needed which would enable the one body to represent its relevant members in both the federal and State arbitration systems and it should be possible for federal and State authorities to examine the question whether organisations and trade unions can be provided with such a system. I wish to say something about one aspect of the report of the inquiry; that is, what it had to say about dual registration. In its report, given within a few months of the appointment of the Committee, on the subject of continuing the systems of dual registration of essentially the same body in both federal and State jurisdictions the Committee said that it had: submissions. written and oral. from bodies and organisations representing the majority of both employee and employer organisations. They were unanimous that a change in the present system was desirable. It also said: Those concerned with operating a system of dual registration and incorporation clamoured for a change. Well they might do so. What became of the Sweeney inquiry? In 1974 legislation was enacted by this Parliament to give effect to the recommendations of the inquiry. Amongst other things, this legislation was intended to facilitate representation by the one body of the industrial interests of employers and employees in both State and federal systems and to go some distance toward overcoming the need for State and federal unions to exist side by side as mirror images of each other for the purposes of representing their members' interests in the State and federal systems. To achieve this end the legislation was quite ineffectual. Nothing has changed. We are still in a jurisdictional jungle which at times makes the Income Tax Assessment Act appear by comparison to be a simple and lucidly expressed piece of legislation. From this jungle the State and federal tribunals, the employers and the employees and the organisations who represent their industrial interests, seek in vain to extricate themselves, faced as they are with precisely the same kinds of impractical difficulties that were exposed in the decision in Moore v. Doyle-now over 10 years ago. Co-operative legislation of the kind envisaged in the Conciliation and Arbitration (Complementary Industrial Relations System) Amendment Bill may bring about some improvements in the working of our industrial systems, but they will be very much in the nature of improvements on the margin. This is not to detract from the importance of the work done to bring about this Bill, exist by State and federal legisis but the central problem remains: The existence of need of the seven jurisdictions and what flows from this fact-the inability of the one organisation to represent in all jurisdictions the industrial interests of its members. In this House we have different views on industrial relations, on the importance of unions, on the legitimate reach of their powers and on their role in the political, social and economic life of this country. But, as the honourable member for Wills has pointed out, we all have a common interest in a sane and simple system for the regulation of industrial relations. So long as Australia is divided into seven jurisdictions - I exclude minor jurisdictions - it will be impossible to achieve either sanity or simplicity. There is only one cure-a determined assault by the States and the Commonwealth aimed at simplifying the seven systems. Ideally there should be only one system but experience teaches us how unlikely it is that the States will be willing to surrender their powers to the Commonwealth, and the difficulties faced in achieving a single system through a referendum in the face of hostile States are all too obvious. Short of a referendum our objectives should be twofold: Firstly, to enable the one body to represent its members' industrial interests in all jurisdictions; and, secondly, by co-operation, or by the limited reference of State powers to the Commonwealth, to enable the State and Commonwealth industrial tribunals to operate effectively as one tribunal, with full power to deal with all industrial questions speedily, on their merits and untrammelled by the jurisdictional disputes and the many other legal technicalities that are endemic to the existing systems.

118,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,-- You may proceed.,63
119,Mr MACPHEE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The work of the FederalState working party to which the honourable BILL 1982 member for North Sydney referred apropros the Second Reading Sweeney inquiry into the Moore and Doyle case is continuing. One of the items being looked at is a single registration system. We hope that more progress still will be made in that area. I should now explain the amendments I have moved to the Conciliation and Arbitration (Government Service) Amendment Bill 1982, which was introduced in the House on 10 In Committee November 1982. Broadly, the Bill seeks to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 by repealing the Public Service Arbitration Act 1920 and investing the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission with jurisdiction over public sector employment which was formerly covered by the Public Service Arbitrator and other relevant tribunals. The Public Service Arbitration Act deems public sector employment to be an industry for the purposes of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act so that an organisation may be registered by reference to that industry. Although the government service Bill classes public sector employment as an inelustry, the wording of the Bill restricts that to the prevention and settlement of public sector disputes. It is not the intention of the Bill to take away the basis for public sector employment being deemed to be in an industry for the purpose of registration of an organisation under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Proposed amendments (I), (2) and (4) remedy the defects. (whether a body corporate or not, The Conciliation and Arbitration (Complementary Industrial Relations System) Amendment Bill 1982, which was just dealt with by the House, inserts a new section 44B in Division 1 of Part 3 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, empowering the Commission to refer disputes to State industrial authorities. The Bill now before the House includes provisions excluding the operation of that section in disputes concern'(other ing the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority or Commonwealth projects. Proposed amendment (3) is a consequential amendment and of a formal nature to ensure that the provisions of the government service Bill dealing with Commonwealth Government employment are excluded from the operation of section 44B. The amendments numbered (I), (2) and (4) that have been circulated derive from certain matters brought to my attention by the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association and the Australian Council of Trade Unions after they had studied the Bill. The amendments are a response to what the ACOA has put to me in discussions which took place between the ACOA and ACTU officials and officials of my Department. I acknowledge the matter of substance which was raised with me. Certainly, there was no intention on the part of the Government to have a provision in the Bill which would take away the concept of Commonwealth public sector employment being an industry for the purpose of registration of an organisation in or in connection with an industry. It was not thought that the Bill interfered with this concept but, on studying what had been put to me, we concluded that the Bill did need adjustment. That is why I moved this amendment. In a spirit of proper consultation the terms of the amendments were given to the ACTU and the ACOA to inform them of the Government's intention. There was then some correspondence between the ACOA and my Department on technical points. My Department received a letter from the ACOA which says: Generally speaking the drafting satisfies the substantial point raised about the treatment of Australian Government Employment as an industry for purposes of the Act. The letter goes on, nevertheless, to express some reservations about the amendment. My Department has replied to that letter. The gist of the reply is that we can see no reason to depart from what is in the amendment now proposed. I have shown the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) the latest correspondence, just as he has seen the earlier letters between the ACOA and me. I therefore commend the amendments to the Committee.",63
120,Mr HAWKE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"1 will be very brief in regard to this matter. I think that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) has accurately put the matter. The unions raised a legitimate point regarding their capacity to organise in the industry identified. It is to the credit of the Minister and his Department that they have responded with alacrity and positively to the real problem that was raised by the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association. It is also correct, as the Minister indicated, that he has been good enough to show me the correspondence between him and Mr Munro of the ACOA. I understand, through not having received any further communication from the ACOA or the Australian Council of Trade Unions, that they have concluded that the action taken by the Government in bringing this amendment before us meets the substance of the point of concern that they expressed. For those reasons, on behalf of the Opposition, as with the main Bill, the Conciliation and Arbitration (Complementary Industrial Relations System) Amendment Bill, I express no opposition to the amendments which the Minister has brought before us. Amendments agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report - by leave-adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Macphee)-by leave-read a third time. INCOME TAX (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1982 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 September, on motion by Mr Howard: That the Bill be now read a second time.",64
121,Mr WILLIS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Gellibrand) (3.47)· The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill, currently before the House, is entirely uncontroversial. The Opposition does not oppose it. The Bill seeks to ratify double taxation agreements entered into with the Republic of Korea on 12 July this year and the Kingdom of Norway on 6 May this year. Several such Bills have been passed in previous years along similar lines and have always been supported by the Opposition. The provisions of this Bill are essentially the same as the previous legislation and again have the support of the Opposition. In addition to the two treaties dealt with by this Bill, Australia currently has treaties in force with 15 other countries. These are: the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, the Philippines, Switzerland, Malaysia, Sweden and Denmark. Tax treaties have become an essential feature of the international income tax system and are directed towards eliminating international double taxation which would have a harmful effect on the exchange of goods and services and international movements of capital and persons, and towards preventing international tax avoidance and evasion. To overcome these problems, taxing rights over certain classes of income are reserved entirely for the country of residence of the person deriving the income. Generally, these are commercial profits if the recipient has no permanent establishment in the country of origin, air transport and shipping profits, pensions, civil service remunerations, remuneration for personal services, if the visit does not exceed 183 days, teaching remuneration and cultural royalties. All other income may be taxed by the country of origin, but the taxing powers for some classes of income are limited. For example, tax on dividends paid to non-residents is generally limited to 15 per cent, compared with the normal dividend withholding tax of 30 per cent. This is to ensure that the effective tax on the dividend income, including the tax on the initial company profits imposed by the country of origin, is less than the tax on the dividend charged by the country of residence, otherwise there would be a disincentive for continued investment in the country from which the dividend is derived. In addition, withholding tax on interest is often limited to 10 per cen t so t ha t residen ts of a borrowi ng country are not at a disadvantage when seeking loans for business purposes. The third category is withholding tax on royalties, which again is limited so that manufacturing rights and know how can be obtained for development purposes at a reasonable cost. These tax treaty provisions may result in a loss to revenue to one or other of the treaty countries, but this has been accepted by governments in the light of the favourable impact of such agreements on trade and investment flows. Probably the most significant aspect of our treaties, especially given the vast international financial and trade networks established by multinational corporations, is the section in each treaty modelled after Article 9 of the so-called model Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development taxation agreement which allows the reconstruction of profits of associated entities which have obviously been engaging in transfer pricing activities. Given the problems evident in section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act which seeks to deal with transfer pricing, this provision of our double tax treaties has generally been regarded as the most effective weapon available to the Taxation Office against transfer pricing. However, as the use of this section is limited to treaty countries and as of the many recognised tax havens we have a treaty only with Switzerland, its usefulness is very limited and in no way precludes effective action in a number of other areas to overcome this tax avoidance problem. The Government has taken one such step by rewriting section 136 to overcome the many defects which have been revealed by recent court decisions. However, in the Opposition's view, without a series of other measures Australia's tax system will still be susceptible to abuse by tax avoidance and evasion on an international scale. Most importantly, the Government should move quickly to introduce a foreign tax credit system to eliminate the use of tax havens to avoid Australian taxes. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) moved in 1978 to introduce just such a system. In his speech proposing the legislation at that time he outlined strongly the abuses of our tax system which are occurring because Australia does not have such a tax. In most cases income derived overseas which has been taxed at some rate in a foreign country will not be taxed when it comes into Australia. This provision means that many companies are able artificially to transfer income which would have been earned in Australia to overseas tax havens where it is taxed at an extremely low rate and then brought into Australia free of further tax. For instance, the company tax rate in Hong Kong is of the order of 15c to 17c in the dollar. In Australia it is 46c in the dollar. So if one can arrange to have one's company income taxed in Hong Kong at 15c in the dollar and then brought to Australia, one saves 31 c in the dollar. Because of the way in which the tax system is structured at present, one does not have to pay any further tax and has avoided the 46c rate which would have applied in this country. However, the Treasurer quickly backed down in the face of the pressure from Australian business interestes who were using tax havens and withdrew the proposed legislation. The Australian Labor Party has announced that it will, when elected to government, introduce such a foreign tax credits system which will tax all income coming into Australia at Australian rates with a credit for any tax levied overseas. This will remove all advantages of transferring income which would otherwise be earned in Australia to overseas tax havens. Secondly, whilst Australian tax treaty provisions provide access to a certain amount of information on the activities of transnational corporations in other treaty countries, it is abundantly clear that this is nowhere near enough to allow the Taxation Office effectively to police transfer pricing activities. What is needed is the enactment in Australia of a code of conduct to be observed by transnational corporations which provides, amongst other things, for the provision of wide-ranging information to the Australian Government. For example, guidelines formulated by the OECD require multinational corporations to disclose detailed information on their structure, the operations of affiliates, areas of operation, employment, sales, pricing and investment policies and accounting procedures. Such guidelines in force in Australia would provide the Taxation Office with much of the information necessary to overcome transfer pricing. It is quite scandalous that this Government, obviously beholden to financial support from the large corporations, has failed to take this absolutely necessary action even though such action has been strongly recommended by the OCED which, as honourable members will be aware, is hardly a radical body. In summary, while the Opposition supports the Bill currently before the House we feel that the Australian tax system is still wide open to abuse by large corporations using tax havens and transfer pricing activities. A number of measures can be taken to end such abuses, but it is obvious that this Government does not have the willpower to do so. A Labor government, when elected to office next year, will take such necessary action to put an end to these massive ripoffs. Such actions are essential to the creation of a fairer tax system in Australia.",64
122,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"ln supporting the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill I recognise, as does the Opposition, that it complies with previous legislation concerning agreements and contracts made with other nations. I think it is significant that this Bill relates particularly to the Republic of Korea and the Kingdom of Norway. It is as well for the House to reflect on the fact that Korea, a nation in the Pacific region, has maintained and is increasing the amount of trade between our two countries. We sell to Korea coal, minerals and food products in return for which an increasing amount of manufactured products come back to this country. This agreement is evidence of that increasing trade. It is the type of trade that we should welcome. The legislation also highlights the fact that multinational companies are conducting this type of trade and will be prevented by this Bill from manipulating accounts, by transfer pricing arrangements and similar methods. The Bill actually specifies the difference in the tax rates of the two countries the 15 per cent tax on dividends, interest and royalties in Korea compared with the 30 per cent tax on Australian sourced income from dividends. This relates to another very important comparison. Korea has a lower rate of direct taxation compared with our rate, which is acknowledged to be high. In fact some rates of individual taxation are too high, with top rates of 60c in the lar on amounts in excess of $35,000. The increase in productivity in Singapore, Hong Kong and now Korea is related to the fact that they are countries with low personal tax rates compared with our own. There is a message for us in that regard. As I mentioned previously, there is an increasing amount of traffic and trade between Korea and Australia, not only in regard to the basic trade and manufacturing items but also in regard to Korea's financial interest in Australia. I bring to the attention of the House the Korean contribution to the conglomerate which intends to take up sugar growing on the Ord River in Western Australia, that capital being mixed with capital from a Western Australian source. I am not sure to what degree capital from Korea will be invested in this project or the extent to which the Australian Government might have control over the entry of that capital, but I use it as an example of Korea's interest in Australia's future. We in Queensland are concerned about Korea's entry into a sligar industry on the Ord River because of the repercussions that might have for the total Australian sugar industry, particularly as Australian rates of personal income tax are probably greatly in excess of those in Korea. I am not suggesting that this international agreement might have any influence in this regard but I hope that all aspects of this transfer of funds between one nation and another might be looked at by the Foreign Investment Review Board very carefully to make sure that no abuse of the present system will be perpetuated. In particular I think it has to be realised that if there is abuse of the system it could be to the detriment of the great Australian sugar industry which has flourised over the last 100 years; that industry is maintaining its place and is providing valuable export income. The purpose of this Bill is to try to prevent abuses that might be available without these agreements. The difference in rates between some of our Asian nations and ourselves has already been explained. I believe it is also important to realise that some of the international shipping and oil companies that have made transfer arrangements have to be watched very closely to make sure that there is no abuse of the system as far as Australia is concerned. I firmly believe that income earned in Australia should be fairly reflected and should not be subject to any international transfer entries or arrangements. Australia should be given the advantage of receiving tax on the correct amount of income properly earned within its shores. As I have said, this Bill relates to tax abuse. I dolnotice that the Opposition could not miss the opportunity of talking about tax avoidance. When we dealt with the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union this matter was very hotly debated around Australia. In fairness to those people around Australia listening to the debate today who might feel that avoidance is something that this Government is neglecting, I have to point to the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has done more than any other Treasurer in Australia's history to come to grips with the tax avoidance situation. He did it by Mr WiIIis-- There has never been so much of it.",66
123,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member for Gellibrand says that there has never been so much of it. Every flower must come from a seed. This tax avoidance seed was germinated back in 1972-75 in the time of the Labor Government. I welcome that interjection. Many of these seeds germinated in the time when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) was Treasurer. They have come to fruition in our time. I do not think the Opposition can take much credit as far as its involvement in this area is concerned. Mr HodgmanWho was the Treasurer? Mr Jacobi-Cut it out!,67
124,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member for Hawker has just interjected. I think back to the Curran scheme. The honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) would recognise that the Curran scheme was created in the early 1970s and came under the notice of successive Treasurers in the Labor Government. They said that they would move against that scheme. The movement in 1972-75 was not towards the elimination of tax avoidance but, as we all know, towards a heavy increase in tax collections around Australia and the growth of inflation. Certainly the Australian Labor Party can take no credit whatsoever for its part in the tax avoidance fight. In fact I have often said that that was the generation that spurred Australians to get into tax avoidance schemes. I come back now to the point with which I was dealing. I believe that tax avoidance in Australia has ceased at the moment. I use as evidence of this the fact that the major promoters from the cities of Melbourne and Sydney in the south of Australia-those promoters did not operate successfully in Queensland-have lost their staff and have gone out of business. Under the new legislation enacted by the Treasurer they can find no room to move in that area. Under the measures adopted by this Government, as recommended by the Treasurer, I believe tax avoidance has stopped. I wish to mention not just the area of tax avoidance but also abuse and evasion. For too long the people of Australia have been confused between tax avoidance and evasion. Tax avoidance is where people can legally avoid taxation because of the framing of laws or because of the encouragmeent of the laws. Tax evasion has been illegal all the time. There is a great increase in tax evasion by means of the cash economy not only in Australia but also throughout the world. I have heard that in Italy the black economy, the cash economy or the subterranean economywhatever one wishes to call it-- represents almost 40 per cent of declared income. So tax avoidance is flourishing in that area. Recently, in America, I had the opportunity of speaking with the staff of a Senate committee who indicated to me that the loss to taxation revenue in the United States of America was $100 billion a year; that is, 20 per cent of its normal collections from personal taxation. In Australia the figure for evaded income is said to be between $10 billion and $15 billion a year. Tax on that amount is about $5 billion or $6 billion. If there is anything with which both parties would want to come to grips-certainly our party does, and I would like to-it would be this aspect of the loss to Australian revenue through the cash economy. Mr CampbellYou never did anything about your shonky Chief Justice. Mr BRAITHWAITEAITEIt is obvious to all honourable members that a certain honourable member who has just come into the chamber has no knowledge of the subject we are discussing but just wants his presence felt. I suggest that he might make his",67
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Order! In view of the fact that the interjection has been answered and has been recorded in Hansard I ask the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to withdraw that remark.,67
126,Mr CAMPBELL,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Withdraw what?,67
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I ask the honourable member to withdraw his interjection which is a reflection on a member of the judiciary.,67
128,Mr CAMPBELL,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That Barwick was shonky? Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER I have asked the honourable member to withdraw.,67
129,Mr CAMPBELL,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"All right, I will withdraw it then.",67
130,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am trying to have a sensible debate on what I believe are real problems facing the Australian economy. We have been talking about an equitable and fair taxation system which at this moment is being circumvented by the cash economy. Nobody has a monopoly on this problem as I understand it could be practised by most Australian taxpayers right across the board. It is a problem at this time when people are looking to the Government to spend more to get the economy moving as far as the employment situation is concerned. It also is denying Australians the opportunity of moving into more productive areas of expenditure. It is also a problem because when that $5 billion to $8 billion is not available to the revenue it means that the Government spends in excess of its income and we move into a deficit situation. I have mentioned before that a deficit situation purely means that this generation is living beyond its means and it is putting the national debt on to the generations yet to come. It also affects Australia inasmuch as it understates the situation as far as the gross domestic product is concerned. Mr CampbeIl-- You are just trying to take the pressure off your party. Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE .. I suggest that it is a pity that the honourable member opposite cannot use as an excuse to interject that he is under the influence of liquor because the interjections are so remote from what is being debated here that one might forgive him for being in that state. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKEROrder! That is a reflection on the honourable member. I think the honourable member should withdraw that remark. Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE Mr Deputy Speaker, I will withdraw it if I can be given protection from such inane and insulting interjections. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER The honourable member should withdraw unqualifiedly and not cast reflections on the Chair. Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw. I come back to what I believe is a serious subject the Opposition is not treating it in that way and that is how any government or any party in Australia can come to grips with this other form of abuse, the cash economy. 1 mentioned before that this does affect our gross domestic product. It affects aspects of the unemployment situation for example, people registering for unemployment benefit, yet still being in receipt of a cash income. The statistics to measure and compare how the economy of this country performs are thrown out of kilter to that extent. This is something within the tax area that I feel very strongly about. I certainly hope that the two major parties in Australia might be able to come together on this matter because it is something that affects not only this generation, also generations yet to come. I understand that the Bill has the support of the Opposition. I speak in support of it on behalf of my party. I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House.",67
131,Mr MORRIS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"As the shadow Treasurer pointed out earlier, the Opposition does not oppose the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill. I would like, in the few minutes available, to make some response to the comments by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). Let me point out at the outset that in Labor's two short periods of government between 1970 to 1974 and 1974-75 at a time when the Parliament was under consistent attack by those who now sit opposite and at a time when the Senate witnessed an unheralded level of obstruction and disruption the then Labor Government was able to legislate against a range of tax schemes and tax avoidance rackets that had prospered under a succession of previous conservative governments the MCMahon Government, the Gorton Government, the Holt Government and the Menzies Government. It is quite puerile for the honourable member who has just resumed his seat to claim that Labor did nothing about tax avoidance. Most was done by the Labor Government at a time when this Parliament was debased by planned disruption and obstruction. This Government has had some seven years to put its house in order. Let us look at the facts about tax avoidance. Between 1975-76 and 1981-82 the number of identified tax avoidance schemes in this country multiplied by 33; that is, there was a 33-fold increase in the level of taxation avoidance in just the identified schemes. The $15 billion of tax that has been stolen from the coffers of Consolidated Revenue by the supporters of this Government have been identified by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The honourable member made no mention of that. All of this roguery and theft, as it has been described by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), has occurred under seven years of conservative administration since 1975. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat debases this Parliament and debases public discussion when he seeks to offload responsibility for the theft of public money, the $15 billion that has been stolen from Consolidated Revenue during this Government's life, not under a Labor government. For 30 years out of the 33 years since World War II the treasury benches have been controlled by those who sit opposite and their ilk. What has as 1 said, but developed? Mr Hodgman Hear, hear!",68
132,Mr MORRIS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"-Of course, the Minister would say, 'Hear, hear', because his party has benefited from what I am going to say. His party has benefited from the massive explosion in the level of taxation avoidance and it has robbed the ordinary householder. Pensioners are paying 20 per cent sales tax on a can of pet food. From I January there has been a 7+ per cent sales tax on manchester-on sheets and pillow cases. That is a tax on sleep from this Government. It will not get such taxes from the rogues and the thieves who contribute to its party funds but it takes it from the ordinary householders who are battling to keep the home together. Let us not have any more cant from honourable members opposite about equity in the sharing of the taxation burden. They talk about an equitable and fair taxation system. They have developed in this country since 1975 a scheme that has fostered the growth of taxation avoidance, that has protected rogues and thieves and which has led to a major contribution to the party funds of the Government parties. That is what the game is all about. It is not enough to mouth a few words, as honourable members opposite do, and try to get off the hook now. The essence of the debate is this: Taxation avoidance has prospered and been fostered by those who sit opposite. They have not acted fully or even reasonably to collect the money that has been stolen. They have sought, instead, to shift the incidence of the taxation burden away from direct taxation, the fairest means of taxation; that is, one should pay tax according to one's income and according to one's responsibilities. They have shifted away from that principle to the principle of indirect taxation under which everybody pays the same level of tax on consumer goods or services irrespective of their ability to pay, irrespective of their income or irrespective of their family liabilities. It is an unfair system. It is an obscene system and it is a system that will be changed by an incoming Labor government back to a fair, honest, reasonable system of direct income tax and to a system where the thieves who have been promoted by those opposite will be brought to book. No more needs to be said other than to repeat that those who have prospered under tax avoidance have done it under the auspices and the encouragement of those who now sit in government. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Hodgman) read a third time. NA Bill presented by Mr Macphee, and read a first time.",68
133,Mr MACPHEE,SALARIES AND WAGES PAUSE BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill and its accompanying Bill, the Special Employment-related Programs Bill 1982, is to give effect on the Commonwealth's side to the agreement reached at the Premiers Conference last week. As the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) reported to the House on 8 December 1982, at the Premiers Conference there was general support for the widest and most effective wage pause. The Premiers of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory agreed with the Commonwealth Government that this pause, which would apply to both the public and private sectors, should be for 12 months. The Premiers of the other States will be seeking a six months pause. The Commonwealth indicated its intention to legislate for a wage pause in areas of its own employment. The States will be asked to extend the wage pause to their own areas of employment. The immediate effect of the legislation will be that savings to the Commonwealth Budget of the order of $300m should eventuate over the next 12 months. The necessary legislative authority for the expenditure of these funds, on employmentrelated projects throughout Australia of the Commonwealth's nomination, taking full account of the views of the States and the Northern Territory, will be dealt with in the accompanying Bill. There is no doubt that the international recession has impacted on our economy with a surprising suddenness. As the Acting Prime Minister said our domestic economic performance is being affected by a reduced demand for our exports, rock bottom commodity prices which have reduced the profitability of our resources sector and contracted plans for new resources investment while increased import competition is being experienced as overseas suppliers react to the variation in market opportunities facing them. I have no need to remind Australians that all this is happening during the worse drought in our Third Reading memory. These are serious problems. They require positive action by all who are interested in directing Australia back into a sound economic position. Developments in domestic wage outcomes have been far from helpful. Average weekly ordinary time earnings rose by about 17 per cent over the 1982 year to the September 1982 quarter. This increase is far in excess of the increase in the consumer price index of 12.3 per cent over the same period, and labour productivity which was virtually unSecond Reading changed. In addition, reductions in standard weekly hours are not reflected in the earnings figure. Australian businesses have not been able to compensate for these drastic increases in wage costs, due to weak domestic demand and the world economic recession. As a result profits have fallen by about 13 per cent over the last year and retrenchments have multiplied. Those in employment have increased their real incomes, while their less fortunate fellows have lost their jobs. For some time this Government has been arguing before arbitral tribunals for the greatest wage restraint possible. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wrote to the Remuneration Tribunal and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) appeared before that Tribunal in July last. The Government briefed counsel before the Academic Salaries Tribunal at about the same time. In both tribunals our submissions asked that the worsening economic situation be taken into consideration and that the tribunals give a lead in wage restraint. Then, in an unprecedented move, the Government, in view of its responsibility as manager of the economy, argued in the clericaladministrative case before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that current economic circumstances required that there should be no increase granted at all to some 112,000 public servants. In August the Commission, having taken into consideration the Government's assessment of the economy, awarded percentage rises substantially less for higher paid employees than those originally offered. Since then the economic situation has worsened and the level of unemployment has risen quite dramatically. It was in these circumstances that the Government decided to call together the Premiers and the Chief Minister on 7 December. Prior to the meeting discussions were sought with the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. In this Bill the Government is legislating for a l2-months' pause in wages and salaries and in reductions in standard working hours in its own employment. The Bill will suspend for 12 months the powers of certain tribunals, authorities, bodies or persons which could make awards or determinations that vary remuneration funded from Commonwealth sources. The definition included in the Bill will ensure that the Remuneration Tribunal, the Academic Salaries Tribunal, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the Public Service Board, and a whole range of other remuneration-fixing authorities will not be able to exercise these powers in respect of Commonwealth employees through the prescribed period. The Bill suspends the power of these remuneration-fixing authorities to make or vary any award, determination, decision, order, regulation or contract or to make, vary or certify any industrial agreement, so as to increase the rates, minimum rates, of any remuneration, or establish a new benefit in the nature of salary or wages payable in respect of Commonwealth employment. There is a similar suspension of powers in respect of reduction of the standard working hours in Commonwealth employment. The Remuneration Tribunal and the Academic Salaries Tribunal will no longer be empowered, through the prescribed period, to hold or continue any inquiries or to make any determinations or reports. These tribunals will not be able to make reports on related matters which could include electorate allowances, travelling allowances and other such payments. Similarly the other remunerationfixing authorities will be precluded from increasing rates of travelling allowances, expenses of office allowances, and other various allowances payable in respect of Commonwealth employment in Australia. It will apply in the same way to the remuneration and working hours of Commonwealth employees in the external territories. It will apply to Australia-based staff but not to locally-engaged staff at overseas posts. The definition of 'Commonwealth employee' is quite wide-ranging. It will include those persons either full time or part time, permanent or otherwise, in the administration of a territory, an authority of the Commonwealth, or a prescribed company. The definition includes members of the Defence Force. Over 470,000 persons will be covered by the legislation. As I indicated earlier, consideration has been given to those, other than Commonwealth employees, whose remuneration was wholly or significantly contributed from the Federal Budget. The Bill provides for suspension of the powers of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to hold or continue any inquiries or to make or issue any findings. In conformity with this it will deem that the Tribunal is not in contravention of sub-section 98BA (4) of the National Health Act 1953 by reason of the suspension of its powers. The effect of this will be that remuneration paid to pharmacists for dispensing of certain prescriptions will not be varied during the period of this pause. The remuneration of members of the medical profession is very significantly affected by the level of approved fees under the Health Insurance Act 1973. In these circumstances the Government in this Bill seeks to continue appropriate regulations during the period of the pause so that the level of fees approved for payment of benefits from registered health insurance funds will be maintained at current levels. This action obviously cannot of itself stop medical fees from rising. The Commonwealth will be approaching or the medical profession to seek the co-operation of all of its members in the application of a pause in medical charges for the next year. We will also be approaching industry leaders and the professional associations to seek their co-operation in respect of their own incomes to bring about a similar pause in fees and charges during the wage pause. We will be seeking a national effort. The Government has already announced that the thrust of its initiative is to prevent a new munity round developing in wages and salaries. However it is not the Government's intention to truncate the completion of the current community wage round that was potentially provided for in the national wage decision of May 1982. By that decision a broad standard was set as a notional upper limit to increases in wages and salaries from December 1982. That standard relates to the movement in the metal industry which was, for the tradesman fitter, $25 a week in December 1981 and a further $14 a week in June 1982. Appropriate proportionate amounts have been allowed for other classifications. Every offer that has been made to Commonwealth employees since May 1982 has been with the proviso that the rate being offered is tested against that national wage decision by the appropriate tribunal. Most, but not all, Commonwealth employees have received wage movements this year which have brought them to the level indicated by the national wage decision. The Commonwealth has determined that no action should be taken which would involve inequitable treatment of employees who have not as yet participated in the current community round. There is then provision for some exemptions in this Bill. Where a remuneration-fixing authority has entered into an agreement or taken a decision, on the matters covered by the Bill before the commencement of the pause it may give effect to that agreement or decision under this legislation. In addition, regulations could be made by the Governor General which would restore, to a specified remuneration-fixing authority, powers in relation to a specified matter which would be powers that, but for this legislation, would be exercisable by that authority. These exemptions will not be made lightly. Each particular case will be the subject of examination by Ministers before regulations are put before the Governor General. There are a number of classes of employee to whom offers have been made but the required examination by appropriate arbitral tribunals has not been completed. In some cases the examination of claims is still progressing and offers when made could be referred to the tribunals for evaluation against the national wage decision. The Government is prepared to use the exemption powers under the Bill to ensure that all its employees are treated equitably in respect of the current community wage round. In the matter of reduction of standard working hours in Commonwealth employment I want to refer to the negotiations that have been substantially completed following the Memorandum of Understanding agreed between the Australian com- Council of Trade Unions, the Public Service Board and my Department in June 1982. That memorandum of understanding set out the agreement of the Government and the ACTU that negotiations could take place which would identify agreed 'trade-offs' so that standard working hours could be reduced to 38 hours at negligible cost. It was agreed that, when completed, the agreements covering particular departments or authorities would be presented to the appropriate arbitral authority to test against the criterion of 'negligible cost'. Two of these negotiations have been completedWilliamstown Naval Dockyard and the Department of Transport and Construction. They were endorsed last Friday by a Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. To apply the pause to the other negotiations would be seen as a breach of faith by the Government. That is not our intention. In the departments and authorities that have substantially completed these hours negotiations we intend that they should be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible. Each case will be considered then by the Government and, if the criteria have been met, the Governor General will be advised so that regulations can be made to allow the appropriate arbitral tribunal to examine and evaluate the agreement reached. One of the requirements before any of these negotiations commenced was that an affirmative decision would not lead to 'f1ow-on' into the private sector of other non-Commonwealth public sectors. In the circumstances the Government will not be considering any agreements that would have the potential for 'f1ow-on'. In addition, the regulation-making power would be available if, in the national interest, it became necessary during the wage pause to have the remuneration of a particular class of employee examined by an appropriate tribunal. It is not envisaged that this will be required except in extreme circumstances. It is not the intention of the Government to say one thing and do another. It is our intention to prevent a new community wage round further eroding the strength of the Australian economy and to provide a breathing space to allow the economy to digest the large increases in real wages which have occurred over the past two years. I emphasise again that this legislation is in conformity with agreement reached at the Premiers Conference for action in the public sector. I ask honourable members to examine the legislation as a necessary part of the concerted action which the Government is taking in conjunction with other governments. I have already approached the President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to seek the immediate convening of a Full Bench to consider extending the wage pause to the private sector. Sir John Moore, the President, has agreed. We, the Commonwealth, will make our submissions on Thursday, 16 December. The Commonwealth will be supported by the governments of Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory in our submission to the Commission for a 12 months pause. We believe that the Labor States New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia-will support the private sector pause for a period of six months. Whilst this legislation is aimed at a pause in increases in remuneration and reduction in standard working hours for all those on the Commonwealth payroll it should not be seen as being discriminatory against those in the Commonwealth public sector. It is an essential part of our overall thrust, in co-operation with the governments of the States and the Northern Territory, to have in place a wages pause over the next 12 months and to provide the necessary basis for savings to the Commonwealth Budget to provide additional expenditure of $300m on employmentrelated activity in the course of 1983. The extent to which this legislation and our submissions to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the various employer and professional bodies in this country are successful will be of great significance to the future of the economy. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Hawke) adjourned. SPECIAL EMPLOYMENT - RELATED PROGRAMS BILL 1982 Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first time.",69
134,Mr HOWARD,SALARIES AND WAGES PAUSE BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, the Special Employment-related Programs Bill 1982, seeks the authority of Parliament to enable Government to fund certain useful programs throughout Australia. In recognition of the difficult employment circumstances facing many Australians the Bill is designed to provide worthwhile employment opportunities to a large number of our unemployed to an extent consistent with the Government's basic economic policies. As such, the Bill complements other employment-generating measures which the Government has introduced including, of course, the wage pause. Honourable members will be aware that the proposal to establish these special employmentrelated programs was raised with Premiers during the conference on 7 December. At that conference the Commonwealth Government indicated its preparedness to spend over the next 12 months the Commonwealth Budget savings resulting from a successful 1983 wage pause. The Bill thus demonstrates-in an immediate way-the important benefits which are available from an effective nation-wide wage pause for 1983. The exact amount of the savings which will eventually be available from the outcome of the Premiers' Conference is not certain. Estimates indicate that savings for the remainder of 1982-83 and for the first half of 1983-84 from a national 1983 wage pause could be of the order of $300m. That figure, which is reflected in the Bill, is a gross figure; no deduction has been made for the taxation receipts which otherwise would have acrued to the Commonwealth. The estimate is based on the expected balance of the bulk allowances for wage and salary increases provided for in the Commonwealth's 1982-83 Budget; an allowance for notional wage increases forgone in the first half of 1983-84; and Commonwealth savings resulting from a 1983 wage pause in Australia's primary, secondary and tertiary education sectors. Legislation has already been introduced to secure a wage pause for Commonwealth employees. Legislation will also be introduced to ensure savings from the education sectors are realised. We cannot estimate with certainty at this stage the actual level of savings that will be available as a consequence of the wages pause. As a result the Bill preserves flexibility for the Government to spend an amount consistent with the savings actually achieved. The Bill provides for expenditure Second Reading by the Commonwealth itself throughout Australia. It provides also for grants and advances of grants to be made to the State and Northern Territory governments-and through appropriate mechanisms to local government authorities-for the purpose of funding special programs. Such grants would be made either for approved programs or for programs of expenditure where agreement has been reached with the receiving government on matters such as the criteria against which programs would be judged. Where the States themselves take on additional staff for Commonwealth funded programs we would expect them to use, to the maximum extent posible, the services of the Commonwealth Employment Service. In this manner some preference for employment could be given to long term unemployed adults. In determining the allocation of any funds to States the Commonwealth will take into account factors such as population and the ability of State governments to identfy and facilitate work on worthwhile programs. Where it would be useful, funds could be provided to local government authorities. In such circumstances further criteria-such as the existence of comparatively high unemployment-would be brought to bear. The criteria for program funding which would apply to any grant to the States and local government authorities would be essentially the same as those which the Government would apply to funding Commonwealth programs under the Act. Eligible programs would need to be of high priority, to have high Australian materials and labour content and to be capable of being carried through quickly. Additionally, programs should desirably make a worthwhile and lasting contribution to national wealth; for example by improving productive capacity, adding to basic infrastructure or reducing future operating costs. The Government has decided that $IOOm will be allocated for welfare housing. Other projects which would meet the eligibility criteria include: Acceleration of capital works already under construction; repairs and maintenance to existing plant, machinery, roads and building; repairs and readily implemented upgrading of key elements of Australia's infrastructure; and minor works. Thus the Commonwelath will not be funding makework schemes or programs of only passing effect. It is not intended that the Commonwealth would seek matching funds from the States, although reports indicate that a number of State governments will be applying their Budget savings from the wage pause to similar employment-generating programs of a worthwhile kind. The Commonwealth will, however, seek to ensure that State governments would not use Commonwealth financing as a substitute for their own funding. Commonwealth statutory bodies which are not dependent on the Budget will also derive worthwhile savings from a wage pause. The Government expects these bodies to apply such nonBudget savings on programs of commercial merit, on reducing the need for wage induced increases to charges or on improving their longer run financial structure. It is evident that adoption of these courses by the Commonwealth's commercial bodies would provide at least short term opportunities for employment generation. The Commonwealth Government has suggested to the States that their commercial statutory authorities and local Government authorities could utilize the benefits of a wage pause in a similar manner and elements from the above approach are being adopted by some State Governments. The Government has attempted to estimate the employment effects from the proposals advanced in this Bill. Such estimates are not readily available as programs have not yet been determined, and different programs would have different employment consequences. In any case, it is difficult to calculate a net increase in employment, as account would need to be taken of the alternative uses to which the savings could have been applied-such as reducing the 1982-83 deficit and thus reducing upward pressures on interest rates. A rough estimate, however, suggests that direct employment generation on a gross basis could be of the order of 6,000 to 10,000 people. Naturally, second round effects would add significantly to that estimate. Of course, while these proposals to spend the savings are framed so as to give useful results, the larger employment and economic benefits accrue from the wage pause itself. Acceptance of that wage pause by the community, the States and the Commonwealth Parliament is needed if those benefits, and the benefits inherent in this Bill, are to be obtained. The Government welcomes the community wide support for a wage pause and acknowledges the support offered by the Premiers on 7 December. The Government now looks forward to the effective support of honourable members to whom I now commend this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Hawke) adjourned.

136,Mr MORRIS,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"- The Opposition believes that the improvements proposed in the motion before the chamber are needed. We accept that it is important that these works be referred to the Joint Committee on Public Works as soon as possible for examination, consideration and report. In that spirit the motion has the support of the Opposition. Question resolved in the affirmative. PETROLEUM (SUBMERGED LANDS) AMENDMENT BILL 1982 Debate resumed from 28 October, on motion by Sir James Killen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",74
137,Mr MORRIS,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND," The purpose of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill is to amend the principal Actthe Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967-so as to create in Bass Strait an area to be avoided by Australian ships over 200 tonnes gross tonnage. The Bill further provides for the application of penalties in the event of unauthorised entry and the granting of powers of enforcement to authorised persons. The Bill before us is in accordance with the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf. It allows for a 500-metre safety zone to be declared around off-shore installations. It is clear that with the increasing number of platforms in the area it is appropriate that the existing advisory restrictions be replaced by enforceable restrictions and the prohibition of entry, other than for authorised vessels, to the prohibited safety zone. In the terms of the Bill the area to be avoided extends 50 nautical miles from the coast of Victoria with the outer boundary of the zone being five nautical miles beyond the platforms and the submarine pipelines. The inner boundary of the zone will follow the outer limit of the three-mile territorial sea. Obviously in these circumstances complementary legislation will have to be enacted by the Victorian Government extending the area to be avoided from the outer limit of the territorial sea to the coast of Victoria. For foreign vessels the restrictions have been promulgated as an area to be avoided in accordance with agreements approved by the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation - IMCO as it is known-and has also approved a traffic separation scheme to the south of the area to be avoided to assist ship navigation. The restrictions will become mandatory for foreign vessels as and when their governments pass appropriate legislation. Again, compliance with the restrictions is to be ensured by sea, air and radar surveillance. I will come to that matter later. Whilst this legislation is long overdue it has the support of the Opposition but the Government's role in respect of the safety of the Bass Strait oil installations is a confused one. On 29 April 1980 the Minister for Transport, the now Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt), in reference to this matter in a Press statement said: I am glad to say that this voluntary system has met with a high level of co-operation from the shipping industry. At that time he was referring to the zone other than the 500-metre zone in the immediate vicinity Second Reading of the installations. He said that it did not need to have a compulsory or mandatory prohibition and there was not any need for penalties. The Press statement further stated: 'Overseas experience, particularly in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico where there are much higher concentrations of oil and gas producing platforms and a far greater number of shipping movements suggests that the risk of an accident involving a ship and a platform is extremely low,"" he said. 'This is despite the fact that in many cases ships pass much closer to platform than they do in Australia'. In other words the Minister was playing down the incidence of danger in this very important area of off-shore Australia. We now find, 2+ years later, that he has finally recognised what we were telling him in early 1980. There is a need for a very strict method and formula of safety prevention in the vicinity of the rigs. When we follow this matter further we find that back in April of this year the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) in another place, in answer to a question on this matter, admitted that there was a danger in relation to the II installations involved. This was quite contrary to the comments that were made by the Minister for Transport in 1980. The Minister for National Development and Energy in the Senate, pointing to the problems involved, said that three major factors could affect the safety of those installations. The first was the weather; the second was the damage that could arise through accident or misadventure and the third was the result of deliberate acts of vandalism or terrorism. The more likely danger of those options is the likelihood of an accident in Bass Strait caused by a vessel manned by a crew that is not properly qualified, or by a vessel on which the lookout is not carrying out his job properly. In answer to the Senate on 28 April 1982 the Minister admitted that there was a risk. He said at that time that there had been two further breaches of the restricted zone, as it was called then, by vessels in the early part of this year. When this matter was raised in 1980 the Minister for Tranport, as I said earlier, played down the issue. He did not consider it to be a matter for national concern. He was sure that the shipping companies and the captains of the vessels involved would accept the advice offered by this Government. It needs to be said that if the major junction in the Bass Strait is hit rier, a bulk carrier or by a vessel of any magnitude other than a fishing vessel and that junction is ruptured, some 85 per cent of Australia's oil supply will be put out of action. Back in August 1980 the Minister told the Parliament, in answer to a question about the number of incidents involving intrusions into the then 500-metre safety zone, that there had been six intrusions between May 1973 and February 1980. The nearest of these intrusions occurred some 350 metres off the Kingfish B installation. Other intrusions occurred 100 metres off the Kingfish A, 200 metres off the Kingfish A, and 18 metres off Kingfish A. That last intrusion was by a trawler. The next intrusion was 60 metres from Cobia 2 sub-C Completion marker bouy by a vessel called the Lucky Star. That showed that there was a danger, but the Government claimed in the period following that it had taken action, that it had advised international shipping agencies and that two firms had been prosecuted. The two prosecutions arose from those six recorded intrusions to which I referred. In one case the vessel was a Japanese cargo vessel, the Tetsukuni Maru, and the operator of the vessel was fined $700. The second case involved a cargo vessel, the Howard Star, from Panama. The operators were fined $500 and $100 costs. I dare say those fines and impositions are considerably less than those which an Australian motorist would incur in a crash of much lesser magnitude than the type of incident involved in this area. The Government clearly was not giving serious consideration to the magnitude of danger involved with these Bass Strait installations. At the same time the Minister told us, in answer to questions from this side of the House, that in the eightkilometre restricted zone, the area beyond the 500-metre prohibited zone, over the period from August 1976 to May 1980 there were some 155 intrusions by vessels involving a wide range of sizes, speeds and origins. The interesting thing about those 155 intrusions is that no one knew the country of registry of 50 of the vessels. In many cases the name of the vessel was not known and the operators of the vessel were not known. In the next grouping, 26 vessels were flag of convenience vessels. It is a well known fact that the owners of flag of convenience vessels exploit virtual slave labour. The crews of those vessels are largely unqualified. In many cases there are only one or two qualified officers on board and the rest of the crew can be classified as sea-going labourers who learn their trade as they go along. Those 26 vessels all came from flag of convenience countries-by a container car- Liberia and Panama. Let me refer the House to the dangers involved. It is of critical importance to the Bass Strait installations that the lookouts on vessels be capable, alert and, most of all, competent and qualified. I refer the House to a report of a New Zealand inquiry into the stranding of a Liberian bulk carrier on the New Zealand coast. The court of inquiry found on 4 March 1982 that the Liberian authorities should take a major part of the blame for causing the casualty. It was a direct result, the inquiry found, of unqualified personnel being licenced to perform under their flag. Both the master and the chief engineer had passed examinations for Chinese Class B certificates but had qualified for their Class A certificates-their major qualification-- by sea service only. The second mate had not passed any examinations. As I pointed out earlier, on many of these vessels the crew is comprised of one or two qualified officers and the rest of them are sea-going labourerscheap labour--picked up from one of the Third World countries where conditions of employment are desperate and where wage levels are extremely low in comparison with those of the rest of the maritime nations of the world. In this case the crew were required to sign two sets of receipts. One set of receipts showed that they had received payment in accordance with International Transport Federation agreement conditions and the other set showed the actual amount that they were paid which was considerably less than the ITF requirement. The movement of these vessels in Bass Strait highlights the need to have rigid and enforceable conditions in relation to the movement of vessels in the area of the installations. The installations are vital to this country. They are vital to the provision of our energy supplies. I mentioned earlier that if the major junction is damaged by a ship 85 per cent of our oil supply will be put out of action. There is a need for the utmost keenness and alertness in the operation of vessels in the Bass Strait region. As I said, the Government has not been clear in what it is about in this case. In the two cases in which there have been prosecutions, one involved a fine of $700 and the other a fine of $500 and $100 costs. In these circumstances the Bill is important to Australia. It is welcomed on this side. I am pleased that the Government has, in the limited time that is available, taken the opportunity to get the Bill into this chamber and to get it passed now so that its provisions can be operative sooner than would have been the case if it had been left until the resumption of the Parliament in 1983. In those circumstances we welcome the Bill. It has our full support.",74
138,Mr OKEEFE,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND," This is a very important piece of legislation to protect the oil platforms in Bass Strait. We in Australia are very dependent on our oil supplies from Bass Strait and Barrow Island. From Bass Strait crude oil is shipped to refineries at Kurnell in Sydney and refineries in Brisbane and, of course, it is piped to Victoria. Any interference with the Bass Strait platforms will cause considerable problems in regard to petroleum supplies in Australia. Should accidents occur in this field our supplies of crude petroleum could be seriously affected. The second reading speech of the Acting Minister for Trade and Resources (Sir James Killen) states: The purpose of the Bill is to give elTect to the Area A voided in Bass Strait. in the vicinity of the roleum production facilities. unauthorised Australian vessels over 200 tons gross tonnage. The Area to be A voided replaces the existing restricted area first established in 1976 and enlarged in 1980. There is an increasing number of platforms in the area. Of course, as the number of platforms increases, so too does the risk of accidents caused by ships running off course and endangering these platforms with a resultant cut-otT of supply. It would be of great economic importance to Australia if interference with the platforms in this area were to take place. The Government considers it appropriate that additional steps should be taken to increase the protection of the offshore platforms and the safe movement of shipping in the area. Bass Strait is situated in an area where immense numbers of ships traverse daily; so protection is absolutely essential. Under the present provisions of the Act and in accordance with the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf, safety zones of 500 metres have been declared around each platform, prohibiting entry by any unauthorised vessel. Proposed new section 140D of the Act provides penalties for the captains and crews of ships encroaching on that area. Proposed new section 140D (I) (a) of the Act sets out the powers of an authorised person in respect of vessels in or near a safety zone, the Area to be A voided, and the provisions in regard to a vessel suspected of having contravened the provisions of section 119 or 140C. These powers are very extensive. They include boarding such vessels; requesting or searching for relevant information or documents; requiring removal of a vessel from the Area to be A voided or the safety zone; measuring a vessel; requiring a disabled vessel to accept a tow or any other assistance considered necessary; or detaining a suspected vessel. Proposed new sub-section (2) provides for fines of up to $5,000 for persons who fail to facilitate the boarding of a vessel by an authorised person; refuse to allow a search to be made; refuse to comply with another requirement under sub-section (I); give false or misleading information; or resist or obstruct an authorised person in the performance of his duties under the provisions of the Act. The Bill will certainly be of great benefit to the petroleum industry in this country. The outer boundary will be approximately five nautical miles beyond the platforms while the inner boundary will follow the outer limit of the three-mile territorial sea. Victoria will have to introduce complementary legislation, which the honourable member mentioned in his speech, to extend the Area to be Avoided from the outer to be limit of the territorial sea to the coast of Victoria. off-shore petApart from the Commonwealth legislation, to which entry is prohibited to complementary legislation has to be enacted by Victoria in order to make this provision effective because it relates to platforms off the Victorian coast. The restrictions established under the Bill will be binding on Australian vessels over 200 tons gross tonnage. For foreign vessels the restrictions have been promulgated as an Area to be Avoided in accordance with arrangements approved by the International Maritime Organisation. The restrictions will become mandatory for foreign vessels as their governments pass appropriate legislation. Of course, the Government will have to advise the foreign countries which bring shipping into the Bass Strait area so that they will be able to follow the restrictions placed on them by our Government for safety reasons. The International Maritime Organisation has also approved a traffic separation scheme to the south of the Area to be Avoided to assist ship navigation. Arrangements are in place involving sea, air and radar surveillance of Bass Strait to ensure that restrictions are complied with by shipping. It is understood that the Royal Australian Air Force and various other aircraft will fly over this area to see that these restrictions are carried out. We have indeed been fortunate to date that no serious accidents have occurred. Several years ago the Government's trade and resources committee visited the area operated by Esso Australia Ltd and the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. We were made very much aware of the problems that could exist in this area if protection measures were not taken. They have been covered under the provisions of this legislation. We on this side of the House support the legislation. It will be of great benefit to the petroleum industries of Australia because we rely on Bass Strait and Barrow Island for 35 per cent of Australia's petroleum requirements. The other 65 per cent has to be imported. It is of great value to our nation that these restrictions will apply and this protection will be given to the platforms in Bass Strait so that our petroleum supplies will not be affected and so that our refineries in Sydney and Brisbane can take delivery of crude oil in order to provide us with the necessary fuels. We support the Bill in its entirety.",76
139,Mr GOODLUCK,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) and the honourable member for Short land (Mr Morris). I think that everybody in the House is of the same accord-that it is welcome legislation when it affords protection to our oil rigs in Bass Strait. We know of the immense benefit those oil rigs will bring to this country in the long term. Of course, all protection is necessary. The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Area to be Avoided in Bass Strait. Depending on weather, Bass Strait can be a very difficult place for shipping. When one thinks of those oil rigs, the number of men employed on them and their immense value we know that continued protection is much required. The Area to be A voided in Bass Strait relates to the vicinity of the off-shore petroleum production facilities to which entry is prohibited to unauthorised Australian vessels over 200 tonnes gross tonnage. The Area to be Avoided replaces the existing restricted area first established in 1976 and enlarged in 1980. Of course, the number of rigs is growing each year. As part of the Government's much debated policy on import parity we hoped-that hope has come to fruition-that more rigs would be constructed in Bass Strait. In the pursuit of being self-sufficient in petroleum production in this country this legislation is of immense value and necessity to this country. I am hoping-I know that the honourable member for Paterson is-that we can be self-sufficient in oil in the short term and then we would not have to be dependent on other countries for that extra 35 per cent. I think the honourable member for Paterson said that we were 35 per cent self-sufficient. I think we are 65 per cent self sufficient. We depend on overseas sources for the other 35 per cent to make certain that all the cars and all the other machinery that are driven by petroleum can be kept going in Australia. Most people have come to accept the high price of petrol. There is certainly a lot of debate about it but I think most realise that if we are to be selfsufficient we need to spend money. Money is definitely being spent in the fuel area and it is hoped that we will be self-sufficient. I only hope that the marketing of petrol can be far better handled than is the case at present. At the moment there is a freeze on the wholesale price of petrol in three States of Australia. Yet one wonders-",77
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,Mr Millar)Order) I suggest that the honourable member for Franklin make it a little closer to the rig.,77
141,Mr GOODLUCK,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"I think it is very important, Mr Deputy Speaker. We are talking about the petroleum Mr DEPUTY SPEAKERThe honourable member has not so persuaded me. I ask him to be a little more relevant.",77
142,Mr GOODLUCK,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"Fine, Mr Deputy Speaker. The existing restricted area is advisory only. However, with the increasing number of platforms in the area and their economic importance to Australia the Government considers it appropriate that additional steps should be taken to increase the effectiveness of the restrictions enhancing protection of the off-shore platforms and the safe movement of shipping in the region. Under the present provisions of the Act and in accordance with the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf, safety zones of 500 metres have been declared around each platform, prohibiting entry by any unauthorised vessel. The Area to be Avoided established under this Bill will extend approximately 50 nautical miles from the coast to envelop the off-shore platforms and submarine pipelines. Its outer boundary will lie about five nautical miles beyond the platforms while the inner boundary will follow the outer limit of the three-mile territorial sea. Complementary legislation will be introduced by the Victorian Government extending the Area to be Avoided from the outer limit of the territorial sea to the coast of Victoria. The honourable member for Shortland said that the Government has been a little slow in introducing this legislation but he did say I agree-- that it is most necessary that Bass Strait and the rigs there be protected from shipping, from any unauthorised ship that may go there. It is terribly important to this country, to the production of oil and to the safekeeping of the men who are employed in the area. The restrictions established under the Bill will be binding on Australian vessels over 200 tonnes gross tonnage. One has only to think of what happened when the Lake I1/awarra hit the Tasman Bridge. The same sort of situation could arise in Bass Strait. That is why every precaution is absolutely necessary. When that ship hit the bridge it created complete dislocation for the city of Hobart. We could have a similar situation in Bass Strait if all the necessary safety precautions were not introduced. I am pleased that this legislation will do just that because I think it is of immense importance to the country. Therefore I support the legislation.",77
143,Mr SHIPTON,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"I am pleased to speak in support of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 1982. The enactment of the original petroleum submerged lands legislation was a great exercise in federalism, of co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. It was a triumph for the Fraser Government's new federalism. We have in place in Australia Commonwealth legislation and complementary State legislation defining the rights, duties and shares of production in relation to off-shore oil in Australia. The Bill before the House is to give effect to an Area to be Avoided in Bass Strait in the vicinity of the offshore petroleum facilities to which entry is prohibited to unauthorised Australian vessels over 200 tonnes gross tonnage. The Area to be A voided replaces the existing restricted area which was first established some years ago-in 1976-and which was enlarged in 1980. This was found to be inadequate, and in any event the existing restricted area is only advisory. With the increasing number of rigs and platforms in the area and in light of their enormous economic importance to the country, the Government has considered it appropriate that additional steps should be taken to increase the effectiveness of the restrictions, enhancing the protection of the offshore platforms so vital to Australia and the safe movement of shipping in the region. The Bass Strait region, as the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck), who spoke before me, pointed out very adequately, is of enormous strategic importance to Australia. The oil and gas that comes ashore from Bass Strait is Australia's economic lifeblood. Since the discovery of off-shore oil and gas in Australia the nature of the Australian economy has changed. The contribution to Australia-we are 70 per cent self-sufficient in oil-is a great national asset. Not only the asset itself-the ability of a country to have its own oil and gas-but also the foreign exchange saved by not having to purchase oil from overseas, is a great saving to the nation. It also means that Australia is not hostage to any fortune in that it does not have to rely on other countries for this important commodity and raw material for Australia. Currently many countries, particularly those in the Third World, are not so well off. I was talking to a high commissioner from an African country only a few minutes ago. He pointed out the problems faced by the Third World countries which do not have any oil revenue. We have oil revenue. It comes from Bass Strait, which is an important and vital area. That is why the Government has introduced the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill to protect further that area in Bass Strait from the likelihood of accident, including a shipping accident. The honourable member for Franklin referred to the tragic bridge accident in Hobart in which a ship hit the bridge. That could easily happen in Bass Strait. Some weeks ago, on one of those rare occasions when one has the chance to sit down and watch television, I saw an excellent program on which young Australian naval officers were interviewed. Mr John BrownYes Minister; I saw you on it.",78
144,Mr SHIPTON,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"Australia has a naval patrol in Bass Strait. Many honourable members opposite--I hear them interjecting --may think that all of the surveillance in Australia needs to take place in the north. But that is not so. In the south we have this national asset, this oil and gas asset in Bass Strait and that needs to be protected. This Government, in its wisdom and quite rightly so-has put into effect surveillance of the area. It is a combination of aerial surveillance and ship surveillance. I saw a young naval officer on a patrol boat being interviewed. He spoke of the problems that one can have with shipping in the area. He gave an example that is very relevant to the legislation before the House. He said that Australian shipping has details of the Area to be A voided, the restricted zone, because that is compulsory but that many overseas ships have old charts. One of the things that is proposed under this legislation is to approach the International Maritime Organisation to approve a traffic separation scheme to the south of the Area to be A voided to assist ship navigation. One of the great difficulties is that many ships do not have up-to-date information and charts available to them, so there is a continuing problem in Bass Strait. The young ship's captain to whom I have referred pointed out that one day he and his fellow crew members saw a ship headed for the rig. It was only as a result of the radar and communications system that this Government had set up in Bass Strait that a helicopter took off and buzzed the tanker that was on course to knock over the rig. It was only by the helicopter pilot and crew waking up the people on the bridge of this ship that a terrible accident was avoided. It was avoided because of this Government's policy and practice of having an adequate surveillance system set up in Bass Strait. Surveillance generally is important to Australia. As I pointed out, it is not only in the north that we need surveillance but also in the south. I talked about the combined air, sea and radio communications system that we have in place I hope that in the future in addition to this system we will get an adequate airborne early warning radar capacity that would be of assistance in Bass Strait and in other parts of Australia. At the moment we really do not have the capacity, particularly in the north··-I guess that if there were ever to be any threat the same would apply in the south--to detect on all occasions a potential intruder. The combination of the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar system, which is part of the Government's experiemental program, and the acquisition of an airborne early warning system such as the Grumman Tracker E2C aircraft which provides the capacity to have airborne early warning by having aeroplanes in the air all the time to carry out radar surveillance, would be a great asset for this country not only in the north but also in the south. I have talked about the strategic importance of oil, the national asset, about the Navy's commitment and about surveillance generally. However, another activity I think worth mentioning in relation to the Bass Strait zone, is the potential for terrorist activity. If someone is going to strike at the very lifeblood of a nation by way of terrorism, one way to do this would be to cut the nation's oil supply. We have seen the Australian Special Armed Services regiment carry out exercises in Bass Strait. I commend that aspect of Government policy also. Unfortunately, tragically a member of the SAS was killed in a boating accident in Bass Strait. Of course, all of us in this House regret that, but it shows how important it is to be on the ball at all times. As I have said before, I congratulate the Government on this policy. I think at one stage some surveillance activity was transferred from the north to the south because in the short term, the most important asset to Australia is all that oil and gas out there in Bass Strait. Under the present provisions of the Act and in accordance with the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf, safety zones of 500 metres around each platform have been declared, prohibiting entry of any unauthorised vessel. I am sure the House will agree that that is only sensible. The area to be avoided which is established under the Bill will extend approximately 50 nautical miles from the coast to envelop the off-shore platforms and submarine pipelines-- not only platforms but also pipelines are important. I suppose anchors were to drag along pipelines. Imagine the terrible damage that could be done, not only in terms of lost production but also to the environment. Imagine the potential of pollution to the Victorian and Tasmanian environment, to the animals of the sea and to the shorelines, if there were to be a terrible, horrific accident whereby either a platform or a pipeline was damaged and oil flowed to the surface. So, in fact, this legislation is an environmental measure as much as anything else. The outer boundary of the area will lie about five nautical miles beyond the platforms, while its inner boundary will follow the outer limit of the three-mile territorial sea. Complementary legislation will be introduced in the Victorian Parliament extending the area to be avoided from the outer limit of the territorial sea to the coast of Victoria. This is made necessary by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act and by interpretations of the High Court of Australia as to the jurisdictional boundaries between the Commonwealth and the States. In fact, the area to be avoided established by the Commonwealth and the State legislation will have the same boundaries as the present advisory restricted area. The restrictions under the Bill will be binding on Australian vessels of, as I have said, over 200 tonnes gross tonnage. For foreign vessels, the restirctions have been promulgated as an area to be avoided in accordance with arrangements approved by the International Maritime Organisation. I have mentioned the problem in relation to international maritime charts; that is, to make sure that captains of ships in the region of Bass Strait have up to date charts. I guess there is not much that one can do about that but press the International Maritime Organisation to make this information available to all ships likely to be in the region of Australia. The restrictions will become mandatory for foreign vessels as their governments pass appropriate legislation. I regret that perhaps this process will be slow. As I said previously, the International Maritime Organisation has also approved a traffic separation scheme to the south of the area to be avoided to assist ship navigation. I am pleased to speak in this House in support of this legislation, which is designed to protect a valuable national asset in Bass Strait, namely, the oil and gas which exists there. thank the House.",78
145,Mr KATTER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"When one contemplates the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill, it occurs to anyone who is profoundly interested in the various phases of our national life and security that there is probably no more important subject than that of oil. When one contemplates the possibilities associated with accidental or intentional collision one finds them appalling. It may be well to look at the loss of the disaster, which would be associated with a ship in the Bass Strait area colliding with one of the ever increasing numbers of oil rigs that are in Bass Strait, and maybe elsewhere. The possibilities of accident are, as I said, appalling. One ore two other aspects, I think, should be very carefully considered. One was referred to by one of my colleagues, who is no longer in the chamber. He referred to the environment. Ocassionally we do get an oil slick. Good heavens! How could an oil slick compare with what would eventuate if there were a collision, intentionally otherwise, between an oil rig and a wandering ship? Consider the ordinary things that are not quite so important in life, such as activities on beaches-those of our lifesavers, for instance, and the training that would be denied them-or the birds and the seals. There are many seals in that area. The wholesale distribution of oil that would eventuate from such a collision is something to which we should give a lot of thought. However, in the limited time available to me I want to deal with matters of much greater substance. But before I leave this matter of collision and disaster I would like to outline the record of this type of ident. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) who, I might say, was very much associated with accepting responsibility at the time of the terrible disaster involving the Hobart Bridge",80
146,Mr HODGMAN,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,He was a hero.,80
147,Mr KATTER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"He was a hero, and I think that perhaps some day we might acknowledge the contribution he made to his community at that time. I am sorry he is not in the House, because I am sure he would be quite pleased that we acknowledge the work he did at that time. That terrible disaster involved not only a tragic loss of life but also siderable expense, dislocation of traffic and the upset of ordinary life in Hobart and the areas adjacent to it. Of course, there was also the West Gate Bridge disaster, another collision when perhaps measures were not taken, or were not taken in sufficient detail, to try to prevent a collision I that could happen in Bass Strait. West Gate, as we all know, is one of those things that are too horrific to dwell on. But it happened. Only recentlylast week, as a matter of fact - I had an opportunity to look at where all of this happened. It is adjacent to Fishermens Bend· I will talk about that in a moment too, because it is not disassociated from the importance of oil. Avalon, where we will have our FA 18s in action, requires a tremendous supply of oil. However, I shall conlife, tinue to draw attention to the possibility of disaster. Dr KlugmanTell us a joke.",80
148,Mr KATTER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"Another disaster occurred in the State of the honourable member who interjects-the terrible Granville train disaster. These were all collisions. As I mentioned in relation to the sort of accident that could occur in Bass Strait, there are many potential side effects-effects on the environment and many other aspects. This involves not only the possibility of accident. Let us not bury our heads in the or sand and say, 'this can't happen here'. It can happen here. It may not be an accident. If there were an intention to create an emergency in this the country there could be 'international accidents'. As my colleague mentioned a little while ago, there is a necessity for early warning aircraft. If ever something was necessary for the security of our oil supplies, our shipping lanes and our rigs, whether on land or at sea, such as in Bass Strait, it is the knowledge of what is happening out there to ensure that we have sufficient surveillance; and surveillance will not be complete until we are provided with early warning aircraft. I suppose the argument about whether we should have an airacc- craft carrier could continue until the end of our term in office. It could be argued that to keep open our sea lanes we should have a floating command headquarters and all the advantages of an aircraft carrier. Then, of course, on the other side--",80
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"Mr Millar) Order! The Chair is reluctant to interrupt the honourable member, but he is becoming somewhat detached from the immediate question before the House. If he could get back into Bass Strait, we might come to terms.",80
150,Mr KATTER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I accept con- your guidance. The only thing I point out, respectfully, is that we are talking about matters associated with oil. I respectfully submit that the security of our sea lanes depends on the early warning of an enemy approach. I am very pleased to see the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) come into the House. His contribution during the Hobart disaster is part of the history of his State. We hope that some day that will be acknowledged.",80
151,Mr HODGMAN,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,-By the Queen.,81
152,Mr KATTER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"By the Queen, yes. I will get back to my logical submission to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was pointing out that if one argued that our sea lanes should be protected, it may be argued that an aircraft carrier is fairly critical to this naval consideration. I have presided over a number of hearings in which oil was one of the most significant and fundamental matters discussed. When one considers the question of keeping a defence machine in action, my goodness, one realises that fuel supplies generally are absolutely critical. The Army, the Navy and the Air Force are totally dependent on fuel supplies. We could well be put in a situation in which our sea lanes were cut and we were dependent on whatever oil supplies were to come from our own sources, whether they be Bass Strait or Moonie in Queensland. Hence I get back to the submission that we must have early warning if we are to-Dr KlugmanI take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I feel that the honourable member for Kennedy is arguing very effectively in favour of a wage freeze for politicians from the National Party, but this Bill is not before the House.",81
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,Order! There is no point of order.,81
154,Mr KATTER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"- Another subject. I would like to deal with, again totally significant for oil supplies, the retaining of our Bass Strait establishments and so on is the situation in the Middle East. There has been a sort of fluctuation.",81
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"Order! I am afraid that the honourable member is fluctuating too far. I applaud his efforts to meet the requirements of the moment, but the Chair likewise is obligated to secure some relevance to the question.",81
156,Mr KATTER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I say respectfully that the throwing of our oil rigs out of action by collision and so cutting off an extremely important and vital part of our supplies is very much associated with the continuance of supplies from the Middle East.",81
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,The Chair is bound to suggest that that is a matter for another occasion.,81
158,Mr KATTER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"Very well. Let us look at the requirements of our rural industry and its dependence on that oil. Mr Morris--- What is the name of the Bill, Bob? Can you tell us the name of the Bill?",81
159,Mr KATTER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"I would have thought that honourable members on both sides of the House would appreciate the fact that we are talking about source-not Holbrook sauce, but the source of our oil supplies. One very vital link in that source is the security and continuance of operation of our oil rigs in Bass Strait. Let me tell the House this: We might talk about ships and about motor cars, but there is a great big rural industry out there. Mr Morris-In Bass Strait?",81
160,Mr KATTER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"- Yes. There is a fishing industry there. If that is not a rural industry, what is? Getting back to the point of my argument, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am totally subject to your guidance-if you will concede to me that the continuance of oil supplies is important, then we must ask: Where do those oil supplies flow to? What are the more vital elements of our national life which depend upon then? I might say that the meat industry and the bread industry, which is dependent on the grain industry, would grind to a tedious standstill if oil supplies were interrupted in any way. This Bill may appear to be a formal sort of Bill. It is not. It is a Bill of very great consequence to this nation. If we go into the details of this Bill we will see that it is obviously the product of a compassionate government which does not want to see Australia's rural industry come to a standstill. All these things cannot be divorced from each other. Let us again consider them. One aspect is that possibility of disaster. In that respect I refer to Hobart, West Gate and Granville. Of course, when we think of Hobart we think of the honourable member for Franklin. Another aspect is the environment. I want to reiterate these points because they are of great importance. Bass Strait and the surrounding areas where these rigs are situated contain prolific wildlife-seals, birds, fish, and even people enjoying their entertainment on the beaches-all of which could be affected. Mr Deputy Speaker, please permit me to make one brief comment on the Middle East. While I am dealing with the Middle East, I think we have to appreciate the fact that we have many people of the Islamic faith in this country. Dr KlugmanWould you stop him reading his speech?",81
161,Mr KATTER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"I am being sidetracked, Mr Deputy Speaker. I had an experience recently in my own electorate with a lady of the Islamic faith who had a passport problem. I had better leave that for another occasion. I conclude by asking every member of this House to support this Bill.",81
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,The House is indebted to the honourable member for Kennedy for the good oil.,82
163,Mr BEAZLEY,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"The Bill we are discussing today is the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 1982. I think after the speech we have just heard what might well be required by those listening to this debate is a reiteration of what the Bill actually does so that when honourable members here digress into other areas the point of the whole exercise will not be entirely lost on the public. The Bill effectively establishes as an 'area to be avoided' an area approximately 50 nautical miles from the coast to envelope the II off-shore platforms in Bass Strait and the submarine pipelines. Its outer boundary effectively will lie about five nautical miles beyond the platforms while its inner boundary will follow the outer limit of the three-mile territorial sea. The area to be avoided also incorporates an area of 500 metres around the installation, which is a prohibited zone, and it replaces what was an advisory limitation on the operation of ships in the wider area-a system which has operated now for a number of years in a completely unsatisfactory manner. The Opposition shadow Minister for transport, the honourable member for Short land (Mr Morris), pointed out that this area to be avoided-previously the restricted zone-was honoured as much in the breach as it was in observation. He pointed out that in a period between 1976 and 1980 there were some 155 intrusions into this zone. It has been mentioned by other speakers in this chamber and in the Senate that there have been more recent intrusions and that therefore it has been quite obvious for some time that this legislation is long overdue. It is legislation which the Opposition has been advocating for some considerable time. More recently, in 1980, when the current regulations came into effect, it was advocated by the Opposition spokeman on transport. Persistently throughout this period the Opposition has been informed by the Government that this type of legislation is unnecessary. So has been a slice of the salami process. Every now and then a new regulation is introduced. Regulations have been slightly tightened until we have finally arrived at a position which is considerably more satisfactory than that which has prevailed for some time and which the Opposition has advocated virtually for as long a period as this matter has been a subject of concern in this Parliament. However, the problem with this legislation is its international component. This legislation effectively only applies immediately to Australian shipping. We await the restriction becoming mandatory on foreign vessels as their governments pass, under International Maritime Organisation agreements, appropriate legislation to be enforced on their ships. Of course, for a very large number of users of the Bass Strait, this situation is likely never to apply. Because of inadequacies in surveillance, which I will deal with in a minute, those 155 intrusions to which I referred earlier reveal that aircraft, the lookouts or whatever, were unable to determine the national origin of 50 of those ships. So conceivably they could have been flag of convenience vessels. Thirty of them were flag of convenience vessels. The essence of flag of convenience operations is that the owners or operators of such ships avoid all forms of national and international restrictions that possibly can be avoided. Hitherto flags of convenience have been used to suppress seamen's wages to a level at which seamen from this country and seamen from other countries with an equivalent standard of living cannot possibly hope to compete. Flags of convenience also have been used to conceal gross inadequacies in the safety standards and other standards of vessels. In this instance flags of convenience can be used to evade the consequences of this legislation. I believe it is important, under law of the sea conventions that have been drafted, to give very serious attention to the capacity of flag of convenience ships to avoid international agreements that establish reasonable safety standards in areas such as the Bass Strai t. I am hopeful, though I am otherwise advised by our Opposition spokesman on transport, that under existing law of the sea legislation, when it is finally ratified by a sufficient number of countries, it will be possible to do something about the problem of flag of convenience shipping and shipping of other countries that will not make themselves party to the type of safety agreement entailed in this legislation. I believe it is absolutely essential that we have the capacity to enforce this legislation rigorously. The need to do so has been quite this evident to many people in this country who have thought about it for quite some time. I quote from a transcript of a Nationwide program on 6 March 1980 when David Farrer, an Australian Workers Union organiser with an interest in organising workers in the Bass Strait area, pointed out what would happen if a ship hit one of these platforms. He said: . . eighty-five per cent of Australia's oil would automatically be lost. It would be uncontrollable---That is, the consequence of the collisionto consolidate that platform and to block the pipes that would be burst and ripped apart by the impact. I'd say that every person on the ship and the platform, because of the associated gases and the oil and the impact, would be something that has overseas and would completely wipe out the Ninety Mile Beach, possibly ruin the fishing and everything else, wildlife and the beaches and resorts. I do not think that assessment could be gainsaid by anyone who has had a look at the situation in the Bass Strait area. The consequences of such a collision would be extremely serious indeed. In fact in that period between 1976 and 1980 about which I spoke, of those ISS intrusions into what was then the restricted zone and which will now become the area to be avoided zone, there were six additional occasions which involved breaches of the 500-metre safety zone. One of those breaches brought the ship in question within 200 metres of the rig. Conditions in Bass Strait are not always placid. Visibility in the area is not always good. It is extremely serious that not only the area to be avoided zone but also the restricted zone is breached so frequently. The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) mentioned two recent breaches. The consequences for the environment in the Bass Strait region would be immense and the consequences for our economy would be enormous were a collision to occur. It has been pointed out by several other speakers in this chamber that we are in a fortunate position to be able to get 70 per cent of our oil requirements from our own resources, most of it from the Bass Strait region. That has enabled us to avoid the worse uncertainties and consequences that have arisen from the political situation that has emerged in the Middle East, particularly since 1969. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am mindful of your strictures on relevance in this regard, but I wish to make just one point. That has been of enormous political importance to this country. It has enabled us to take a more detached view of Middle Eastern affairs than just about any other country in the Western alliance with an equivalent economic status to ourselves. We have benefited greatly from the security of our Bass Strait platforms as well as their productivity. That security is well within our control. But for it to remain in our control and to be effectively carried out the implementation of this sort of legislation is required. The fact that one-third of those 155 intrusions into the zone involved an incapacity on the part of our surveillance system to identify the countries of origin is a matter to which we need to give some very serious consideration when we advise the Government on how this Bill ought to be implemented. It is quite appalling that we cannot identify one-third of the vessels. They are not pirate vessels or vessels travelling deliberately diswould be killed. The oil slick been experienced in other areas guised; they are vessels which ought to be able to be identified. This points out the very considerable need for us to upgrade our surveillance of our coastal areas. I think it is time we gave to the Fleet Air Arm a significant role in surveillance. We have excellent surveillance aircraft in the Trackers that are standing wasting at Nowra. They were not utilised in the recent Sandgroper exercise in Western Australia, to the very great concern of the Fleet Air Arm. We have a demoralised service in the Fleet Air Arm. It is very desperately in need of a substantial role in the defence of this country. I believe that some of the Orions ought to be handed to the Fleet Air Arm as well so that it has both the Trackers and Orions to enable it to utilise those aircraft far more effectively than they are being utilised at the moment. This is exactly the sort of area in which this could be done. As I said at the outset, this Bill is long overdue. It follows constant advice by the Opposition that it ought to have been implemented some considerable time ago. We on this side of the House wish to give this Bill speedy passage as we support it as an essential piece of legislation. We do so, as I said, noting a degree of pride of authorship.",82
164,Mr HODGMAN,TO SCHOOLS OF TRANSPORT AND,"Nearly 30 years ago in the Tasmanian Parliament one member saw fit to argue against a piered bridge and in favour of a suspension bridge to be built across the River Derwent. He did so on the basis that the risk of collision with the proposed bridge by a vessel at sea was such that he did not believe that that risk should be taken. The fact is that that member was sadly but tragically vindicated in 1974 with the collision of the Lake Illawarra with the Tasmanian bridge in Hobart. This gives me the opportunity to make the comment that whilst we would all say it cannot happen, the risk of collision at sea is ever present and the consequences of a collision between a vessel and one of the II oil rigs in Bass Strait are so horrendous that we are obliged, as a Parliament, to adopt a bipartisan approach, as indeed we have, and to legislate as we have. I want to make three points. One of them relates to the last point made by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) who spoke immediately before me. One-third of the vessels which made ISS unauthorised incursions into what was then the restricted area, and now becomes the Area to be A voided, were unidentified. The point must be made over and over again that we simply do not know, as the honourable member said, the origin of those vessels. I go a step further to say that we do not know for certain whether they were commercial or non-commercial vessels. I say that with some feeling in view of the observance and later the arrival in the port of Hobart some years ago-it was within the last seven years-of a Soviet submarine which had been operating in these waters. The second point I want to make relates to international obligations. Again, to take the point that was made by the honourable member, until other nations ratify this legislation, it effectively applies only directly to Australian vessels over 200 tonnes. I have to make the point, and make it with emphasis, that the increasing number of foreign vessels in Australian waters is such that those nations which wish to indicate a genuine compatibility with Australia and a genuine desire to co-operate in protecting these rigs should proceed to ratify this legislation as quickly as possible. I am delighted to see the Australian Labor Party has taken the attitude it has to this legis· lation involving, as it does, Bass Strait. The comment was made the other day that the Labor Party has not had very much luck with Tasmanian explorers-Bass in 1975 and Flinders in 1982. Having made that comment, I make the point that this legislation is federal legislation. In conclusion, I take the opportunity to remind this House that contrary to some views which were expressed abroad we still have a federal system in this country. There is no such thing as a centralist government. If one looks at the definition clauses in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment, one will see reference is made to 'Australian national', 'Australian vessel', 'authorised person' and last but not least to 'government vessel'. This not only involves the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory but also, in relation to 'government vessel', includes a specific reference to the Transport Commission of Tasmania under the Transport Act 1938. We do have a federal system and this is classic federal legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

166,Mr CARLTON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," Mr Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented. Mr SPEAKER Does the honourable gentleman wish to make a personal explanation? Mr CARLTONYes. I would not normally take this matter up, It was something the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) said this morning in the House. I would not take it up in relation to its misrepresentation of me, but it does involve an officer of my Department who was named. I believe that it would be most unfair to him if I did not take the matter up. The honourable member for Burke claimed that I had accused him of a breach of propriety when I made remarks in the House on Thursday. He commented on the report by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on medical fraud and overservicDate of Report government ing and mentioned the name of Dr Webb, the response head of the Victorian Division of my Department. He has made remarks to the effect that Dr Webb 24.8.82 (c) should be stood down pending investigations. I 6.5.82 (a) said on Thursday that there was nothing in the recommendations of the report which suggested 18.11.81 14.12.82 that Dr Webb should be stood down. Dr Webb was not named in the conclusions or recommen22.6.80 28.10.82 dations section of the report specifically. The honourable member for Burke has excused his own behaviour in mentioning Dr Webb by refer6.5.82 (a) ring to argument from within the report. I said 11.9.80 10.11.82 clearly the other day that Dr Webb was not named in the conclusions or recommendations. It was most unfair for his name to be mentioned by the honourable member. It has not been mentioned by the Chairman of the Committee or other members of the Committee. Although I am not chastising, I believe that I am quite correct in Date of being a little unhappy about the honourable Report government response member for Burke mentioning Dr Webb's name.",85
167,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I do not propose to call the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous). I think the matter was covered this morning by the honourable member for Burke.

I do not want the 29.10.81 (a) matter to proceed to debate. 27.8.80 (a) Mr Morris- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Having so ruled, I point out that what the 20.2.80 20.8.80(b) Minister has said, that the gentleman concerned, Dr Webb, was not named, is in fact different from what is recorded in the report where reference is 10.6.81 (a) made to the directors in each State.

Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.",85
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SALARIES AND WAGES PAUSE BILL,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering those two measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",86
172,Mr HAWKE,SALARIES AND WAGES PAUSE BILL," The Opposition does not enter this debate in a spirit of negativism. We on this side of the House recognise that our country is in a condition of economic and, increasingly, social crisis. I say at the outset that we also recognise the operation of factors which are beyond the control of this Government. We recognise the impact of the international recession and of the drought. Having recognised those factors which are beyond the control of the Government we immediately then say that it is all the more important that the Government, in the areas which are within its competence and influence, should in these circumstances act in a sensible, coherent, planned and relevant fashion. The Government has manifestly failed to do that. My colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) will deal in more detail with the longer term economic failures of the Government to adopt such a sensible, coherent plan and relevant set economic policies. I want immediately to draw the attention of the House to the circumstances of the presentation of the Salaries and Wages Pause Bill and the Special Employment-related Programs Bill which we are considering. Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that very rarely, if ever, would members of this House have been shabbily treated in relation to matters asserted by the Government to be of such importance. I point to the chaos of delay, withdrawal, redrafting and unavailability of the detailed legislative proposals for proper consideration. I point out that those factors are merely the ultimate reflection of a tactic conceived as a political gimmick rather than as part of a comprehensive plan to deal with the real problems confronting our society. In case there be some suggestion that it is merely a partisan observation to talk about the ad hoc gimmickry which has characterised the approach of the Government in this matter, I refer briefly to the observations in the editorials of the relevant Press. I refer to the editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald of Wednesday, 8 December. Under the heading, 'Now it's farce', it stated: What started as a gimmickry has now become farce. It concluded its examination of the Government's approach by stating: According to Mr Howard, the freeze was 'the single most valuable contribution that can be made at this moment to the cause of improving the employment position.' The editorial continued: Translating that statement from polispeak, it is the best the Government could come up with. But it is not nearly good enough, as at least the Labor Premiers had the wit to realise. Mr Howard should go back to his drawing board. The editorial of the Age of 9 December stated: It is almost unbelievable that a conference with so much going for it could have ended in such a fiasco as the Premiers' Conference. The blame for the failure must rest with the Fraser Government. Mr Anthony as conference chairman was unable or unwilling to secure this vital consensus-mainly, it seems, because his own Government refused to budge an inch to arrive at common ground. The editorial concluded in its assessment of the approach of this Government: The Federal Government should concede failure and call an immediate follow-up conference-with employers and the ACTU as well as the Premiers-to hammer out a genuine agreement. It should go back to the conference table, and this time do it properly. It will suffice to refer to the first couple of sentences of the editorial of the Canberra Times in its assessment of the Government's approach to the matter which we are dealing with here today. It stated: What a farce! If they had a referee instead of a chairman the lot of them would have been sent off for collapsing the serum. So we can see that it is not merely the assessment of the Opposition in this House that we are witnessing here the ultimate reflection of the gimmickry of the approach of the Government; it is the considered opinion of the editorialists of this country. Having said that I make it quite clear on behalf of the Opposition that movements in wages are a significant factor in what has happened and what is happening to the economy. We in the Opposition acknowledge the relevance of wage movements as overwhelmingly as does the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I put it quite clearly: It would be totally unrealistic to expect that the rate of increase of wages of the last 12 months could continue in the current and foreseeable economic circumstances. Having said that it is fundamentally important that this House and the Australian community understand just how and why the wages push developed. Unless we understand that we will not properly analyse the present situation and what needs to be done to put ourselves in a position properly to draw up programs for the future to deal with these problems. I say at the outset that this wages push that the Government now complains about was primarily attributable to the attitudes deliberately fostered by this Government. I intend to analyse and to demonstrate just how much this country of ours has suffered because of what seems a congenital incapacity on the part of this Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and of this Government to play it straight with the people of this country, particularly when there is a smell of an election in the air. I take the House back to 1980. It will be well within the recollection of all members of this House just how, as 1980 developed, this Prime Minister and leading spokesmen for this Government talked up the resources boom and spelt out what the implications of that perceived boom were in respect of what should be the attitudes of the component parts of the Australian economy to formulating their claims upon the resources of this country. It will be well within the recollection of members of this House how many statements were made to that effect by the Prime Minister and by other Ministers. I content myself with quoting from what the Prime Minister said to this House on 26 August 1980. He said: These developments will add greatly to our national product, to incomes and to wealth benefit from being members of a wealthier society. He went on: The investment of many billions development will stimulate economic growth and employment. This investment. the growth of great new industries and the expansion of others will mean increased incomes and higher living standards for all Australians. This exciting prospect has relevance for all of us; we all stand to participate in it. That was the Prime Minister talking to this House in August 1980. The sniff of the election was right in his nostrils. What did he say as he came up towards an election? He said to all the people of Australia, to the organised trade union movement: This is what is on. Make sure you get in and have your share'. The election was held at the end of 1980. The Government won it. What happened after that? We had this Prime Minister and this Government again creating in this community an attitude that what is required of groups and of individuals is that they get out into that free enterprise market and use their power and their strength to get what they can. Let me make it quite clear that this is no figment of the collective imagination of the Opposition. This Prime Minister came into this House on 30 April and spelt out in unequivocal terms what the philosophy and the attitude of this Government was and how the people of Australia and the trade unions of this country should conduct themselves in terms of grabbing their share of the resources of this country. I refer to the Prime Ministerial statement of 30 April. It is very important that this attitude be understood because this was what set the mood. This was what established the philosophy of this Government. This was the lead that was given to the people of this country and, in particular, to the trade unions. In speaking to this House on 30 April, in the starting point of the ministerial statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Prime Minister said: The Review's starting point is that. the role of government is to enable people to exercise their abilities. their skills, their imaginations and their enterprise. When this happens the result iseconomic growth more jobs higher incomes and a better life for all. He went on to say: The benefits of our program are now visible for everyone to see. Then we got the exposition of the philosophy, just what it is that this Prime Minister said to the trade unions of this country that they should do. Under the heading of 'Government Regulation and Asand all Australians stand to sistance Schemes' the Prime Minister said: One of the many virtues of the free enterprise system based on the market is that it decentralises influence and control over what is produced to the greatest extent possible. of dollars in resource based There it is. It is absolutely central to the philosophy of the Government, this exposition to the people of Australia, including the trade unions, on what they should do. It refers to 'the virtues of the free enterprise system based on the market'. As I have had cause to say before, just to show that this was not merely a philosophical exposition, a statement of ideology, the Prime Minister and the Government went ahead to give practical effect to the statement of that philosophy and that ideology. Let me read what the Prime Minister finally said to the House in this respect. He said: As a significant step in the necessary process of deregulation we will abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal. This body has outlived its usefulness as a regulatory mechanism and is placing an undue burden on industry; there is no evidence that it is having any significant impact on the restraint of inflation. An appropriate mechanism will be established for the maintenance of the Government's petroleum product pricing policy. I ask members of the House to understand the explicit statement of ideology-that is, the 'virtues of the free enterprise system based on the market'-the statement of philosophy and the practical giving effect to that ideology with the abolition of the Prices Justification Tribunal because it was too much of a burden on industry. The Prime Minister made a clear statement: 'Go out into the market and use your powers in the market to get what you can'. That was an unequivocal statement. It was not merely a statement, as I say, of ideology; there was a practical giving effect to that ideology by the abolition of the PJT. This happened in April. The Government went on from that. By the end of July the Government had moved also to see that the central system of wage regulation was abandoned. Very much under the influence of this Government the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission decided finally at the end of July that it would abandon the central system of wage regulation. Of course, from that point on, given the statement of philosophy by the Government in the first part of the year and the abolition of the central system of wage fixation, the trade unions proceeded in the latter part of 1981 to act according to the philosophy expounded by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said: 'Go out into the market. Use the free enterprise system '. That is what the trade unions did-they went out. The Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union and other unions went out and negotiated. How did they negotiate? They negotiated strictly according to the philosophy of Fraser. Let it be understood that the Prime Minister was not upset about it. He thought that the trade unions had learned their lessons well from the Government. He almost congratulated them and said: 'You are behaving according to my philosphy'. The Australian of 14 December, at the end of 1981, stated: Mr Fraser told journalists at his annual party at The that he was not unduly worried about the metal trades proposals or fears of a follow-on to the rest of the work There we have it. We had it in the lead-up to the 1980 election. We had the Prime Minister telling the people of Australia that the boom was on, that they should get in and have their share. In April 1981 we had his philosophy of 'get out into the free enterprise market, use your power'. We had the abolition of the central system of wage fixation under the influence of the Government in the middle of 1981. As 1981 went on, we had the endorsement by the Government of this process of the exercise of power in an unregulated way in the market. It is quite clear in those circumstances how right it was for we on this side of the House-in particular me as I had the responsibility in the shadow portfolio-to point out the insanity of that philosophy. I pointed out time after time in this House and around this country that if we allowed that philosophy to go on it was certain what the results would be. One could point out, on the one hand, those who would be the beneficiaries of the use of that philosophy and, on the other hand, those who would suffer from it. Those who benefited from the use of that philosophy would be those who had the power. On one side, those who owned and controlled capital, those who were in some monopolistic or semi-monopolistic position, could use their power and they would benefit. On the other side, that of the workers, on the side of labour-we are evenhanded on this - those in the trade union movement who had power, who had a very strong bargaining position, would improve their position. To those who had the power more power and more benefit would come. Just as easily and as readily as one could identify those who would benefit from the pursuit of this Fraserian philosophy one could identify those who would suffer. Those who would suffer from the operation of this philosophy and practice in this country were these people: Those who were unemployed, who had no power at all because they were not in work; those who in work belonged to weak unions or no unions at all and had no bargaining power; those who were on fixed incomes; and the farmers and the small businessmen. All those people would suffer as that crazy Fraserian philosophy was worked out through this country. I put it to this House that one cannot espouse open slather-to quote the Prime Minister, the 'virtues of the free enterprise system based on the market'-and then expect to be taken seriously when one throws up one's hands in horror at the Lodge result. This is the central point confronting the force. Australian community today. We will not cure an economic malaise by the simple mouthing and application of economic nostrums. It is fundamentally important in this situation that there is the right attitude in the minds of the Australian people and important groups within the Australian community. What is essential is the creation of an attitude of mind that the attainment of the best interests of the community requires more than the pursuit of the perceived personal and group interests. But instead of trying to get that concept of community consensus, the need to work together, into the minds of the Australian people and the trade union movement, as well as business, this Government and this Prime Minister from 1980 in the pre-election period and throughout 1981 pursued the opposite philosophy-the philosophy of the virtues of that free enterprise market system: 'Get out into the market place, use your power and get what you can for yourself and the group of which you are part'. That is the background to the wages push of 1981-82. It happened directly as a result of the espousal of that ideology and philosophy by this Government. It is in that context and with the realisation that we have on this side of the House that we must have this attitude of consensus and a concern for the community as a whole rather than for ourselves or our group. It is in that sense and with the realisation of the truth of that position that we have framed the amendment to the second reading of the Bill that we are putting to this House. I will go through the amendment in some detail so that honourable members will have the opportunity of understanding the positive constructive approach which the Opposition is adopting. We are not simply coming here flat-footed and saying: 'We oppose what you are putting but we have nothing constructive to put up'. We are moving this amendment which I recommend to Government members to consider. This is not a tactic on our part. We are asking the Government sensibly and constructively to look at what we are putting. We are saying that the Bill should be withdrawn, pending the Government convening early in the new year a national summit conference of Federal and State governments, the trade union movement and employers. Our amendment sets out what should happen at that national summit conference. It states: (a) the full dimensions of Australia can be fully exposed and analysed; The logic of that is indisputable. A truth that cannot be denied is that whether it be in personal relations between two people, in relations between groups or in relations which exist in a total community the sine qua non of getting a sensible decision about resolving a problem is that the parties understand what the nature of the problem is. If the parties do not know what the problem is, if they do not have a comprehension of the dimensions and magnitude of the problem, they will not begin to get the right answer. What we say in our amendment is first of all that we should have the national summit conference. We do not want it to be a point scoring exercise. Sufficient time should be made available so that all parties-the trade unions and the employers-can have exposed to them the dimensions of the crisis confronting this country in terms of our position and the international context within which we are operating. Our amendment then states: (b) the elements of an equitable, consistent and coherent alternative strategy to meet the immediate and shortterm problems can be defined and agreed on a basis of consensus including-Before I consider each one of those points let me emphasise again",86
173,Mr TUCKEY,SALARIES AND WAGES PAUSE BILL,"I know that Mr HAWKEIt might get through even to the jackal over in the corner that what we are not concerned about is saying that we have the answers or that the Government has all the answers. We do not pretend that we have a monopoly of wisdom or truth. We do not pretend that the ACTU has a monopoly of wisdom but we do believe that if men and women of good will, from the trade unions, employers, State and Federal governments, meet together there is a very good chance that if they use their combined resources of exposition they will start to come to a degree of understanding of the problem. We make a suggestion in our amendment about the sorts of things that we believe should constitute integrally important component parts of such a package to deal with this problem. On behalf of the Opposition I do not say that we are exhaustively correct in the points we list but we do believe that they constitute important elements in an overall package. Let me go through them. Firstly, we say that an integrally important element of such a package would be 'moderation of wage and non-wage incomes'. I have pointed out that, of course, in these circumstances we cannot expect a continuation of the level of wage increases that have occurred in the last 12 months. We acknowledge that. But we also acknowledge the economic crisis confronting both the economic reality and the psychological importance of the fact that we cannot expect the trade union movement and its members to understand and accept that fact if they do not witness and understand that other income earners in the community will also be subject to wage moderation. For instance that fact is recognised in the final comment in the outline of the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Salaries and Wages Pause Bill, which refers to doctors. The last sentence states: This will not of itself prevent doctors increasing their fees. In other words in the very memorandum accompanying this Bill there is an acknowledgment that freeze or pause will operate in respect of professional incomes. Our amendment goes to this essential point. Of course there must be moderation in wages and salaries but there must also, in terms of economic reality and political justice, be moderation in the other areas. Secondly, the amendment refers to prices surveillance and the limitation of government charges. The people of this country, not just the trade union movement, have made it abundantly clear in every poll that has been taken on this matter that overwhelmingly they demand that as part of a package including wage moderation there must be surveillance and control of prices. This does not mean that there cannot be some increases in prices does mean that there should be surveillance by the public of the public interest in respect of what happens in that area. If one is concerned with economic realities, political justice and the possiand bility of making something work equitably who can say that that is not sensible? Thirdly, we refer to demand generation and job creation programs. It would be easy for us to say: 'We have been talking for a long time about the need to generate demand in the housing industry'. My colleague the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) has had the responsibility for dealing with this matter in this country. We have also talked about the necessity for job creation programs and we have had ridicule and scorn poured upon us. However, there are signs of sense from honourable members on the other side that they do understand the necessity of doing this. Our positive, constructive alternative indicates the necessity for including that sort of approach as part of an overall package. Fourthly, we refer to manpower planning, including immigration levels. Let me quickly say something about this. One of the great indictments of this Government is that after seven years in office it still does not have any concept of manpower planning. As I have had occasion to say before we have the absolute obscenity-there is no other word for it-of hundreds of thousands of unemployed in this country, particularly young unemployed, when we are bringing in people from overseas to fill positions for which we have not trained our own people. We are saying that there should be manpower planning by which we ensure adequate training and retraining programs to provide a core of our own people who can fill the jobs that are available in this country. Let me make a point in regard to immigration levels; it is very important that this point be made. I hope that honourable members can adopt a bipartisan position across this House. One of the disturbing features which is emerging in this country is an attempt in some quarters to blame the immigrants. We should have a bipartisan position on this matter and I trust that we do. I am sure that the Minister who is at the table, the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen), would agree with me that we should together reject the practice of blaming immigrants who have come to this country. They have done us proud; they have helped us to build up this country. We should not be trying to condemn those people who have come here but should say that we will not continue to bring more and more people in for alleged job vacancies which do not exist. There should be a relationship between our immigration program but it and the economic situation in this country. The final point to which I refer in relation to paragraph (b) is the employment effect of current levels of protection. On both sides of this House within both sides there would be different emphases as to our attitude on the question of protection. We simply draw attention to the fact that at a conference such as this it would be sensible to look at whether we may not need more protection in certain areas to avoid the situation in which dumping will cost jobs. After doing all those things and looking at those things we could have any legislative and administrative measures needed to implement a strategy of this kind. I conclude by emphasising again that this question of attitude is important. We will foster a constructive attitude on the part of the people of Australia only if we adopt this approach and have this all-in conference to which I referred. If we do that, we on this side of the House believe that with constructive and positive leadership the people of Australia will respond to this challenge and do those things which are necessary to help people in our community who are suffering from the privation and erosion of self-esteem which is a feature of the tragically high and growing level of unemployment in this country. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the Bill be withdrawn pending the convening by the Government early in the New Year, of a national summit conference of Federal and State Governments, the trade union movement and employers, at which: (a) the full dimensions of the economic crisis confronting Australia can be fully exposed and analysed: (b) the elements of an equitable. consistent and coherent alternative strategy to meet the immediate and shortterm problems can be defined and agreed on a basis of consensus including-(i) moderation of wage and non-wage incomes, (ii) prices surveillance and the limitation of government charges, (iii) demand generation and job-creation programs, (iv) manpower planning, including immigration levels, and (v) the employment effect of current levels of protection, and (c) any legislative and administrative measures needed to implement a strategy of this kind can be determined'.",89
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SALARIES AND WAGES PAUSE BILL,Is the amendment seconded? Mr WiIIis--1 second the amendment.,90
175,Mr CHAPMAN,SALARIES AND WAGES PAUSE BILL,"ln moving his amendment, to which he referred in detail and which I strongly oppose, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) once again tonight treated us to a fine serving of rhetoric with very little in the way of substance. He repetitively asserted that in 1980 this Government told the trade union movement to get out into the market place and to use the free enterprise system to get what it could. Repetition of that assertion, which, incidentally, as I will show in a few minutes, is a false assertion, seemed to constitute the bulk of his speech. The honourable member for Wills claimed that the Government at that time opened up a vista of prosperity. That certainly might be the case, but never at any stage in 1980 did the Government indicate that that prosperity would fall into the laps of Australians without working for it. Indeed, the Government indicated quite strongly that to achieve that prosperity hard work and sacrifice were required. The rest of the honourable member's speech was devoted to his concept of consensus which he claims will be developed through a national summit conference. Let me assure the honourable member for Wills that the consensus view of the Australian people is not that they want more conferences or more discussions but some initiatives and actions. As I listened to the ideas of the honourable member for Wills about consensus, it seemed that the consensus that had to be agreed to was that which fell in line with Australian Labor Party policy; we should adopt a bipartisan approach as long as it is the Labor Party's policy that we put into action. He did not tell us, of course, how that Labor Party policy would work. He did not provide a detailed analysis of the policy. In fact, if we look at that policy very closely we will find that in the present economic climate, if ever, it simply would not work. Indeed, the electors of Flinders recognised that when they soundly rejected it at the recent by-election. The other prong on which he hung his argument was the need for manpower planning. Once again he did not give us any indication as to how, in a dynamic and growing economy, one individual or even a small group of individuals within government can predict the long term manpower needs of our economy. But I come back to his major assertion that this Government told the trade union movement that it ought to get out into the market place and use a free enterprise approach to get what it could. I will show in a few moments that that is absolute nonsense because in the areas of labour relations and wage determination we do not have a free market situation. This legislation, in a very practical way, deals with the major domestic factor which is currently causing our economic problems; that is, the rapid escalation in wages and salaries which occurred over the last two years. There are two other factors which have had a detrimental effect on our economy but they are factors beyond Australia's control; namely, the sharp deterioration in the international economic climate and, of course, the severe drought which we are currently experiencing. The major factor which is within the control of all Australians and which is contributing to these problems is the current level of wages and salaries. Until now wages and salaries, although they are within the control of the Australian community, have not been within the control of the Federal Government. This legislation brings the portion of wages and salaries, over which the Government has some constitutional control, those within the Commonwealth public sector, within our power. The Government cannot legislate in regard to the State public sector or the private sector throughout Australia, but through legislating in the area over which it has direct control it is providing an example and a path that the rest of Australia should follow. Over the last two years wage and salary increases have outstripped not only productivity but also inflation. In the year to September 1982 average wages increased by about 17 per cent compared with a rate of inflation of 12.3 per cent. Of course, within that same period labour productivity did not increase at all; it remained unchanged. There has also been the addition to the cost of production of shorter working hours which are not taken into account when looking at that wage movement of 17 per cent. Those wage increases follow increases of a similar magnitude in the previous year. We ought to have learnt from the Whitlam era the detrimental impact on our economy that increases of that magnitude have. That detrimental impact has generally been reflected in increasing levels of unemployment in recent months, as it was reflected in the same way during the years of the Whitlam Government. It is no coincidence that during the period 1976 to 1980, when we experienced a measure of wage restraint, there was strong employment growth. We can minimise the detrimental effects of the international recession and also, despite the drought, we can provide a better domestic economic environment if we adopt a realistic approach to wages and salaries. By doing so we can ensure that there is a greater level of employment opportunities than would otherwise be the case given those two other factors. In the current situation a wage and salary freeze for the next 12 months is the minimum that those with jobs should accept to provide employment opportunities for those who have lost their jobs or for those who may lose their jobs if this wages freeze does not come about. I say that is the minimum because much more than a wages freeze is necessary if we are to restore stability and growth to our economy and, indeed, to the economies of most developed countries. The real requirement to restore job growth is that remuneration across the board should be responsive to market forces. Of course, contrary to what the honourable member for Wills said, wages and salaries are not responsive to market forces, certainly in Australia. Over a long period remuneration across the board, from low income earners to the very highest income earners, ranging from unskilled workers to the most highly skilled professionals, has been set at a price higher than the market clearing price for labour. It has also been set at a price much higher than would be justified by rates of productivity improvement. This occurred because industrial organisations, whether they be trade unions or professional organisations, have a virtual monopoly over the supply of labour. We do not have a free market; industrial organisations have a monopoly over the supply of labour. Such industrial organisations are virtually able to set their own price for labour - a price which they choose. For many years those prices have been set well above the market clearing price. Of course, if the price of labour is consistently set above the market clearing price, as with any other commodity some of it will be left on the shelf. We will have the inevitable result of unemployment. Because of the labour market rigidities, enforced by the monopoly positions of industrial organisations, with the acquiescence of governments, the individual no longer has the option of accepting employment at a lower rate of remuneration, which would in fact be the market rate. Rather, the individual is forced to accept unemployment. Therefore, the best way to provide jobs for the unemployed, not only in Australia but also in the rest of the developed world, would be for wages and salaries to fall to the market clearing level. Of course, this is a radical change. Given the industrial and political power of industrial organisations it will happen only if there is a marked change in attitude on the part of members of the Australian community who in their selfishness have become geared to expecting more and more. Given the greed and selfishness that is inherent in the nature of man, the achievement of such a marked change in attitude would require much persuasion and would take a long time. Dr Edwards-It happens in Japan.",91
176,Mr CHAPMAN,SALARIES AND WAGES PAUSE BILL,"It happens in Japan, as the honourable member mentions. In Japan we see a much greater level of productivity and a much better result for employment. If economic difficulties are faced in Japan wages fall to reflect the market forces. In Australia, as I have said, because we will have to rely on persuasion to change that attitude, that change will take considerable time to achieve. The plight of the unemployed presently requires immediate and desperate action. The best option we can provide at the moment is to make sure that the past escalation of wages and salaries does not continue. A wages and salaries freeze will provide the best way of achieving that goal. The Government deserves congratulations for taking the initiative in this regard. It is of crucial importance that State governments and the private sector follow the lead that has been made. A l2-month freeze on remuneration levels throughout Australia would allow productivity to catch up partly on the gap that now exists between wage levels and productivity. Certainly, after a l2-month freeze remuneration levels would be nearer the market level. A freeze would also allow a much needed improvement in business profitability. That, in turn, would allow businesses to employ more people. The hostile attitude to profits which is engendered by the Labor movement is, in fact, a hostile attitude to the generation of employment opportunities. The relative shares of gross national product and gross domestic product obtained by wages and salaries on the one hand and profits on the other are important factors in determining employment levels. When wages and salaries, expressed as a proportion of gross national product, move above about 63 per cent, unemployment rises sharply. When it falls and the share going to profits increases, employment opportunities increase. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows the relative shares between wages and profits over the last 20 years in the Australian economy. Leave granted. The table read as followsNA Years Wages Profits % % 1953-57 65.6 15.25 1957-61 63.3 16.4 1961-65 62 16.75 1965-69 62.4 16.95 1969-73 63 17.2 Years Wages 1973-77 67 1977-81 65.65 1981-82 66.3",92
177,Mr CHAPMAN,INCOME SHARES OF GNP,"-I thank the House. This table clearly shows that between 1973 and 1977 the wages share increased from about 63 per cent to 67 per cent. The profits share fell from 17.2 per cent to 13.8 per cent. Between 1977 and 1981 the wages share fell to 65.6 per cent, while the profits share increased to 14.2 per cent. In 1981-82 the wages share increased to 66.3 per cent and the profits share fell to 13.9 per cent. We know only too well that unemployment exploded as a consequence of that change which occurred between 1973 and 1977 under the Whitlam Labor Government. Of course, unemployment has exploded again in recent months when, once again, we have seen the wages share of GNP rise and the profits share fall. In contrast, during the period between 1977 and 1981 when the wages share fell and the profits share increased, there was strong employment growth. In fact, unemployment fell during that period. I also seek leave to incorporat- in Hansard a table which demonstrates the relatIOnship between the percentage of non-farm GOP going to profits and the percentage of the labour force in employment. Leave granted. The table read as followsNA Year GDP 1959-60 17.6 1960-61 16.4 1961-62 16.7 1962-63 17.4 1963-64 18.0 1964-65 17.8 1965-66 16.6 1966-67 17.0 1967-68 17.4 1968-69 17.6 1969-70 18.3 1970-71 17.5 1971-72 16.9 1972-73 17.4 1973-74 16.4 1974-75 14.1 1975-76 13.9 1976-77 14.1 1977-78 13.6 1978-79 14.0 1979-80 14.4 1980-81 14.9 Profits Profits percentage Percentage % % share of of labour 13.85 non-farm force in 14.2 Year GDP employment 13.9 1981-82 13.9 93.7",93
178,Mr CHAPMAN,PROFITS AND JOBS,"- I thank the House. The table shows that when the profits share was high, in the mid to late I 960s, employment was at its peak in this country with about 98 per cent or 99 per cent of the labour force employed. In contrast, in the early to mid-1970s, with the profits share falling under policies instituted by the then Labor Government, employment fell to about 93 per cent or 94 per cent of the labour force. In contrast, in the late 1970s employment levels rose above 94 per cent as the profits percentage of nonfarm GOP once again increased. Over the last 12 months the profits share has fallen again and, as a result, employment growth has fallen and unemployment has increased. That was a direct result of the wages push we have experienced over the last two years. The causal effect of falling profits in reducing employment levels and, - ence, increasing unemployment is clearly shown In thIs table by reference to the time lag between the former and the latter. That reflects the need for market forces to determine levels of remuneration. Those whose hostility to profits is revealed in their rhetoric from time to time would do well to remember this relationship and its importance to Profits the employment prospects of the people the.y percentage Percentage claim to represent. If they fail to do that there IS share of of labour non-farm force in no validity in that representative claim. Byopposemployment ing the concept of the wages freeze and the legIslation we are debating tonight, segments of the 97.5 labour movement are abdicating their responsI97.6 96.6 bility in that regard. 97.7 98.2 At least the New South Wales and Victorian 98.6 governments Labor govern-ents at that--are 98.4 supporting the wages freeze for a penod .of SIX 98.3 98.0 months. Although this is not long enough It IS at 98.0 least a start and it gives some indication that these 98.3 States are prepared to adopt a measure of res98.3 ponsibility. However, we find in this chamber that 97.6 97.2 the Labor Party is opposed to this concept and IS 97.8 opposing this legislation in particular. Th- Leader 96.0 of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), In pubhc state95.1 ments opposing the freeze, has introduced a red 94.7 herring into the argument. He has claimed that a 93.7 93.6 wages freeze will cause a further cont:actton In 93.9 economic activity by reducing the spendtng power 94.2 of consumers who are subject to the freeze. Mr Cunningham That is not a red herring; that is a fact of life. Mr CHAPMANThe honourable member says that it is a fact of life. The fact is that the claim does not stand up to rational economic analysis. To make such a claim destroys any claim the Leader of the Opposition might have to credibility as an economic policy maker. We have seen the destruction of that credibility reflected in the results of the Flinders by-election. Quite simply, a wages freeze will allow more people to remain employed than would otherwise be the case in the current economic climate. The Confederation of Australian Industry and other employer organisations have made that clear in a statement supporting the freeze. The Opposition ought to acknowledge that even the frozen wages and salaries which will be earned by those kept in employment as a result of that freeze over the next 12 months will generally be higher than the unemployment benefit they would be receiving if they faced unemployment, which they would undoubtedly face without the implementation of this wages freeze. Contrary to the claim of the Leader of the Opposition, as a result of the wages freeze consumption spending will be maintained at a higher level than would otherwise be the case. Also those who are employed will have additional confidence that they have a better chance of staying in employment as a result of the wages freeze. That will also encourage greater consumer spending. That economic nonsense from the Leader of the Opposition needs to be soundly laid to rest on that basis. Of course, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, in opposing the freeze--although we are not quite sure from day to day whether it opposes it or supports it-- is equally failing to come to grips with its responsibility for the unemployed as well as its responsibility for those who retain employment. We find that some Labor spokesmen are supporting the freeze and some are irrationally opposing it. But poor old John Bannon, the Premier of South Australia, does not seem to know quite where he stands. Before the Premiers Conference he indicated general support for the concept. Afterwards he had to go to the Trades Hall on South Terrace in Adelaide to get his riding instructions before he could make any announcement on it. Finally, although Mr Bannon's position still is not really clear, it seems that he will not support a wages freeze. South Australia will be the odd man out. I believe that State - my home State --deserves better than that from its new Premier. Wage costs are an even more important issue in South Australia's capacity to compete on interstate and overseas markets than they are perhaps in some other States. Compliance by the State Government is essential to the well-being of all South Australians. There is strong community support for this concept of a wages freeze. This legislation gives the initial effect to that concept. Apart from the faulty economic analysis of those opposing the freeze, those people should be reminded of that strong community support for it. The honourable member for Wills in his comments ought to remember the strong community support for this concept. The legislation provides a lead in dealing with our current economic problems. The details of the legislation have been referred to by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) in his second reading speech, and I do not need to go through them again. Basically, the Bill freezes the wages and salaries of all persons employed by Commonwealth instrumentalities, whether they be direct Public Service employees, or employees of statutory authorities or other Commonwealth bodies including members of the Commonwealth Parliament. The other initiative in the legislation is to freeze the Commonwealth's contribution towards doctors' fees and the Commonwealth contribution towards pharmaceutical benefits. It is to be hoped that apart from freezing the wages of public servants the legislation will also have the effect of encouraging doctors and pharmacists to freeze their incomes in accord with the basic freeze principles that this Government supports, and that that will provide a further incentive to other areas of the private sector to follow on. It will only be if the private sector follows this lead that the Commonwealth Government has so effectively given that this initiative will be successful to the benefit of all Australians. In conclusion, I come back to the point that we need the support of the State governments, and especially the South Australian Labor Government, if this principle is to be effective. The basic principle behind the wages freeze is that our wages have got out of kilter with productivity and that in turn is destroying our international competitiveness. As a community we need to put aside our greed and share the burden over the next 12 months so that at the end of that period we will all be much better off.",93
179,Mr WILLIS,PROFITS AND JOBS,"The legislation which is now before the House is of great importance not just because of its effect on those people who are directly affected--that is, government employees, whose salaries and wages will be frozen by this legislation--but also because of what it represents. That is, it is the Government's legislative response to the worse economic crisis that we have faced in this country for almost 50 years. This is what the Government is going to do to solve the economic problems of this nation and get us out of this terrible crisis which is now afflicting the Australian economy. This is what it is going to do to solve the problems of falling employment, rapidly rising unemployment, high inflation, massive deficit blowouts and falling economic growth. This is the Government's answer to the disastrous economic problems with which we are now confronted. The test of this legislation is this: Is it and the strategy on which it is based an adequate or appropriate response by government to this crisis situation which we are now facing? The Opposition says that it most certainly is not an adequate or appropriate response. The Opposition says that for several reasons, many of which have been canvassed by my colleague the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). Let me just go over some of those points again. First, the origins of the legislation lie not in economics but in politics. There is no doubt that that is where this wages freeze comes from. It comes not from a rational economic response as the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman) would have us believe, but from political aspects related to two factors with which this Government is currently very concerned: First, in the face of this appalling crisis the need to be seen to be actually doing some damn thing; and, secondly, the need to divert attention from its own responsibility for that crisis. They are the two compelling political realities which the Government faces and which it wishes to cover by way of some sort of action such as this. We all know that back benchers have been calling to the Government in the party room: 'For God's sake, please look as though you are doing something about this incredible increase in unemployment and the appalling economic mess you have got us into'. So the Government took off on this wage freeze approach after the former Premier of Western Australia whispered to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that this might not be a bad sort of lurk to play at this time so that the Government can at least look as though it is doing something effective about the economy. Secondly, the legislation diverts attention from the Government's own responsibility. It is, of course, a key part of this Government's approach at present to say that it really has nothing to do with what is going on in the country. It is a terrible mess, the Government knows, but really it is not to blame at all; it is the international recession, the drought and, of course, wage increases which are to blame. It really has nothing to do with budgetary or monetary policy; it has resulted from the other things for which the Government is not responsible. This wage freeze must be seen also in the light of trying to put much more emphasis on that third factor than the Government has hitherto been able to do. It would like us to believe that the economic situation in which we find ourselves at present is really the fault of wage increases and the unions. In other words, it needs another scapegoat apart from the international recession and the drought. The second important factor is that the introduction of the wage freeze has been marked by incredible confusion and misrepresentationoutright and blatant misrepresentation-of what is involved. Let me just look at some of this confusion and misrepresentation. First of all we have seen all sorts of wrangling between Ministers. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee), who is at the table, have reportedly been wrangling about whether we should have a decentralised or a centralised wages system. Each is claiming at present that he has won that battle. I leave it to honourable members and to the public to make up their minds about that. The Treasurer and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations have apparently also been wrangling about whether they need legislation to impose a freeze on the private sector. I think it must be said at this stage that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations seems to have won that round. Then we had the farcical outcome of the Premiers Conference. This Conference was held in this very chamber. The Premiers and Commonwealth Ministers sat for a day and finally came out with a sort of elastic-sided freeze in which on one side there was to be a 12-month freeze and on the other side there was to be a six-month freeze. I must say that that is a rather curious result. Thirdly, there was the misrepresentation by the Commonwealth as to what was actually agreed to by the States. This is a very serious matter. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) undoubtedly blatantly misrepresented to this House, on the day after the Premiers Conference, what in fact was agreed to by the States at that Conference. Let me just go through a few of the points of total and complete misrepresentation to the House by the Acting Prime Minister the following day. He went through a whole series of points about 15 of them-on which he said there had been agreement. The first was that there should be no catch-up at the end of a wage pause. In fact, it was not agreed by any of the Labor State governments that there should be no catch-up. Each of them has maintained that it has not said that it agreed in any way to having no catch-up at the end of a wage pause. They have all said that there should be some examination of the situation at that time. They have made varying responses about that matter, but all in the context of it possible for there to be an increase at that time. is just completely untrue for the Acting Prime Minister to say that they had agreed to having no catch-up after six months. The second point on which the Acting Prime Minister said there was agreement was that the Labor States had agreed there should be no reductions in the standard working hours in their own employment in the six months period to which they had agreed to some pause. That is totally untrue. None of the Labor States agreed to the proposition for reduced working hours. They all said that the negligible cost criteria for reductions in standard hours, which have been utilised not only by them but also by the Commonwealth Government, should continue to apply. They in no way said that there should be no reduction in standard hours; they simply said that the negligible cost criteria should continue as in the past. Then it was said that the Labor States would go into the hearings before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, which are to be held later this week, supporting a sixmonths pause. That is certainly not a correct statement of their position. I understand that they will go into those hearings and make submissions, but it is highly likely that they will do more than just support a six months pause. They will be saying as they proposed to this Government and advocated at the Premiers Conference that there should be a whole package of measures, not just some temporary cessation of wage increases. Of course, the Government would not agree with most of those things being done. That is what the State Labor governments will be saying to the Arbitration Commission, as I understand it. They will not just be saying: 'Yes, it is terrific; there should be a six months wage pause', as the Acting Prime Minister would have us believe was their position. Then it was said that the States were expected to take action against professional incomes which are funded from their Budgets. I understand that this in fact may be the case, but the States were of the opinion that what the Government was doing in the area of professional incomes was totally inadequate. They believed that this whole area of non-wage incomes should have been looked at in much more detail than the Government proposed. The Government's proposal, of course, was really to do nothing at all except to allow those incomes to continue with the exception of an odd case or two in which it said it may pass some legislation. It was also said by the Acting Prime Minister that all governments would urge maximum restraint on other non-wage incbeing omes. Of course, that is a totally meaningless It thing to which the States would not object but which they regarded as not having much importance. Finally, it was said that the $300m which would be spent from the savings on Commonwealth outlays was something that was agreed to by the States. Yes, they agreed to that much but they wanted much more. The whole point of their position was that there needs to be a much more stimulatory package produced by the Commonwealth Government than was in fact produced at the Premiers Conference. I suggest that the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister the morning after the Premiers' Conference was a travesty of the truth, that he blatently misrepresented what actually happened at the Premiers Conference and that he should be condemned for so misleading this House. There is further misrepresentation in regard to the savings from the freeze. We have been told in the aftermath of the Premiers Conference and since, including in the speeches made here this afternoon during this second reading debate, that the Government will be making savings of $300m in regard to Commonwealth outlays. Yes, there will be a $300m saving as a result of not increasing wage and salaries-so they say-but, of course in fact, the savings in regard to the Budget will be negative; in other words, there will be a substantial cost to the Budget. This the Government has been very shy about indeed. Let me just for a moment explain what is involved there. If there is a freeze which is effective in the Commonwealth area, in the States area and generally, the Treasurer said that in the year 1982-83--he said this is response to an Opposition question-there will be a loss of tax revenue of some $200m to $300m. But he did not say what would happen in the whole of 1983. In fact, I understand that when the Australian Council of Trade Unions went to see the Government and talked to the Cabinet a private savings of $2 all billion to $3 billion was talked about. If the Government's view is that the wage freeze will mean a reduction of some $2 billion to $3 billion in wage payments which would otherwise have been made by private employers, the cost to revenue will be of the order of $1 ,DOOm or more because of the lost tax revenue on that. It seems to me that this is a very different situation from the one the Government has been protraying to us, in which savings which were going to be made on the outlay side would pay for the increased expenditure. The reality is that this process, if it is an effective freeze, as the Government says it will be, and if it has the impact it says it will have, will result in a very substantial increase in the deficit. I wonder whether the back benchers have been told about that, whether the dries have been told that this will be the full impact of what the Government is on about, and that this policy, which they all think is so terrific, is going to blow out the deficit much more. Of course, they are all totally against that. They think any policy which does that should not be pursued. Indeed, the incredible irony of this is that today in Question Time the Acting Prime Minister argued that we could not apply stimulatory policies in this country because to do that would blow out the deficit; we could not increase demand in a concerted way, that is through increased government expenditure, because that would increase the Budget deficit. Yet he pursues a policy in respect of a wage freeze which will blowout the deficit enormously on the figures given to the ACTU by his own colleagues. This seems to me an incredible situation, one which shows that this Government is totally confused as to what it is about. It has no real idea of how to run this country or how to control the economy. It is reacting on the run, picking up an idea from an ex-Premier of Western Australia, running with something it thinks it can make political mileage out of in a short time. It has no regard for the economic reality which faces this nation and no regard for what is really needed to get this economy back on its feet. The Government's argument that there needs to be a very substantial transfer of income from wage and salary earners to profits, supposedly because the rapid real wage rises in the last two years have depressed profits and caused unemployment, is in the Opposition's view grossly exaggerated. There certainly has been an increase in real wages in the last couple of years. But honourable members opposite, particularly the Government, should be very cautious in using average weekly earnings figures as the basis for claiming that there has been a super increase in real wages in the last year or two. The fact is that those figures are highly suspect. They are based on a new survey which seems to have some dubious aspects. Also, with unemployment there is an upward bias in the average weekly earnings figures because it is mainly the lower paid workers who get the sack or who do not get jobs, so one is measuring the incomes of people who tend to be higher up the income scale. So these figures are probably quite misleading at present. I do not have time to go into the details of this, but the Flinders Institute of Labour Studies, which publishes the Australian Bulletin of Labour stated in its latest bulletin that it simply did not believe the average weekly earnings figures. It said that they were exaggerations. Indeed, if one looks at the average award rate figures, which measure just award rates and not total earnings, one sees a much lower rate of increase. In the last two years the real average weekly earnings figure has been 6 per cent and the real award rate figure has been only 2 per cent. That is a very big difference indeed. If the average award rate figure is the right figure, as people are now arguing, that destroys the whole basis of the Government's argument, even on the face of it, which is that there has been a very substantial increase in real award wages. By that I certainly am not saying that therefore wages do not matter; I am saying that the Government's trying to point to the increase in real wages and to say This is an horrific increase which is eating up profits and destroying jobs' is a very dubious argument indeed. The Government is basing that argument on figures which may be very misleading. In relation to that, it should also be noted that the argument--it was used by the previous speaker in this debate-that because the profit share is so low real wages should be reduced simply does not hang together. The profit share is always reduced in a recession because fixed costs have to be allocated over lesser units of output. Costs go up and cannot be passed on because of a recession. The previous speaker incorporated tables in Hansard showing that profit share was less in recession years. Of course it was. But that does not mean it was because of higher wages; it could well be simply because there was unemployment and recession in those years. In other words, it is not a matter of unemployment being caused by reduced proflt share, but rather it is a matter of reduced profit share being caused by unemployment. That is a relationship which the Treasurer and the previous speaker fail to understand, which the whole Government turns its back on, but which nevertheless is tremendously important to understand. Another factor which must be mentioned in this regard is that the wage freeze will do little to create jobs. That is because to some extent already a wage freeze is operating. With the recession many unions, even the stronger unions, are finding it difficult to get any pay increases at all. To the extent that there is already a wage freeze, this freeze will do nothing to create jobs. To the extent that there is not already a wage freeze and this legislation, and this plan, is effecthat tive in imposing such a freeze, it will reduce real wages further than they would otherwise fall. That will reduce consumption expendiure. Despite what the previous speaker had to say that will mean reduced demand for goods and services. That, in turn, will mean that there will be less incentive for employers to maintain production and employment. All that will result from the reduction in real wages. The argument that the income will shift to real profit and that therefore employers with more profits will be able to spend more is simply ridiculous. They will not spend more on employing more people unless there is more demand for their goods and services. Why should they produce more, why should they employ more, in a private enterprise system, not because there is more demand for their goods and services but simply because their profits go up a little bit? Indeed, their profits will not go up a little bit anyway if there is reduced demand because eventually those profits margins will decline again. Therefore, they will be back in a situation of low profits but with even more recession and more unemployment than was previously the case. So this argument about real profits being increased by a cut in real wages and boosting employers' capacity to employ is a nonsense. What are needed in this country are policies to increase demand, not policies like this to reduce demand. Certainly, it is true that the Government is planning to spend some $300m on capital works to give a small injection to demand as an offsetting factor. That will have some small effect on the other side of the equation-I acknowledge that. But I make the point that that in effect will be very small. Honourable members should not delude themselves in any way that by a $300m expenditure on capital works there will be a turnaround in the economy, that demand will pick up and that the economy will get back on its feet again. It is absolutely ridiculous to argue in that way. Even if one assumes a multiplier of two, on the figures the Government has given, the total employment effect will be a maximum of 20,000 jobs. There are 600,000 officially unemployed and an increase in the work force of 110,000 every year. So 20,000 jobs in that context is a drop in the ocean. It is important for the 20,000 people to get the jobs, and they are better than nothing. But that is all they are better than and indeed they are probably wiped out, on the other hand, by the reduction in consumption expenditure and real wages which is part and parcel of this policy. Finally, an argument against the wage freeze is wage freezes always fail to work. They do no more than give a temporary alleviation from cost increases. At the end of the period of the freeze there is certain to be a blowout again. No economist in this country would not support me in saying that a wage freeze will not give a lasting solution to the problems. A lasting solution can be found only through a combination of policies to increase demand-through more stimulatory budgetary and monetary policies allied to prices and incomes policies to ensure that that increase in demand finishes up as increased production and employment and not as increased inflation. The conference which we believe should be established and which is called for in the amendment could be a first step to setting up such a prices and incomes policy in this country. Without it we will be in a low growth trap in which expansion will never be possible. We can get continued expansion without inflation only with a prices and incomes policy. The Labor Party will implement such a policy when it is elected to government next year and will provide the only lasting basis for sustained growth of the economy and for reduction of unemployment. Policies such as a wage freeze will get us nowhere.",94
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROFITS AND JOBS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,98
181,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PROFITS AND JOBS,"-1t saddens me to realise that the Opposition's arguments so far in this debate have been very high on rhetoric but very low on a full appreciation of the situation facing Australia at this time. This legislation has the rare distinction of having the agreement of not only the Commonwealth but also the State Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. This concurrence highlights, I believe, the gravity of the position the Commonwealth and the States find themselves in, with shrinking employment, growing unemployment and the high costs of industry that cannot compete in international markets. In each of these aspects Australia can readjust and rearrange its own affairs to assist in a recovery. The pity is that the circumstances we face at the moment, allied to the drought conditions throughout Australia, have brought this realisation so late to the nation's legislators. There are also outside influences over which we as a nation and we as a government have no control--the world-wide economic recession, declining mineral demand, surplus food products, the intransigence of the European Economic Community and its success at protection and subsidisation of products which it then dumps on world markets. The only control which Australia can exercise over these matters is to be more competitive, more efficient, more reliable and more productive. In all of those areascompetition, efficiency, reliability and productivity-we have declined over recent years. Some of them, but not all, come back to the industrial situation that has prevailed throughout Australia over the last decade. These problems have to be redressed. The wage pause can be a start in making that situation possible. This legislation affects only the Commonwealth Public Service, some 470,000 people, including us parliamentarians. The amount saved, $300m, will be made available to other labourintensive and work-oriented projects. I have noticed that housing will be allocated $IOOm of this amount. Apart from the initial ability to create and keep jobs in the housing industry, this has the worthy secondary flow-on effects of boosting purchases of household goods, white goods, motor vehicles, and landscaping plans, and of opening up financial markets still further to the home buying market. I suggest that other projects for expenditure of the remainding $200m might well be road construction and maintenance and water conservation projects, both of which will materially enhance the economic and social prospects of all Australians. I am sure that I can put forward Queensland, my own State, as a State where such road and water projects could be profitably undertaken. The Australian economic pie has been shrinking over the past 12 months, and it is obvious in which direction it has shrunk. The annual growth in Australia's economy to the September quarter was 0. I per cent. This comprised an increase in the wages, salaries and allowances component of 16.9 per cent and a decrease in company profits of 13.6 per cent. This affirms that the wage and salary component of the economic pie grew in the last year at the expense of business profits. In comparision, the consumer price index, a measure of the inflation rate, rose by approximately 12 per cent. I appreciate that several years ago, about April 1977, a voluntary wage and price freeze was attempted. This, of course, proved futile. The present wage pause, which is expected to flow on to the private sector, is not linked with a price pause through legislation, and I can understand why this is the case. Firstly, the profit decline of the past 12 months must be given some chance of recovery if the private sector is to re-employ. Secondly, associated with wage increases and commodity increases over the past six months are costs which have yet to flow through and which, if not recovered in prices, will mean further liquidations and bankruptcies; and bankrupts cannot employ, they can only layoff labour. Thirdly, the necessary cost of price control will only add millions of dollars to an already over-expended Budget and confusion and red tape to the implementation of an impossible task. Apparently the Premiers are also aware of these difficulties about price control and have agreed to a voluntary or trust system, whereas the pause will be used by the private sector to keep prices at an operational limit so that the wage pause will be accompanied by an inflation hesitation. I hope that this spirit of trust and co-operation will be established and achieved. The Salary and Wages Pause Bill includes two areas of private enterprise. One is the suspension of the powers of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, which is currently hearing the case for catch-up costs. This will mean that the cost of certain prescriptions will not be varied during the period of the pause. The second concerns the maintenance at current levels of fees approved under the Health Insurance Act 1973. While the second matter reflects a pause in increases associated with labour content, both of the professional medical personnel and the staff, I feel that there is reason in this argument. However, the pharmacist is in a catch-up situation, both with regard to labour costs and material costs, which goes back several months I understand. There is a need for special consideration to be given to allowing this flow-on, basically on the grounds that the effect of a predetermined decision of a remuneration fixing authority should be allowed to flow on in spite of this legislation. I believe it is inconsistent to allow other prices in the private sector to float or to catch up but then to deny pharmacists the same right. This wage pause, if accepted by all governments and by the whole of the private sector, will not in itself provide the answer to our economic ills. In 12 months time we cannot resume the march and thus accept and continue the other problems which are major causes of the present recession that Australia is now feeling. I deal only with those matters where the governments of Australia, with the co-operation of its people, can provide a review so that the economic pie can be more equitably and fairly divided and allowed to grow. The period of the wage pause will be wasted unless the time is used effectively to review and adjust many of these factors which in combination make up the real wealth of Australia. As I understand, an Opposition speaker said a little while ago that a comprehensive plan has to be accepted and adhered to. This can be done only in a spirit of co-operation and goodwill whereby we frankly and honestly address ourselves to the other underlying problems and tackle them on a bipartisan basis. Let us commence with the arbitration and industrial commissions. Australia has been the victim of demarcation disputes, bans and strikes which have robbed us all of productivity and given us a reputation for unreliability. The current dispute concerning the berthing of the Australian National Line bulk carrier River Boyne and many other demarcation disputes throughout Australia have all been at the huge expense of Australia itself. As Australians we have all been the losers. I believe that some efTective enforcement procedures to enable the Commission to work properly and effectively. If parties are not to abide by decisions handed down we might as well not have industrial tribunals at all. Enforcement may have to be associated with penalties. Perhaps we could legislate for bonds to be posted by parties and unions registered with the Commission. Non-adherence to a decision would mean forfeiture of those bonds. Whatever is done, enforcement is absolutely necessary to overcome the present situation in which we find ourselves. We should not, as a nation, have to rely on the independent activities of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to settle demarcation disputes after months of costly disruptions. We have to tackle that sacred cow of the Australian economythat is, the industrial relations area. Early in the 1960s MIM, or Mount Isa Mines Ltd, as it is known in the Kennedy electorate, provided the real watershed throughout Australia in the industrial relations area. When union interrivalry forced the close down of that mine for six months the re-opening ushered in a new era of a more attentive management prepared to consult with the work force through the union officials on the job. This has resulted in a much improved industrial climate for that great Queensland company. However, this example has not been followed by other companies, in particular those multinational companies that have resorted to completing agreements with unions based only on commercial considerations. These companies, with large resources and potential profits, set ditions of pay and employment with unions well above the standards accepted through normal arbitration. These commercial agreements have become the new standards to be met by all companies and businesses throughout Australia whether or not they can afford to reduce profitability. Employers in the early 1970s bowed to union demands on the misunderstanding-as it now proves to be-that Australia was wealthy enough to pay any wage bill presented to it. I must admit that at that time. I was an employer and was part and parcel of that back down in the face of those demands. This produced many of the difficult pay and award conditions that we have today. I will mention just a few. Four weeks annual leave was given as compared to two weeks in America on completion of two years successful service. There was a 17+ per cent annual leave loading. We now pay a person in Australia more to go on holiday there have to be than to go to work. Mr Lusher It is a shame. Mr BRAITHWAITEAITEAbsolutely. It is a shame. There is a reduced period of service to qualify for long service leave entitlement. Overtime and penalty rates are double and treble normal rates. A compulsion to unionise I believe has made 80 per cent of the Australian work force come under union influence as compared with 21 per cent in the United States of America. These are the real costs which are reducing employment opportunities in our industries. These are the costs that are borne by our primary and mining industries and manufacturers trying to sell against competion from other nations that are not loaded by these unreal conditions and high costs. Mr LusherDid you talk about sick leave?",98
182,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PROFITS AND JOBS,"No, I did not talk about sick leave. But that certainly is another factor. Mr Lusher It used to be that sick leave was only for when you were sick. There was no accumulation.",100
183,Mr BRAITHWAITE AITE,PROFITS AND JOBS,"Jt has become a right and not an entitlement. During this wage pause there has to be a complete review of all these conditions. We need a minimal, hourly wage, not a weekly wage. Australia needs a seven-day week, not a nine-day fortnight. We have to become more efficient and productive if jobs existing today are to be saved. I hope that there will be more meaningful discussions between management and the work force itself at the factory floor level. A oneindustry union in place of the multiplicity of conunions that we have at present involved in disputes with members often fighting against one another is one aspect at which we should look. We certainly could improve upon the present situation. Mr Lusher Did you talk about maternity leave and paternity leave'?",100
184,Mr BRAITHWAITE AITE,PROFITS AND JOBS,"-- No, I have passed that. Management also has to realise that while its outlay in capital and technology has to be protected, so too do human and labour resources available to a company have to be consulted and protected. Management has to pay more attention to the needs of its work force. The ideal situation would be for a government to remove itself from the industrial arena but this is not really practicable. However, it can provide the forum for management and labour to discuss, honestly and frankly, these problems between themselves. As I have said before, it requires a bipartisan approach to reach right across political prejudices for the good of all Australians. After all, we are here to represent the people. We are expected to govern for the people. I deal finally with the protection of Australian business. The European Economic Community and its influence on the world economy and its markets is enough of a lesson on the evils of protection in its worse form. Protection in Australia has for too long propped up inefficient industries and moved high costs on to the consumer. On one hand, when protection was given to an industry, a higher wage demand was a result. On the other hand, the industry was too weak to protect itself from the threat of union action. The consumer is the person who finally pays the bill and the consumer is the person who elects us as members of parliament. There is no need to remove or to cease this protection immediately but there should be a comprehensive plan to reduce it over a specified period. Business can only become more efficient as a result. Certainly we should encourage government action, through realistic depreciation and other allowances, which will give industries the incentive to produce and to compete. But I think that protection in its other form should be looked at closely. I speak in favour of this Salaries and Wages Pause Bill. I request the Government to look very carefully at these real problems that are underpinning the recession that we have at the moment. They are certainly not covered in this Bill. I believe that there is a realisation by the Australian public that we have all been taking more out of this system than it can afford. In view of the employment situation, the state of the world economy and our own economy, I believe that this fresh expectation would lead to an acceptance of the basic principle that each one of us could take a little less and give a little more to allow this nation to regain its former position of strength. I and the National Party fully support the Bill. I hope that the Government will take on board those additional items that have been mentioned. Mr lJREN (Reid) (9.27) The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) mentioned several times during his speech that we need a comprehensive plan. There is no comprehensive plan. This legislation grew out of deceit and opportunism at the time of the Flinders by-election. The Government stole two words 'wage freeze'. There was no plan and no concept. In fact the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) knows that there was a division of thought on this matter even within the Cabinet. Even now there is division over how to control wages. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Department of the Treasury wanted to decentralise wage-fixing tribunals. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations supported the concept of centralised wage tribunals having control over wages. That division of thought still applies. But to some extent the status quo has been maintained by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. At this stage he has a victory over the Treasury. Let us stop all this nonsense about the Government having a plan. There is no plan and no real concept. In fact there is no historical precedent in Australia or anywhere else in the world. It is tragic that we are debating this Salaries and Wages Pause Bill and a related Bill. This is an historic moment in Australian politics. This legislation has been drawn up in haste and has been rushed through this House with cynicism. The Salaries and Wages Pause Bill has been presented by this Government as its response to alleged agreements reached at the Premiers Conference last week. If any agreements were reached at that meeting they were at best ambiguous, tentative and partial. The slick short term gimmickry of this Government is no answer to the complex and deep seated problems facing this country. Each of the Premiers in his own way realises that. Yet some have gone along by default because of the failure of this Government to exercise leadership and to come up with a soundly based program for recovery and renewal. What we need in this country is a plan for recovery and renewal. This Government has no such plan. Only the forces on this side have an alternative. There is no Premiers plan; all we have is a punt. But we do have a tragic similarity with a major error of the past. The Niemeyer plan for a 10 per cent wage cut during the 1930s Depression caused massive damage to the Australian economy and society. At that time, with inflation at low levels, wage cuts were effected by reducing rates of pay. Today, with inflation persisting in double figures, a wage cut can be effected by pegging wages while prices are permitted to rise. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations who is at the table knows that prices will continue to rise. We know that they will rise by over 12 per cent this year. This legislation is a part of a general proposal by this Government to force a real wage cut on a section of the community. The specific legislation before us will directly affect over 470,000 Australian Government employees and their families. The Government hopes to extend the wage cut through decisions made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and by the State governments to the private sector and to State government employees. The thrust of this legislation is wrong socially, economically and morally. Firstly, it breeds confusion, insecurity and division in our society. It places the burden of recession unfairly on to the working people of this country and their dependants, without any complementary action on the prices front and without any action to restrict greater profit and wealth accumulation by those outside the scope of this legislation. Secondly, it will aggravate our economic problems rather than help to solve them. Domestic demand, already depressed, will be pulled down further as a result of the erosion of household spending power that the wage cut will cause. While 1,000 jobs are being lost every day, while uncertainty persists about interest rates, while prices and charges continue rise, any sensible people in a household will be very cautious about their future spending. They will work out what they can do without and try to build up their own personal savings to protect them against any further future hardships. Many sectors of the economy, especially in the service sector, will experience further decline. Businesses will be in trouble and many jobs will be lost. Thirdly, the Government estimates of savings achieved through the wage cut are questionable. When sales fall and when unemployment rises the Government revenues are reduced and expenditures are increased. The most probable net effect of the wage cut will be a large Budget deficit and more vulnerable economy. It is also likely that any savings incurred by the States will be used for the purpose of balancing their Budgets rather than expanding their programs. Fourthly, what happens when the freeze on wages is lifted? What plan does the Government have to cope with the problems that will flow from this present action- All previous experience suggests that the chaos created in the longer term is not worth the short term costs. The Government has attempted to dress up its wage cut proposals with some ad hoc initiatives related to employment. The States have been told that they will receive an extra $100m for construction of public housing. The Government now talks of the effectiveness of investment in housing for providing jobs directly in the housing industry and indirectly throughout the economy. Labor welcomes the boost of further moneys to the public housing sector. We have been arguing for years that housing should be given a higher priority. We have, in Australia a massive growing backlog of neglected housing needs. We have surplus capacity and high unemployment in the housing industry. It is common sense and good economic sense to expand the home building industry. When the private housing sector is depressed it is appropriate to lift the level of activity in the public housing sector. But why has it taken this Government so long to wake up to this argument? Why has this Government, for seven years, deliberately stifled the housing industry in this country in both the private and public sectors? We know that there has been a deliberate policy by this government to divert funds from both the private and public sectors. In the private sector the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry showed today that this year there will be only 110,000 commencements in the housing sector. In an industry which has a capacity of 155,000 housing commencements, there will be only to 110,000 commencements. We need at least 155,000 housing commencements to meet present and future developments. The figure of 110,000 is the lowest in 20 years. The housing sector is at the lowest ebb for 20 years. Why has it taken the Government so long to act? It is because it has carried out a deliberate policy of diverting money away from the housing sector to other industries, particularly the resources sector. The Government's action now gives the lie to its previous arguments that housing is a relatively unproductive investment and that funds should be diverted out of the housing sector to make room for expanded investment in other sectors. a Its actions now seriously call into question the thrust of this Government's withdrawal from public housing. I seek leave to incorporate a table in Hansard showing the real net federal payments to the States for housing from 1974-75 to 1982-83. Leave granted. The table read as followspayments (Grants and 1974 75 392.4 1975-76 371.6 1976 77 380.9 1977-78 3956 1978-79 335.5 1979-80 265.5 198081 277.5 1981-82 255.2 198283 318.2 Source: Budget Paper No.7, various years and 1982-3 implicit",101
185,Mr UREN,PROFITS AND JOBS,"I thank the House. The table shows that in 1974-75 the States received a net amount of $652m for housing. That amount was savagely cut back each year to $52m in 1981-82. As a result, the number of public dwelling commencements fell from 19,428 in 1974-75 to 9,360 in 1980-81. The waiting lists for public housing grew longer. In fact, there are now 100,000 families-this figure is risingin all areas waiting for public housing. In New South Wales alone, there are over 40,000 families waiting for Housing Commission homes. In the 1982-83 Budget the States were given increased funds but nowhere near sufficient to compensate for the previous cuts. The amount they received was not even enough for them to employ half of their operating capacity. The amount given was without any guarantee of stability to allow the States to plan ahead confidently. Let us look at this on a broader scale. If one looks at what has occurred since January 1976 to the present day and takes the amount of money made available in the year 1974-75, in real money terms the Commonwealth has stolen from the States, and particularly the people on low incomes, an amount of $3,500m. The accumulated funds amount to $3,500m. Another 70,000 dwellings could have been built with that money during that period. That would have alleviated a great deal of suffering in this country. The Australian economy might be a little healthier if that were the situation. Out of the blue, the Government provides another $IOOm to be distributed on a population basis amongst the States. The money is to be earmarked for public housing construction. It is given mainly as an employment creating initiative. Again, there is a lack of understanding on the Government's part. It does not understand the social problems about public sector housing which have occurred in the past.

Labor supports an expansion of the home building industry for the purposes of providing employment, stimulating domestic industries and meeting housing needs. I seek to incorporate in Hansard a list of figures which demonstrates the employment effects of expanded home building. Leave granted. The document read as followsNA NA Every $IOOm expenditure on home building provides directly about 1,450 jobs in on-site and off-site construction. Of that $1 OOm, $59m is spent on the purchase of building materials and services, generating indirectly another 2,700 jobs in supply industries. A further 4,000 extra jobs come from the multiplier effect of spending $1 OOm throughout the economy. So the total employment effect of $1 OOm expenditure on home building is 8,150 jobs. The $59m on building supplies and services is spent as follows: $7.8m on sawmill products, such as timber beams and floorboards $7.6m on wholesale trade $7.0m on clay products, such as bricks, tiles and pipes $6.1 m on cement, readymix and concrete products $5.7m on joinery and wood products $4.7m on sheet metal, structural metal and metal products. $3.9m on household appliances $3.6m on transport services $2.6m on non-metallic minerals, such as sand and gravel $1.7m on other business services $1.5m on electrical machinery $1.2m on plastic products $1.1 m on paints, varnishes and lacquers $3.3m on other goods and services Source: Australian National Accounts, Input. Output Tables 1974-75.",103
186,Mr UREN,BUILDING,"I thank the House. The figures show that for $1 OOm invested in the housing sector, a total of 1,450 people are directly employed, and 2,700 people are indirectly employed within clay industries, timber industries and other associated industries to the building industry. A further 4,000 extra jobs will come from the multiplier effect of spending that $IOOm throughout the economy. So, in total, there are something like 8, ISO jobs for every $IOOm investment. The Government's estimate today is that there will be another 2,000 dwellings built for $1 OOm of expenditure. That is an average unit cost of about $SO,OOO. Assuming that the land component per dwelling is about $12,000 that leaves about $76m to be invested in construction activity. As the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) said that will provide 3,200 jobs directly and indirectly. He really did not deal with the multiplier effect. If honourable members read the document I have incorporated in Hansard they will see what these multiplier effects are. I have done a great deal of research on this matter. The whole basis of the Labor Party policy for the revival of the housing industry is dealt with in that way. Housing is one of the surest and fastest triggers of employment. Housing cannot be dealt with in a piecemeal way. Housing cannot be dealt with in a sectional way. Housing cannot be dealt with in a gimmicky way. Unfortunately, that has been the situation. The only way to deal with housing is on a broad front. The only way to tackle it first of all is to make sure that there is stability in the industry. This Government has undermined and ruined the whole building industry. The industry has no stability at all. As I say, the approvals for building commencements are the lowest for 20 years. The figures were published today by the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry. Not only do we have to bring stability to the industry but we have to maintain cash flows. An assured amount of has to be made available to the housing industry at an affordable price. Today we also have to look particularly at the situation in the private sector. We must overcome the deposit gap. Programs must be put forward by the national Government to overcome the deposit gap. When we house people we then have to make sure they are protected. Under this Government interest rates since February 1980 have risen by 4 per cent. A person paying off a $30,000 loan is in fact paying an extra $88 a month or over $20 a week extra. That has been the situation. Therefore, we must protect those people with their mortgage repayments so that they will not be evicted from their houses. If we are going to deal with public housing sector we have to deal with it on an even broader front than this Government is doing. Honourable members will see that the Australian Labor Party's policy says clearly that we will make available a base rate of $SOOm over the first three years of government. This Government has guaranteed only $200m each year for a five year period. What we have said is that on top of the first amount we would make another $IOm available to the housing commissions so that we might be able to uplift the social and cultural amenities of the housing commission areas. On top of that we will make a further $ISm available to local government. We also have to look at the problem of people living in rental accommodation, particularly private rental accommodation. Next to the homeless people in this community they are being affected more than other people. They should also be given housing assistance. That would be given by a Labor government. We have to attack the problem. The problem cannot be dealt with in the piecemeal or opportunist way of this Government. Let us look at the context of the Government's housing proposal. It has not been properly thought through. The land available to the State housing authorities for new dwelling construction is largely in the outlying areas of capital cities. Land in the inner and middle suburbs of most capital cities is scarce and very expensive. Housing authorities will be pressed to expand housing in fringe areas which are poorly serviced with transport, recreation and community services. Such areas are poorly serviced because this Government, particularly over the last seven years, has cut back funds in the savage way that I have spelt out. The Government also has cut back funds in other related services associated with urban and regional development programs. We run the risk of perpetuating the mistake of public housing where low income earners are forced into deprived areas isolated from jobs and community amenities. We run the risk of reinforcing the stigma that has surrounded public housing in the past and which progressive governments have sought in recent years to overcome. Housing cannot be expanded in isolation from the development of related urban services. We should be promoting programs which will help to build integrated human settlements where access to jobs, and transport and community services are an integral part of the living environment. This Government does not understand this philosophy. In its haste and expediency and opportunism it will cause repetition of past errors from which lessons should have been drawn. The biggest lessons that this Government is blind to are the lessons learnt during the last major depression of this country. Now is the time to put in place the infrastructure we will need for the growth of our future industries and population. Now is the time to stimulate the domestic economy. Now is the time to invest in programs that will generate growth in the future. Now is the time to invest in the skills of our population. This is a period of major structural change in the Australian economy. It is a time of major social change. We have to prepare now to house, feed and clothe a population of around 20 million by the turn of the century. We have to build now for the jobs and the requirements of that growing population. We should now be expanding our investment in infrastructure and human skills and laying the foundation for recovery and renewal of transport, housing, water ways, forests and other essential areas of social and economic activity. For this reason I support the amendment moved by the honurable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). I believe that this Government's decision of opportunism will be paid for by the Government at the next election.",103
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,105
188,Mr MCLEAN,BUILDING," This is a debate about a small but very important policy initiative to cope with a very major recession facing the people of this country. It is about a small part of what ought to be a comprehensive package of measures. I think it is a pity for the sake of the unemployed and the marginally employed that their interests have been subordinated in this public debate over recent weeks, and again tonight, to the political interests of those who purport to protect their interests. The Australian Labor Party, in its response to this legislation tonight, has bowed again to the trade union movement of this country. It amazes me that the unions and the ALP seem to accept no responsibility for and no obligation to the unemployed. The Labor Party says that under this wages pause program wage and salary earners are being asked to bear the burden of this recession. That is partly correct but the Labor Party would do well to realise that it is those who cannot find work, those who may soon be out of work and those who are receiving no wages or salaries, who are carrying the burden of this recession-largely because of the neglect of those who claim to be the guardians of their interests. I think it is sad indeed that the unions and the ALP by their opposition to this Bill have decided not only to ignore the plight of the unemployed but also inevitably to add more to the unemployed list. Who then represents the unemployed in wage negotiations and advocacy before the industrial tribunals? It is certainly not the labour movement in both its industrial and political wings. Surely the labour movement must see that we have a major recession, understand what has caused it and assess what is needed to minimise its impact on the work force. The labour movement would do well to focus its attention not only on the consequences of unemployment-as it does almost exclusively in economic debates--but also on its causes. The reality is obvious to anyone but itself. I think that a sensible look at the causes of the present problem facing this country gives us a clear indication of the proper policy initiatives which ought to be followed by the Government. The causes are clear. We have the worse drought in our history. Rock bottom commodity prices are affecting our resource industries. The international recession has reduced the demand for our exports and placed our import competing industries under the hammer by the very aggressive marketing of overseas suppliers. Each of those factors is beyond the capacity of any Australian government to influence or control. But confronted with such problems there are certain domestic policies which this Government can and should implement. A sensible wages policy is one such area, particularly given the fact that in recent times wage settlements in Australia not only have failed to minimise the effect of the world recession on Australia but also have actually accentuated the influence of the recession on the Australian economy. Let us consider a few relevant facts in this regard. The international recession has reached such proportions that real gross national product, or national output, in the industrialised world will actually fall this year. World trade will remain stagnant, having fallen in value last year for the first time in 20 years. Confronted with this scenario and given that international trade is more important to Australia than to most other countries what kind of policy direction would any sensible person expect from those who control the economic forces of this country? Given this environment one would surely expect all Australian producers to increase their productivity and lower their costs. In fact, the reverse has occurred. At the very time when the overseas influences were being felt we had a wages explosion combined with a push for shorter hours. In other words, with weaker international demand and a reduced domestic market companies facing empty order books and declining profits were being confronted with higher costs in the form of wage claims which they could not pay. The wages push was spearheaded by the metal trades package which, taking account of reduced hours, was equivalent to an increase of over 20 per cent in wages. In the building industry-deep in recession and confronted with high interest rates existing projects earlier this year were confronted not with reduced demands from unions but with industrial sabotage. The unions knew that with project developers paying peak interest rates they had to complete their projects within tight timetables, to finish the projects in fact at almost any cost, and the unions extended their blackmail against the developers, extracting maximum concessions for their members against the threat of halting concrete pours and similar tactics. Their claims were met but at great cost to the developers, to the nation and now to the unions' own members who cannot find jobs. The building unions-the Builders Labourers Federation and the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia--have had a reduction in hours and a 23 per cent increase in wages since November 1980. Now, with many of their members out of a job, the unions are seeking a reduction in hours worked in a week from 38 hours to 35 hours and a wage increase for 1983 of 22 per cent. They want to work only 182 days a year that is, half a year. I know many unemployed who would work for less and work for longer. This claim, together with other non-wage benefits, means that the cost per man-hour of work, if all claims are accepted, will have increased by 143 per cent over the past three years-- at a time when employers are facing a bleak future. But they will still face blackmail and sabotage from these unions. That is a recipe for more unemployment. The Labor Party and the union movement are the first to criticise market failure when it appears in the capital and the business sector, but to them the labor market is somehow different. Yet nowhere is market failure more obvious or devastating for employment. Whilst many of our products have to compete in free markets overseas, the market for our major cost component is highly restrictive and monopolistic. Trade unions monopolise the labour market. They seek prices for labour which benefit the declining number of employed in the industry at the expense of the growing number of unemployed in industry. In other markets the unions seek the power of the Trade Practices Act to stop the kind of abuse which is practised by unions in the labour market. While union leaders such as the former communist John Halfpenny drink their white wine with their Labor Party friends in Canberra, the men they represent are suffering from the claims that they put forward, ostensibly on behalf of all workers but in reality at the expense of the unemployed and the marginally employed. Throughout the Australian community in the year to September 1982 ordinary time earnings of all fully employed males rose by about 17 per cent-that is, wages rose at about 40 per cent faster than prices and at a rate on average 60 per cent higher than in overseas industrialised nations. All this is at a time when we must be more competitive. How can anyone, given that kind of situation, possibly oppose a pause in wages as a means of preserving existing jobs and increasing employment when the international recovery finally comes, whenever that might be? I think it is economic madness to oppose these measures. I can conclude only that it is political posturing by the members of the Opposition who owe their political status to a union movement which in the past has shown scant regard for the needs of the nation and of those people whose best interests they are meant to serve but who they have chosen to ignore. I make these comments as one who does not have a record in this place of being a union basher. I think the union movement is both necessary and important in the economic and social life of this country. But surely one has to question the motives of people such as Gallagher and communists such as Halfpenny and Carmichael who, I believe, are more interested in undermining the economic and social structure of this country than in serving the interests of the workers they pretend to represent. Obviously, as the private sector is the major employer in this country and wages and the recession have squeezed profits, a wage pause is needed to increase company profitability. Profits remain a major source of investment expenditure and potential employment growth. The latest national account figures show quite clearly that wages and salaries have increased sharply-they have gone through the roof-and company profitability has gone through the floor. If we are to take part in any international recovery and to increase employment, obviously profits will have to rise and real wages will have to decline. This means that the freeze on the wages section of national income is absolutely imperative. The Labor Party cannot have it both wayswith the Opposition spokesman on industry and commerce, on the one hand, expressing dismay at business bankruptcies and the left wing of his party stating, on the other hand, that profits are obscene. Yet, on any time chart, there is a very close correlation between profits and employment. When profits rise so does the level of employment; when profits fall so does the level of employment. If we are to share in any international recovery and increase employment by so doing, obviously our inflation rate will have to fall below those of other nations which we compete against in international trade. Given all this, it is ridiculous to talk in terms of adding to aggregate demand by increasing real wages and spending power because this, in the present economic circumstances, will lead only to a higher inflation rate, not higher production and a higher level of employment. Nations overseas which have sought to do this have succeeded only in increasing the inflation rate and the level of unemployment. Any look at recent economic history, both here and overseas, will show that to be the case. The Labor movement and the Labor Party I think would do well to consider what is happening in the real world of the private sector at the present time before they criticise the wage pause proposals of this Government and the Premiers Conference. In many areas of the private sector there is a growing realisation that we are all in this thing together and the burden of the recession needs to be shared. It seems to me that in the private sector, in those companies in which there is a proprietorial interest in the day to day running of a firm's affairs and in which there is a close, work place relationship between the union and managemant, agreements on wages of the kind which we are seeking here tonight for the public sector are already being made. I know of companies in which management and the unions have come together and worked out arrangements whereby the workers accept a wage pause, directors in turn agree to a reduction in their fees and management agrees that non-award employees accept a similar wage or salary pause. That is being done by mutual agreement and by recognising that the company is going through a rough time. Profits are down, order books are almost empty and, if a company and its jobs are to survive this downturn, all have to help keep costs down. This kind of thing is happening in the private sector right now because those directly involved in the work place know the reality of life in an economic downturn. Unions and management are able to make such arrangements. It is a pity it did not happen sooner for the sake of the many who are now out of work. In those cases in which the workers are represented by large, centralised unions with little relationship to the work place and in which management removes itself from the work place these matters are much more difficult to resolve. The union advocates and management advocates become involved in semi-political disputation, owing allegiances to broad groupings far removed from the work place. When this occurs, as it often does, decisions are made on behalf of, rather than by, those who are directly involved and those who would prefer to make their own priorities in the full knowledge of what their work place reality is. But the deals now being made show what can be achieved when political and peer group pressures of this kind are removed and common sense is able to prevail. As I have said, it is a pity that these matters were not taken into account earlier. I think we as a parliament have an obligation to support the now emerging consensus. I can remember 18 months ago Government spokesmen were advocating that economic reality should prevail in negotiations between industry and the union movement. At that time both employers and employees used to respond by saying: 'It is not economic reality which ought to prevail; it is industrial reality'. This meant that if the unions did not get what they wanted there would be industrial trouble. This led to outrageous and unreal settlements which have caused all parties, too late, to stare economic reality in the face. Those same employers and employees now want the rest of the community to pay in the form of higher tariff protection and more unemployment. Employers are now saying that they cannot afford wage indexation. It is a pity they cannot be a little more consistent in these matters. I support the legislation which is before the Parliament. We are confronted with a national crisis in which all sections of the community-particularly the employed-must share the burden of the recession rather than force it on to the existing unemployed and those who may soon be unemployed in the absence of any form of wage restraint. I think that the public servants of this country serve this nation very well. But in the context of the present economic situation to them the recession is something which is happening elsewhere from which they are immune. They are not confronted with the uncertainty and the difficulties of their fellow citizens in the private sector. It is important therefore that wages be held back because wage and salary increases, like all others in the community, add to the nation's difficulties in a time of recession by either adding to inflationary pressures in the absence of production increases, by putting more pressure on interest rates through the Budget deficit or by leading to higher tax rates to finance them. None of these results are what the economy needs, particularly given the present budgetary difficulties. The savings of some $300m which will be put to work may lead to improve employment prospects as a result of this transfer from those in very secure employment positions. I think it is interesting to note that a strike freeze last year would have yielded at least the same amount of income for the economy as a whole from the private sector. The diversion of these funds into economic infrastructure and welfare capital programs is a much more sensible deployment of funds than the creation of artificial projects which have no lasting benefit to this nation. I think that the Government should be careful not to undertake policy initiatives which in the long term may only increase the structural problems of this economy and inhibit long term employment prospects long after the present recession has passed. Of course the present economic problems have again led to predicatable cries for higher protection in Australia. Quite obviously, a lower inflation rate would do Australian industry more good than highly selective protection policies which destroy our international competitiveness and make our exports more expensive in a tough international marketing scene. Protection is inevitably concentrated on our less efficient industries and again provides room for the kinds of wage increases which bear no relationship to the requirements of the Australian economy, hinder living standard increases and protect jobs in particular industries at the expense of a much greater number of jobs being lost in other industries. Last month's report of the Industries Assistance Commission showed that consumers pay, as a result of protection, an extra $2,500m for the products of the clothing, footwear and textile industry. That represents $550 per household. Last month Kenneth Davidson in the Age said: The cost of keeping each job in that industry is $21,850 a year about $7,000 a year more than the average ""age in the industry. But while wages are low, profits are high. The same journalist asked: Why should the unemployed, along with everybody else. contribute some $22,000 a year per job when the contribution to an unemployed man with a dependent wife and two children is just under $8,000 a year and the single adult unemployed is on less than 3,400 per year. No job creation program is as expensive as this not only in terms of cost per individual in the industry but also in terms of the cost to the nation of channelling such enormous funds to industries which, in the long term, are not productive for this nation. I simply make this point to indicate that the wages pause is an essential policy initiative at this time but it is only one part of what ought to be a total fiscal and monetary package aimed at reducing inflation in this country, making us more productive and encouraging economic growth which, in the long term, is the only solution to the nation's economic and employment problems. Both of these Bills have my support in this context. Politically it is a tough issue for the Government because we are asking the employed to make some sacrifice in order to help preserve their own jobs and provide better opportunities in the future for those who are presently unemployed. It is politically a difficult measure for this Government but it is right and it deserves bipartisan support in this place rather than being a focal point for political granstanding and point scoring which does not do a thing for the unemployed.",105
189,Mrs KELLY,BUILDING,"1 think it is quite appropriate that I speak to the House tonight on a wage freeze with a cold. I hope that honourable members will bear with me during this debate on the freeze. As I have listened to the Government members debate this legislation I have been absolutely amazed at the sanctimonious nonsense that I have heard across this chamber about the Government's sudden concern for the unemployed. The reality of the situation is that this wage freeze, pause, cut honourable members may call it what they like-emerged for one reason only. It was a political stunt that the Government used to win the Flinders by-election. That is what it is all about. Let us not pretend that it is just to help the unemployed. Of course this Government created the unemployment problems. This Government has done more to create unemployment in this country than any other government in the history of this Commonwealth. Yet honourable members such as the honourable member for Perth (Mr MCLean) suddenly say that they are very concerned about the plight of the unemployed. I would also like to thank members of the Opposition for the opportunity of speaking today because this legislation affects my constituents in Canberra and the people of Canberra generally more than those in any other part of Australia. The Government says that this legislation is all about the employed helping the unemployed. It is supposed to be based on equality yet in effect it will bring about great inequalities because the people who feel the freeze the most will be those living in this Territory. Seventy per cent of the work force will be affected by the freeze, Can honourable members say where in Australia people will be affected more by the freeze? Can any honourable member answer that question? No he cannot. The people of Canberra will cop it most. It will affect not just the Commonwealth public servants but all those who depend on them. All the so-called friends of the private sector do not care less about the private sector in Canberra. That is the reality of the situation and honourable members cannot hide that fact. It is Canberra that will be affected the hardest by this legislation. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) mentioned the income of public servants. That is an issue that I would like to follow up now because there is talk that employees in the Public Service are so much better off than those in the private sector. That has not been the case especially in the last few years when the Government has consistently intervened in wages cases to try to stop salary increases of public servants. What has happened is that the Commonwealth Public Service has fallen further and further behind the private sector in wage comparabilities. There is also another factor that I think needs consideration and that is that Commonwealth employees are pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. They have been making an increasing contribution to taxation revenue over the years. The facts speak for themselves. From the Budget Papers it can be seen that, as a percentage of total taxation revenue, the taxation paid by PAYE taxpayers has increased from 41.7 per cent in 1975-76 to 45.7 per cent in 1981-82. They are continuing to contribute to this country's revenue because they cannot go through elaborate taxation avoidance and evasion schemes or through legitimate tax write-offs. Rather, they have been making a fair and equitable contribution to taxation in this country. It is also important that this House realise that all Commonwealth employees are affected by this legislation. It is not only the so-called fat cats that people hear about-the image that people have of Commonwealth public servants who earn massive amounts of money. That is not the reality. The reality is that the bulk of Commonwealth public servants earn between $12,000 and $ I 4,000. Some members of the Government look a little amazed about that statement. The reason they are so amazed is because they have no concept of the effect that this freeze will have on Commonwealth employees. I would like some of them to see, for example, a Commonwealth salary slip which I have and which shows what one Commonwealth employee earns. I will tell honourable members. This person's salary is $ I 3,050. That is how much that person earns a year. This figure is not unique; it applies to the majority of Commonwealth employees. Would honourable members opposite like to take home $13,050 to live on every year? By the time they pay their tax-and these people, we can be sure, pay their tax-what do they get to take home? They get about $200 a week to take home. Mr Groom-Table the document.",108
190,Mrs KELLY,BUILDING,"I can give the honourable member for Braddon hundreds of these documents to table. In fact I might do that during the next parliamentary session. I would like Commonwealth employees to start sending the honourable member for Braddon some of their pay slips because he obviously has no idea of how much money Commonwealth employees earn. Let me give just one other example for the information of the members of the Government who obviously are totally ignorant in this area. A fettler, for example, in the Australian National Railways Commission receives a gross pay of $243 per week with a take-home pay of $190 per week. Mr Braithwaite-For how many hours' work?",109
191,Mrs KELLY,BUILDING,"·Probably a lot more hours than the honourable member works. That amount is slightly more than Mr Anthony receives as travelling allowance for staying overnight in his Canberra house. Those are the sorts of inequities we are talking about in this wages freeze that principally affects Commonwealth public servants. The Canberra economy will also feel the brunt of this measure to a very disproportionate degree. I have calculated that about $ 150m in disposable income will be lost to the local economy. That amount comprises natural increases in Commonwealth employees' pay that will be forgone. This will obviously have a disastrous effect on the local economy because there will not be enough money to go around, to keep buying and to go back into the economy. What will that do about the disastrous unemployment situation in Canberra? The Government has not thought this matter through at all. If public servants' wages are frozen we must consider the effect it will also have on the spending capacity of those public servants. They will not have the money to put back into the local economy. I hope that in six months' time the honourable member for Braddon-as he walks out of this House-will acknowledge the effect that this will have on Canberra. We will be able to judge the effect of the freeze because it is here that we will see its greatest effect on the private sector. What will the people get in return for being the greatest contributors to the wage freeze and this $300m that will be available for these job-creation programs? I read with interest the speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on the Special Employment-related Programs Bill. I read-they cannot even number the pages any more-the seven or so pages of that speech. It consistently refers to certain useful programs throughout Australia that will be funded. The speech states that there will be grants made to the States and Northern Territory governments. It goes on to state: In determining the allocations of any funds to States the Commonwealth will take into account factors such as population and the ability of State governments to identify cilitate work on worthwhile programs. It goes on to refer to other projects and matching funds from the States. I would like the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) to tell the people of Canberra how much they will get out of this measure because, after all, they will make the biggest contribution. Nowhere in this statement is there any reference to how much the Australian Capital Territory will receive, who will be consulted about how that money will be spent and what the people of Canberra are to get in return for the massive contribution that we will make to this freeze policy. I will conclude so that I can give my colleagues time to participate in this important debate. I would like the members of the Government to keep an open mind on this issue and to look at the effects that this wage freeze policy will have on one particular area of Australia, Canberra. I can guarantee that the people of this Territory will look at it, and I hope that by the end of the so-called year of the freeze the rest of Australia will be as aware as the people of Canberra of what a farce and what a stunt the so-called wage freeze is.",109
192,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BUILDING,"We have heard a lot of repetition from honourable members opposite about the so-called economics of this wage freeze. I have never heard such absurd, neanderthal economic statements as those that have been made in this House tonight in relation to how the economy operates, to what is happening to it and to the possible consequences of the wages freeze. I think other speakers summed up the situation quite clearly when they said that this measure is nothing but a sham political exercise intended to get the Government off the hook for a temporary period, that it has no basis whatsoever in economic sense and that in fact it is an exercise which can have a contrary effect to that which they intend. I will address myself to that point a little later. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) summed up the situation when he said that we are facing a crisis of enormous proportions. The situation is that the Government has not even begun to come to grips with the nature or extent of the crisis. Unemployment at present is at a post-war record of 8.2 per cent. By June of next year, on the Department of the Treasury's own forecasts, it will be 10.3 per cent. If we continue with the present situation of no growth in the economy to 1986, based on Treasury's own figures, 20.3 per cent of the labour force will be unemployed-an astounding 1.5 million people. Indeed, it is expected that by the end of 1984 we will have at least a million officially unemployed and many and famore on the unofficial list. Let us get this matter into perspective. If we continue on the present no growth path and if we continue with the present policies, by 1986 not only will we have unemployment of that order but also the gross domestic product will be $33.3 billion less than what it would have been had we had a normal growth pattern and been reducing unemployment. These are the stark realities that we face. What did the Government come up with? It came up with",110
193,Mr GOODLUCK,BUILDING,What is your policy?,110
194,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BUILDING,"I will come to that in a minute, do not worry. The Government came up with a so-called wage freeze which is supposed to save $300m and then be used to create work. The sum of $300m is peanuts compared with the total problem. The Government does not even begin to come to grips with the problem. It does not even begin to come to grips with the number of people who will lose their jobs if the present situation continues. I remind honourable members that 180,000 jobs were lost in the last year. That is the extent and the dimension of the problem. But the problem can be further analysed in relation to what has happened to manufacturing industry. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) has come forward with some programs to create a bit of public work here and there. We have heard nothing at all about what will happen to the manufacturing sector or of the proposals to stimulate that sector or effect a change in that sector. The fact remains that the Government is theoretically bankrupt. It has no economic theory even to understand the situation, let alone come to grips with it. Let me say something about a theoretical understanding of the situation. We have heard a great deal tonight about the operation of the market and how the market is not operating in the labour area as though it is operating in every other area. The fact remains that the major cause of the economic crisis throughout the Western world is the fact that monopoly corporations, especially the foreign dominated corporations, have seized control of all the key sectors of the economy. Having seized that control, they are using the situation, not because they were not making profits. Honourable members should look at the profits they were making three or four years ago. Why were not those profits invested in Australia? Why were they taken out of this country? Those are the questions to which honourable members opposite do not even address themselves. The fact is that there is an investment crisis not only in Australia but also in the rest of the Western world at present. That investment crisis has to be dealt with directly and not simply through Mickey Mouse suggestions from the present Government. Let us look at this situation. Mr Good luck - What is your policy? Dr THEOPHANOUSThe honourable member should stop talking nonsense when he does not know what he is talking about. The situation is that what is required now is a massive program of public investment in various key areas of the economy and particularly in the manufacturing sector where we need to restructure industry and to create new enterprises. The Minister has put forward no suggestions or ideas about how we will create more jobs in manufacturing industry. He has put forward no suggestions about how we will come to grips with this problem. He has said nothing about the protection and dumping issue. All we have heard from him is the idea that $300m-peanuts-will solve the problem. Not only have honourable members opposite fallen for this suggestion but also, unfortunately, large sections of the media have too. They do not even recognise the full extent of the problem and the tough measures that will be necessary to take up that problem. It is quite clear-the honourable member for Gellibrand mentioned this-that one cannot get an economy going if one does not stimulate aggregate demand. That has been accepted economics on all sides in the past but now we find the monetarists and Friedmanites telling us that the matter has to do with the high level of wages and that we have to cut real wages. Cutting real wages has been tried before in other places and at other times. It was tried during the Great Depression. It has been tried in other countries. The United Kingdom has tried this exercise. What has happened? Instead we have found a situation in which unemployment has shot up rapidly. One day soon this Government will come to a situation in which it will recognise what a dreadful mistake it was to implement such a wages freeze on ordinary people. Let us remember that it is the ordinary Australians who will be hit hard. Now we have a situation in which the workers are being asked to share the burden of this economic crisis and nobody else-not the people who are making large incomes, who are taking dividends and who are taking their profits out of this country. No one else is sharing the burden except the workers of this country and the poor and the unemployed. They are the ones who are bearing the burden and who will continue to bear the burden. The fact remains that if the Government is really serious about a job creation scheme it should not be looking at the expenditure of $300m. It should be looking at spending at least $1,500m for job creation schemes, and for investment in other sectors of the economy. That is what the Government should be looking at to increase demand. At the same time it should be looking to ensure that people have enough money to buy goods and services. Honourable members opposite think they are the only ones who talk to businessmen. I have talked to a large number of businessmen. I can tell honourable members that these people are saying that it is not the wage costs that are the big problem. They are saying that the big problem is that they do not have any orders for goods and services on their books. That is what they are saying. For them that is the major cause of the current crisis. In fact, this situation is caused by two factors. One is the reduction in demand, which is already happening, and the other is the dumping of imports to an extraordinary degree especially in the manufacturing area. I should remind honourable members opposite of what has happened in the last two years in relation to imports. The number of imports into this nation has increased by a staggering $7,OOOm in the last two years. At the same time the amount of exports has been increased by less than $1,OOOm. In other words, the situation has turned around to there being a deficit in the current account of $3,OOOm. That is the situation we are facing. The freeze will not achieve its goals. All it will do is put the burdens on those who can least afford them. It is not an answer to the unemployment crisis. It does not even begin to come to grips with the problem. It is a sham and it will be exposed as such.",110
195,Mr MACPHEE,BUILDING,"1 suppose that at this time of the evening and at the end of a long parliamentary session the contribution of the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) can be treated as light entertainment. The trouble is that the subject is serious. This Government has been putting before the Parliament and the nation for quite some years a progressive program for economic stimulation in response to the domestic and external pressures upon us. The honourable member mentioned dumping, for example. The Minister for Industry  or so made a detailed statement in this House and elsewhere about measures the Government has taken. Indeed, legislation has passed through this chamber. I refer now to stimulation of the economy. In May we introduced a housing package; in July we introduced an industry assistance package; and in August we introduced a Budget involving taxation and family assistance, public works stimulation for employment purposes and all the rest. We have made a constant call for restraint in wage increases. The wages pause, which is the subject of this Bill, is the logical corollary to We have introduced it not only on behalf of the so-called workers of this country to whom the honourable member for Burke referred. If he were a member of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, which he is not-to its pleasure, I am sure, as well as to his own-he would know that at this moment the pharmacists and the doctors no doubt are complaining that they are the subject of this legislation. It is just not fair and sensible to say that we are seeking to act against lower income earners. The Budget contained measures to assist lower to middle income earners in terms of taxation relief and this Bill applies to everyone. The honourable member for Burke said that he would welcome an extra $1,500m being spent on job creation programs. One has only to ask and then dismiss these questions: What would that do to the deficit? What would that do to inflation? What would it do to inflationary expectations? How could that, in the current economic climate, assist in stimulating demand for the products or the services of the people to whom he referred? What nonsense! The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and others have raised serious questions about on-costs which are themselves inhibitions to the employment of people. He mentioned penalty rates and demarcation disputes. They are certainly serious problems. In some respects they are barriers to employment but they need to be tackled separately from this legislation. The honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) has asked the question: What is Canberra's share? The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) will be bringing into Cabinet a submission to deal with that in the same way as the State Premiers are bringing forward to the Federal Government their views on what should be done to assist employment in their States with the savings achieved by this legislation. We have introduced this legislation not to discriminate against our own employees but merely to ascertain more certainly than we could otherwise do-Dr TheophanousWhy don't you at least be honest about it?",111
196,Mr MACPHEE,BUILDING,"I am being absolutely honest about it. We are legislating to identify as precisely as we can the savings we can achieve by deferring the next round of wage increases as they apply to the public sector so that they can then be applied to the States and local government for the purpose of employment generation in things which we need and in areas where we need them, to that. make the best use of the skills which we have and to assist those in greatest need. The Conciliation and Arbitration (Government Service) Amendment Bill, which will be debated by the House after this legislation, deals more specifically with that matter. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has moved an amendment which the Government opposes but I must say on behalf of the Government that we respect the measured and responsible words of the honourable member in moving his amendment. Even if the Opposition lacks policies-I believe that it demonstrably lacks policies in this field-it should be comforting for a number of Australians of different persuasions to see that at least one leading member of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wills, understands the nuances of the debate, which is more than can be said for some of those who spoke in support of him. This was certainly evident in the words he used when proposing his amendment. Indeed, when one looks at the range of matters covered by his amendment, when it is contrasted with the general opposition to the Bill and the line which presumably he was authorised or instructed to follow, one sees that at least there is someone in the Opposition who understands the complexity of the situation with which we are faced. We have never said-I repeat, never said that this or any other single action of this Government provided a panacea for our industrial or economic problems. We have never claimed that anyone of the things to which I have referred, including those which I listed in answering the honourable member for Burke, provides the answer. There is no single answer, it is a matter of tackling a number of problems, some of which are marginal. But when we add them together they represent some step forward in terms of laying a foundation for our economic recovery. If there were more measured debate of the kind that lay behind the amendment we might get nearer to having a sensible bipartisan approach. But while the amendment covers many aspects of the economy it is obviously beyond the debate identified by this Bill. In the end when one is legislating one has to come down to a rather narrower ambit than one would wish to cover in a broader economic debate. The amendment is certainly relevant. The points made in the amendment and in moving it are relevant to the present and future economic debate in Australia. I refer, for example, to something which is almost parenthetical. Again I praise the honourable member for Wills for the restraint which he used. I refer to sub-paragraph (iv) of paragraph (b) in which he referred to 'manpower planning, including immigration levels'. I know that I speak for the honourable member for Wills, because of the words that he used in referring to that part of this amendment, when I say that all members of this House should be very concerned-at least in this respect I am at one with the honourable member for Burke-about the tendency of this country to find scapegoats in many areas including the area of immigration. I have been at pains for a number of months to say on behalf of the Government that we are not seeking by the measures before us tonight or by any other measure to make scapegoats of anything, including wages. Just as there is no panacea, there is no obvious scapegoat. Certainly that is true in the case of migration. This country would not be what we would like in our wildest moments to believe it could be and is without the contribution of migrants from over 100 countries with the economic and cultural contributions that they have made. The last thing we can afford at this time of economic decline is to resort to the use of scapegoats, and in this regard the tabloid newspapers of this country last night and earlier must be a cause of concern to all reasonable people. While we must look at all aspects of our policy-this amendment certainly challenges the Government to do that, and I can assure the honourable member for Wills that we are looking at the whole range of matters covered by it-we must cling to the bipartisan immigration policy which we formulated in this House and in which I enjoyed the support of the honourable member for Burke.",112
197,Mr CAMPBELL,BUILDING,Why don't you talk about economics?,113
198,Mr MACPHEE,BUILDING,The honourable member for Kalgoorlie might not be interested in the subject of immigration but some of his colleagues are.,113
199,Mr CAMPBELL,BUILDING,I talk a fair bit about it but I don't want to hear you waffle about it now. Talk about economics.,113
200,Mr MACPHEE,BUILDING,"Some people in this country are interested in this subject. I want to complete my remarks. It is important that this House maintain a sense of balance on the question of immigration, even if our tabloid Press cannot. We had a bipartisan policy. We will modify it in a bipartisan way. I trust that we will be equally bipartisan in not trying to find scapegoats for it. In respect of the amendment I can only refer the House to a statement made by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) on 13 December which reads as follows: The Commonwealth submission for a 12-month wages and salaries pause in the private sector will be heard by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on Thursday. The Government is hopeful of a successful outcome at that hearing. Legislation to implement a 12-month wages and salaries pause in the public sector will be introduced in the House of Representatives tomorrow afternoon. The Government has also considered the proposal made by the ACTU last Thursday for a conference on the economy involving the Commonwealth and State Governments, the ACTU and employer representatives. The Government seeks the active support of the ACTU for measures to relieve pressure on employment, and believes the proposal merits longer-term consideration. It believes, however. that current economic conditions, especially the very real threat to jobs posed by further wage rises, make it imperative to successfully implement as soon as possible the wages and salaries pause agreed to at the Special Premiers Conference last week. With those words I reaffirm the support of the Government for the Bill and its opposition to the amendment. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Hawke's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided.  Ayes 62 Noes 47 Majority 15 NA Adermann, A. E. Howard,1. W. Anthony,J. D.

208,Sir JAMES KILLEN,PAIRS,"I can only describe the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) as a monument of relevancy after his speech today. Who would have thought one could have wound up the seals, the lifesavers, the West Gate, the Bass Strait, the Middle East and an experience with Islam at the one time? My distinguished friend the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) will speak, but I want to say something as one who has had the privilege, the opportunity and the honour of being in this House now in my twenty-eighth year. Many years ago I took the view that Parliament needed a Leader of the House. A speech is on the record. I was always of the opinion that it was too much to ask of a busy Minister. I do not seek to be defensive on point, but if one looks at the House of Commons one sees that it has for many years been led by a leader. In my own experience I have sought to bring what I regard as one of the great contributing factors to Parliament, and that is a sense of fairness. I seek to treat people with courtesy and with confidence. If I have failed honourable members may impugn me. I still nurse what I regard as a very real anxiety, namely, that a private member of this Parliament does not command the opportunity to speak as he should. I will seek to do something about that in the new year. Without the slightest inhibition I say to my honourable friend the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) how grateful I am to him for his co-operation over a very difficult time. I do not know how much longer I will stay here, but I would like all honourable members to know that I will always regard with pride and pleasure that I sat in the Parliament with the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, the Deputy Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition. No matter what may happen in the course of the next few months I hope that honourable members have a very happy Christmas and, as for the new year, the splendid uncertainty of politics, the splendid uncertainty of the racecourse. Oh, what a unity they command. We all walk into the polling booths determined to win; we all walk onto the racetrack determined to win. Dr KlugmanYou can't say the same about your horses.",116

I say to my honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), who has stood the vicissitudes of the last 12 months not only with remarkable equanimity but also unscarred, at least on the outside, that he and his Deputy Leader command my respect and continuing goodwill. If it should be in God's name that I should be with honourable members next year, I will ensure that I undertake to make the private members' lives in this Parliament all the better and all the more interesting.",116
210,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"1 would like to join with the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen) in remarks of appreciation for the contribution many people have made to the successful workings of this institution during the past 12 months. They have done it in a spirit of good will. Seasonal greetings at this time of the year are conveyed to people not only of this Parliament but also to people around Australia. I think this is the first this time that seasonal greetings have been extended here so close to the real festive period. On many occasions I have heard these tributes being made even in the beginning of November when the House has risen, but on this occasion due to a pretty arduous political year, we have been brought right to the second week of December before the House has been able to adjourn. This is a very important institution; it is the heart of our democracy and it should work properly. As I said, the workings of this Parliament depend on the services and the dedication of many people. First of all, I thank you, Mr Speaker, for the very dignified way in which you have carried out your job during the year. You have carried it out with patience and a degree of humour. On many occasions I know that the House has been in a stressful situation but you have handled it with great decorum. I would like to express appreciation to the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) who is a Deputy Speaker and the Chairman of Committees for his untiring work and the excellent command he has of the House procedures also. He and his deputies have done a great job in seeing that the House is controlled properly to put legislation through the Committee stage. I also thank the other deputy speakers-the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage), the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Drummond), the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles), the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Jarman), the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins), the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) and the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Ian Robinson) who have all played their part. I would like to thank Mr Doug Blake, the Clerk of the House for his work. He has recently acquired the position of Clerk of the House. We have all known him for many years and we feel quite at ease and confident in the job that he I thank his deputies too, Mr Alan Browning and Mr Lyn Barlin who do a most commendable job. I thank the Serjeant-at-Arms, the parliamentary officers and the attendants all of whom are so necessary to the smooth running of this Parliament. I thank the Principal Parliamentary Reporter, Mr Jim Roberts, and his Hansard staff who have made our speeches intelligible.",116
211,Mr J,PAIRS,eo MCLeayEven your speeches.,117
212,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"Even mine and, without doubt, the honourable member's also. I thank the Parliamentary Librarian who has been appointed only this month, having acted since July last together with his staff who do an enormous amount of work particularly for the private members of the House. I thank the Table Office staff who deal efficiently with a large number of requests, also the first Parliamentary Counsel, Mr Geoff Kolts and his staff. I would also like to thank some of the people behind the scenes, particularly the Australian Broadcasting Commission staff who unfortunately have to listen to all of speeches and see that they are transmitted to the people of Australia to give them our attitudes and the messages we are trying to convey. There are many other people behind the scenes in Parliament such as the gardeners, cleaners, the refreshment room staff who are all vital to the smooth running of the Parliament. I thank the Leader of the House for keeping the business of the House running smoothly and trying to prevent as many divisions taking place as possible. Of course, that is only done with a good working relationship with the manager of the Opposition business, the Deputy Leader (Mr Lionel Bowen). The Whips and their staff have to be mentioned along with the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, Mr Jeff Townsend, and his staff who work to ensure that the business keeps coming forward. I mention the House of Representatives Transport Officer who is new to the job. He took over the job from Gordon Pike who did a great Melba-style departure from this Parliament, but with full justification for doing so. I think all of us would want to give Gordon a special New Year message. I take this opportunity with all the spirit of good will to hope that everybody has a good break, a Merry Christmas and comes back refreshed in the New Year. It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is not able to speak on behalf of the Government tonight. All honourable members know of his circumstances but I can assure them that he will come back here completely refreshed and invigorated to does. ensure that a vigorous Parliament continues in 1983. On behalf of the Prime Minister I wish you all a merry Christmas.",117
213,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS," I welcome the opportunity to join with the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) on the occasion when he speaks on behalf of his Government, as I understand he describes it according to newspaper reports. I must confess that I feel somewhat inadequate to the occasion after the pyrotechnical display of rhetoric from the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen) which was presented with an appropriate fist of exuberance. Nonetheless, I will try to endorse modestly year, the views which have been expressed by the two preceding speakers in their appreciation, on behalf of all members of parliament, to the vast army of people who support us as we keep afloat on that endless sea of words which we manage to churn out in the essential way that is part and parcel of the parliamentary system. We work in an extraordinary system in the sense that the public sees the functioning of Parthe liament in terms of this chamber, but as we all know a very large number of people of various capacities work in this House and in nearby buildings which are associated with this House; their services are absolutely essential if the system is to function. Those people contribute quite general and day to day sorts of services which are necessary to keep Parliament House functioning in a mechanical sense from keeping people fed and so on to very technical tasks and quite recondite obligations which are essential for legislation to proceed through this Parliament. In short, it is a very complex operation. While we are at the sharp end of the performance it is the people behind us who allow us to perform as well as we do or otherwise. I join with the previous speakers in conveying festive greetings to all of those who have worked so loyally and successfully in the past year and similarly endorse the keen wish that 1983 will be an outstandingly successful year for all of them and for all members of the Parliament.",117
214,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"--I wish to make a few points to the House concerning matters of interest during this year. This year there were no Estimates committees and no legislation committees. Sessional orders concerning routine business were changed. There was the moving of the announcement of petitions lodged to a later time in the day's proceedings. There was a statement by myself concerning the incorporation of unread material in Hansard. There was the establishment of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege. The Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill was introduced with the Budget which meant that the Parliament's appropriations could be dealt with as a separate measure for the first time. The Public Service Acts Amendment Bill was introduced. It provides for the Speaker and the President to appoint or to promote persons to offices within each of the parliamentary departments, to create and abolish positions within the parliamentary departments free from the necessity of the intervention of the Public Service Board or of the Governor-Generalin-Council. Annual reports for each parliamentary department are to be tabled by the Presiding Officers as soon as possible after 30 June each year. There has been the reference to the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, the matter of televising Parliament and its committees in the new Parliament House and continuous and simultaneous radio broadcasting of both Houses of parliament. The New Parliament House construction is on schedule. The Joint Committee on the New Parliament House is active in monitoring the user requirements. There were 53 sitting days in the year. The II o'clock rule was suspended on II occasions, including tonight. There have been four sittings after midnight. I thank the Chairman of Committees, Mr Millar, and the Deputy Chairmen of Committees, Mr Armitage, Mr Dobie, Mr Drummond, Mr Giles, Mr Jarman, Mr Charlie Jones and Mr Ian Robertson. I thank Mr Blake and the House of Representatives staff. I congratulate Mr MACLean, the newly appointed Parliamentary Librarian, on his appointment and the Parliamentary Library staff for their very good work. I thank Mr Roberts, the Chief Hansard Reporter, and his staff. I thank Mr Jorgensen and the Joint House Staff. I indicate to the House that one of the Deputy Clerks of the House, Mr Lyn Barlin, is at present the acting permanent head of the Joint House Department. I thank my personal staff. I pay tribute to the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen) and the Leader of the House earlier in the year, the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair). I congratulate also the Manager of Opposition Business, Mr Lionel Bowen. To the whips of all parties I wish to say that without their efforts Parliament would not be able to function properly. I thank the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) for his co-operation. I want to tell members generally what kind of people you are and how easy you have made the job for the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker and all the Chairmen of Committees. When I meet Speakers from other parliaments they always say what a hard job it is. I always say to them that I have the easiest job because I know that when members wake up in the morning on a sitting day the first thing they do is say to themselves: 'How can I be kind to Snedden today?' Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA 1982 Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. NA PROTECTION BILL 1982 Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Motion (by Sir James Killen) proposed: That the second reading be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting.",117
215,Mr WEST,WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES," Mr Speaker, I oppose the motion to defer debate on the second reading of the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill. It is only a few minutes ago that we heard the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen) deplore the treatment of private members in this place. Yet we have an urgent situation in Tasmania in regard to the protection of the Franklin River. I was informed just a few minutes ago that at the request of this Government the South West of Tasmania has now been placed, by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, on the World Heritage List. This Bill, which was introduced into the Senate by the Australian Democrats, has been amended by the Australian Labor Party to make it a better piece of legislation. The purpose of the Bill is to protect areas such as the Kakadu National Park, the Great Barrier Reefand South West Tasmania. However, we are not going to be allowed to debate the Bill in this place because of the actions of the Government. Mr HodgmanIt is on the List.",118
216,Mr WEST,WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES,"It is on the List, following nomination by the Government at the. request of the the previous Tasmanian State Government. Tonight in Paris it has been placed on the List. Last week in this House we had the spectacle of the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr MCVeigh) saying that, although the Government wished to proceed with the listing, it would not take any action to intercede in Tasmania to prevent the very heart and soul being torn out of the South West by the damming of the Franklin River. The Bill was debated by our colleagues in the Senate for something like 25 hours in an effort to get it into this House tonight so that the issue can be debated and put to a vote before the House goes into recess until next February. The situation in Tasmania is urgent because this Government, despite calls from the World Heritage Committee, despite the position taken by the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment and Cabinet where he was rolled, has decided that it will not intervene. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has given advice to the Government that, because we are signatories to the Convention, because we have nominated the area for listing and it has now been listed, there is at'least a moral, national and international obligation to protect the area. He has said that the power exists under the trade and commerce powers, under the implied power which has been tested in the High Court and under the external powers of section 51 of the Constitution. The Attorney-General has informed this Government that if no action is taken along these lines to intercede in Tasmania against the Tasmanian Government to prevent the dam from being constructed any decision will be political and not the result of constitutional impediment. Yet this Bill, which has been passed by our colleagues in the Senate and sent over here as a matter of urgency, will not be allowed to be debated tonight. It clearly ought to be debated. We have a moral, national and international responsibility to protect this area which is not being protected by this Government. There is an environmental case against the damming of the Franklin River. The environmental case is that the river is now on the World Heritage List and that it has now been listed on the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission. Only last Thursday, the Australian Heritage Commission in a report to this Parliament asked that this Government take action to preserve the area for posterity. Professor John Mulvaney has resigned his Federal post and has called this Government a government of vandals because it has refused to take action to protect archaeological sites in the Fraser Cave on the Franklin River. The Acting Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, has come out and said that this is not an important part of Tasmania. It is a most important part of South West Tasmania and it clearly ought to be saved. Yet there is an economic case also against the Gordon-below-Franklin project. The economic case is that hydro industrialisation has clearly failed to provide employment in Tasmania. Sixteen major power consuming industries consume 65 per cent of the power and provide 6 per cent of the jobs. There has not been a new industry attracted to Tasmania on the basis of power consumption for over 10 years. The Government's own Department of National Development and Energy has said that there is not any need to construct the dam now. There is no need because the Department has seen no demonstrable evidence that power requirements in that State are such that power from the Gordon-below-Franklin project will be required before at least the year 2000 A.D. The Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania found that the project ought to be deferred for at least three years to examine whether, first, the power is required and, secondly, the alternatives which undoubtedly exist ought to be implemented. These alternatives include coalfired power stations, alternative hydro stations and a cable from Victoria to Tasmania. The fact is that this dam will be constructed at a cost of almost $1,OOOm. It will provide only 180 megawatts of power and 30 permanent jobs. Mr HodgmanLies, lies, lies.",118
217,Mr WEST,WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES,"Surely, if capital works are to be used as a means of creating employment they have to be economic in their own right-",119
218,Mr SPEAKER,WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES,The honourable member for Cunningham will resume his seat. I ask the Minister for the Capital Territory to withdraw that remark.,119
219,Mr HODGMAN,WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES,I withdraw it.,119
220,Mr WEST,WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES,"Surely, if a capital work is to be the means of producing employment during the construction period, it has to be economic in its own right. One cannot accept the Hydro-Electric Commission's proposal that these great dams, which are so environmentally damaging, ought in fact to be built on spec. How stupid that is. It should not be tolerated. Capital loan funds which are authorised by this Parliament surely could be put to better use than to construct a billion dollar dam to provide 30 permanent jobs. Already the Hydro-Electric Commission in Tasmania consumes something like 60 per cent of total loan funds, 95 per cent of allocations for the larger semi-governmental borrowing programs and about 95 per cent of allocations for the infrastructure program. What does housing get in Tasmania? It gets about 7 per cent of the total loan funds; construction works get about 7 per cent. No wonder there is a lack of development in areas other than the Hydro-Electric Commission. There is only one reason the Liberal Government of Tasmania and the HEC want to construct this dam; that is that they wish to provide jobs during the construction period. When the construction period is finished IO years down the track there will be a dam which is not required but which will still have to be paid for. It will provide only 30 permanent jobs.",119
221,Mr HODGMAN,WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES,That is not true.,120
222,Mr WEST,WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES,"It is true. If there were any economic case for it we would be willing to consider it. This Bill which we are asking honourable members to consider tonight, it is true, would protect all the areas that this Government has nominated and which have been placed on the World Heritage List-that is, the Great Barrier Reef, the Kakadu National Park, the Willandra Lakes area in New South Wales and now South West Tasmania. The Opposition has said in the Senate that that provision is probably too broad in the sense that we need not allow interference with previous zoning plans which have been set up for the use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park areas with the zoning plans and the management program of Kakadu National Park and with any zone planning that a future South West Tasmanian management authority might implement. We support setting up, in conjunction with the Tasmanian Government, a South West Tasmania management authority. Those amendments have been incorporated in this Bill. They have improved this Bill. If this Bill is not passed by this House we will have to wait until the next general election, when a Federal Labor government undoubtedly will be elected. Then we will be able to pass our own legislation to protect areas such as the Franklin River listed on the World Heritage List. This Government will stand condemned throughout Australia by all who care about the environment because it has conned them. It conned the people of Flinders when it allowed the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment to push the myth that perhaps, just perhaps, this Government might intervene in South West Tasmania. It was even said that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) might at heart be a closet greenie. The lie has been given to that because last week the Government said that it would not intervene. It will now become completely apparent to everyone in Australia in marginal seats-no wonder so many back benchers are terrified by the actions of the Government-that, despite the wishes of the Senate, the Government is not willing even to give this Bill a second reading in this place. The people have been conned once already, in Flinders. They will not be conned twice. To my great joy and satisfaction I was informed last Friday at the Opera HouseGovernment supporters should listen to this because it will strike fear in the hearts of those who occupy marginal seats-that all of the 2,000 organisations concerned with the environment and conservation in Australia, including the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Wilderness Society of Tasmania, and their half a million members and supporters are determined to campaign against the Government in marginal seats because of its action. Tonight Government supporters have fallen into the classic trap. Their colleagues in the Senate debated for 25 hours in an attempt to get this legislation before the House tonight but the Leader of the House, despite all his arguments about the way in which private members' Bills are treated in this House, has been willing to use the jackboot, the iron heel, to stop this legislation from being debated tonight. All members of environmental groups throughout Australia will see Government supporters for what they are, environmental frauds who have done nothing for the environment and who are not willing to save the Franklin River in Tasmania, despite the urgency of the situation and the fact that people are being gaoled down there right now because of actions of conscience. I suggest that honourable members oppose the motion so that Government supporters will be seen quite clearly as the environmental frauds they are.",120
223,Mr HOWARD,WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES,"1 simply want to make the obvious point that the motion being debated is a procedural one and that any vote taken would be related to it and not to the substantive legislation. I make it perfectly plain to the House that during the next session there will be an opportunity for the general issue touched upon by the legislation to be canvassed in full debate in this Parliament. Therefore, any suggestion that such an opportunity is not being provided or will not be provided is demonstrably false. It is appropriate that the House deal with this procedural-not substantivemotion now. Motion (by Mr Bourchier) agreed to: That the question be now put.

224,Mr NA BROWN,NOES,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to .. After detailed debate in the Senate, a number of amendments were made to the National Crimes Commission Bill. Some of these amendments were made on the initiative of the Government, others by the Australian Labor Party and others by the Australian Democrats. The Government position generally attaches a great deal of importance to the early establishment of the National Crimes Commission to combat the serious growth of organised crime in this country. T-erefo-e, while the Government has some reservatiOns with respect to certain of the amendments, it appears that a workable National Crimes Commission can be established under the authority of the Bill as amended in the Senate and therefore the Government will accept the amendments and urges the passage of the Bill in its amended form. If expe-i­ ence shows that some of the amendments made In the Senate present serious practical problems, consideration will of course be given to legislative change. Having moved that the amendments be agreed to, I shall briefly refer to each of them in turn. The first of the amendments from the Senate relates to clause 7 of the Bill, in particular clause 7 (2) (d), and it removes from the list of matters to which the Commission is to direct its attention those matters described as-I quote from the Bill as it was in this House- 'other offences of kinds that persons or bodies engaged in law enforcement are experiencing special difficulty in investigating'. The Bill, with that amendment, in the view of the Government, still provides a suitable ambit of those matters to which the Commission is to direct its activities. It is, in the Government's view, in all the circumstances appropriate that that amendment should be accepted. this section applies shall not be The second amendment relates to legal and financial assistance. The Committee will recall that when the Bill was before the House some deto a court a matter or thIng that bate took place with respect to legal and financial assistance that should be provided to witnesses. The clause that will become clause 18A provides in substance that a witness may apply to the a result of Attorney-General for the provision of assistance in respect of his appearance before the Commission. The Bill provides machinery by which the Attorney-General may, after being satisfied authority or person having about certain matters, authorise the provision of assistance by the Commonwealth to that person. The Government believes that this is an appropriate provision to have in the Bill in all the circumstances and accordingly would urge that the amendment be accepted. The third amendment is to clause 19. It inserts a new sub-clause which is self-explanatory. It provides, in substance, that a summons requiring a person to appear before the Commission to give evidence shall set out the following: . . . . as far as is reasonably practicable, the general nature of the matters in relation to which the Commission intends to question the person, but nothing in this sub-section prevents the Commission from questioning the person in relation to any other matter that the Commission may, In the proper performance of its functions, investigate. A reading of that clause would suggest to members of the Committee, I respectfully submit, that it is an appropriate provision. Accordingly, the Government accepts it. The fourth amendment is with respect to clause 20 (4) which again is an area of the Bill in regard to which some debate took place on the last occasion. It relates, in effect, to self-incrimination. In substance the subclause provides that it is a reasonable excuse for a person to refuse to answer a question or fail to produce a document if the answer to the question or the production of the document or thing as the case may be might tend to incriminate him. It is appropriate, and the amendment was moved for this reason, to limit that provision to natural persons; that is to say, not to corporations. It is consistent with a recent decision of the High Court of Australia. I shall read a short extract from the judgment in Rochfort v. the Trade Practices Commission which is not yet reported but which was delivered on 18 November 1982. I refer to the judgment delivered by Mr Justice Murphy. His Honour said: A person required to produce. documents cannot resistproduct ion on the ground that thiS would tend to IncnmInate another person. The privilege against self-incrimination is a human right, based on the desire to protect personal freedom and human dignity. The history of, and reasons for, the privilege suggest that it should not such as corporations or to large or amorphous voluntary organisations. His Honour cites some American cases and then refers to some English decisions which he says in his view are unconvincing and should not be followed. For those reasons, we believe that that is an appropriate amendment to make. There is an amendment to clause 21 with respect to persons giving evidence that is false or misleading in a particular manner, and it is proposed to insert the words 'to his knowledge' after the words 'that is'. That is also appropriate as an amendment. Likewise, the amendment to sub-clause (2) which adds the words 'or by a fine not exceeding $20,000' is appropriate. In our view the amendment to clause 24 in two respects is one which the Commonwealth can accept. The Government would have preferred the term of appointment to be five years but the amendment has been made so that it now reads 'two years', but that, in effect, there may be a reappointment for a period not exceeding two years. In the circumstances, for the reasons I have given the Government will accept that amendment. There is also an amendment to insert after clause 36 a new clause, clause 36A, which is in effect a secrecy provision. In the Government's view, that is appropriate to accept. Accordingly, I urge that the amendments which have been circulated be accepted.",122
225,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NOES,"The Opposition concurs with what the Government proposes; namely, to accept these amendments which have been inserted in the National Crimes Commission Bill by the Senate. In our view the amendments improve the Bill. In some respect, they were matters which we debated in this chamber at the time of the second reading debate and in Committee. We moved a number of amendments, some of which have now, to some extent, been brought into the Bill. I think that we would all agree that the combating of crime is a most important element. We need to get the best expertise that is available. Crime is on the increase. Of course, the Opposition took the view that we needed to have, perhaps, a different concept. We were very anxious to have an intelligence unit which would pick up not only the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies but also those of the States. I hope that that comes to fruition. In a federal structure it appears very obvious to all of us now that we need to work together, particularly in the areas of law enforcement. Also, it is essential that people who can give some sort of what might be called prima facie evibe extended to artificial persons dence of crime and corruption can get protection, because it has not always been available. It is also counter-productive to have police authorities investigating themselves. It does not seem to give some sense of security to people who are prone to give information; nor does it bring about any reduction, as we are aware, of any corruption in the forces themselves. I need not go over the matters that the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) has explained in detail, except to say that we want to see legal and financial assistance being made available. Anyone who is asked to appear before the Commission should have at least some information available to him as to the type of matters that he will face-in other words, the particulars of those matters. There is a question of secrecy; information gained in the Commission should not be used against any person, and there should be the appropriate penalty if it is so used. The Minister has explained amendments 3 to 8 inclusive. They relate to a number of matters with which the Opposition concurs. We hope that the Crimes Commission proves to be a very successful body. In that context, if it does it will mean that we will eventually get the concept of co-operation right throughout the Commonwealth in all law enforcement agencies. Perhaps this will be the forerunner of many areas in which the Commonwealth and the States can work together, not the least of which would be in industrial arbitration matters, as well as in a number of other areas. If we are to get this nation performing efficiently we will need to get all those areas of Australia acting in unison without the dreadful problem, burden and cost associated with the division of powers and an inability to cope because the separation seems to have provided some sort of a gap that we cannot cover. I think this legislation is a step in the right direction. I make the point that it does not go as far as we would like it to but at least it will provide a rapid improvement on what we do have at present. Amendments agreed to.

226,Mr NA BROWN,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. This Bill was amended in the Senate after an extensive debate. I should say that the Government regrets the amendment that was made on the initiative of the Australian Labor Party to remove the provision proposed to be made to provide more effective procedures for dealing with witnesses who fail to answer questions before a royal commission. Nevertheless, the Bill in its present form makes very important and essential changes to the Royal Commissions Act. Therefore, I urge the passage of the Bill. It will be seen that amendments were made which provide for fines on two occasions in addition to imprisonment. Accordingly, I urge that the amendments be agreed to.",124

I think it is worthwhile mentioning the rights of citizens in our community these days. Certainly, in respect of amendments Nos 2 and 3 people would face the position that the only alternative was a prison sentence rather than a fine. I think that would be going back to the dark ages.

228,Mr HODGES,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT," I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The main purpose of the amendments is to take account of the points made in the fourteenth report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which noted that the clauses of does not affect the validity the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1982 relating to tourism promotion did not contain provisions for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the decisions relating to the declaration of a recognised tourism promotion. The Government has accepted the of the foregoing. the following need for such a provision. It is proposed that the amendments to section 3 of the principal Act affected by paragraph (c) of sub-clause 3 (I) and sub-clause 3 (3) be omitted and in their stead section 6 be developed so as to (I) is. or is likely to be. set out the means for making applications for declaration of a tourism promotion as a recognised is likely to prejudice tourism promotion. The amendments contain a proposed new section 40AAA which confers upon dissatisfied applicants the right to seek review before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In addition a drafting error has been discovered in writing signed by him. delegate to all or any of his powers under clause 4 of the Bill relating to benefits applying to the construction industry. As drafted the Bill would have had a reverse effect from that intended by the Government and would have penalised a claimant in proportion to his degree of success in obtaining overseas contracts. Amendment 4 corrects this situation.",125
229,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT," The Opposition supports the things referred to in paragraphs amendments. In view of what the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges) has just said, we would not want to have a proposition, which is now corrected by clause 4, which has the reverse effect of what is intended.

230,Mr MILTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to refer this morning to some specific problems relating to disabled and handicapped people in my electorate. I am concerned that whilst the Federal Government offers a number of financial inducements to enable disabled people to be accommodated in nursing homes and supervised hostels, minimal support is provided for disabled people and their families who wish to live independently in their own homes. The parents of a handicapped boy aged eight years, who lives in Scoresby and who attends the Knox spastic centre, have told me of their impossible financial situation resulting from the excessive financial outlay involved in meeting the dayto-day living needs of their son. The current handicapped children's allowance is $17.50 a week. This amount is totally inadequate and provides no real financial help for the family. Because the boy attends the Knox spastic centre which is not designated as a school, there are no tax concessions or support for education expenses. In addition, there are no tax concessions for the transportation costs from the boy's home in Scoresby to the Knox spastic centre. The medical expenses are particularly high, as exemplified by the cost of the disposable nappies alone, which amounts to $15 a week. There had been some hope on the part of the family that the Federal Budget would make some provision for families such as theirs, but to their distress that was not the case. The parents are now at their wits end having reached the end of their financial resources. Their final hope that they could place their son in the Waverley Special School was dashed when no places were available. I wish now to draw attention to another family in Ferntree Gully, which is also in my electorate. The 20-year old disabled son, Phillip, has become too physically burdensome for his mother to be able satisfactorily to provide the services he How distressing it was for Phillip's mother to find that the nearest suitable accommodation for her son was at Colanda in Colac, many scores of kilometres from Ferntree Gully. It is an appalling fact that there are so few of these special accommodation centres for the disabled in the eastern region of Melbourne that in this case the young man had to be sent to Colac, involving considerable travel expenses for Phillip's mother and father. In addition, if an appropriate attendance allowance had been made available to this family, Phillip's mother could have no doubt been provided with an attendant who could have assisted her in caring for Phillip in his own home. I have mentioned the problems of two disabled young people who live in my electorate, but many other disabled people known to me, both inside and outside my electorate, have related problems. Federal Government programs and facilities are totally inadequate to deal with matters of concern to disabled people in our community. It is essential to provide funding for both parents and the disabled child. Allowances and tax concessions are either not available or inappropriate. Financial assistance should be provided for making essential alterations to family homes to accommodate disabled children. This money should be available also for the purchase of special equipment and educational facilities. Federal and State education departments are not voluntary agencies and should be responsible for educating disabled children. All government authorities providing government services should ensure, through both planning and funding, that those services are accessible to the disabled, regardless of the nature or severity of their condition. In giving the brief details of the problems of my constituents I call on the Federal Government to take active steps to alleviate the problems of the disabled. Urgent measures are necessary to diminish the sense of social isolation which the mothers of disabled children feel exist in particular as a result of the community's lack of understanding of the needs of the disabled and those who care for them.",125
231,Mr MAHER,ADJOURNMENT," I wish tonight on the adjournment to raise a problem in the electorate of Lowe; that is, the distribution of Commonwealth Government offices. The structure and situation of government offices in that electorate and in the inner western suburbs of Sydney has really not changed since the end of the Second World War, which was an era of full employment at a time when pensions and social security payments were not an extensive business. Within the electorate of Lowe there is only one needs. office of the Commonwealth Employment Service and there is only one office of the Department of Social Security. Although it is an urban electorate the public transport runs in many different directions and many people who are out of work or who are wanting to inquire about pension payments have to use several modes of transport to make an inquiry. A young person seeking employment should not have to spend money-perhaps his or her parents' money-on travelling to a Commonwealth Employment Service centre in a suburb many miles away. I ask the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) to consider the establishment of a Commonwealth Employment Service office in the three large shopping centres in the electorates that are not at present serviced by such a centre. They should be located at Five Dock, Strathfield within the Strathfield Plaza and Birkenhead Point in Drummoyne. There is only one Commonwealth Employment Service Office, and that is in Burwood. That office is very busy. I am informed by the officers in charge of Commonwealth Employment Offices in the surrounding areas that they are so busy at present that they cannot do any promotional work. They cannot make contact with employers. They are suffering because of Public Service staff ceilings. This is the busiest time of the year for the Commonwealth Employment Service with the school leavers being processed, with many firms shutting down and with people trying to change jobs or looking for work. These dedicated public servants are extremely busy and cannot do the work that they should be doing of promotion and talking to employers, advising employers and potential employees. I inform the House that the Commonwealth Employment Service in other areas which serve much of the electorate of Lowe do an excellent job. I called on these offices before I became a member of this Parliament and met many of the staff. But it is essential that each of the large commercial centres within the electorate of Lowe has an office of the Commonwealth Employment Service and also a office of the Department of Social Security. There is only one Department of Social Security office within Lowe and that is located within the Strathfield Plaza. The large shopping centre in which my electorate office is located at Burwood has no office of the Department of Social Security. I took this up with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). He replied that there was plenty of parking at Strathfield and that constituents who want to visit the Department of Social Security could easily travel to Strathfield. It is extremely difficult for an old or frail pensioner to travel on several modes of transport and to deal with the suburban train service in Sydney. The Department of Social Security offices should be in every large commercial shopping centre. I ask the Minister for Social Security to look at the possibility of setting up a social security office at Five Dock, the Burwood shopping centre and also at Birkenhead Point, which is a large commercial shopping centre in the surburb of Drummoyne. The Department of Social Security office in Burwood has been extremely helpful to me, as has the Commonwealth Employment Service. The CES in Burwood has taken under its wing the launching of the first Community Youth Support Scheme within the electorate of Lowe. Several months ago I held a public meeting about starting this scheme in Lowe. We held this meeting at Homebush. For the first time, we trust that we will get this off the ground when a submission is drawn. The committee which was formed is working on that. The officers from the Commonwealth Employment Service have been extremely helpful. Mr Fred Rouse, the Director, and his staff have helped launch the scheme. But I feel that one of the reasons why there is no CYSS scheme in Lowe is that there is only one CES office to serve that entire electorate. Had there been several CES offices with a chance to overview the youth unemployment situation, we may have had a CYSS scheme. But it is tragic that Lowe is one of the few electorates in Australia which has no CYSS scheme.",126
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,127
233,Dr BLEWETT,ADJOURNMENT,"- I have spent the afternoon on the blockade on the Franklin River. I thought that it might be worthwhile, given some of the discussions that have taken place in this House and in the other place today, saying a few things about that experience. First of all, I took the opportunity to go there to show the people who are protesting against the damming of the Franklin the solidarity and support of the Federal Australian Labor Party for that movement. I also believe that, as this Parliament is deeply involved in this Issue, it is important that we make an effort to u. derstand and discover the situation as it is on the ground in South West Tasmania. It is clearer than ever that this is not just a Tasmanian issue. An effort was made this morning to suggest that this was something that should not concern the rest of the people of Australia; that somehow it was something that should be locked up and left alone for Tasmanians. I must say, as a person who was brought up in Tasmania for the first 20 years of my life, that I cannot accept that kind of attitude. I believe that it is a national issue in which all of us have to diplay our concern. I am glad to say that although there have been many arrests this afternoon when we arrived some of the ship loads of the arrested were being brought back--on both sides, the police and the demonstrators. the confrontation has been conducted with a cheerfulness and a serenity. I only hope that that will continue.It is true that there are dangers in the situation. I thought one of the tragic aspects of the situation was the enormous beauty of the setting against which the activities were going on. I say of both sides in that confrontation that to date they have displayed good sense. It is interesting to note that the people participating in the blockade come from all classes in Australian society and are of all ages. We met and talked with many of the young people involved in the blockade. I heard them described this morning as 'stirrers and radicals'. Let me say that after meeting these people I would much prefer them as representatives of this society to the five who represent Tasmania in this House. Indeed, I think that if anyone has doubts about the future of Australian youth they should go and meet and talk to these people. As I say, they are very determined but they are also cheerful. They are a group of young people completely committed to their ideals, making their protests in a completely peaceful and law abiding way. Another interesting thing that emerged is that they are not just blinkered environmentalists. They revealed in discussion a very real concern for the employment and economic problems in Tasmania. But they did not believe, and I think that they were right, that the building of this dam was any real solution to either the unemployment or the economic problems of Tasmania. I gather that since I have been away this House has refused to take on board a discussion of the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill that came across from the Senate. I hope that at the earliest possible opportunity a full discussion of this issue will take place in this House as well as in the Senate because I would say that all of us in this House owe it to the people involved on both sides in what is a national issue to have a full discussion in the House of Representatives. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 12_23 a.m. (Wednesday) until Tuesday, 22 February 1983, at 1.45 p.m., unless an alternative day or hour of meeting be notified by telegram or letter addressed to each member of the House.

These records were not designed to provide the information requested but those cases located have been table does not list every case referred by a fund. between January 1978 and September 1981. I emphasise that any action taken by my Department in respect of a doctor referred by one of the funds is not always NA taken solely as a result of the referral. In many cases, my Department is already aware of apparent irregularities in a doctor's claiming pattern at the time of a referral from a fund, (Question No. 3156) and appropriate action is under way. NOTE: An abbreviated description of my Department's responses is included in the table. An expansion of the terms used under 'Response' in the table is provided below. of Australia's 86 registered 'Reviewed': In response to a complaint about a particular doctor, statistical data are gathered on the doctor's claiming pattern and analysed for apparent irregularities. Where it appears that fraud may be involved and further action by way reported any suspected cases of investigation is required, the matter is referred to Departmental investigation personnel. Where there is sufficient indion which occasions (since January cation that overservicing may be involved, the malter is referred to a Medical Counsellor. Information arising from a review of medical benefit claims which is insufficient to justify either course of action is normally recorded and re-evaluated if additional information is subsequently received. 'Investigated': Where the information received from the fund and that arising from a review of claims indicate that possible fraud or overservicing may be involved, the case is referred to Departmental investigators. Following detailed examination of available information, an investigator will normally recommend one of the following courses of action: the undertaking of patient interviews where fraud is suspected; fraud by medical practitioners: the referral to Medical Counsellors where overservicing is suspected; . referral to a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry (MSCI) where the doctor has previously been counselled, or where he has been before a Committee previously, or where there are indications of gross overservicing. If patient interviews are undertaken where fraud is suspected, investigators will ascertain whether there are substantial grounds for referral of the case to the Australian Federal Police. 'Referred to AFP': Where evidence acquired by Departmental investigators indicates there are substantial grounds for referral, the case is referred to the Australian Federal Police for fraud investigation and possible prosecution. The referral indicates the alleged breaches and is accompanied by all documentation obtained in support of the allegations such as patient statements. 'Referred to Medical Counsellor': Where a review or investigation indicates that overservicing may be involved, the information is usually referred to a Departmental Medical Counsellor for examination. If he considers that excessive services may have been rendered he will normally discuss the matter with the doctor concerned. If the Medical Counsellor considers that there was overservicing he will counsel the doctor. If the doctor does not respond to counselling (as indicated by the pattern of claims received for his services in the months immediately following counselling), his case is likely to be referred to an MSCI. 'Referred to MSCI': Following unsuccessful counselling, or shown. It is possible that the where extreme overservicing is indicated following an investigation of claims, a case is referred to an MSCI to determine whether particular services are considered to be excessive (that is, not reasonably necessary for the adequate medical care of the patients concerned).

(2) What would be the (a) advantages, (b) disadvantages and (c) estimated cost (at current values) of relocating these facilities in a suitable location outside the Sydney metropolitan area. (3) What is the estimated cost of rendering the sites safe from the hazard of unexploded ammunition so that they could be used either for urban development or public recreation.",139
237,Mr SINCLAIR,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) 20,560 hectares. (b) The Holsworthy /Moorebank/lngleburn areas are estimated to have an approximate value of at least $1 OOm. (c) No figures are available improvements. An estimate of the approximate replacement cost of the facilities is given in the answer to 2 (c). (2) (a) Relocation of the portunity to plan more suited to requirements, in general layout and scope for expansion.

[t could also involve additional operating costs, depending on the new location(s). (Question No, 4757) (c) Replacement of existing capital facilities (excluding land costs) is estimated to be of the order of $500m. In addition, the costs of removing personnel, equipment, and stores to the new location(s), and of the short to medium term disruption of activities of the units concerned, could be significant. (3) The costs of clearing unexploded ammunition would depend on the type of clearance operation undertaken. This could take the form of a visual surface search followed by a mine detector sweep; or it could involve the removal of overburden (usually in three layers each of 300 mm thick) to a depth of up to a metre. The soil at Holsworthy possesses magnetic qualities to the extent that the results of such a search in some areas would be questionable. No guarantee of total clearance, and therefore complete safety, could be given in either case. Total costs could range between $ [OOm and $400m.

(2) In the long term will the cost of settling damage claims be greater than the cost of relocating the Holsworthy firing range.",139
239,Mr SINCLAIR,TASMANIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The acquisition of major training areas in New South Wales is being considered: a. to provide a manoeuvre area in which the Army could conduct training up to brigade level: and b. a schools area to which Army could locate the School of Artillery (now at North Head) and the Infantry Centre (now at Singleton). Such acquisitions would permit the relocation of School of Artillery firing from Holsworthy Range. However, Holsworthy-based units would continue to require access, for the foreseeable future, to a close ties at Holsworthy, for small arms and artillery firing.

Mr Carlton--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Non-government organisations receiving grants from my Department and the Capital Territory Health Commission are required to fulfil certain audit requiremenls to satisfy the conditions of the grant, namely: organisations receiving general support grants must supply copies of audited financial statements covering the periods for which the grant was made recipients of specific purpose grants must certify that the purposes and conditions of the grant have been complied with, and supply a statement of expenditure for each grant, certified by a qualifIed public accountant who is not a member of the organisation. Grants for medical research funded under the Medical Research Endowment Act are administered by the institutions in which the research supported from the grant is undertaken. These include universities, hospitals, Government departments and authorities, colleges which is audited by the relevant Auditor-General (State or Commonwealth), or an independent auditor. The Department of Finance's directions provide that, if auditing is undertaken by a State Auditor-General, statements of expenditure of grant monies, certified by an executive officer of appropriate status in the grantee body, are acceptable in lieu of audit certificates. In other cases, such as the Howard Florey and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institutes, ations are audited annually by external auditors and the auditors' reports are published in the Institutes' annual reports. Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Aviation, upon notice, on 26 August 1982: (I) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Adelaide Advertiser' of 16 June 1982, entitled 'Fare Subsidy from South Australia Withdrawn '. (2) Have return economy air fares paid by Adelaide international travellers risen by $194 since 9 June 1982. (3) Can he explain the reasons for this fare increase and can he say what part Qantas played in reaching this decision. (4) Is it a fact that the International Air Transport Association (lATA) quashed a common Adelaide-MelbourneSydney fare offered by Pan Am and KLM while allowing a common Munich-Hamburg-Frankfurt fare to continue, even though additional domestic flights to Munich and Hamburg are needed to reach these destinations: if so, (a) is he able to say why, and (b) will he redress this victimisation of Adelaide travellers by reinstating the common fare and offering lATA concessions which have an equitable impact on all Australian training area and range faciliStates. (5) Has lATA dropped claims against the Australian the costs of settling damage Government to have member airlines re-imbursed for excesswith the cost of relocative navigation charges: if so, was this linked in any way to the decision on Adelaide fares. (6) Will he restore confidence among South Australian international travellers by enunciating a policy supporting common international air fares and common airfreight rates for (Question No, 4793) Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. (7) Is it a fact that freight is used for topping up passenger airlines to their maximum safe take-off load. (8) It is also a fact that during periods of heavy passenger by the Minister's Departbookings such as the first and last weeks of the low season and shoulder season Boeing 747 aircraft leaving Adelaide will not be able to take on the 18 tonnes of air freight normally carried because of the short runway at Adelaide Airport: if so, will he explain how international airlines flying direct to Adelaide can provide a reliable air freight service with guaranteed delivery dates. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) There have been increases in air fares on many routes between Australian cities and overseas destinations in the period since 9 June 1982. Fares for travellers to and from Adelaide have increased, as they have for other travellers. However, there has been no increase of the kind suggested in approved international air fares applicable to Adelaide. (3) The Government's policy is to leave international airlines, including Qantas, free to establish fare levels in accordance with their commercial judgment, where the provisions of Australia's air services agreements allow. (4) & (6) Qantas, which is a member of lATA, advises that and research institutes, each of it has no knowledge of any action within lATA such as has been suggested. (5) lATA has made representations to the Government about the level of air navigation charges that are levied on international airlines. There is no known connection between that matter and any resolutions adopted by lATA member airlines in relation to fares for travel to and from Adelaide. the accounts of the organis(7) Airlines would carryon individual flights with a particular aircraft type, many different combinations of number of passengers, their baggage and amount of freight, up to the Airline Fares maximum safe take-off load, (Question No, 4991) (8) Qantas advises that its B747 aircraft operating from Adelaide to Singapore with a full payload of passengers and their luggage, are also able to uplift 11.4 tonnes of cargo. A small reduction in total payload may be necessary on days with extremely high temperatures. Air freight services from Adelaide will still continue to be available via connection with Qantas services at Melbourne, Sydney or Perth. Vietnam Veterans: Death Mr Holding asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 5 May 1982: How many members of each of the 3 armed services, who served in Vietnam, have died, in each year while still serving as members in the armed forces.",140

Mr SincIairThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The estimated number of flying hours per month on average for fixed and rotary wing pilots in the Australian Defence Forces for the years 1978-79 to 1981-82 together with those estimated for 1982-83 are as follows: 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Fixed wing pilots Rotary wing pilots 28 30 Notes on the above are as follows: (I) The answer has been derived by relating pilot numbers and aggregate hours flown for each year. These were averaged (Question No. 5089) over ten and a half months to reflect the time a pilot is available for duty. The result is a notional average for operational pilots in the Defence Forces. Pilot and aircraft availability are not constant throughout the year and actual monthly achievements can differ from the annual average, from Service to Service and from aircraft to aircraft. (2) Certain activities not directly related to operational flying or not amenable to averaging have where Service records permit, been excluded. Examples are initial pilot training, research flying together with that done by headquarters and depot personnel. (3) With respect to 1982-83, the figures quoted are calculated on planned average pilot strengths and hours currently planned for achievement during the year. As indicated in Note (I) above, actual monthly achievements can vary from the planned average.

Mr Me Veigh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Government decisions relating to proposed canal developments along Peel Inlet, WA. are the responsibility of the WA. Government. Environmental Review and Management Programs (ERMP's) have been prepared on these developments in accordance with State requirements and are currently being examined by the WA. Environment Protection Authority. I suggest that, to obtain a response to this part of his question, the honourable member make representations directly to the Authority. With respect to the Master Plan for Perth Airport, I draw the honourable member's attention to section 8.8 of Appendix C of the Provisional Master Plan/draft Environmental Impact Statement for Perth Airport which states: As far as possible, consistent with safe and economic operations of the airport, management of the airport will take account of the need to conserve areas which have been designated as important from a conservation perspective. It has been noted previously, however, that the conservation of habitat which is suitable for bird species which are hazardous to aircraft operations is inconsistent with of warehousing for the three Sersafe operation of the airport.

(3) What goods and services are being produced in the community around Samar that would justify this road network. (4) From which country or organisation did the proposal about the Samar roadworks come and what (a) was the proposal that was put forward, (b) was agreed to, (c) is the cost of this proposal and (d) is the benefit to Australia. (5) What investigation did the Australian Government make of the project before committing funds to it. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The broad objective of the Australian assisted Northern Samar Integrated Rural Development Project is to improve the quality of life of the majority of residents of Northern Samar. The island of Samar is one of the poorest regions in the Philippines. The Australian assistance program is concentrated in one of its three provinces where the bulk of the population is dependent upon small scale agriculture. The project aims to bring about a broad-based increase in rural incomes through an integrated effort at the simultaneous development of several key sectors, including agriculture, transport, water supplies, education and health. (2) The project does involve a major program of road works. Arterial secondary roads, mainly along the coast, are being reconstructed and these are being complemented by a network of feeder roads. (a) When the project was first clear that the road system in Northern Samar was inadequate and imposed significant constraints on economic and social development. The road program is one of the critical elements in achieving integrated development. The justification for upgrading the road network is based on the need to provide quicker, more reliable and less expensive access for the rural population to: health, education and agricultural extension services; agricultural supplies, seed and fertiliser; markets for farm produce; and employment opportunities. (b) Yes. Inadequate road systems are a feature, and a major constraint to development, in many parts of the Philippines. The Philippine Government gives a high priority to the improvement of rural road networks struction programs. The problem is particularly acute in Samar. Loan assistance for road development in Eastern and Western Samar is being provided by the World Bank. (3) Agricultural produce in Northern Samar includes rice, coconuts, abaca, livestock, cassava, sweet potatoes and timber. The Province has the physical potential to increase production very substantially, particularly of such vital crops as rice. Inadequate road access is perhaps the single most constraining factor. The normal merce also require road communications. (4) (a) The Philippine Government requested Australian assistance with the development of Samar based on a program they had already prepared. This gave priority to improving the road network, but included activities in many other sectors. (b) The Memorandum of Understanding between the two governments establishes the project as ""directed towards alleviating the under-productivity and inadequate linkages of agricultural services and infrastructure facilities of Samar Island and its people. As such, the main thrust of the project is to develop an integrated package of infrastructure and agriculture projects that will resolve essential problems and meet the needs of the people"". This package comprises: (i) developing 160km of principal secondary roads and constructing 263km of agricultural feeder roads; (ii) providing potable water supplies at Laoang, Allen, Cattarman, Catubig and Las Navas; (iii) assisting with the implementation of an electrical distribution system to significant population centres along the coast of Northern Samar between Allen and Laoang; (iv) assisting with the achievement of improved agricultural productivity through means such as the provision of specialist personnel, extension services, pilot crop and livestock demonstration farms, incentives to farmers for on-farm improvements; (v) assisting with road maintenance at the provincial level through the provision of equipment, training of administrative staff and the development of a technical training and repair workshop. (c) In 1978 the Australian Government approved a contribution of $25 million for the project over a commitment period of five years from January 1979. Over the same period the Philippine commitment was Pesos 208.35 million (also approximately $25 million). (d) Benefits to Australia exist at several levels. Besides the substantial credit which Australia has gained within the Philippines for assisting in a severely disadvantaged area, material benefits include the employment of Australian consultants as planners, advisers and managing agents and the supply of material inputs from Australian sources. proposed and assessed it was (5) Australian commitment to the project was preceded by a most thorough investigation. After initial consideration by a Program Planning Mission in 1975 and investigation by the Australian Embassy in the Philippines, a professional study of the proposal was commissioned. This was followed by a prefeasibility study in 1976 and a full-scale feasibility and design study in 1977. The proposal was then submitted, as part of normal consultative procedures, to the Department of Finance which endorsed the proposal with strong support for its concept of integrated development. During the preparation and negotiation of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Philippine Government further specialised studies were undertaken and discussions held in Australia and in the Philippines. The Australian contribution was reviewed with the World Bank which is also funding development in Samar. and has extensive road conVisual Display Units: Department of HeaIth (Question No. 5333) Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 14 October 1982: How many visual display units were in use in the Minister's Department and statutory authorities which fall within the jurisdiction of the Minister for each of the last 10 years. services of government and comMr CarIton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The total numbers of visual display units in use in my Department and related Statutory Authorities for each of the last 10 years were1973 63 1974 65 1975 70 1976 747 1977 835 1978 737 1979 766 1980 478 1981 555 1982 626 The large increase in 1976 occurred with the transfer of computer processing responsibilities for the Health Insurance Commission from the Department of Social Security to my Department. Figures for units operated by the Health Insurance Commission from 1980 onwards are not included. To do so might place the Commission at a commercial disadvantage with other registered health insurance organisations throughout Australia with which it is in direct competition. International Add-on Fare Discount for Travel to Mrs Kelly asked the Minister for Aviation, upon notice, on 19 October 1982: (I) Are overseas visitors arriving or departing in Sydney by air eligible for the 30 per cent International Add-on Fare discount for travel to Canberra. (2) What proportion of international air arrivals and departures occur via Sydney or Melbourne. (3) Is he able to say whether the Canberra Tourist Industry is losing an enormous amount of potential business as a result of the highly selective application Fare scheme which only has an adverse effect on one capital city. Canberra. (4) Will he take immediate action to have this anomaly removed in order to provide the tourist industry in Canberra with a reasonable air fare structure to attract overseas visitors; if not, why not. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) All overseas visitors national promotional air fares, such as advance purchase excursion fares, are eligible to purchase international add-on fares for travel within Australia. (2) In 1981, the proportion of international air arrivals to and departures from Australia which occurred at Sydney International Airport was 56.4 per cent and the proportion at Melbourne International Airport was 22.8 per cent. (3) The international add-on fares include a condition that makes them available only to eligible overseas visitors who travel more than 1000 kms within services of the domestic airlines, or on the services of any international airline which has the rights to carry international passengers over Australian domestic tive application of this condition. (4) Conditions attached to 'See Australia' fares are matters for consideration by the airlines concerned in the first instance. Puckapunyal Range, Victoria: Lease Conditions Mr Bourchier asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 October 1982: (I) With regard to the conditions of leasing of Puckapunyal Range for grazing fields how required on (a) improved and (b) unimproved pasture. (2) What requirements are there on the lessee for the control of rabbits and noxious weeds. (3) What is the rental charged per acre for this range. Mr SincIair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Superphosphate is to be spread at the rate of (a) 125 kilograms per hectare for improved pasture and (b) 62 kilograms per hectare for unimproved pasture. (2) The lessee is required to keep the land free from vermin and noxious weeds, and comply with provisions and requirements of the vermin and Noxious Weeds Act 1958, and other Commonwealth, State or Municipal laws relating to owners or occupiers of land used for grazing purposes. (3) 41,000 nectares of the Range are subject to licence for which the Commonwealth is paid $20,000 per annum. Telephone Services Canberra (Question No. 5434) (Question No. 5357)",143

245,Mr NA BROWN,DEFENCE FORCE DEATHS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission, is as follows: of the International Add-on Telecom's accounting systems do not record earnings and expenses in such a way as to compare the average earnings of a telephone service with the average cost of providing a telephone service on a district basis. However, the average revenue per subscriber for 1980-81 was approximately $490. The average investment per net additional telephone service for 1980-81 was calculated at $2,600. Pharmaceutical Benefits: Cost (Question No, 5575) who travel to Australia on interDr Blewett asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 28 October 1982: What is the detailed costing behind the statement on page 94 of Budget Paper No. I for 1982-83, that in relation to total outlays on pharmaceutical benefits there will be a net increase ($2.8m) resulting from the part-year effect of the increase in the general contribution rate and the introduction of the new concessional contribution rate, both to apply from I January 1983. Australia by air on jet route Mr CarltonThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: sectors. There is no selecThe increase in the general contribution rate and the transfer of prescriptions to the concessional contribution rate are estimated to reduce the cost to the Government from $157.5 million to $ 136.6 million giving a saving of $20.9 million. However, the new concessional contribution rate will cost the Government $23.7 million. Thus the net result of the introduction of the new rates from I January 1983 is estimated to (Question No, 5366) cost the Government $2.8 million. Health Insurance: Advertising by Department of Health (Question No. 5577) much superphosphate per acre is Dr Blewett asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 28 October 1982: What proportion of the $1,350,400 appropriated for major publicity campaigns in 1982-83 does his Department propose to spend on health insurance advertising. Mr Carlton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No funding has been provided for the advertising of health insurance as such. However $400,000 has been spent on an advertising campaign, conducted in June/July 1982, to remind people of their entitlement to a taxation rebate on health insurance contributions and to advise them how to claim it. A further $281,000 is to be spent on a publicity program which will be directed principally towards people in special need, with the aim of ensuring that as many eligible persons as possible apply for, and take up their entitlement to, free Government health benefits. Tar Content of Cigarettes Dr Blewett asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 28 October 1982: (I) Is it a fact that the Government has in the past published relatively regular lists of the tar content of Australian cigarettes, at least every 2 years. (2) Is it also a fact that the publication of such tests has become irregular and that the last test published was July 1980, and that the next is not expected until mid-1983. (3) Will the Government undertake to (a) continue testing the tar content of Australian cigarettes in its own laboratories on a regular basis and (b) publish the results at least annually as is done in America and Britain. Mr CarIton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The latest 'Smokers' Tar Table', which reports on the results of the Cigarette Testing Program conducted by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL) on behalf of my Department, was issued in July 1980. Since then, the Cigarette Testing Program has been unavoidably delayed by technical problems in AGAL's cigarette testing laboratory. As well it has been necessary to conduct a carbon monoxide pilot study and obtain industry agreement on a uniform test methodology for carbon monoxide yields of cigarettes. On present indications, the involving all brands, is expected to commence early in 1983 and will take about twelve months to complete. However, the Government has acted to assist smokers who cannot give up the habit to choose lower yield cigarette brands. Under the requirements of the Voluntary Code in Respect of CPM (,Tar') and Nicotine Labelling on Cigarette Packaging, which was jointly agreed to by the Government and the industry in November 1981, all primary cigarette packages manufactured in or imported into Australia as from 12 August 1982 will be labelled with the tar and nicotine yields, per cigarette. (3) It is intended that the Cigarette Testing Program conducted by AGAL will continue on an on-going routine basis, with publication of the results completion of each Brands Survey. Hospital and Medical Benefits Fund Reserves Dr Blewett asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 28 October 1982: (I) What does his Department consider to be the desirable level of reserves for registered hospital and medical benefit organisations. (2) Does the Department have a standard accounting practice for all health funds to reserve levels, provisions, outstanding liabilities, and fixed assets on a similar basis. Mr CarIton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The existing policy is that with 175,000 or more members) ought to maintain combined hospital and medical fund reserves at a level equivalent to two months of break-even contribution income (2 CM). Smaller organisations are expected to maintain a level of up to 4 CM. There is no legislative requirement relating to reserves levels. (2) No. Most organisations registered under the National Health Act to conduct hospital or medical benefits funds are incorporated under and subject to State Government legisl(Question No. 5579) ation; e.g., the companies and friendly societies legislation. Therefore, in preparing their accounts, organisations and their auditors will be guided by the relevant legislation and by reference to accepted accounting standards and conventions. While there are no standard accounting practices as such, my Department, in its financial monitoring and consideration of contribution rate changes of health funds, does ensure that, now as far as practicable, there is proper accounting for reserves and provisions, etc. As in commerce and industry generally, there is some divergence between health insurance industry organisations in aspects of their accounting practices. Earlier this year my Department and the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia established a joint Working Party comprising representatives from both the industry and the Department to examine this matter and make appropriate recommendations. I look forward to receiving the results of their examination in due course. Sand Mining (Question No. 5625) Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 9 November 1982: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Courier-Mail of 14 October 1982, which states that revegetation of areas of sand mining would take 30 to 40 years? next Cigarette Testing Program, (2) Has he or his Department, conducted any research into the subject; if so, what are the findings? Mr MCVeigh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) No. My Department keeps under review the relevant scientific and research literature. Defence Force Pilots (Question No. 5630) as soon as possible after the Mr Maher asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 9 November 1982: (1) How many persons have been trained as pilots in the (Question No. 5581) Defence forces in each year since 1975. (2) Have any female Defence personnel been trained as pilots; if not, why not. Mr SincIair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Defence Force Pilot Training Rate ensure that they account for their Total (Defence Year RAAF Navy Army Force) 1975 31 5 41 1976 55 6 12 73 large organisations (i.e. those 1977 67 12 12 91 1978 51 12 12 75 1979 46 15 II 72 Year RAAF Navy 1980 39 1981 56 1982 (to date) 26 Total 371 (2) No female Defence Force personnel have been trained as pilots. To meet any change in strategic is a need to maintain the capability to transfer aircrew between the strike, fighter, maritime, and transport roles. Accordingly alI aircrew positions, including pilots, are categorized as 'combatant', and in accord with Government policy are therefore not available to women. Hazardous Chemicals Mr Holding asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 10 November 1982: (I) Have steps been taken to provide a substantial increase in staff for the secretariat of the National Advisory Committee on Chemicals (NACC) as recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation in its report on Hazardous Chemical Wastes presented to the House on 29 April 1982; if so, what are the details; if not, why not. (2) How many staff are currently employed in the Hazardous Chemicals Branch of his Department. (3) What is the reason that question No. 5255, which was originally directed to him, has ter for Primary Industry, in view of the fact that his Department provides the NACC secretariat and has responsibility for the management of toxic and hazardous chemicals. (4) Who initiated this change and on what basis was it made. Mr MCVeigh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Government's response to this report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation is in preparation and staffing needs are being considered in this context. (2) Eight people are employed on hazardous chemicals activities within the Environment Assessment Branch of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. (3) Question No. 5255 dealt exclusively with matters relating to pesticides. Under the current administrative arrangements, the Australian Environment Council's National Advisory Committee on Chemicals does not have responsibility for pesticides. The Co-ordinating Committee on Agricultural Chemicals (CCAC), which is responsible to the Australian Agricultural Council, has, since 1963, functioned to review the overall problems co-ordinate Commonwealth and State activities associated with information, registration, regulation, and ing to pesticides. The day to cultural chemicals' (pesticides) is undertaken by the Technical Committee on Agricultural Chemicals (TCAC), a Commonwealth/State committee responsible to CCAC.

Mr Carlton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I became Minister on 7 May 1982. I have not attended any function of the organisation. Mr Carlton-On 28 October 1982 (Hansard, page 2700) Dr Cass asked me, as Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning health care funds in Victoria. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 28 October 1982, Dr Cass asked me a question in relation to negotiations concerning the imposition of charges by Victorian public hospitals on the health funds for hospital treatment of patients eligible for free hospital treatment between 1976 and 1978. I understand that discussions have been held between the health funds and the Victorian Health Commission over a period of time on this matter. The matter is one for negotiation and settlement between the Victorian Health Commission and the health funds. There is no direct Commonwealth involvement and the Federal Government has not been involved in the negotiations. I understand that the Victorian Health Commission has estimated that the total amount refundable to the funds is $5.9m. The Cost-Sharing Agreement with Victoria expired on 30 June 1981, and the Agreement operated on a cash basis. The Federal Government has met 50 per cent of the agreed net operating costs of Victorian figures provided by the Victorian Health Commission. However, there are still a number of matters to be resolved lation to the finalisation of ment and I wrote to the Victorian Health Minister in June 1982 seeking a meeting of officers to this end. While I am still awaiting Mr Roper's reply, there raised by the honourable member could not be taken up in those discussions. However, it is the responsibility of the torian Government to fully settle funds in the first instance. Regulation of Insurance Brokers Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 August 1982: (1) Is it a fact that the Campbell Committee (a) expressly approved in principle the concept of regulation on insurance brokers, (b) made no suggestions that reducing brokers' dependence on credit from insurers, by redefining assets of insurers so as to exclude certain be a substitute for direct broker regulation and (c) suggested that regulation should be effected by the Commonwealth rather than the States. (2) Is it also a fact that proceeded on a uniform basis and brokers operating on an interstate basis will be faced with unnecessary complexity and cost in complying with different requirements in different States. (3) If so. will the Government reconsider its decision not to regulate insurance brokers in the limited way proposed by the Australian Law Reform Commission. (4) Has the Government announced its decision on the other recommendations made in the Commission's report; if not, why not. (5) With whom has the Government consulted on this matter. (6) Has the Government consulted with any consumer groups on this matter; if not, why not.",148
248,Mr HOWARD,DEFENCE FORCE DEATHS,"The answer to the honourable Health Care Funds member's question is as follows: (I) In its Final Report the Campbell Committee indicated that it had not sought to explore in full the issues pertaining to the regulation of insurance brokers (paragraph 20.203). The Committee did indicate, however, that it favoured a system of co-regulation, with government legislation laying down the ground rules for an arrangement basically involving selfregulation by an appropriate industry body on which there would be some government representation. It believed early action should be taken by the Government to ensure that appropriate co-operative national legislation was developed (paragraph 20.206). The Committee did not make any suggestions of the kind mentioned by the honourable member in (b) of his question. (2) It is true that the States that have so far taken action to legislate for the regulation of brokers have not proceeded on a uniform basis. In my statement of 10 June 1981 to Parliament on this subject. I expressed the hope that any prospective legislation by the States would recognise the benefits of existing self-regulatory arrangements adopted by broking industry bodies and have regard to the advantages associated with uniformity of controls. In the latter context, I indicated that the Government stood ready to assist in achieving uniformity between the States in this area. (3) I am not proposing any reconsideration of this matter. (4) The Government considered the Law Reform Compublic hospitals on the basis of mission's recommendations and decided not to enact legislation governing insurance intermediaries. In my statement in in re- Parliament of 10 June 1981 I outlined the Government's the Victorian Cost-Sharing Agreeviews on issues of relevance to this subject.

(2) What has this expenditure been and what proportion of total Budget outlays has it represented for each financial year since 1974-75.",149
249,Mr HOWARD,DEFENCE FORCE DEATHS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Statistics are not available on the purchase of goods and services by the Commonwealth Government Budget sector from the private sector. Statement No.6 of Budget Paper No. I classifies total Budget outlays into net expenditure on goods and services, transfer payments and net advances. However, net expenditure on goods and services encompasses purchases from all sources, not just from the private sector. In particular, it includes purchases of goods and services from other areas of the public sector as well as payments of wages and salaries to Commonwealth civil and defence employees. Precise information on these components is not available.

Mr Fife- The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: As of recent dates there were 2553 pupils, (1429 at government schools, 1124 at non-government schools). In the case of government schools, Commonwealth and State funds are combined to finance ESL programs.

Excise 21.7 11.0 collection records relate to the points of clearance of motor 21.1 10.1 spirit and distillate, which do not coincide with the ultimate 21.3 10.2 State and Territory consumption of those products. For example the southern part of New South Wales is supplied by the oil companies with motor spirit and distillate which attracts excise when it is cleared in Victoria, and similarly the northern parts of New South Wales are supplied from Queensland. (b) On a very tentative basis, it was estimated prior 1982-83 Budget that the 2 cents per litre surcharge which will apply for all of 1983-84 could yield of the order of $435m. By 1983-84, it could be expected those uses which have become excisable but are not eligible for rebate will have had time to effect substitutions of other fuels for distillate wherever such changes are economic, or at least to apply conservation measures. This makes estimates of surcharge yield especially uncertain. Evidence on any changes in consumption should emerge through the latter part of 1982-83 and should make it possible to improve on the 1983-84 revenue estimate. On velopments, the estimate mentioned above could well prove to be too high. (2) The estimates are based on excise clearances of motor spirit in 1981-82 and an estimate of total distillate consumption in 1981-82 derive from a survey of fuel usage by the Department of National Development and Energy. Excise clearance and survey evidence was used to disaggregate total estimated distillate consumption into estimates of on-road consumption (which was excisable before the Budget), off-road consumption which became excisable but rebateable after the Budget, and off-road consumption which became excisable in the Budget but fell scheme. The 1981-82 clearance and consumption estimates were then adjusted by assumed rates of growth to yield estimates for 1982-83 and 1983-84. Redundancy as a Result of Recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Functions Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 October 1982: How many persons have been made redundant as a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions recommendations involving the transfer to the private sector of functions previously performed in the Australian Public Service. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Public Service Board has informed me that all Australian Public Service staff been transferred to the private sector as a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions have had the option of either separating from the Service employer, or seeking redeployment within the Service. 138 staff were given the opportunity of transferring to the private employer and of these 134 have separated from the Service and been given the benefits attaching to retrenchment. No staff have been involuntarily retrenched. Mrs Darling asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 October 1982: (1) Has his attention been Courier Mail of 12 October 1982 in which he is reported as saying, during an address to the Annual Conference of the National Readymix Concrete Association of Australia in Sydney on 11 October 1982, that a change in the Government's present economic policies would be a mistake because he believed in achieving lasting economic growth in Australia; if so, is there substance in the report. (2) What statistical evidence can be produced to show that to the the Government's economic policies are achieving lasting economic growth. Mr HowardThe answer to the honourable that consumers of distillate in member's question is as follows: (I) I am aware of the report in the Brisbane Courier Mail of 12 October 1982 last referring to my address to the Annual Conference of the Readymix Concrete Association on II October 1982. During that speech I stated that those calling for a policy change were not talking about a mere fine tuning of present the basis of recent economic depolicies, but rather a major change fowards what they choose to describe as expansionary policies. I noted-as I have on numerous occasions-that such a change of policy would inevitably be inflationary at a time when our inflation rate is already much too high and well above that of our major trading partners. I went on to say: 'A change in economic policy at present would inevitably delay in my view a resumption of economic growth. If we were now to adopt policies which produced a rise in inflation and inflationary expectations this would result in Australia not being in a position to take full advantage of world economic recovery when it comes. outside the scope of the rebate The essential policy objective in Australia at present must be to ensure that when there is a resumption of economic growth around the world we are in a position to take advantage of it and to share in it.' (2) In the three years 1979 to 1981 economic growth in Australia was stronger, and our inflation rate lower, than the average rates for all OECD members. Statistical evidence of (Question No. 5265) this comparatively favourable performance can be found in Tables R1 and RIO at pages 142 and 151 and Tables 1 and 2 on page 14 of the OECD Economic Outlook Number 31 published in July 1982. The basis for that achievement is to be found largely in the consistent, anti-inflationary policy stance of earlier years. Governments do not, of course, have complete control over economic events and cannot bear sole responsibility for economic outcomes. During 1982 excessive domestic wage increases, combined with a further deterioration in economic activity overseas and, in recent months, the increasingly grave drought in the rural sector, combined to substantially dampen domestic activity. Drink-driving Campaign: Cost engaged on functions which have (Question No. 5371) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport in order to work for the private and Construction, upon notice, on 19 October 1982: (1) Is he able to provide an estimate of the total cost of the drink-driving campaign involving T.V. personality, Paul Cronin. (2) Is he able to say what sum was allocated and by which Economic Policies organisations. (Question No. 5361) (3) Can he provide a precise description of the campaign, its aims and methods. (4) Is he able to say when the campaign was initiated and when it is expected to be completed. drawn to a report in Brisbane's (5) Is he able to say what stages of the campaign are still to be completed and at what cost. (6) Has the Government allocated funds to complete the campaIgn. (7) Which Government bodies are involved in Government-supported drink-drive campaigns, what are their tasks and which organisation co-ordinates the campaigns.",150
251,Mr HUNT,DEFENCE FORCE DEATHS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) To date the Commonwealth has spent some $400,000 being the cost of the initial research and development of the four television commercials featuring Paul Cronin, their market testing in Tasmania and subsequent showing on the mainland last Christmas. An Australia-wide campaign based on the commercials is to commence shortly at a public sector cost of $1,000,000. (2) The amount of $1,000,000 comprises $500,000 provided in the Commonwealth Budget this year and a matching contribution from the States and the Northern Territory. Industry is also to be invited to contribute. (3) The aim of the campaign is to effect a change in attitude and behaviour in relation to driving after drinking. The Cronin commercials emphasise the social responsibilities of being someone's friend while reinforcing the traditional pervasive concept of mateship. The commercials demonstrate practical and effective ways of supporting friends in social situations and are designed to encourage more responsible attitudes in relation to drink driving. (4) At the August 1982 meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council (AT AC) in Darwin I canvassed with my AT AC colleagues a proposal for a national drinkdriving campaign following consideration by AT AC advisers over several years. An amount of $500,000 was provided in the Budget for the campaign and the Prime Minister, on 19 September 1982, formally invited the States and the Northern Territory to participate on a matching contribution basis. The national campaign is planned to commence on Sunday, 12 December 1982 and extend to February 1983. It is hoped that the campaign can be further extended to Easter 1983 if industry contributions are forthcoming. (5) The final stage of the campaign is the showing of the Cronin commercials on television throughout Australia. (6) Yes. (7) At the Commonwealth level, campaign is being co-ordinated my Department in consultation with the appropriate agencies in each State and Territory. The Department of Health has also supported a pilot campaign conducted by the Australian Medical Association and the Office of Road Safety was consulted during its development. The Department of Health and the Australian Medical Association support the national campaign. Diesel Fuel Rebates",152
252,Mr HAYDEN,DEFENCE FORCE DEATHS,"the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 October 1982: What is the estimated additional (a) 1982-83 and (b) a full year from the Budget decision to replace diesel excise exemptions with rebates, from (i) each State Government, (ii) local government authorities in each State, (iii) each Commonwealth ness undertaking.",152
253,Mr HOWARD,DEFENCE FORCE DEATHS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Data available to the Commonwealth are insufficient to permit comprehensive answers to the question. There are two types of data on diesel fuel use available: excise clearance data collected by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and consumption estimates and forecasts by the Department of National Development and Energy. The former source does not record any detail on the ultimate end user of the fuel once it is retailed downstream of the excise clearance point. The latter source estimates distillate consumption by broad type of end use-e.g. road transport-but not by end user. However the Department of National Development and Energy forecasts do identify two end uses of distillate - public rail transport and public power generation where State Governments would account for the bulk of consumption. On the assumption that both these types of end use were exempt from the 5. I 55 cents per litre excise before the Budget, but are not eligible for rebate of the 6. I 55 cents per litre exci,e which has applied since the Budget, the following estimates of excise costs may be of assistance in partially answering part (i) of the question: ESTIMATED DISTILLATE EXCISE COSTS: 1982-83 NA Public rail' Public power 1982-83 Full year 1982-83 Full year $m $m $m $m New South Wales 11.0 12.6 4.8 5.5 Victoria 4.7 5.4 0 0 Queensland 9.5 10.8 3.0 3.4 South Australia 5.3 6.0 0.2 0.2 Western Australia 3.4 3.9 4.9 5.6 Tasmania 0.5 0.6 0.1 0.1 Northern Territory 0 0 2.5 2.9 , The Commonwealth, through the operations of the Australian National Railways Commission, would bear some of this excise cost in South Australia and all of the Tasmanian costs. There would be other smaller exceptions also, such as the Indian Pacific service. No breakdown by State of likely additional excise costs to local government authorities is available to permit an answer the national drink driving to part (ii) of the question. by the Office of Road Safety in As for part (iii) of the question, no central record of distillate consumption by each Commonwealth statutory authority and business undertaking is available; authorities would not normally report their outlays in such detail. It is relevant, however, that Commonwealth Departments and most. statutory authorities except certain trading authorities retain their long standing eligibility for rebates of all fuel excise costs. Thus the majority of Commonwealth authorities would be unaffected by the Budget's distillate excise measures. (Question No_ 5377) Salaries of Engineers in the Australian Public Service (Question No. 5427) net revenue to be raised in Mr John Brown asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 20 October 1982: statutory authority and busi(I) Is it a fact that the salaries of engineers employed by the Australian Public Service (A.P.S.) are well below those in the New South Wales State Public Service. (2) Has the Public Service Board admitted that engineer salaries in the A.P.S. are too low. (3) Is the starting salary for a draftsman in the A.P.S. higher than the starting salary for a qualified professional engmeer. (4) Was the apparent anomaly outlined in part (3) created by the Public Service Board over 5 months ago and has no action to remedy the situation been taken since. (5) Has this failure of duty led to overwhelming dissatisfaction and frustration among engineers in the A.P.S. resulting recently in industrial action which may delay some major engineering projects. (6) What action will he or the Board take to remedy this situation. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I ) to (6) The Public on 21 October 1982 the Acting Public Service Arbitrator issued a consent determinatKln giving effect to salary increases offered to engineer or related groups by the Board on 24 September 1982. It is the view of the Board that the salaries of engineers employed by the Australian Public Service are now broadly comparable with those of engineers in the New South Wales Public Service. Any anomalies that it is claimed existed between graduate engineers and drafting grades prior to the increases were largely the result of the different timing of pay reviews concerning those groups. The salary of a graduate engineer is now higher than the starting salary of a draftsman. In addition the Public Service Board also considers that these increases should largely, if not totally, remove situations where the maximum salary of a subordinate technical officer /draftsman exceeds that of his professional supervisor. A process for dealing with any remaining situations of this nature was included in the offer that was accepted by the relevant organisations. Interaction between Industry and Tertiary",152
254,Mr HAYDEN,AND FULL YEAR,"the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 20 October 1982: (I) Further to his answer to Question No. 5084 (Hansard, 14 October 1982, page 2147) in which he said that the Government was actively encouraging interaction between industry and tertiary institutions through a range of existing programs and activities, to which programs and activities was he referring. (2) In which instances over the last 3 years have these programs and activities resulted in increased research and development effort. Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Government actively encourages interaction between industry and tertiary institutions through a range of programs and activities including: (a) the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme, which encourages ects whereby tertiary proved Research Organisations (ARO's) can perform research and development for manufacturing firms. The costs incurred by companies for R&D work performed in this way are eligible for grant assistance under the Scheme; (b) the Research Associations program, which provides block grants to assist the establishment, operation development of non-profit research associations. These associations perform or contract out problemoriented research and development for industry members and provide a technical information and consulting service. Research associations have substantial interaction with tertiary institutions, through both joint projects with, and the letting of research conthe Board to perform its statutory tracts to, the tertiary institutions. The Budget allocation for this program has increased from $0.831 million (1980-81) to $1.341 million (1982-83); (c) CSIRO-university collaboration, under which arrangements are made for collaborative research (e.g. CSIRO/ANU Fund of $100,000 in 1982 to support collaborative projects), joint sponsorship of visitors, supervision of higher degree students and lecturing by CSIRO staff; Service Board has informed me that (d) support for the Technology Transfer Council (TTC), which provides a technical referral, consulting and problem-solving service for firms in the metals manufacturing sector. Through its close contact with tertiary institutions and industry, the TTC is in a position to assess industry needs and relate these to research activities in both the industrial and tertiary sectors; (e) the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Scheme, which encourages cooperation in energy research and development between tertiary institutions and industry; (f) symposia, conferences and workshops on science and technology-related topics supported by the Government, involving participants from tertiary institutions and industry (e.g., Genetic Engineering Symposium, Sydney, November 198 I; Finance for Technology Ventures, Melbourne, July 1982; Biotechnology Seminar, Brisbane, August 1982; Biotechnology Workshop, Canberra, November 1982). (2) The programs and activities outlined above which encourage interaction between industry and tertiary institutions Institutions assist in creating the climate for increased industrial research and development effort, although the aims of individual (Question No. 5433) activities may have another focus. Polychlorinated Biphenyls: Use by Department of the Treasury (Question No, 5529) Mr Holding asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 October 1982: (1) What materials and equipment currently in use in the Minister's Department or bodies under the Minister's control are known to contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). (2) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the dangers associated with the use of PCBs. (3) What (a) statutory and (b) advisory conditions exist for the purpose of monitoring all introduction, use, transport and disposal of PCBs, and what arrangements are currently in existence for policing statutory conditions.

255,Mr HOWARD,AND FULL YEAR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Materials and equipment currently in use in agencies within my area of responsibility known to contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are only located at the Royal Australian Mint. The following answers are therefore provided: (I) The Mint operates a number of medium frequency melting furnaces for the production of coinage and metal alloys. The electrical system incorporates capacitors filled with PCB which are located ted access area in the main basement. The furnaces presently in operation placement in 1983 under the Mint Refurbishment Scheme. The new furnaces will be filled with a silicone fluid capacitor replacing the PCB type. (2) Yes. (3) I am not aware of any statutory or advisory conditions applying for the purpose of monitoring the introduction, use, transport and disposal of PCBs. (4) Currently, all PCB contaminated waste is stored in a secure area within the Mint basement. The disposal ship ""Vulcan us"" is shortly due in Sydney and arrangements are in hand to leach all contaminated solids with a suitable solvent, the solution of which containing the PCB, then being forwarded to Sydney for disposal by the ""Vulcanus"". The remaining solid waste will be encased in concrete and buried by the Department of the Capital Territory. (5) The Mint has advised tamination of the environment due to its use/disposal of PCBs. (6) Access to the area containing PCB filled capacitors has always been restricted to Electrical Tradesmen only, except in the case of a condenser burst when Trade Assistants would be up. All personnel concerned ards involved. A comprehensive 'Safety Instruction' covering the handling of PCBs has been current for some years and full protective equipment, including breathing apparatus, is used. All items used during a clean-up, including boots contaminated waste. Polychlorinated Biphenyls: Use by Department of Home Affairs and Environment Mr Holding asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 27 October 1982: (I) What materials and equipment currently in use in the Minister's Department or bodies are known to contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). (2) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the dangers associated with the use of PCBs. (3) What (a) statutory and (b) advisory conditions exist for the purpose of monitoring and disposal of PCBs, and what existence for policing statutory conditions. (4) What methods of storage and disposal are used for materials and equipment containing PCBs when those items become redundant or useless. (5) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to any contamination of the environment by PCBs which may be wholly or partly due to the use, etc, of PCBs by the Minister's Department or bodies under the Minister's control; if so, what are the details. (6) Has the Minister taken any steps to ensure that all employees under the Minister's control are fully aware of the dangers of PCBs; if so, what are the details; if not, will the Minister now do so; if the Minister will not do so, what is the reason. Mr Me Veigh-The answer to the honourable in a restric- member's question is as follows: In relation to parts (I), (2) and (4) of the question, a comare scheduled for progressive reprehensive answer was provided to Senator Jones' question (No. 2009) in Senate Hansard of 12 October, 1982, pages 1308-9 which dealt with the same topics. (3) As indicated in the reply to the question by Senator Jones, the introduction of PCBs is controlled under a Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation. In recent years the annual amount of PCBs introduced has been zero or very small. The permitted uses of PCBs under the import regulation are strictly limited. Control of the transport and disposal of PCBs is largely the responsibility of State and Territory authorities. (5) and (6) No significant quantities of PCBs are known to have been used by my Department or other bodies within my portfolio. Consequently, the issues of environmental contamination and employee safeguards are not relevant. Interest Rates (Question No. 5615) that it is not aware of any conMr Humphreys asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 9 November 1982: (I) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Australian of 25 October 1982, in which Professor Milton Friedman predicted a new surge in United States interest rates very called into assist in cleaning soon. are fully aware of the haz(2) Would a surge in interest rates in the USA affect interest rates in Australia; if so how. (3) What steps can be taken to divorce Australian interest rates from the fluctuations in the USA. and overalls, are treated as",154
256,Mr HOWARD,AND FULL YEAR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) A surge in interest rates in the United States would tend (Question No. 5549) to put upward pressure on interest rates in Australia. Broadly speaking, if the interest rate on investment in the United States rose, funds would tend to move away from Australia until the return to investing in Australia matched the increased return to investing in the United States i.e. Australian interest rates would tend to rise. Interest rates overseas are, however, only one of a number of important influences on under the Minister's control domestic interest rates. Fiscal and monetary policies, inflationary expectations and expectations of movements in exchange rates also affect domestic interest rates. It therefore follows that the extent to which any increase in United States interest rates would be reflected in Australian interest rates would depend on developments in each of these factors. The all introduction, use, transport same applies in respect of any fall in United States interest arrangements are currently in rates. (3) There are various steps which can be taken to reduce Australian interest rates relative to those in the United States. By following policies designed to lower the rates of wage and price inflation and also inflationary expectations, Australian interest rates can be further reduced independently of changes in overseas interest rates including those in the United States. Mr Humphreys asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 9 November 1982: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the claim made by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, reported in an article in the Australian of 25 October 1982, that new economic policies were needed to solve the country's basic economic problems, and to the further suggestions of the Committee that the taxation system needed reform, the coastal shipping industry should be considered for deregulation and that the Government 'experiment' for policies capable of lowering inflation rates, reducing unemployment and increasing productivity. (2) Is there any substance to the tem needs reform, as stated by the Committee. (3) Is it a fact that the Government is fighting present economic problems with the same policy instruments and general approaches that were used decades ago. (4) Is it also a fact that. as stated by the Committee, old economic recipes do not seem to work.",154
257,Mr HOWARD,AND FULL YEAR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) There is always scope for reform in the tax area and the Government has moved towards responsible reforms at a rate consistent with other objectives and the overall economic situation. For example, the Government has recently acted to reduce the burden of direct taxation and to alter the taxation mix towards a greater reliance on indirect taxation. More changes will follow at a responsible pace consistent with budgetary requirements. (3) No. However the basic elements of our present economic problems have occurred in many economies and in different combinations over many years, and there has been correspondingly wide experience with many policy instruments and approaches. Hence it is not surprising to observe that elements of present policies have been used in the past. (4) No. The Government believes, ence both here and abroad, that its long-standing economic policies form the basic requirements rates of wage increase are to be wound back and the economy is to be put into a position world economy. Innocents Relief Appeal Association Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 November 1982: (I) Are donations to the ation for the purposes of aid to overseas countries tax deductible. (2) If not, what criteria are used in allowing donations to these sorts of charities to be used for tax deduction purposes.",155
258,Mr HOWARD,AND FULL YEAR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. (2) An organisation seeking eligibility in terms of the income tax scheme that authorises taxation deductions for gifts to certain overseas aid agencies must, in the first instance, be determined an approved organisation for the purposes of the Economic Policy scheme by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Where an organisation has been so approved, gifts made to a public fund estab(Question No. 5617) lished by that organisation may qualify for deduction where the Treasurer is satisfied that the fund is established exclusively for the relief of persons in developing countries that have been certified for the purposes of the scheme by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Eligibility for deduction is subject to the further requirement that the fund be declared by the Treasurer, by notice published in the Commonwealth Government Gazelle, to be an eligible fund for the purposes of the scheme. Generally, gifts to an eligible fund will be deductible from the date of the Gazelle declaring its eligibility, although a later date may be prescribed for this purpose. The Innocents Relief Appeal Association has applied for access to the concession and its application is currently being claim that the taxation sysconsidered. Halley's Comet (Question No. 5749) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 8 December 1982: What is Australia going to do about Halley's Comet. Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Following an agreement reached in 1979 between the Australian Government and the European Space Agency, the Parkes Radiotelescope operated by the CSIRO Division of Radiophysics will playa crucial role in the scientific investigation of Halley's Comet in March, 1986. The objectives of the satellite mission, code-named ""Giotto"", are to undertake imaging of the comet's nucleus, to measure characteristics of the comet's atmosphere, and to investigate interactions between the solar wind and the comet's atmosphere. For this purpose the space-craft will be equipped with instrumentation for ten experiments, amongst which there will be a camera for image production, mass spectrometers, plasma and particle experiments, and a magnetometer. In addition, a program of direct observations with the on the basis of experiParkes Radiotelescope to study molecular species in the comet is being planned by Australian astronomers for late 1985. The study forms part of Australia's contribution to the if inflation and excessive international Halley-watch. to benefit from any upturn in the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union Ballot (Question No. 5754) (Question No. 5660) Mr West asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 8 December 1982: (I) Is it a fact that, during the recent Federal Courtcontrolled ballot for positions in the New South Wales Branch Innocents Relief Appeal Associof the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union, 789 envelopes containing ballot papers were found to be taped and carried no Australia Post postmark. (2) Is it also a fact that the Senior Industrial Officer of the  requests to count these ballot papers separately. (3) Did the officer also admit to being in breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, in so much as the Telecom Australia section of the ballot papers had been prematurely destroyed. (4) Is this officer currently involved in pending industrial ballots and did the officer also preside over the New South Wales Senate count at the last Federal election; if so, will he ensure that this officer is prevented from conducting further ballots pending inquiry into his conduct. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) The 1981 election for officers in the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union was conducted under section 170 of the Con tralian Electoral Office, Sydney, was the Returning Officer for that election. 789 envelopes containing hesive tape either in addition to or instead of the normal envelope glue were received by the Returning Officer by the close of the poll. Approximately 1300 of the envelopes returned were not postmarked by Australia Post. During the scrutiny, the scrutineer for one of the candidates approached the Returning Officer and requested that all envelopes that were either not on them be set aside and counted separately. After discussing the matter with the then Australian Electoral Officer for New South Wales, Mr Lewis rejected the request. Mr Lewis has, for the purposes of the current court proceedings involving this election, sworn and filed an affidavit setting out the cumstances concerning the request and its refusal. These are set out in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the affidavit: ""16. During the course of the ballot I overheard scrutineers expressing their concern about Business Reply Post envelopes that were either unpostmarked or had tape on them. In the elections that I have both assisted with and conducted over the past six years I have noticed that bulk amounts of Business Reply Post envelopes addressed to the Australian Electoral Office quite often include unpostmarked envelopes and I was not aware of any noticeable increase in the number of postmarked (sic) envelopes for this election. Further, I had familiarised myself with the previous elections conducted Electoral Office where allegations had been made concerning tampering of those envelopes which had been taped, however, subsequent investigations of those envelopes held those allegations to be unfounded. In the elections that I have assisted with and conducted over the years, and for that matter general correspondence as well, I have noticed that it is not unusual for envelopes to have tape on them. I believe that the number of envelopes returned in this election which had been taped was no greater than for any other election of Postal workers. 17. During the course of the scrutiny a scrutineer for one of the candidates approached me and requested that all envelopes that were either not postmarked or had tape on them be set aside and counted their numbers to be excessive. Based on my experience as outlined in paragraph 16 above it appeared to me that there was nothing irregular about were unpostmarked or taped and after discussing the matter with Mr White decided to count those ballot-papers together with the others in the usual manner."" (3) The circumstances surrounding the premature destruction of certain material relating to this election-including the Telecommunications Group Representatives ballot papers, are set out in Senate Hansard of 16 November 1982, page 2356, in a response by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, Minister for Finance, to certain Gietzelt on II November 1982 during the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. I). (4) As at 8 December 1982 Mr Lewis is, as Returning Officer, responsible for the conduct of seven industrial ballots in New South Wales. The Senate count for the last Federal election was conducted by the then Australian Electoral Officer for New South Wales. Mr Lewis, together with other officers of the Australian Electoral Office in Sydney (both senior and junior to him), assisted with the tallying and transfer of votes and this was done under the supervision, direction and control of the Australian Electoral Officer. In the light of the foregoing, no inquiry into the conduct of Mr Lewis is justified or warranted. Sales Tax",155
259,Mr HOWARD,AND FULL YEAR,"On 8 December 1982 (Hansard, ballot papers sealed with an adpage 3078) Mr Donald Cameron asked, without notice: Whether the imposition of sales tax on retreaded tyres will result in a retreaded tyre costing more than a new tyre. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: postmarked or had adhesive tape The Commissioner of Taxation has conducted a review of the processes involved in the retreading of tyres and concluded that the processes amount to manufacture. Retreaded tyres will, as a result, be taxable at 20 per cent. The cir- tax will be payable on the wholesale selling price of the retreaded tyre. The effect of this decision may increase the price of retreaded tyres but will certainly not result in a retreaded tyre becoming dearer than a brand new tyre of the same general specifications. There has always been a tax element in a retreaded tyre, tax being payable on the new rubber and other materials used in the retreading process. This tax element will no longer apply so that the tax impact on retreaded tyres under the new arrangements will not amount to an additional 20 per cent on the wholesale price. Rather the increase in tax will be 20 per cent of the wholesale price less the tax previously payable on the retread rubber, etc. The increase will be variable depending on the value of retread rubber used. for the Union by the Australian The Commissioner's decision will mean that retreaded tyres produced from Australian casings will be taxable on the same basis as retreaded tyres produced from imported casings which have always been taxable. Furthermore, retreaded tyres will be taxed on the same basis as new tyres albeit on lower sale values for comparable tyres. Where a customer takes his own used tyre casings to a tyre retreader and those casings are retreaded to the order of the customer so that property in the casings always remains with the customer then sales tax will only be payable on the ret reader's charge, not the full value of the tyre. The Commissioner has advised that the new arrangements will apply from I March 1983. separately as he considered Qantas Airways Ltd: Annual Reports (Question No. 3679) the number of envelopes that Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 18 November 1981: (I) On what dates were the annual reports of Qantas Airways Ltd for each of the years ending on 31 March (a) 1976, (b) 1977, (c) 1978, (d) 1979, (e) 1980 and (f) 1981 (i) received by him or his predecessors and (ii) tabled in the House of Representatives. (2) What were the factors associated with the delay in questions raised by Senator presenting the reports to (a) the responsible Minister and (b) the House of Representatives. Mr Fife-Further to the honourable member's question, the following supplementary information is provided: In my predecessor's reply to Question No. 3679 asked by the honourable member for Shortland (Hansard 16 February 1982, page 188), the wording of the answer to part 2 (b) could be misinterpreted. The question concerned the tabling of the Annual Reports of Qantas Airways Ltd, and sought information on the period between their receipt by the Minister and their presentation to the Parliament. Part 2 (b) enquired into factors causing delays in presenting the reports to the House of Representatives. The reply to part 2 (b) said that no delays of any significance occurred between receipt of the financial statements by the Minister and their tabling. This was intended to mean that once the necessary discussions between Departments had concluded and the final form of the accounts had been resolved there were no significant delays in Ministerial refer to the receipt by the Minister of the 'financial statements' forwarded for his approval and which are subject to Departmental consideration and examination by the Auditor General which may take some months. National Companies and Securities Commission Mr Jacobi asked the Acting Attorney-General, upon notice, on 24 February 1982: (I) Is it a fact that the 3 full-time commissioners of the National Companies and Securities Commission have persistently drawn public attention to the totally inadequate allocation of funds and staff to enable the Commission to be effectivelyadministered. (2) If so, will the Attorney-General, as a matter of urgency, ensure that the Commission has adequate staff and funds to effectively administer its responsibilities. (3) Is it also a fact that there has been, since the establishment of the Commission, a lack of co-operation between the Commission and several State Corporate Affairs Commissions, in particular the Victorian Commission. (4) If so, what action has been taken to eliminate this State parochialism and to ensure the Commission receives the full support and co-operation it deserves. (5) Does the co-operative agreement for companies and securities regulation stipulate Law Review Committee shall be formed to carry out research into and advise on law reform in relation to the co-operative scheme legislation. (6) If so, will this important and vital body be established; if so, when; if not, why not.",156
260,Mr NA BROWN,AND FULL YEAR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) Following submissions from the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) on its staffing requirements, the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities in November 1981 decided to engage Messrs Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co. as consultants to examine and report on present and future staffing requirements of the NCSC. The consultants' report was considered by the Ministerial Council on 12 February 1982 and, on the basis of the consultants' recommendations, Ministers approved a net increase of 8 in the permanent staff of the Commission. Subsequently, following further representations by the Chairman of the NCSC, the Ministerial Council on 26 November 1982 approved a further increase of lOin the permanent staff of the NCSC. The Commonwealth believes that the level of funding approved by the Ministerial Council for the NCSC in 1982-83 is appropriate in the current climate of financial restraints. (3) and (4) The NCSC has advised that there is no lack of co-operation between the Commission and the State Corporate Affairs Commissions. (5) and (6) At its meeting on 26 November 1982 the Ministerial Council agreed in principle to the establishment of the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. The matter will be considered again by the Ministerial Council at its meeting in February 1983 following receipt of a paper to be prepared by Commonwealth and New South Wales officers on the detailed mechanics involved in setting up the Committee. Employment (Question No. 4226) tabling.

266,Mr HAYDEN,NEW VACANCIES NOTIFIED BY EACH OFFICE,"the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 6 May 1982: (I) Did the Prime Minister, September 1980, promise to upgrade migrant education in such areas as the Home Tutor Scheme. (2) If so, when was this promise implemented and in what form. (3) What was the appropriation and spending on this scheme in each year since its inception. Mr Hodges-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) A review of the Home Tutor Scheme was encompassed in the general evaluation of post-arrival programs and services for migrants which was conducted by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs from 1982. Following the evaluation, the Government decided that an additional $150,000 will be provided over three years for the Home Tutor Scheme. In each State and the Northern Territory, the Scheme is administered by the State Adult Migrant Education Service to allow it to respond more readily to local needs. Up-grading of the Scheme is being undertaken in co-operation with State authorities. (3) The Home Tutor Scheme commenced in 1974. Until 1978 Good Neighbour Councils participated with other organisations in the administration and co-ordination of the Scheme. Funds were not appropriated separately and it is not possible to identify total expenditure on the Scheme in its early stages. Since 1979 funds for the Scheme have been derived from the appropriation for the Adult Migrant Education Program. There is no separate appropriation for the Scheme. The following summary gives Scheme since 1979-80. NA SCHEME 1979-80-1982-83 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83 (estimated) Workers Compensation: C. E.

267,Mr HOWARD,SUMMARY OF EXPENDITURE ON HOME TUTOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) C. E. Heath Underwriting and Insurance (Australia) Pty Limited was authorised under the Insurance Act 1973 on 23 June 1976. Information of relevance to the liquidity status of the company can be obtained from an examination of the Underwriting Accounts, Profit and Loss Accounts and Balance Sheets (Forms 1,2 and 3 of the Insurance Regulations) lodged by the company pursuant to the Act. These documents are available for inspection by the public at the Office of the Insurance Commissioner and copies of the documents can be obtained for a small fee. Information of relevance to the company can also be obtained from the Annual Reports of the Insurance Commissioner and from the Corporate Affairs Commission in the States in which the company operates. (2) I am informed that the company conducts Employers' Liability insurance business in all States except New South Wales. However, as licenses in respect of certain liability details of expenditure on the classes of insurance business (e.g. Employers' Liability) are issued under State and Territory legislation, the honourable member may wish to consider obtaining information on this aspect from the relevant State and Territory authorities. $ 302,71 I (3) I do not have any information on this aspect. See (2) above. 319,671 532,581 (4) This information is not known to me. However, I am 625,000 informed that a company known as M. W. Payne Liability Agencies Pty Ltd changed its name to C. E. Heath U nderwriting Agencies Pty Ltd on 26 June 1974 and that while the latter company acted as an underwriting agent it did not conduct in(Question No. 4685) surance business as defined in the Insurance Act 1973 in Australia. (5) I do not have any information on the company or the person mentioned. The company is not authorised under the Insurance Act 1973. (6) See (I) above. The provisions of the Act do not allow for public disclosure of returns other than those mentioned in (I) and accordingly it would not be appropriate for me to provide copies of the other returns furnished under the Act by C. E. Heath Underwriting and Insurance (Australia) Pty Limited. M. W. Payne Liability Pty Limited has not applied for or been granted an authority under the Insurance Act 1973 and therefore has not lodged any returns under the Act. (7) See (2) above. (8) The Office of the Insurance Commissioner monitors, on a continuing basis, all authorised insurers including C. E. Heath Underwriting and Insurance (Australia) Pty Limited. The Commissioner does not reveal any information beforehand on any investigations in the industry which might be pending. In this regard, the secrecy Act 1973 are relevant. It might be mentioned, however, that where inspections of general insurers have led to the issue of directions under paragraph 62 Insurance Act, details are published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and related information is published in the Insurance Commissioner's Annual Report. (9) Companies authorised under the Insurance Act 1973 are listed in the Anual Reports of the Insurance Commissioner. Information regarding place of incorporation of such companies can be obtaine<i from the Corporate Affairs Commission in the State or Territory in which those companies operate. See (2) above in relation to workers' compensation aspects.

(2) What are these embassies. (3) What frequencies are used by these transmitters. (4) What levels of transmitting power are believed to be used. Mr Street: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I am advised that pursuant to the requirement that foreign diplomatic missions must make application to the Department of Communications for approval to operate a radio transmitter, three missions have applied for and have been granted permission to operate a radio. (2) The embassies of Indonesia, Switzerland and the United States of America. (3) Particulars of the frequencies used by embassies (as for all radio communication users licensed under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905) are not normally published as this would be construed as an invasion of privacy by the licensee. (4) The maximum transmitting power authorised for each of these stations is one kilowatt. Grants to Non-government Organisations: Department of Employment and Industrial Mr Les MCLeay asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 18 August 1982: (I) In the 1981-82 financial year what non-government organisations received grants or payments from the Minister's Department. (2) What was the value of these grants or payments.

The deductions apply where the home was purchased under a contract entered into on or after 1 October 1980. Information made available by the Commissioner of Taxation indicates that the reduction in income tax attributable to deductions allowed in respect of home insulation expenses incurred in the period 1 October 1980 to 30 June 1981 is estimated to be about $1.5 million. Given the very limited information available, only very broad estimates can be made of the potential savings by home owners who have taken advantage of the insulation taxation deductions. An estimate of the potential Department of National Deve.lopment and Energy in relation to insulation installed under the income tax concession between 1 October 1980 and 30 June 1981. The annual potential savings is estimated to be between $533,000 and $767,000 based on current average marginal energy costs. These estimates are based on the assumption that proper insulation can save up to 30% of heating/cooling tralian households. The actual energy savings on several factors. These include whether the insulation was installed in ceilings and/or walls; the type and thickness insulation; the type of house/dwelling and its location; and the extent to which occupiers of insulated dwellings choose to increase comfort levels, or extend the areas which are heated and cooled, rather than save energy. Meat Marketing in Rockhampton Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 18 August 1982: (1) Is meat from Mackay abattoir district, entering Rockhampton, required to be taken at buyer's expense to be stamped at a Rockhampton meat works before delivery to retailers or wholesalers in Rockhampton. (2) Is the landed price now freight paid, than some comparable local cuts. (3) Is Gladstone exempt (4) What is being done to rationalise marketing. Mr Nixon-The question asked by the honourable member involves matters relating to the regulation of meat marketing in local areas in Queensland under that State's regulatory arrangements. I sought the required information from the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries who has responsibility for those arrangements. His comments are as follows: (1) Meat introduced into the Rockhampton area from the abattoir at Mackay presently is required to be submitted for inspection by officers of the Queensland Department of Primary Industries before delivery Rockhampton. The meat industry legislation of Queensland, in the interests of meat consumers, requires that any meat supplied into a declared area such as the Rockhampton Regional Meat Area shall be presented for inspection unless otherwise authorised by the Queensland Meat Industry Organisation and Marketing Authority. (2) The Queensland Department of Primary Industries does not monitor wholesale meat prices of individual abattoirs. However, the Minister indicated that he would be suprised if Rockhampton meat works' operators failed to meet the competition provided by operators at Mackay or elsewhere. (3) Gladstone is not within a declared area into which only fully inspected meat can be supplied. Consequently, meat supplied to the Gladstone district is not required to be submitted for reinspection. Nevertheless, it is expected that the area will be declared at some future date when similar conditions relating to the introduction of meat will then apply. (4) The Queensland Government has no specific proposals to rationalise meat marketing in Queensland. However, in the circumstances that exist within the industry as a whole and because presently available slaughtering capacity exceeds by far the number of livestock available for slaughter, the Queensland Meat Industry Organisation and Marketing Authority has, for the time being, decided not to approve the savings has been made by the construction of additional slaughtering capacity in Queensland.

268,Mr ANTHONY,BLMR SPONSORED RESEARCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (b) and (c) The Prime Minister has on a number of occasions conversed and corresponded with members of the RSL National Executive concerning measures to assist Vietnam veterans. Because these consultations were conducted on a confidential basis and any disclosure would constitute a breach of that confidence I do not intend divulging details. Vietnam Veterans: Departmental Officers Involved in Claims (Question No. 4855) Mr Holding asked the Prime Minister, upon to retailers or wholesalers in notice, on 18 August 1982: Further to his answer to question No. 4470 (Hansard, 18 August 1982, page 555), (a) How many officers of his Department have been involved in matters arising out of Vietnam veterans' claims (b) what are the classifications of those officers and (c) what are the matters in which they were involved.",203
269,Mr ANTHONY,BLMR SPONSORED RESEARCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (b) and (c) In addition to the information provided to the honourable member by Mr Fraser on 18 August 1982 (Question No. 4470, House of Representatives Hansard, page 555) the involvement of officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in matters arising out of Vietnam veterans' claims has been connected with handling correspondence from individual veterans, attending meetings, and preparing advice on matters for the consideration of the Government. Youth Training Schemes Mrs Darling asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 19 August 1982: Did the Federal Government underspend its 1981-82 allocation for youth training schemes by nearly 20 per cent; if (a) why and (b) did this have the effect of placing 60,000 fewer people in the scheme than was intended. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The original 1981-82 allocation for the Youth Training Program was underspent by about 20 per cent. The reduced expenditure resulted from a shortfall of about $11.4 million for the Special Youth Employment Training Program (SYETP) and a shortfall of about lowances under the School to Work Transition Program. In the case ofSYETP, there cause of the reduced number of available vacancies in the labour market. Difficulties were also experienced in estimating the usage of Extended SYETP which was only introduced in February 1981. In the case of reduced expenditure under the Transition lowance, there was an increase of 2,700 in the number of young people assisted in 1981-82 compared to .1980-81. A greater increase had been expected. However, States did not respond as quickly as expected to the Commonwealth's offer to make the Transition Allowance available to certain State funded Transition courses. It is also considered that many young people many not have been attracted to Transition courses because of relatively high charges for books and equipment levied for some courses. To offset the inhibiting effects of books and equipment costs, a lump sum payment of $30 is being provided to each eligible trainee;n 1982-83. It should also be noted that youth training programs was re-allocated within the Department's global vote for employment and training programs. At the time of the 1981-82 Budget, $202.9 million was allocated to this vote, while actual expenditure was $206.4 million. (b) There were 23,500 fewer approvals than originally targetted for under both Programs, not 60.000.

Building Tradesmen: Relocation Assistance Dr Blewett asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 9 September 1982: (I) Has the Government ever provided relocation assistance to a person who was sacked by an employer in one State and then re-employed by the same employer in another State; if so, which States and what industries and occupations were involved. (2) How many building tradesmen were relocated out of Tasmania to other States under the Relocation Assistance Scheme in 1981-82. (3) What proportion of building tradesmen left Tasmania under the Relocation Assistance Scheme as compared to other occupational groups. (4) How many employers have started equal employment opportunity programs for women since the National Labour Consultative Council guidelines were issued. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Without devoting a disproportionate researching the thousands of the inception of the Relocation possible to provide an answer ever, such a situation is possible sistance Scheme is primarily oriented to assisting the individual job-seeker in overcoming his employment problems, provided that he meets all the eligibility criteria of the Scheme. These are, essentially, that the applicant cannot be placed locally, and that the job to which he wishes to move cannot be filled by a local applicant. At the same time the CES does not provide assistance under RAS if the employer normally bears such costs, as many do for skilled and senior staff in short supply. (2) 73 Building tradesmen were relocated out of Tasmania to other States under the Relocation Assistance Scheme in 1981-82. (3) Building tradesmen comprised 32.2 per cent of the 227 relocatees who left Tasmania Scheme in 1981-82. (4) The Department has no number of employers who have started equal opportunity programs. The 'Guidelines for Employers, Equal Employment Opportunities for Women' provides information from which equal employment opportunity procedures suited to the needs of individual employers can be developed. It has been distributed widely and a number of employers have approached the Department for information and assistance. Since those who have introduced equal employment opportunity programs may not have done so solely as a result of the guidelines, it would be difficult guidelines in this way. A number establishing a program and close liaison is being maintained with representatives of these employers by officers of the Department's Women's Bureau.

A private line connected to the PABX does not offer the same level of accessibility to the Minister exchange line. New South Wales-A thorough review of the allocation of lines is being undertaken to determine if all private exchange lines are still required. South Australia and Western Australia-No. The exchange lines afford privacy and confidentiality. They also overcome urgent communication problems when PABX facilities are congested. TasmaniaNo. Because the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service is located within Repatriation General Hospital, Hobart, there is a need to retain its separate identity acy reasons. National Women's Advisory Council Mr Beazley asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 23 September 1982: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the widespread concern among women's groups in Western Australia over the failure to appoint an additional Western Australian woman to the National Women's Advisory Council following the completion of the term of Mrs K. French. (2) Has his attention also been drawn to concern that the remaining representative, who is located in a north-western town, may not be able to represent adequately the views, nor be in touch with the experience of the 80% of Western Australian women who live in Perth and the south-west ofW.A. (3) Will he appoint an additional Western Australian woman to cover any deficiencies in representation. Mr Mc Veigh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) At II October 1982 I had received three representations expressing concern at the lack of a Perth representative on the National Women's Advisory Council. (2) It is not possible at anyone time to represent all centres or regions in Australia. This does not mean that the Council is not in touch with the views of women from all over Australia. In making appointments to the Council the Government seeks to ensure a balance of points of view and representation of different groups. The balance changes from year to year so that over a period there is comprehensive representation. At the same time the Government looks to the Council to put the views of women in all sections of the community to it. Council members consult extensively with women throughout the country. Mrs Robyn Crane, of Dampier, the Western Australian member of the Council, brings to it experience of geographic isolation, of life in mining towns, of local government and the provision of child care services. I am advised that Mrs Crane frequently visits Perth and expect that she and other members of the Council will ensure that women who live in the southeast of the State have access to them. (3) The Government believes that the twelve members of the National Women's Advisory Council reflect a breadth and variety of experience and a balanced representation of views, ages and lifestyles which will enable them to respond to the needs and aspirations of all Australian women. Australian Police Medal and of security as does a private (Question No. 5197) Mr Maher asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 23 September 1982: What action is being taken to establish an Australian Police Medal to replace the Queen's Police Medal, which is no longer issued in some Australian States. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Queen's Police Medal is awarded by Her Majesty The for privQueen on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Government and State Governments to officers for special service in a police force, including conspicuous gallantry or merit and distinguished service over a prolonged period. Other representations concerning honours and awards in (Question No. 5194) Australia are presently being considered. Complex issues are involved which will take some considerable time to examine. Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Question No. 5253) Mr Holding asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 13 October 1982: Is he able to state what (a) agricultural and (b) veterinary chemicals have been (i) banned, (ii) restricted (and with what conditions) and (iii) cleared for unrestricted use in (a) the USA., (B) Britain, (C) Canada, (D) Finland, (E) France, (F) the Federal Republic of Germany, (G) the Netherlands, (H), italy, (I) Sweden, (1) Switzerland, (K) New Zealand, (L) Mexico and (M) Papua New Guinea; ifn,ot, why not. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In 12 of the 13 countries listed, Papua New Guinea being the exception, all agricultural and veterinary chemicals have to be registered with appropriate authorities prior to being offered for sale. This requirement applies to each separate proprietary formulation including mixtures and novel preparations. There are well over 1,000 separate major agricultural chemical active constitutents and over 700 separate major veterinary chemical active constituents together with many minor active constituents in general widespread use in the industrialised countries named. These may be available in many separate formulations including aerosol, bait, band, capsule, collodial suspension, dip, dispersible powder, drench, dressing, dust, emulsifiable concentrate, emulsion, encapsulated granule, feed additive, fine granule, flowable, fumigant, granule, injectable, jetting fluid, liquid concentrate, low-volume spray, paste, pellet, powder, prill seed dressing, slow-release granule, slurry, solution, space spray, smoke generator, suspension concentrate, tablet, tracking powder, ultralow-volume spray or wettable powder form. Combinations are often prepared of two or more active constituents. Different strength preparations are commonly produced to meet particular needs. In Australia there are over 10,000 separate agricultural chemical products registered. In the USA the number exceeds 60,000. The number of veterinary chemical products, though somewhat less, is still extremely high. Each proprietary product, if permitted to be sold, is registered for specific uses with limitations, restraints, prohibitions and conditions of use appropriate to the particular product. These restrictions do not necessarily apply equally in all countries where the product, or something similar, is registered. Some products, including many active constituents, are not available in some countries for a variety of reasons such as: (I) the pest, disease or condition for which the product is indicated does not occur; (2) there is no commercial moting the sale of such a product; (3) the cost of the chemical exceeds the benefit to be gained from its use; (4) agricultural practice and animal husbandry are not compatible with the use of the chemical; (5) government policy does not favour the use of a particular chemical. In any event, agricultural and veterinary chemicals are generally not available for They may be used only in accordance with registered label directions. In the light of the knowledge it will be appreciated why it is not possible to provide the by the honourable member. Use of Herbicides in South East Asia Mr Holding asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 14 October 1982: (I) Further to the Minister's answer to question No. 4574 (Hansard, 19 August 1982, page 799), (a) did the Department of Veterans' Affairs provide a copy or copies of Operation Ranch Hand: The Air Force and Herbicides in South East Asia 19761-1971 to the Parliamentary Library; if so, when, and how many were provided, (b) has the Department been advised of strong demand for this publication by the Library and, further, of a request for extra copies; if so, when did the Department receive that advice and what was the response, and (c) will the Minister order the Department to make arrangements for the urgent supply of extra copies of this publication to the Library; if not, why not. (2) Can the Minister state whether this publication was initially released in the United States of America in the form of more than 500 double-spaced, typewritten pages following a lawsuit brought under the US. Freedom of Information Act by the National Veterans Task Force on Agent Orange. (3) Can the Minister also state whether 20 pages of the document in its original format have been withheld by the US. State Department on the grounds that their release would cause identifiable damage to national security and adversely affect the United States current and future relations with foreign countries - Trade Practices Commission (4) Is the Minister able to state whether further legal action is pending, or has been taken, in respect of the release of those 20 pages. Mr Thomson-The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) (a) The Department of Veterans' Affairs forwarded a copy of the book Operation Ranch Hand: The Air Force and Herbicides in South-East Asia 1961-1971 to the Parliamentary Library on 22 September 1982; (b) Advice was received towards the end of September caller was advised that additional copies had been requested from the US. and would be forwarded to the Library as soon as received. The caller then advised my Department that, of its own volition, the Parliamentary Library had requested five copies from the US. The Library made no other request; (c) No. My Department has already taken action to obtain additional copies of the publication which will be forwarded to the Library when received. The acquisition of Parliamentary Library stock is outside the province of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. interest in developing and pro(2) Yes. (3) I am informed that twenty pages were withheld inter alia on national security grounds at the direction of the Department of State. (4) I understand that the Court of Appeal of the District of Columbia has recently ruled in favour of the State Department and the Office of Air Force History in respect of a suit brought by veterans' groups challenging the decision to withhold the 20 pages. unrestricted use in any country.

(2) Of the 148 staff mentioned in the Report as having been declared surplus, where are the 100 officers who have been placed. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Public Service Board has informed me that of the 48 declared surplus staff who were unplaced at 30 June 1982, 10 have since been redeployed, 9 have separated voluntarily from the Public Service and 29 remained available for redeployment at 22 October 1982. (2) Page 69 of the Public Service Board's 1981-82 Annual Report indicated that at 30 June 1982, of the 100 surplus staff concerned who had been declared to the Board during 1981-82, only 59 had been redeployed at that time, 40 had separated voluntarily from the Service and one had appealed successfully against declaration and was therefore no longer available for redeployment. The Public Service Board has informed me that the 59 staff who had been redeployed by 30 June 1982 were placed in the following departments and authorities:Department of Administrative Services I Attorney-General's Department 2 I Department of Aviation 6 Department of Communications I Department of Defence . 10 Department of Education I Department of Employment and Industrial Relations 9 Department of Finance . . . . .

(2) What experiments and trials have shown prospects of being commercially and practically successful. (3) Have experiments and trials centred on robotics and chemicals shown prospects for success. (4) How many experiments and trials have taken place and what has been the cost and level of success of each. (5) Did the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) express interest in a system of wool harvesting proposed to it by Mr W. Geary. (6) Did the A WC provide Mr Geary with funds for the development of the system; of so, what sum was advanced and what was the result. (7) Has the A WC continued to develop the system proposed by Mr Geary without any further payments or contacts with Mr Geary. (8) What was the basis for the A WC severing its relationship with Mr Geary and yet continuing to develop his system.",211
275,Mr HUNT,INGSCHEME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The wool harvesting experiments, with which the Australian Wool Corporation has been concerned, lie in the areas of:(a) Modifications to existing shearing equipment; e.g. improved drives for handpieces, improved combs and cutters, improved shearing shed design. (b) Modified shearing systems; e.g. restraint shearing, chain or sequence shearing, (c) Novel wool severance methods; e.g. chemical and biological defieecing, automated mechanical shearing, laser, cryogenic, ultrasonic These covers some ninety identifiable projects financed since 1973. More detail is provided in the answer to question number 5038. (2) Practical trials and costing harvesting costs in conventional shearing can be significantly reduced by improved shearing shed layout, the use of self pinning presses and the use of simplified classing procedures. Basic engineering studies of handpiece, comb and cutter materials, coatings, treatment and design, and the use of special light weight electric motor drives have also given promise of commercial and practical success. (3) Yes, they are continuing. (4) It would be premature to attempt to assess levels cess. The funds allocated to the two A WC programs this year were: Automated mechanical shearing $695,589 8 Chemical defieecing $173,250 I (5) Yes. 59 (6) Yes, $57,387 was paid to Mr Geary towards the cost of designing/constructing certain defined equipment which was to be completed no later than Arpil 1978. Wool Harvesting In all cases no equipment was made available by Mr Geary (Question No. 5276) for inspection in accordance with requirements of the agreements entered into by him with the A WC and the Commonwealth. In July 1978 Mr Geary advised the Corporation in writing that he was unable to proceed as agreed. The agreement with Mr Geary was terminated on 25 October 1978 by the A WC and the Commonwealth. (7) The A WC did not continue to develop the system proposed by Mr Geary. (8) See answers to 6 and 7 above.

Visual Display Units: Department of Science and Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 14 October 1982: How many visual display units were in use in the Minister's Department and statutory authorities which fall within the jurisdiction of the Minister for each of the last ten years.

(2) From which countries are these foreign pensions paid and how many Australian pensioners receive a pension from and Commerce each of these countries. (Questiop No. 5314) (3) How often are Veterans' Affairs payments adjusted to take into account the conversion rate used to calculate the Australian equivalent of overseas pensions. (4) What were the savings to the Government over the 12 month period to September 1982 from applying the conversion rate to overseas pensions. (5) What was the cost to the Government over the 12 month period to September 1982 of adjusting Veterans' Affairs payments in line with the conversion rate used to calculate payments. Mr Thomson-The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) 2652. Other Australian Repatriation pensioners may also be entitled to overseas pensions. These pensions are paid directly to the pensioner by the overseas government. In cases where service pensioners, for example, also receive an overseas pension, the Department adjusts entitlement when notified of additional income as required by section 96 of the Repatriation Act 1920. In addition, adjustments may be made as a result of periodic reviews conducted by Branch Offices of the Department. (2) United Kingdom 2509; New Zealand 126; Hong Kong Technology 9; Malaysia 8. (Question No. 5326) (3) The Department of Veterans' Affairs performs agency functions on behalf of the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Malaysia and pays pensions to people now resident in Australia on behalf of these governments. Acting on their advice, Veterans' Affairs varies the amounts of the overseas pension payable to pensioners in line with exchange rate fluctuations. This is done when there has been a change of 5 cents or more in the dollar. The number of adjustments made depends upon the fluctuation of a particular currency. In the case of the pound sterling, there has been one adjustment in 1982, two in 1981 and five in 1980. When overseas pensions are varied, Australian pensions are adjusted concurrently. NSC AIMS (4) Figures are not available for the administrative cost of adjusting pensions in the process described in (3).

(2) Is the Minister able to say whether either the Taxation Office or the Department of Social Security can offer pensioners any literature on their income tax obligations. (3) What steps will the Minister take to ensure that information will be made available to pensioners to assist them in assessing whether they have to pay tax and, more particularly, to assist them in ordering their financial year so that they will not have to worry about lodging a tax return at the end of the year. Mr Wilson-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) I am aware that some pensioners find confusing the relationship between the income limits for full pension entitlement (which are $30 a week for a single pensioner and $50 a week for a married couple) and the amount of income they can have apart from their pension before they become liable to pay tax (which, in 1982-83, is about $16 a week for a single age pensioner and about $31 a week for an age pensioner couple where one partner has private income apart from the pension). However, this confusion does not arise from any lack of coordination between my own department and the Taxation Office. (2) My department has recently produced an information sheet on 'Pensioners and Income Tax', which has been widely distributed, including to all federal members and senators. In addition, I should like to draw the honourable member's attention to my response to a Question without Notice in the Senate on 10.11.82 (ref. Hansard p. 2036) when I confirmed that my department is preparing a more comprehensive information leaflet for pensioners, which will include information on taxation. (3) To assist pensioners and beneficiaries who prefer to meet any tax liability they may have by fortnightly contributions rather than paying an annual tax bill, my department has for many years offered the ductions from Social Security payments. This service is clearly advertised in information material relating to pensions and benefits and in the special (2) above. Brisbane Airport Redevelopment Mrs Darling asked the Minister for Aviation, upon notice, on 19 October 1982: Has his attention been drawn to the Public Works Committee report on the Remainder of Works of Phase One of the Brisbane Airport Redevelopment project; if so, what is the Government's response to the committee's recommendation that proposals to upgrade the proposed general aviation runway to take commercial jet aircraft be abandoned. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government has no plans to upgrade the proposed general aviation runway at Brisbane Airport to take commercial jet aircraft. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works (PWC) report did not recommend abandonment of such beplans. The PWC concluded, at previous hearings, that a commercial jet standard cross-wind runway is unnecessary. It considered that the evidence submitted by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and the Civilian Air Operations Officers' Association of Australia, at the recent hearing, does not provide justification for it to alter that view.

Mr Thomson-The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) (a) The Review of Commonwealth Functions made the following decisions relating to the activities of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and other authorities/enterprises in my portfolio: the level of staff for the Defence Service Homes Scheme be reduced; (b) transfer of functions to the the number of artificial limbs and appliances contracted out for private manufacture be increased; and maintenance deductions under section 49 of the Repatriation Act be abolished and control over these pensions be handed over to the States; (b) Agreement was reached with the Public Service Board that the staff level of the Defence Service Homes Corporation would be reduced by 27. The reduction achieved by 30 June 1982 was 36. The number of commercially manufactured limbs increased by 876 or 76.4 per cent from 1980-81 to 1981-82.

(2) (a) The decision to increase the number of artificial limbs and appliances contracted out for private manufacture has resulted in a direct transfer of functions to the private tor. In October 1981 approval was given to increase the number of commercial firms contracted to supply these aids. This action has resulted in the increase referred to in I (b).

Some minor staff savings have been made as a result of the repeal of section 49 of the Repatriation Act but precise figuring of the type sought on savings an unjustifiable commitment of resources.

Brisbane Airport: Traffic Controllers Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 20 October 1982: (I) What is the average number air traffic controller during normal peak periods at Brisbane Airport. (2) What was the average number being handled in October 1981. (3) What is the acceptable demand that can be placed on air traffic controllers before exists under the Air Safety Regulations. Mr Fife- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Approach/departures (North)-25, Approach/departures (South)-15, Arrivals (North)-17, Arrivals (South)--17, Sector Control (North)-18, Sector Control (South)-17, Control Tower-35. The numbers of aircraft are based on October 1982 records and represent the daily peak week. (2) The data from which the average number of aircraft being handled in October 1981 could be calculated is not available. It is known, however, handled at Brisbane from October 1981 to October 1982 increased by approximately 4%. (3) No criteria is specified. However, Airways Operations Instructions states ""The radar controller shall not accept consectrol of more aircraft than he is able to control without overloading, or of more than could be safely passed to procedural separation in the event of equipment failure or other emergency"". The number of aircraft that can be handled safely at any time is dependent on many factors-examples of which are - weather conditions illness to States since that date; - if an emergency situation exists - the type of operation i.e. transiting aircraft can present more problems than those arriving or departing - procedures being used i.e. radar or procedural; visual or instrument approaches - complexity of the airspace management arrangements - amount of co-ordination involved decision in relation to that or- whether or not ""on the job"" training is being carried out. The responsibility of assessing a safe 'loading' rests with the air traffic controller on duty. The flow controller assists in this regard by planning the traffic flow to achieve optimum use of the available airspace and the aerodrome, taking into account, inter alia, controller workload, thereby ensuring that the system is not overloaded. cannot be provided without Answer to Question on Defoliants (Question No. 5417) Mr Holding asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 20 October 1982: has been previously explained in When may I expect an answer to Question No. 4431 which first appeared on the Notice Paper of 21 April 1982.",221

280,Mr ANTHONY,I I I,"The answer to the honourable it is deemed a safety problem member's question is as follows: I refer the honourable member to the answer to Question No. 4559. Salaries of Engineers Employed by Telecom Australia (Question No_ 5428) Mr John Brown asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 20 October hour air traffic averaged for one 1982: (I) Is it a fact that the salaries of engineers employed by Telecom Australia are well below those in the New South Wales State Public Service. that the number of aircraft (2) Has the Public Service Board admitted that engineer salaries in Telecom are too low. (3) Is that starting salary for a draughtsman in Telecom higher than the starting salary for a qualified professional engineer. (4) Was the apparent anomaly by the Public Service Board over 5 months ago and has no action to remedy the situation been taken since. (5) Has this failure of Telecom to perform its statutory duty led to overwhelming dissatisfaction and frustation among engineers in Telecom resulting recently in industrial action which may delay some major engineering projects. (6) What action will he or his Department take to remedy this situation.",222
281,Mr NA BROWN,I I I,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission, is as follows: (I) to (4), (6) The position was that there were some anomalies between the salaries of engineers and other similar areas of public employment. Offers of salary increases for Engineers were made by Telecom and were accepted by the relevant staff organisations, the Professional Officers' Association and the Association of Professional Engineers, Australia. The appropriate awards were varied by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in Melbourne on 20 October 1982, the same day that this question was asked. (5) There was no industrial action by Engineers in Telecom that would have delayed any major engineering projects. Australian Tobacco Growing Industry Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 21 October 1982: (I) Has his attention been drawn to growing concern with the Australian tobacco growing industry that sales of Australian leaf may be prejudiced as a result of monopolistic chasing and marketing arrangements arising from the effective merger in Europe in 1981 of the Rothmans and Philip Morris groups. (2) Will this merger inevitably result in a substantial lessening in real competition in the Australian market: if so, will he request the Treasurer to have the flow-on in Australia from this merger examined by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Trade Practices Commission, and advise the House of the results of that examination. (3) In the meantime, will grower that the Government will take whatever steps are necessary to protect tobacco leaf farmers from foreign monopolies by effectively stopping the imminent consummation of the merger as it affects Australian growers and consumers.",223
282,Mr HUNT,I I I,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Australian tobacco growing industry has not advised me that it considers that sales of Australian leaf may be prejudiced as a result of an agreement in April 1981 under which Philip Morris Inc. acquired shares in Rothmans Tobacco (Holdings) Ltd. (2) Available information, including data on shareholdings in subsidiary and associated companies of the two groups and the outcome of Australian tobacco leaf sales in 1981 and 1982, provide no indication that competition in Australia between Rothmans of Pall Mall (Australia) Ltd and Philip Morris (Australia) Ltd has lessened since the agreement mentioned in (I). The share transactions under that agreement provide no basis for referring the matter to either the Foreign Investment Review Board or the Trade Practices Commission. outlined in part (3) created (3) The marketing of Australian tobacco leaf is assured under the Tobacco Stabilisation Plan in which the full participation of each of the manufacturing companies is a key element. The marketing arrangements for the current Plan, under which the 1982 sales have already been completed, have not been eroded by the share transactions referred to in (I). Withdrawal of Passports (Question No_ 5456) Mr Jacobi asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 26 October 1982: (I) Will he confirm receipt of my telegram, dated to September 1982, in view of my earlier communication to the Attorney-General of 27 August 1982 and in particular my speech in the House on 29 March 1979, with reference to possible amendments to the Passports Amendment Bill (Hansard. page 1356). (2) Will he, as a matter of urgency, discuss with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General what steps he will take to ensure that persons named in the Costigan Report and the MCCabe-Lafranchi Report who have been involved in tax avoidance and evasion, and in other alleged illegal activities, and against whom there appears to be substantial evidence, are not allowed to leave Australia in order to escape possible criminal proceedings. (3) Is it a fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has discretion in this matter as conferred upon him in sections 7-9 of (Question No. 5446) the Passports Act 1938, and in particular, sub-section 8 (l). (4) In view of the enormity of the tax loss as revealed in the Costigan Report and the MCCabe-Lafranchi Report, will he take immediate steps to revert to the policy which applied prior to the statement of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 7 March 1979 (Hansard. page 709), that the Minpur- ister for Foreign Affairs could withhold or have withdrawn passports if State Corporate Affairs Commissions or company officers reported that an investigation was in progress; if not, why not. (5) Will he take further action to ensure through the Treasurer that these persons do not attempt to transfer assets out of Australia pending such proceedings. (6) Is it a fact that failure to take this action could result in taxpayers incurring enormous costs for extradition proceedings. he assure the Australian tobacco",223
283,Mr ANTHONY,I I I,"the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) to (6) In reply to the honourable member's telegram of to Septemberr 1982, the Prime Minister noted that it had been copied to the Attorney-General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and referred to the answer he gave in the House on 9 September 1982 on these matters. If people have been named in particular reports as participating in illegal schemes, until prosecutions are launched they still have their full rights as Australian citizens. The then Minister for Foreign Affairs stated in the House of Representatives on 7 March 1979 (Hansard. page 708) that the practice of withholding passports of persons suspected of offences would be discontinued, in recognition of the Government's policy relating to human rights and the view that the Passports Act should neither be used as an extension of the judicial system nor be expected to impose more restraint on an individual than a court would be prepared to impose. Where persons named or referred Report or the MCCabe-Lafranchi Report have been arrested and charged with offences against Commonwealth Law. application has been successfully made for bail to be subject to conditions designed to prevent the ing Australia. Clause 16 of the National Crimes Commission Bill 1982 when enacted would allow the Commission to apply to a judge of the Federal Court for an order for delivery of a perBemrose Cleaning Service son's passport to the Commission where the judge was satisfied that the person had been summoned as a witness before the Commission and his evidence could be of particular significance, and there were reasonable grounds for believing that he intended to leave Australia. The person concerned would have a right to show cause why the order should not be made. The Prime Minister has already taken up with the Treasurer the matter of preventing monies being sent overseas for other than legitimate purposes without creating serious impediments to legitimate transactions. Overseas Travel by Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations or Minister's Staff Mr Morris asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 26 October 1982: (I) On what occasions has the Minister or members of the Minister's staff travelled abroad since I January 1982 to the date of preparation of the answer to this question.

There is a possibility that may incorporate smalI sealed capacitors which contain PCBs. (2) Yes. (3) Under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations the importation of polychlorinated biphenyls, terphenyls and other polyphenyls and goods containing those substances is prohibited unless the permission of the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been granted. This regulation has been in force since 1973. The normal Customs import control procedures exist. (4) I am advised that as to contain PCBs have been identified in use in the Department the questions of storage and disposal do not arise. (5) No. (6) Officers of the Australian Customs Service are aware that PCBs are covered by the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Legislation and Customs General Orders list substances known to be covered.

Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) There are no materials and equipment currently in use in my Department or bodies under my control known to contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). However, the Adelaide depot of my Department's Transport and Storage Division does hold a transformer believed to contain PCBs. This transformer is held on behalf of the Department of Transport and Construction. (2) A summary of information about polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which was prepared by the Department of Home Affairs and the Environment has been brought to my attention. (3) If there is a need to store or transport dangerous goods (including PCBs) and my Department is advised of the exact nature of the goods, local and State ordinances are adhered to and the manufacturer's specifications for storage and transport of dangerous goods would also be complied with. Additionally. the recommendations laid down in the Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail (as published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. P 2 of 24 February 1982) would also be adhered to. (4) The Adelaide depot of my Department's Transport and Storage Division holds a transformer believed to contain PCBs. I understand that the original owner of the transformer, the Department of Transport and Construction. will drain the transformer and arrange destruction of the PCBs and disposal of the transformer remains. (5) No. (6) No. As my Department does not currently use, or contemplate the use of material and equipment containing PCBs, I consider it unnecessary to bring to the notice of employees under my control, the dangers of PCBs at this stage. Allegations of Dimethoate Contamination of Mr Holding asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 27 October 1982: Following the industrial accident which occurred at the Nufarm Chemicals Pty Ltd plant at Laverton, Victoria, at about 3 a.m. on II July 1978, did (a) the Minister or the Minister's predecessors; (b) the Minister's Department or any body under the Minister's control and (c) any other body; if so. which ones, make any investigation of (i) allegations of dimethoate contamination of meat destined for export which was being processed and packed at the meat processing factory in the immediate vicinity of the Nufarm factory, and further allegations that an export ing testing which demonstrated the dimethoate levels in the meat were in breach of export requirements, and (ii) allegations that the contaminated meat was later sold on the domestic market; if not, will the Minister now undertake to make investigations of those allegations; if the Minister will not do so, why not.",223
284,Mr ANTHONY,I I I,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (i) No; (ii) No. (b) (i) No; (ii) No. (c) (i) and (ii) I am not aware of these allegations having been investigated by any other body but I refer the honourable member to the reply given by the Minister for Primary Industry to Question No. 5555 on conducting an investigation into these allegations. Qantas Airways Ltd: Sponsorship Mr Morris asked the Minister for Aviation, upon notice, on 28 October 1982: (I) Is he able to say what was the total cost to Qantas Airways Ltd of its sponsorship of the recent round-the-world solo helicopter trip by Mr Dick Smith. (2) Is he also able to say what are the specific benefits tas Airways Ltd expects to gain from the sponsorship of Mr Smith's flight. Mr Fife- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Qantas has advised that its sponsorship of Mr Smith's promotional venture involves the provision of travel credits valued at $50,000 in return for specified advertising, identification and publicity services. The arrangement between Qantas and Mr Smith is essentiallya matter for the company's own commercial judgment. I am informed that the arrangement was strongly recommended by the company's advertising agency-Monahan, Dayman and Adams-on the basis that the value of the publicity that would accrue to the company from Mr Smith's flight appeared to provide a fair and equitable return for the services received by Mr Smith. (2) Qantas has also advised that the agreement with Mr Smith specifies that Qantas be identified prominently and positively as a major sponsor: on the Smith helicopter in a book to be published by Mr Smith at the completion of his journey in television programs and all interviews and media releases issued by Mr Smith Meat and on any displays and promotions associated with the flight. (Question No. 5554) Qantas believes that it has achieved excellent publicity through its sponsorship of Mr Smith's flight. The company considers that publicity already provided on the first two-thirds of Mr Smith's journey demonstrates a favourable return on the services it has provided and justifies the company's decision to sponsor Mr Smith's round-the-world helicopter flight. Review of Major Functional Areas at Airports (Question No. 5596) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Aviation, upon notice, on 28 October 1982: licence was refused follow(I) What information is he able to provide on the specific results of the Review of Major Functional Areas: Airports, referred to in Administrative Circular 82/35 of 23 July 1982. (2) What are the implications for the maintenance of Air Safety Standards arising from the rearrangements and cut backs to his Department and the Department of Transport and Construction referred to in the circular. (3) What discussions have been held with the relevant unions concerned on each of the items referred to in the circular, and on what dates were those discussions held. (4) Is it a fact that the Review has resulted in a decrease of staff morale within his Department and has been the cause of considerable unease amongst its personnel. (5) What services are being considered for termination and what are the consequences of doing so, taking account of staff, financial and material costs as well as the sources of revenue. (6) Which standards of service and which services are being considered for reduction. (7) What action does he propose to take to cope with the (Question No. 5592) inability of his Department to maintain levels of air safety. Mr Fife- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I am advised that this Review is still in progress and hence no results are yet available. The Review's terms of reference, which were set out in Administrative Circular 82/35 Qanhave been amended to make them consistent with a relevant decision of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. The terms of reference now read 'to examine the scope for contracting maintenance of major civil aerodromes'. (2) None-air safety standards will not be affected by the Review. (3) A meeting was held with representatives of the Association of Drafting, supervisory and Technical Employees (ADSTE) on I November 1982 at which Departmental officers outlined progress in a number of reviews, including the Management Review of the Airports Functions. (4) At the meeting referred to in (3) the union made reference to unease among certain personnel concerning a review separate from the Management Review of the Airports function. The ADSTE has been advised that any conclusions of the Airports function review which might affect the interests of ADSTE members will be discussed with the Association. (5) No services are being considered for termination. (6) As the Review is not yet completed, I can give no indication. (7) There are no grounds ment cannot maintain current levels of air safety. Greek Language Program at North Ainslie Primary School, Canberra Dr Theophanous asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 28 October 1982: (1) Has a decision been made by the A.C.T. Schools Authority not to continue funding of the Greek Language Program provided at the North Ainslie Primary School. (2) If so, what is the Minister's justification for the discontinuation of this excellent language education program. (3) Is the Minister prepared to reconsider that decision. (4) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the difficulties of providing language education in Australian schools under current budgetary constraints imposed by the Government. (5) If so, what steps will available to meet the increasing demands for bilingual education, foreign language education and other language education programs in schools. Mr Fife-The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) It is A.C.T. Schools Authority policy to allocate supplementary teaching staff positions to selected primary schools for a limited period of two to three years for development of language programs. North Ainslie Primary School has already had a supplementary teacher, renewed on an annual basis, for its Greek Language Program for more than three years. Along with three similar schools, it was informed in December 1981 that allocation of supplementary staffing would be renewed for 1982 but could not be assumed beyond that year. In fact North Ainslie Primary School has been offered 0.5 supplementary staffing for 1983 provided that it acknowledges this as a final allocation. (2) Authority policy provides supplementary staffing for a curriculum development phase of two to three years during which the school should recruit suitable language teachers within its normal staffing entitlement. This enables the program to continue when the drawn for allocation to another primary school. Schools such as Wanniassa Primary School have successfully integrated language teachers into normal staffing entitlements; North Ainslie Primary School has not so far done so. The responsibility for continuing or discontinuing the Greek Language Program rests with North Ainslie Primary School. (3) No. It would be inappropriate to change a policy for one school when other schools have developed programs successfully within the Authority's guidelines. (4) & (5) I am aware of issues in the area oflanguage education. The Government provides financial assistance for language teaching in Australian schools by means of the Commonwealth Schools Commission general recurrent grants, and also more specifically under several programs to meet particular needs: (i) the Ethnic Schools Program provides $30 per annum to ethnic school authorities for each student attending after-hours classes, or insertion classes in regular day schools. (ii) under the Multicultural Education Program, the funding ($4,435,000 in 1983) is spent on community language projects. for suggesting that the Depart(iii) $64 million is being provided in 1982 for special English language assistance for children from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds, including new arrivals. The Government seeks to keep itself informed on the needs (Question No. 5600) of the community in relation to language education: (i) The Commonwealth Schools Commission has recently engaged Professor W. J. Campbell, Professor of Education at the University of Queensland, to carry out a comprehensive review of the Commonwealth ESL Program, including current arrangements for new arrivals. (ii) The Department of Education is seeking responses from interested groups and individuals to a paper it published in May 1982, entitled ""Towards a National Language Policy"". The paper canvasses a range of important issues in language education. In addition the honourable senator will be aware of the current inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, on 'The Development and Implementation of a Co-ordinated Language Policy for Australia'. My Department is supporting the Committee in its inquiry. the Minister take to make funds Queensland Government Lear Fan Jet (Question No. 5608) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Aviation, upon notice, on 9 November 1982: (l) Is he able to say in respect of the new technology lightweight Lear Fan Jet recently ordered by the Queensland Government for use by the Premier of Queensland whether certification of the aircraft has been granted by the Federal Aviation Authority of the United States of America or his Department; if not, why not, and when is it expected that the aircraft will be certified in Australia. (2) Will the aircraft be required to have a 2-pilot crew for operation in Australia; if not, why not. (3) From what aerodromes in Queensland will the aircraft be authorised to operate. (4) Of what materials is the aircraft to be constructed and when is it expected to be in service in Australia. (5) How many passengers and crew is it expected the aircraft will be able to transport on non-stop flights from Brisbane to Townsville. supplementary staffing is withMr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Learfan Limited has designed and flown two prototype aircraft known as the Learfan. The aircraft has not been certified in the United States of America or Australia because the applicant company has not yet demonstrated compliance with the relevant certification requirements. My Department is unable to state when the aircraft is likely to be certified in Australia since there is presently no basis upon which a forecast of this nature could be made. (2) The minimum requirement is a matter for determination during the process of airworthiness certification, and no forecast can be made in this regard for the same reason as indicated in the answer to the first part of the honourable member's question. (3) The aerodromes from which the aircraft may be authorised to operate would be determined during subsequent consideration of any application for inclusion of the aeroplane type on operators' air service licences. (4) The aircraft is constructed of many materials, including graphite epoxy fibrous composite material which is used extensively in the primary structure. I am informed that some Australian operators have expressed an intention to operate the aircraft in Australia as soon as Australian certification be obtained. (5) The limited information available to my Department about the Learfan is that it is designed to be a 5/6 passenger executive aircraft intended to altitude and near jet speeds. ance capabilities of the aircraft until the certification process has been completed. National Rehabilitation and Compensation Mr Jacobi asked the Minister asslstmg the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 9 November 1982: Will the Minister bring up to date the information provided on 18 November 1981 (Hansard, page 3097) in answer to my question about: (a) financial aspects of the proposed National Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme, (b) discussions on the scheme with the State Governments and the insurance industry, and (c) increases in premiums for workers' compensation and compulsory third party insurance. Mr Wilson: The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) On the basis of the figures Insurance Commissioner's publication ""Selected Statistics on the General Insurance Industry for the year ended 30 June 1981 "", the updated figures are: Direct premiums Benefits (including legal, hospital and medical costs) Administration expenses and commISSIOn Separate figures for legal and hospital and medical costs are not published and must be estimated. If the ratio implicit in the reports of the Working Parties of the National Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme are applied to the actual amounts paid in benefits in 1980-81, the figures for legal and hospital and medical costs would have been: Legal (excluding solicitor / client costs) Hospital and Medical (b) There have been no further discussions between the Commonwealth, States and the insurance industry on national compensation proposals to those notified in answer to Question No. 6053 of 22 May 1980. (c) Using the same basis as in the answers to Questions No. 1748 (Hansard, 20 October 1977, pages 2301-2), 6053 (Hansard, 22 May 1980, pages 3170-1) and 2706 (Hansard, 18 November 1981, pages 3089-90), the percentage increases can in premiums between 1974-75 and 1980-81 was: Direct Earned Premiums Premiums fly over long distances at high However, the in-service perform% % will not be known accurately Workers' Compensation 62.4 61.1 Compulsory Third Party 154.1 221.6 Scheme (Question No. 5611) National Estate Grants Program (Question No. 5613) Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 9 November 1982: (I) Did the Prime Minister state in an address on 20 June 1977, at the National Library, that the Government believes that all places and items of real historical value to Australia should be preserved for future generations and that this goal must be responsibly pursued even in times of great economic restraint. (2) Is it a fact that, due to the inadequate level of funds appropriated to the National Estate Grants Program over the past 8 years, hundreds of projects such as the repair of 'Rockend' where Banjo Paterson spent his boyhood and 'Hampledon Cottage' built by Macarthur, are starved of funds. provided in the Office of the (3) How is the claim that the Government is committed to the protection of Australia's heritage justified when it is still only providing for new works a paltry $246 000 to each State for 1982-83 under the National Estate Grants Program. Workers' Compulsory Compensation Third Party Mr MCVeigh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: $'000 $'000 934,833 778,423 (I) Yes, although the date was 20 January 1977 and not 20 June 1977. 828,679 575,119 (2) The funding of individual heritage projects throughout 134,048 23,659 Australia does not rest solely with the National Estate Program in which the Commonwealth Government's role is basically one of partnership with the State and community groups in the conservation of the national heritage. Under the Government's federalism policy, State and Territory Governments have primary responsibility for administering their respective National Estate Programs including the selection of project priorities. In this regard the relevant State Government has responsibility for decisions relating to 'Rockend' and 'Hampledon Cottage'. Workers' Compulsory Compensation Third Party (3) The Government's commitment to the protection of Australia's heritage is not confined to its funding of the $'000 $'000 National Estate Program. It should be noted, for instance, that in 1979-80 the Government commenced a special seven 75,327 95,872 year program on a $2 for $1 basis with Tasmania to restore and develop the Port Arthur region. It is currently estimated 150,654 83,852 that Commonwealth assistance of the order of $6 million will be required over the seven year period. To date $2.4 million has been expended on this important component of Australian heritage with an additional $1.3 million being appropriated this financial year. National Estate Program Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 9 November 1982: (I) Did the Prime Minister say at the launching of the World Conservation Strategy in 1980 that the Government's record of action to protect the environment will withstand any scrutiny and that it is a proud. (2) Can he say if the Prime Minister is personally proud of the fact that the Budget for 1982-83 is the 8th in a row in which there has been no increase in funds for the preservation of Australia's heritage. (3) Is it a fact that there is at least $20 million worth of work around Australia waiting for funds through the National Estate Program. (4) Is this the only continuing Federal program aimed at the survival of Australia's built and natural heritage for this and future generations; if so, what action will the Government take to adequately fund this program. Mr Me Veigh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) This assertion that there for heritage preservation for statement. The annual comparison depends on which items of the Budget are included (see 4 below). So far as the allocation of funds to the National Estate Grants Program is concerned this is decided within the context of the Government's economic strategy and in recent years that strategy has been based on restraint in public sector expenditure. (3) The aggregate cost of projects that might be eligible for assistance under the National Estate Program is difficult to timate. It should be understood however, that the National Estate Program is intended to help the States and Territories and organisations within them to conserve the National Estate. It is not intended to supplant of funding. (4) The National Estate Program is not the only measure aimed at the survival of Australia's built and natural heritage. The Commonwealth provides financial assistance to Australia's National Trusts and to voluntary conservation bodies and assistance to Tasmania for the Port Arthur Program. The Australian Heritage Commission, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority are examples of Commonwealth organisations established to preserve and protect our built and natural heritage or particular parts of it. Road Funds: Article in 'Australian' Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Transport and Construction, upon notice, on 19 November 1982: (I) Has his attention been tralian of 25 October 1982, which stated that there was a massive shortfall in funds of $1,000 million in New South Wales for road projects because of what was described as the shonkiest and most rubbery yet of the 1982/83 Federal Budget figures. (2) What will be the shortfall for roads in Queensland. (3) Which road projects will be delayed or scrapped because of a shortfall in funds. (Question No, 5614)",228
285,Mr HUNT,I I I,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) Yes, I am aware of the article which appeared in the Australian of 25 October 1982 to which the honourable member refers. Following this article I issued a press statement on 28 October strongly refuting the allegations and misconceptions in the article. record of which he was personally In my press statement, I pointed out that the estimates used in the Australian were based on exaggerated costs and design standards developed some ten years ago for traffic levels not likely to occur until well after the turn of the century. The figures used by the Government in developing the ABRD Program are based On estimates recently provided by State Road Authority officers, in Commonwealth/State Studies on National Road needs, and from officer discussions on forward planning. Furthermore the levels of Commonwealth roads assistance to the States beyond 1984/85 under the ongoing roads program remain to be determined, and there can be no doubt as to the Government's commitment to upgrading major sections of Australia's road network by 1988. (2) and (3) Pending passage of the enabling legislation currently before Parliament, Commonwealth officers have had preliminary discussions with their counterparts in all States including Queensland about their proposed ABRD Program. On the basis of these discussions, there is nothing to indicate that the objectives of the ABRD Program in Queensland canhas been no increase in funding not be met. 8 years is incorrect in its general of funding for this purpose Popular Theatre Troupe (Question No, 5623) Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 9 November 1982: (I) Is it a fact that the Popular Theatre Troupe, a national es- touring theatre group which plays to factory workers, prisoners, hospital patients, students, etc., has been funded by the Australia Council since 1975 and that the level of funding in the last year for the Troupe has been $75,000. them or be the sole source (2) Has Commonwealth funding of this group now been terminated; if so, why. (3) How many persons are employed within the Troupe and, if funding has been terminated, will they now become unemployed. (4) Is he able to say whether the Troupe was banned from performing their play, The State We're In, in Queensland schools by the State Government. (5) If so, was the decision to stop funding to the Troupe made at a similar time as this ban was imposed. (6) How many similar political theatre groups exist in Australia. (Question No, 5622) (7) How many of these have been funded in each year since 1975 and what was the level of their funding. Mr MeVeighThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australia Council has advised me as follows: drawn to an article in the Aus(l) The Popular Theatre Troupe has been funded since 1975. Grants made by the Theatre Board to the Troupe in 1982 were: General grant towards activities $75,000 Supplementary grant $4,000 Challenge grant $4,000 (2) The Theatre Board has decided not to provide financial assistance to the Troupe in 1983. The Board considered other for assistance from the limited funds at its disposal. The Board's decision also took into affecting the Troupe's operations: the precarious financial position of the company, including its continuing failure to attract significant funding from sources other than the Australia Council; concern about the artisitc frequent turnover of actors and staff which has resulted in the discontinuity failure to develop professional skills; at a meeting with the Theatre Board in Brisbane on 20 September, 1982, members of the Company could not indicate to the Board that they would continue with the Troupe in 1983. (3) At present the Troupe employs five full time staff (an administrator and four actors). A writer and a clerk were employed on a part time basis in 1982. Until the amount of funds available to the Troupe in 1983 is known, the four positions of full time actors will be reduced to two. In addition, a writer/researcher two month period in early 1983. (4) and (5) The decision The State We're In during school hours is a matter for the Queensland Arts Council and the Education Department in Queensland. This decision did not influence the Theatre Board's decision to discontinue funding. (6) No theatre company which seeks assistance from the Theatre Board describes itself as a political theatre group. (7) A full list of the Theatre Board grants for anyone year is set out in the Council's Annual Reports. Special Allocations to Sporting Bodies Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 9 November 1982: (I) After the success of the Australian team in the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, will a special allocation be made to sporting bodies prior to the next budget. (2) If so, which sports, or ents of special allocations. (3) Is it a fact that many sporting bodies have not received significant increases in funds over the past few years, because of the greater application of available funds to those areas which whould benefit from additional funds to the Commonwealth Games.
