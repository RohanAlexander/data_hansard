2,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"In March last the Minister of Trade and Customs promised a deputation that for a time entries would be permitted to be made and checked before the reporting of the ship by which the goods to which they related were being imported, and I understand that the period was slightly extended yesterday. It will, however, soon expire, and, as the Minister in May last promised that in the course bf two or three months he would see whether a permanent arrangement could not be come to, I ask him whether at Adelaide, where agents have to be engaged, he will provide permanently for the checking of entries before the reporting of ships, and will establish a central office or Department at which the checking may take place. Will - he also comply with the request of the deputation that a King's bond shall be established ?",14

14,Mr WILS ON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Corangamite) [2.45] In framing a Tariff every care should be exercised that the duties collected under it should be productive of as little friction as possible between the importers and our Customs officials. Before we pass the first item therefore we should clear the ground somewhat in regard to such articles as cases, casks, bottles, corks, labels, and, indeed,' everything incidental to the importation of various goods. I therefore desire to move That duties shall not be charged on any containing package where the value of the contents exceeds that of the containing package. This shall apply to casks or shooks of all sizes, cases, cartons, bales, demijohns, bottles, and tins. Take, for example, a consignment of spirits, drugs or chemicals. It is absolutely necessary that these things shall be enclosed in bottles or jars, that corks shall be used, that the bottles shall be packed in cases, and that something shall be used for packing purposes. Under the old Tariff it was the custom to charge a statutory TO per cent, upon the invoiced price of cased goods, and 1I have always understood that this charge was intended to cover the cost of packing and the c.i.f. charges.",16
15,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The cost of importing ?,16
16,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . But under the present Tariff the Government apparently intend that duty shall be charged upon the. cases, upon the bottles, and upon the material used for packing. If that course OFFICERS. of action be persisted in it will cause considerable trouble to importers and others who are interested in this matter.",16
17,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"There is a lot of difference between exempting cases from duty De- and exempting bottles. Very frequently the former are quite useless after their contents have been extracted. . Mr WILSON - Ver y often the bottles are equally useless. I know something about importing bottles in my profession, and I say that many bottles are absolutely valueless after their contents have been TARIFF. extracted. In addition, the corks are utterly useless. Under the present Tariff the Customs authorities have power to charge duty upon the cases-and where they contain bottles, upon their cubical contents-in addition to charging ' duty upon the articles contained in such cases, irrespective of whether they consist of ale, porter, spirits, chemicals, or earthenware. Seeing that the statutory 10 per cent, is imposed for the purpose of covering the cost of importing, it would be a perfectly fair thing to allow cases, cartons, bales, demijohns, bottles, tins, corks, husks, cap' sules, labels, & c , to be admitted free.",16
18,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What is imported in shooks ?,16
19,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Shooks are used for packing purposes. Most of the packing materials in which crockeryware is imported is known as ""shooks."" Bottles are imported-in the same way. However, that is a question of detail. I am arguing in favour of a matter of principle.",16
20,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,There are special items upon the schedule which refer to packages containing goods.,16
21,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am quite aware of that. Casks will be included under the item dealing with hogsheads. Cases will come under the item of timber, bales under that of bags, demijohns under that of bottles or earthenware. Straw will be included under the item of hay, and sawdust, shavings, and naper cuttings, I suppose, under that of "" paper n.e.i."" All these articles are dutiable under the new Tariff. If the Ministry will give an undertaking that the Tariff will not be harshly administered in this connection, I shall be perfectly satisfied. But otherwise I shall be compelled to move in the direction I have indicated. Duty should be charged upon packages only where the value of their contents exceeds the value of the' package itself. ,",16
22,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A, operate harshly.,17
23,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If all packages or cases were admitted free, it might be possible to bring in silver-mounted cases filled with very common stock. By the insertion of the words I have suggested, anything of that sort would be prevented. I further intend to moveNor shall duty be charged on mateiial used for packing where its value is less than that of the goods or articles packed. This shall apply to straw, hay, sawdust, shavings, paper cuttings, husks, &c. I also intend to submit a third proposal, which readsNor shall duty be charged on corks in bottles containing dutiable liquids, nor on the labels, capsules, designating any dutiable article. Under the Tariff higher duties will be posed than have hitherto operated, and statutory 10 per cent, will still be added to the duty upon cased goods. these circumstances, I submit that trouble will be minimized at the Customs House if effect be given to my proposals. should like to know whether the present the proper time to submit them?",17

28,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Dalley) [2.56] - Yester - mate day a discussion was originated by the Treasurer upon what is known as the £ 2 new protection. I have ciently long in public life to recollect occasions upon which the policy of protecspite tion has been presented in various guises. I have heard it spoken of as "" discriminatspirits-anticipatin ing "" protection, when, as a matter of duties fact, it discriminated only in favour of few individuals. I have also heard dubbed "" scientific "" protection. Now it being called the "" n e w "" protection. making his statement yesterday, the That might surer outlined a soheme which is designed lo protect alike the manufacturers, the workers, and the consumers. A few weeks ago the leader of the Labour Party submitted his scheme in this connection, and apparently the Treasurer has adopted it.",17
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The scheme outlined by the leader of the Labour Party differs materially from that of the * Government.,17
30,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The two are practically identical. I am willing to believe that the Labour Party are the parents of the scheme, and that the Treasurer is its fostermother. Like most foster-mothers, the latter has very little knowledge of the child that he is presenting to the public. Already his estimate of the revenue which imthe new"" Tariff will yield has been far exthe ceeded. In the same way that skilled accountant, Sir George Turner, when f ill Under ing the same office, predicted that the Kingston Tariff, after it had been a year or two in operation, would return a revenue I of only ,£5,500,000. As a matter of fact is it never vielded less than £9,000,000 . In other words, he under-estimated the revenue that would be collected under that Tariff by about £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. A similar result will be witnessed in conAbout two months ago the Treasurer estimated that it would yield £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum point of more than did the old Tariff.",17
31,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Will there not be a big fall if the present drought continues?,17
32,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member comshould not forget that when Sir George Turner was acting as - Treasurer we exan alniost unprecedented drought. During the month which has closed, the revenue collected under the new Tariff exceeded the Treasurer's estimate by £ 1 9 3 , 0 0 0 , and for the quarter ended 30th September it exceeded his estiby £ 4 3 8 , 0 0 0 . In other words, under the operation of this Tariff more than , 0 0 0 , 0 00 per annum will be extracted been suffifrom the pockets of the people i i i excess of the Treasurer's estimate, and .this dethe fact that many traders-particularly those interested in tobacco, wines and g a heavy increase in the upon those articles, made large cleara ances from bond during the month of August. it Notwithstanding that importers have made is immense clearances, the public have not In only to carry the heavy burden indicated Treaby the Treasurer, but have to provide £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum beyond his estimate. The leader of the Opposition urged that we should expedite the passing of the Tariff, but we must not have expedition at the cost of thoroughness. What was our experience when the last Tariff was under consideration ? Many of the higher duties were carried by the casting vote of the Chairman.",17
33,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,No .,18
34,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"At any rate, many of the tralia. items were carried iby only one vote, and, but for the introduction of those items, it the result. would have been a foregone conclusion that the Kingston Tariff would stand. Howbate, ever, after honourable members had preabout £ sented theirviews, even the Government modified their proposals, and I believe we shall have a repetition of that occurrence if there be reasonable and thorough bate. The Treasurer shakes his head, but we have already seen some changes in last three or four weeks. In Sydney the honourable gentleman said that he was "" whole h o g "" protectionist, and on same evening the Minister of Trade and Customs, at the smoke concert of the Combeen mercial Travellers' Association, Melbourne, intimated that the Government would be reasonable. Since then the Treasurer has said that he dees not intend to hold fast to the Tariff, as proposed.",18

36,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable gentleman has practically said that if good reason be shown there will be a modification of the duties.,18
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I have not anything of the 'kind.,18
38,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Do I understand that the Treasurer is not going to permit any modification ?,18
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Wai t reach the items.,18
40,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Treasurer apparently intends to wait until he'sees how honourable members intend to vote-that is his skilful political engineering. finds his friends in the Labour corner favouring modifications he will be ready to grant them.,18
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The member need not flatter himself. At all events, I desire to be in absolute opposition to the honourable member for Parkes.",18
42,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I , too, find myself occasionally in political opposition to the honourable member for Farkes, but in matters ethical, I find myself in agreement with him. At any rate, the honourable member for Parkes has the courage of his opinion, and I trust I shall never be found factiously opposing him. As a ""result of debate, the last Tariff was modified to the extent of saving some £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 of taxation on the people.",18
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That was a great mistake.,18

48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable the member for Adelaide never said so.,18
49,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"As a matter of fact, the a two Houses of the Parliament could have the reduced the Tariff much more than they did, as experience has shown that there has extracted from the public £4,000,00 0 a year .more than was anticipated by Sir George Turner. But even suppose this Tariff is carried as proposed in every item does the Treasurer expect manufactures to spring up on the next morning like mushWe know that the factories of Australia today are working full handed.",18

51,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The manufacturers themselves say that they have difficulty in getsaid, ting skilled labour, and at some of their establishments, particularly in the textile trade, are twelve months ahead with orders.  until we member not better reserve these remarks until we are dealing with the item ?",18
52,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That interjection had better have been made yesterday when the When he Treasurer submitted his statement to which I am briefly replying. Factories cannot be established under the new Tariff for the next three or four years. honourable Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Oh , yes.",18
53,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Unde r the present Tariff factories have not yet been established, and in the meantime the public have had to carry a heavy burden of taxation. I should now like to deal with the item immediately before us, which is, under ordinary circumstances, supposed to yield materials of hospitality.",18
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member is a teetotaller.,19
55,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"My personal habits are those of abstinence, but I belong to no teetotal association; in short, my personal habits are my own concern. In connection with this item we have had laid before us proposals for the new protection. This scheme is submitted as a sort of solace to the public of Australia; and I describe it as a lubricant to enable honourable members to swallow the high duties. It is worthwhile turning our attention to previous legislation with similar objects in view. We passed the Australian Industries Preservation Act, and the Excise Act connected with agricultural machinery, but neither has been a success. The anti-trust legislation will have to be amended to make it effective, and the Excise Act has not yet been put into operation. Both Acts were merely patches, and we shall have to patch them again. The latest proposal is the. new protection; and I remind honourable members that, only a few years ago, the one cry of the ardent protectionist was that a high Tariff would be the salvation of the people of Australia. The free-traders of those days opposed protection because it 'did not benefit the general masses of the community. Free-traders are just as patriotic as are protectionists, and just as anxious to see Australian products in general use. But they have always contended that a protectionist Tariff benefited a few at the expense of the many; and the truth of that contention is admitted by protectionists in the introduction of the new protection proposals, which are an endeavour to meet the situation. It is proposed to protect, not only the producer and the manufacturer, but also the artisan and the consumer-to protect those who are not employed in protective industries, and who reap no direct benefit from protection. In the case of the consumer it is proposed to appoint a board of inquiry to investigate allegations of overcharges by manufacturers.",19
56,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the member not agree with that proposal?,19
57,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Certainly. But for years free-traders have been pointing - the necessity for some such legislation, while the honourable member for Riverina, and other protectionists, never touched that phase'of the question.' This project was never heard of until it was suggested by the Labour Party, a committee of whom had beenappointed to sift the matter; but today protectionists generally are ranging themselves under the banner of this new scheme. This, as I say, is an admission that some machinery, beyond Customs duties, is required. One result of the new protection will be, in my opinion, to stop the clamouring by manufacturers for further and higher duties; and that will certainly be a.gain to the'country. As soon as manufacturers discover that they will have to pay high wages, and that they will be prevented from combining to overcharge the general. consumer, they will cease their agitation for increased protection; and I welcome the proposal as indicating some finality. We often hear in debate' that the. manufacturer is a rogue, or the importer a swindler; but I do not use such terms. We know that neither is out for an airing, but desires to make as much money as possible in a given time; and the new protection proposals will remove to a great extent the sting of protection. I suggest that the new protection proposals, whatever they may be worth, should be introduced at an early stage in the detailed consideration of the Tariff, and not postponed until later on, or until, perhaps, the consideration of the Tariff is completed. There are many honourable members who, like myself, favour a low Tariff, generally speaking; and if the legislation in reference to the new protection be submitted early, we shall know where we are in relation to the duties which may be adopted. In the Labour Party there are many who hold low Tariff opinions, and who desire that the benefit of any protection which may be afforded shall extend to the whole of the community. To those honourable members the introduction of - the new protection proposals at an early date would also be of assistance. The Treasurer was asked yesterday whether the new protection would apply to agricultural and pastoral pursuits, which afford large'and important avenues of employment, but he was unable to anhonorable swer the question.",19
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , I was not.",19
59,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Then why did the honout orable gentleman not reply when the honourable member for North Sydney asked the question? I respectfully ask the Treaon surer whether the new protection will apply to agricultural and pastoral industries ? I shall wait for an answer.,19
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Do not w a will delay the Tariff.,20
61,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Las t night the Treasurer did not give an answer, and today, apparently, he is unable to do so. Under the circumstances we ought to hesitate in passing the Tariff until we have some further information in regard to the new protection, which materially affects groceries, agricultural products, textiles, and rnetals and machinery. Before honourable members can vote on the items in these classes they ought to have an idea whether the new protection will be effective in regard to them. If the Treasurer wishes to get the Tariff passed quickly, on the lines he has proposed, it is to his interest to place the desired information before us. The Government delayed the consideration of the Tariff in order that the Judiciary Bill , the Commonwealth Salaries Bill, and the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill might be passed, and surely they ought not to hesitate to introduce immediately a Bill to give effect to their new protection proposals. a measure ought certainly to be dealt with before we finally dispose of the Tariff. Before we are called upon to vote on any division in the schedule, we ought also to know whether this policy of the new protection is to apply to the agricultural and pastoral industries. Those industries give employment directly and indirectly to tens of thousands of workers, and with the instincts of a radical I seek for information on this question.",20
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,A,20
63,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . The honourable member is a new-born radical. I remember when he used to oppose radical measures. From the first, however, I have been a radical and a free-trader, because I believe that free-trade is in the best interests of the masses. I do not know whether the new protection will stand the test of time, but if it proves effective, it will whittle awav many of the obstacles that have hitherto stood' between me and the policy of protection. If it will give the workers a share of the benefits of protection, a good deal of my opposition to that policy will disappear. A man is not a free-trader merely because he wishes to buy from the foreigner.",20
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Oh yes he is.,20
65,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It may suit the honourable .member when on the platform to urge that free-traders are foreign traders, but I have yet to learn that my li it ; it views in regard to freedom of commerce are not on a broader basis. As a radical, I have fought for an equitable adjustment of the burden of taxation. Hitherto protection has imposed a burden upon those least able to bear it ; but under the new protection we are told that there will be a more equitable adiustment of taxation. It seems to me that the Treasurer has thrown aside his "" discriminating protection "" cloak, as - well as his ""scientific protection ' 1 garments; and has now donned a suit of "" new protection."" If tinder the proposals now before us an attempt is to be made by a Board to fix prices and profits as well as to determine the rate of pay to be received by workers in various industries, it must be admitted that protection and Socialism are twin sisters. I am strongly of opinion that the new protection is closely allied with Socialism.",20
66,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Opposition corner do not share that view. Such Mr Wilks - That , at all events, is my opinion. If on top of their Australian Industries Preservation Bill , Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery)' Bill , and Commerce Bill , the Government are going to place this policy of new protection, I do not think that I shall have to wait long to hear the Treasurer announcing himself as a full-blown Socialist. The Labour Party are taking the Government, with a mask over their faces, step by step, in the direction of Socialism, and before they know where they are, Ministers will find radical? themselves committed to that policy. It seems to me that it would be easier for the State to conduct some of these industries than it would be for it to regulate prices and wages relating to them, and to penalize manufacturers who fail to observe the conditions to be laid down. Sir WILLIAM LYNE : - Let us get on with the Tariff.",20
67,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member would like us to "" buy a pig in a poke - to vote for the Tariff without discussion, and to adopt the new protection proposalswithout attempting to analyze them. U nless we are careful we shall have a repetition of our experience in connection with the Australian Industries Preservation Act, which we are told must be amended. I say openly that I intend to vote for the new protection. I propose to give it a trial, for the simple (reason that it is the only wav open to me, so f ar as I can see, to reduce the burden of taxation now on the shoulders of the people. I am strongly opposed to the Tariff, and I intend to adopt what seems to me a means of destroying its most objectionable features. The Labour Party hold that fiscalism is a matter of no great importance to the workers-that neither protection nor free-trade benefits them to any material extent-and they now propose to water clown the system of protection. That is an admission on their part that protection does not bring about a paradise of labour. The policy has been patched again and again, and legislation of this kind is mere botching. Apparently, the people of Australia approve of the coddling of industries by means of a protective policy, and we have now to devise some scheme by which the benefits of that policy will be equally distributed. If the new protection proves effective, it will certainly do away with the clamour for increased duties. been told that it is unconstitutional. That contention is raised in connection with nearly every measure submitted to us, and the question can be settled only by an appeal to the High Court. I am opposed to the suggestion which has been made more than once that the constitutionalitv of a Bill should be determined, before it becomes law, by a reference to the High Court.",20
68,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Court has decided that that cannot be done.,21
69,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I was not aware of that, but in any event I should be opposed to the adoption of that course. It would simply mean delegating to the High Court one of the functions of the Parliament. AVe have in this House very many skilled lawyers, and probablv we shall find them expressing different views with regard to the constitutionality of these proposals. There seems to be no desire to test measures of this kind by an appeal to the High Court.",21
70,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"There has been no action under all the Acts which the honourable member has in mind. No one has been proceeded against under them, and consequently they have not been tested.",21
71,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Then they have simply been a dead-letter?,21
72,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That is all.,21
73,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I should like to know whether this new protection, which has been introduced as a lubricant to .smooth the passage of a protective Tariff through the Parliament, is also to be a dead-lettei. My desire is that it shall be operative, and I think that the Bill relating to it should be passed before we are called upon to deal with such divisions as ""groceries and agricultural products,"" and "" metals and machinery,"" on which there is sure to be a fight between the supporters of moderate and of low duties. If we knew that the new protection would be effective, many honourable members would not be disposed to so strongly resist a number of these duties as they would otherwise be. We are told that under this scheme reasonable consideration will be given to those outside the industries affected by the Tariff, and that it will deal with combinations which attempt to increase prices.",21
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It can effect only about one-twentieth of them. We have Mr Wilks - Combination s are to be reported to Parliament. What will happen in that event? Everything will depend upon the temper of the Legislature. We are travelling at a very rapid rate, and the moment we depart from our first principles in regard to taxation we find ourselves on the brink of a precipice. If prices are to be regulated, I should like to know whether the Government will be prepared to introduce, in a Banking Bill provisions to regulate the rates of interest that may be levied by financial institutions. Manufacturers often have to make arrangements with such institutions, since their own capital is not always sufficient to enable them to carry on their operations effectively; and if these proposals be passed they may want to know what Parliament intends to do in the direction of preventing banking and other institutions from charging unduly high rates of interest. I can understand the members. of the Labour Party raising both hands in favour of the proposals of the Minister, because the putting of them forward is an admission of a desire to lessen the burdens of the masses, and an attempt to appease those who are feeling the pressure of Customs taxation. Yesterday ' the Treasurer read a list of prices of articles of ordinary consumption obtained in Melbourne by one of his officers, and because there were very few increases, he said that the effect of the Tariff had not been to make living dearer. His officer, however, took the prices of shops in Chapel-street, Prahran, probably the cheapest suburb in Victoria, and many of the articles contained in his list are not articles affected by the Tariff.",21
75,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Besides , many of the prices quoted were for catch-lines, exhibited in the windows.",22
76,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . As the honourable member for East Sydney has pointed out, that the Tariff has increased the cost pf living is demonstrated by the fact that the revenue obtained last month was larger than that obtained in August, the probability being that the public will have to pay at least £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 more during the coming year for the goods which they consume than they paid last year. The effect of the general elections in New South Wales, in stirring up to a sense of the burdens now imposed on it a public which has always loathed Customs taxation, has caused the members of the Labour Party to now express the wish to"" reduce the duties on the necessaries of life. I shall vote for a reduction of all such duties to the lowest level, because the Treasurer will not say whether he will introduce his' new taxation proposals early or late, and I wish to be perfectly sure of my position. My desire is to reduce the burdens of the people, and to make an equitable distribution of taxation. If the new protection proposals were introduced, they might silence opposition to some of the Customs proposals. No doubt the ardent Victorian protectionist who is so desirous that the Tariff shall be passed, will not worry much about the new prptection once he gets higher rates of duty; but honourable members generally should urge its introduction at the earliest moment.",22
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It should - been introduced long ago.,22
78,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . The honourable member .pointed out last night the need for further information as to what is intended by, the Minister. I understand that he is as desirous as anv member to reduce iniquitous charges upon the public, and to do all that can be done for the protection of employees, but that he fears that the measures proposed will be as ineffective as other Government measures - have proved, and that they have been brought forward merely to appease the public. Certainly, legislation of the character which we are now being asked to consider amounts almost to an admission that as a race we arc more or less decadent. The establishment of Arbitration Courts, Wages Boards, and similar tribunals shows that ideas have changed in regard to individual power and strength. But if the manufacturers are to receive protection by means of Customs duties, the masses whom they employ should also be protected. With regard to the provisions of Part VI . of the Tariff, which deals with metals and machinery, I say openly that, although I have been an anti-bounty man for years - and I do not declare myself in favour of bounties nowwhen assistance is being given to every other industry, the iron industry is entitled to consideration, and it can best be assisted by a bounty. I should like to know whether the proposed Bounty Bil l will be introduced before Part VI . is dealt with.",22
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I understand that those items are to be postponed until the Bounty Bill has been passed through both Houses.,22
80,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I would rather support a bounty for the encouragement of the iron industry than vote for import duties, because Australia will not for many years produce all the iron she requires, and an. import duty would be a tax on all users of iron, and the death-blow to many of our engineering firms, whereas if a bounty were granted the public would have to pay extra only for the iron produced locally. But if a bounty is given for the production of iron, it must be coupled with a bounty, for the encouragement of ship building. Both industries are slightly more important than is the growing of peanuts or flax, and they will employ a class of artisans such as we should be glad to encourage here-sturd y Scotchmen, Irishmen, Englishmen, and Welshhave men, who must be paid good wages, and will prove desirable citizens. These in dustries do not leave openings for the emplovment of alien or cheap labour. But if the price of iron is increased to encourage its local production, the industries which employ iron most largely must also receive consideration. I trust that, when the leader of the Labour Party speaks, we shall receive more information about the new protection; but if we are to go much further in our interference with business, there will not be much difference between' State regulation and State enterprise, and in the long run it may be cheaper and easier for the State to manage industries than to regulate their proper conduct at every point. I do not intend to go to extremes, but I am prepared to give the new protection a trial. I hope that it is not a mere placard. is, of course, an admission that protecfor tionists have at least realized what freemittee traders have always recognised, that toms taxation does not benefit the masses on whom chiefly it imposes burdens. They admit that manufacturers are as ready as importers to despoil the public, both desiring to make as much as they can. Protectionists, like free-traders, now see that if manufacturers are to assisted, their employees must alsobe tected. Of course, this means interferdiscretion. ence all along the line, but the public desire to be coddled, and all sections the community must be treated alike. No doubt, in the end, the system will work tution. its own cure, and manufacturers will to clamour for higher duties. The surer will not declare whether the protection is to apply to the agricultural chinery which has and pastoral industries, a tacit admission that it will be inoperative as regards large section of the community. Further, it can have no effect in improving I the position of clerks and others employed in distributing houses. When a measure is introduced to prevent the undue raisinc; of prices, will it apply only to the raising of prices on articleson which import duties are imposed? Apparently that will be so, because the. penalty for fringing the conditions which are to be laid down is to be the payment of an Expose cise duty equal to half the import duty.",22
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"A point we wish have cleared up is whether the new proitems tection is to apply to the amount of the increase to industries which are being tected by duties which have been only slightly increased, or whether it is ply to the amount of the duty?",23
82,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Quite so. If there has been no increase of duties, will the new protection apply? The whole matter is surrounded with - difficulties. I voted for the imposition of an Excise duty on vesters, to prevent 'the public from victimized by manufacturers; but I fear that measures of this kind will not the results which are hoped for. Howculations ever, if there is to be an should interfere on behalf of the general public, in whose interests I shall be found lighting.

But, personally, I have a free hand in this matter, having refused, when before the electors, to be tied.

In this connection, honourable members wilt inhave noticed that some of the Statesowing to their continued prosperity-pro ""to repeal the taxation upon incomesderived from personal exertion. Those to honourable members who fear that certain in the Tariff are merely intended to be revenue producing need not hesitate to procut them down. We must recollect that Sir George Turner, the most careful acto apcountant who has ever presided at the Treasury, under-estimated the revenue which would be derived from the Kingston Tariff by .£4,000,000 a year. That being so, I am not surprised that the present Treasurer has under-estimated the receipts harunder the present Tariff 'by nearly being £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum.",23

These are naturally Australia in regard to the Tariff. beyond the ken of most laymen, and sequently I do not express any dogmatic opinion as to the constitutionality of proposals.

But (Ale, &c). I we must recollect that we shall be compensated if we get an occasional success of any magnitude. The honourable member for Parramatta hasintimated that, in his opinion, the Arbitration Courts have failed. I suppose that he had in his mind particularly the Arbitration Court of New. South.

112,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It shows great laxity on the part of the Government.,26

114,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The principle is the same in both schemes.,26

132,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The improvement is to the law, of course. . Mr WATSON - Undoubtedly - It appears to me that the honourable member for Parramatta altogether misunderstood or misconstrued what is conveyed in the proposals submitted by the Government. The honourable member yesterday talked about attempts to regulate wages throughout Australia. He mentioned difficulties, and, amongst others, the fact that throughout Australia there are varying conditions which make living high in one place and cheap in another, and which make the cost of getting goods from the place of manufacture to one place greater than it does to get them to The honourable member went on to emphasize those varying conditions, which undoubtedly exist, just as though it were proposed to have one uniform wage throughout the Commonwealth. No such suggestion has ""Been put forward in connection with these proposals.",27
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I pointed out varying conditions more as a difficulty in the determination of a fair price.,27
134,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have looked through the honourable member's remarks, and I take him as applying the difficulties to both proposals-no t merely to prices, but also to wages. What is involved in the proposals as I understand them is that the awards of States tribunals-the decisions of the States tribunals-shal l be accepted wherever they exist; and those . awards or decisions have been arrived at with due regard to the conditions existing in the States.",27
135,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Commonwealth Act specifically states that.,27
136,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Quite so.,27
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The member knows that only a modicum of those employed in industries to which duties will apply, are able to obtain awards.",27
138,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not know that that is. so. In some States-for instance, in Victoria-wher e Wages Boards . are in existence, there is some limitation of the area in which those Boards have jurisdiction, whereas in New South Wales there is no restriction as to the area over which an Arbitration award can be extended. There is, therefore, nothing to prevent employees in any given industry from being asked to work in accordance with an award of the Excise Board, in the event of no State authority having been set up, or no attempt having been made to take advandue tage of a State authority in order to get"" an award or decision. In Tasmania, for instance, where there is no State authority, or in Victoria, outside the jurisdiction of the Wages Boards, the proposal of the Government is that the Excise Board shall grant a certificate, either after taking evidence itself or by deputy, which will give those who obtain the certificate the same immunity from' taxation as is enjoyed by those working under a Wages Board's decision or an Arbitration Court's decision.",27
139,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Can this Parliament instruct an independent Board to accept the decisions of a State Board or tribunal ?,27
140,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That may be done by another. Act of Parliament, but we do not instruct the Board to accept a State decision. The proposal involves this-that the use of the Commonwealth trade mark shall exempt from taxation the manufacturer who is entitled to use it . The Commonwealth trade mark at present can be used with the Minister's consent by any manuthe facturer who conforms to a Wages Board's decision or an Arbitration Court's award. Therefore, all that the suggestion of the Treasurer involves is that, in addition to those means of obtaining the use of the Commonwealth trade mark, .another Board shall be constituted^ available for all Australia, which can issue a certificate entitling a manufacturer to use the trade mark.",27
141,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,How should we deal with an individual manufacturer who employs no labour?,27
142,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"In such a case it is proposed to follow the lines .of the Factories Acts, and make exemptions. However, that is a matter of detail.",27
143,Mr KNOX,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What would be the area honourable of the application of the decision? Would it be a common rule?,27
144,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It would not be a common rule over the Commonwealth, because that would mean a uniform wage; and such a proposal, in my opinion, is impracticable. As the honourable member for Parramatta pointed out, wages are justifiably higher in Western Australia than in Victoria or Tasmania. We, therefore, propose to follow the decisions of the States Courts where they exist, and, where they do not exist, to constitute a Commonwealth tribunal to supply the deficiency.",27
145,Mr KNOX,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I desire to know the area of the Commonwealth tribunal's jurisdiction ; will it exercise a limited jurisdiction.,28
146,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , I think the Excise Boards will exercise jurisdiction all over Australia.",28
147,Mr KNOX,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That is what I desire to know.,28
148,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Will the jurisdiction of the Excise Board be restricted to trades not controlled by the States Courts?,28
149,Mr KNOX,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Will the award of the Board be a common rule for. the Commonwealth ?,28
150,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,No .,28
151,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Certainl y not; will not be a common rule. Mr WATSON,-It-wil l be for the State tribunal to make it a common rule.",28
152,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Eac h manufacturer will have to get the certificate for himself.,28
153,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"In cases where there are no State tribunals, that is so. The certificate will be issued by the Board, after either taking evidence itself or by deputy in regard to the conditions where the particular manufacture is being carried on. There is a provision, I understand, in the Government proposal that the Board may depute to a police magistrate and assessors the business of taking evidence in any remote portion of the Commonwealth, and thus obviate - the necessity of travelling immense distances; and on that evidence a decision will be arrived at as to what is a reasonable rate.",28
154,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Board may do so, but need not do so unless it chooses.",28
155,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It may, or may not.",28
156,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The case of each manufacturer will be an independent case, but at the same time the decision in one case will greatly help the decision in another.",28
157,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Quite so; the honourable member for East Sydney is correct, except that where an Arbitration Court award, or a Wages Board decision, already exists, it will be sufficient.",28
158,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Quite so.,28
159,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"But other cases will be decided on their merits, except for general features that may be supplied by the decisions in other cases.",28
160,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Six Boards will not do the work. [144]- 2,28
161,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I am not so sure of that. .,28
162,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,On e Board will be sufficient.,28
163,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member for Brisbane should recognise that there will be auxiliaries to assist the work of the Board. Classes of employers would no doubt, through their associations, make united application to'the Board. In all the States capitals the employers are for the most part associated. . Mr HUGHES - There is, for instance, the Employers' Federation.",28
164,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Quite so. They would make united application, and would be dealt with in the one operation.",28
165,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,And united application would both cheapen and expedite the work it for the employers?,28
166,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Undoubtedly . Another point to be remembered is that the work of the Board would relieve any congestion of business in the Conciliation and Arbitration Courts, and in connection with - Wages Boards and other classes of industrial machinery. The honourable member for Brisbane will recognise on consideration that the work of this Board is not likely to be so great as would at first sight appear to be probable. It will be minimized very materially by the existence of industrial tribunals in four of the States. Such tribunals do not exist in Queensland and Tasmania, and the fact that they have not been established in two out of the six States is a strong reason for some legislation of this kind.",28
167,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Step s are now being taken in Queensland for the appointment of Wages Boards.,28
168,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"They are moving, in that direction, but we do not know how long it'may take to secure the passing of the Bil l to which the honourable member refers.",28
169,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The second reading was, I think, carried without division.",28
170,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That was in the Lower House; we do not know what may happen in the Legislative Council. In some of the States the area of jurisdiction of the industrial tribunals is extremely limited, and much trouble is involved in securing its extension. However, wherever local organizations exist the work of the Board will be minimized. I am sure that every honourable member welcomes the fact that the States authorities are themselves making the way easy The general existence of these local organizations will mean practically that there is no 'further work for the Commonwealth authority to do, so far as the regulation of wages and hours are concerned. As to the proposal to constitute a body to report as to prices, I think that the honourable member for Parramatta when he vpoke was under a misapprehension. He :otally misunderstood the proposition, and seemed to have no conception of what was aimed at. He indulged in a long explanation of the obvious, pointing out that prices varied throughout Australia, and that the jonditions of manufacture in Western Aus-.ralia and Victoria vary just as they do n Queensland and New South Wales. All hat is perfectly clear. We at once adnit the-correctness of such a statement, but JO far as I know there is no proposal to fix prices. The first point that appealed x> me in regard to the harvester legislation jassed by this Parliament was that it would '36 impossible to applv such a system to the immense arena of general industry. That is to say, whilst the application of '.he system to one particular line of manufacture with which we were dealing separately was practicable",28
171,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"And we had the cost of construction. ' Mr WATSON - Quite so. The unit manufacture was large, and it paratively easy to fix the maximum price to be charged in that case, since we the necessary data to work upon. I every one must recognise that it would absolutely impossible to apply that method to the protection of the consumers of goods generally produced throughout monwealth. That being so, all this talk about the impossibility of attempting to fix prices is a mere waste of effort. We have never proposed to fix prices throughpoint. out Australia. It would be practically impossible to attempt to the whole gamut of goods and prices, and, therefore, no such proposition is made. What is proposed is to appoint a permaloss, nent body, which shall be oiven all facilities of Government, all the powers that are necessary to examine books and other data upon which an opinion may formed, and that it shall constantly over industrial conditions in the Commonwealth. Mr KNOX.;-Actin g upon its own initiative ?",29
172,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , and also upon the suggestion of any one who chooses approach it. It should be laid down that part of the work of this Board shall be to inquire into the general conditions surrounding industries, and to report at least at regular intervals to Parliament. Such a body certainly ought to be able, in the course of a little time, to form a very fair estimate of what is a reasonable price to be charged for an article. I do not propose, as the honourable member for Parramatta suggested, that it should attempt to follow, prices from the factories in Melbourne to the retail shops, say, in the Gulf of Carpentaria.",29
173,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,How could the Board assess wages if it did not do so?,29
174,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That is another question.,29
175,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,But the one is the corollary of the other.,29
176,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"No . I should like the honourable member to make an effort to dissociate the two proposals. Each is in itself distinct. I have already pointed out that the Board could delegate its power of inquiry as to wages tq a police magistrate and assessors in distant parts of the Commonwealth ' or to any"" other body decided evidence of upon by the Parliament.",29
177,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,But the profits made of in an industry would certainly be a mawas comterial factor in fixing wages.,29
178,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wit h all respect to the had honourable member, I hold the view that think a living wage should be insisted upon, be even although no profits are made.",29
179,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It might be necessary the Comto fix more than a living wage.,29
180,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Where the profits were considerable,- it might be advisable to do so.",29
181,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That is exactly my,29
182,Mr FAIEBAIRN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Coul d wages be paid run up and down out of losses?,29
183,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"No . Where there is a it is paid out of capital. A business the man prepares in advance for such a contingency. If he thinks that there is a prospect of his losing for a little while, he deibe termines either to make good his loss out of watch capital or to shut up.  for losses out of capital.",29
184,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"And business men do so. They say very often, in effect, "" It is worthwhile making up our minds to suffer to for a time a certain loss out of capital, since we know that a little later on we shall be full y compensated. We are prepared to lose a little in the hope of making good our losses later on.""  does that finds himself in the Insolvency Court. * Mr WATSON - That is no reason why he should sweat his workmen and regard them in a business way as part of his machinery. On the same principle, it might as well be argued that the manufacturer who is making a loss should demand from the maker of his machinery a rebate, since he has not been able to use it successfully.",29
185,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,When we that point the Board need only report to Parliament.,30
186,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is so.. I want to make it clear that it is unnecessary, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Parramatta. that the Board should follow retail prices throughout Australia. What does such a proposal involve? If to insure that the consumer is not injured by reason of protective duties, we should follow retail prices to. villages in remote parts of Australia, the same duty would lie at our door in respect of imported goods. If it be our duty to follow the retail price of goods locally produced, it is equally our duty to follow''the retail price of imported goods that are sold locally. There is no need at present to follow prices to the retailer. We assume that the same machinery which distributes imported goods wil l operate in the distribution of locally-produced goods, and at the same cost. Whether the goods be locally produced or imported, the storekeeper or the draper will add the same round 20 per cent, or 30 per cent, to cover expenses and profit.",30
187,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,He will be exposed to the same competition.,30
188,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Quite so; therefore, the retail price, although in itself a very important factor, is not a matter with which we are at present concerned. The same factors govern retail prices, whether the goods be produced in Australia, America, . or Germany.",30
189,Mr KNOX,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not think it is necesdone sary to follow the goods to the retail shops.,30
190,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"No r do I . The factors, whatever the origin of the goods, are exactly the same. The retailer, as compared with the wholesale man, adds the same profit in both cases.",30
191,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Whether the goods are ' produced at a loss or a profit?,30
192,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , and whether they come from outside Australia or are locally produced.",30
193,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"He will be satisfied with the same profits in each case; if he is not, further competition will make him.",30
194,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"There will be the same degree of competition, and, therefore, the same degree of profit. The gravamen of the charge against local manufacturers, under a protective policy, has been that they put up the price to the highest limit permitted by the Tariff. * That has been the charge levelled-and sometimes with reach justice-by the free-traders against; the protected manufacturer.",30
195,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"They keep up the price, although they cheapen the cost of production by the use of improved machinery. _ Mr WATSON - That is so, and sometimes increased trade means a reduction in the cost of production. In a great many cases a manufacturer can afford to reduce his prices, notwithstanding an increased Tariff, because, under that Tariff, he secures a large turnover whilst his managerial expenses remain unaltered.  do that.",30
196,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"We wish to insure that .the manufacturers shall be kept to their word. Until the millennium' is nearer at'hand than it appears to be today, we may allow retailers to compete with each other in the matter of prices. All the pro-posals of the Government aim at is the insuring that the prices charged by manufacturers shall not be unreasonable; it is not proposed to fix retail prices throughout Australia. I understand that a permanent body is to be appointed, to be charged with the duty of reporting to Parliament, regularly or at irregular intervals, as to whether the prices of the local manufacturers are unduly high, and that, if it is reported that they are too high, Parliament will take action by reducing the protection extended to the particular industry affected.",30
197,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,How could that* be if only half of the manufacturers connected with that particular industry were offending?,30
198,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I think that a serious situation of that kind will not arise, because if only some manufacturers charged extortionate prices, the competition of those charging reasonable prices would speedily put them out of the market. If one-half of the Melbourne manufacturers of boots increased prices unreasonably, the public would buy the boots made by the other half,, who were selling at reasonable rates.",30
199,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,But a difficulty might arise in connection with the manufacturers of different States.,31
200,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The incidence of the Excise would prevent that.,31
201,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I think that any difference in prices would result in a speedy adjustment. We must expect that the members of the proposed Board will exercise common sense, and show a certain amount of discrimination. Prices would have to be generally higher than circumstances warrant before the Board would report to Parliament in favour of a reduction of duty.",31
202,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The members of the Board must be men of very high class, because they may ultimately become the members of the Inter-St ate Commission. Everything will depend upon the class of .men appointed.",31
203,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I agree with the Treasurer that very good men will be needed.,31
204,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,How will the operawhich tions of the Board affect the consumers?,31
205,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The contention . of free-traders-and I am not sure at the moment whether the honourable member is a free-trader or a protectionist-is that protective duties enable manufacturers to bleed the public by putting up their prices as high as the import duties will allow.,31
206,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Is not the introduction of the Minister's proposal an admission of the truth of that contention ?,31
207,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I admit that this is done in many instances, and that the Minister's scheme was designed to prevent it as far as possible. The honourable member for Franklin asks how the Board will protect the consumers.",31
208,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Manufacturer s may sell through their own retailers. Many retailers are merely selling for manufacturers. ',31
209,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That fact would be easily discoverable. The Board would know what manufacturers who were not selling through their own retailers were charging to bond fide retail houses.,31
210,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,And the books of the manufacturers would show what was being - charged.,31
211,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . As for the protection of the consumers, if it is shown that extortionate or unfair prices are being charged, the Board will report to Parliament, which may thereupon reduce or strike out the protective duty. and allow the competition of outside manufacturers to. comeinto play.",31
212,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Parliamen t could "" take any action it chose.",31
213,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . Under present conditions, we hear all sorts of statements, mostly ex farie and unreliable, as to theeffect of the Tariff on prices, the fortunes which manufacturers are making, and the impoverished state of the poor importers. Many conflicting statements are being put before the country, and it is in the highest degree desirable that Parliament and the community generally should have authoritative information on the subject, such aswould be given by the reports of a body composed of experts, who would know exactly how our industries were faring. Such a body as the proposed Excise Board might well be converted later on into the Inter-State Commission; but at the present time there are many functions, such as pertain* to the Board of Trade in England, might well be added to its work.. It should be more than an Excise Board, and should deal with practically the wholerange of trade and industry.",31
214,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Why not call it the Board of Trade and Industry? - Mr WATSON - That would be a good* name to give it. Of course, the name does not matter much, though it should indicate that the Board will have more' to do than merely to take note of the prices charged in protected industries. In my view, a Board of this sort might do excellent work.",31
215,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Would it not be easier for the State to take control of all our industries than to do all that honourable members propose should be done?,31
216,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I hardly think so under present conditions.,31
217,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Apparentl y the manufacturer is to be told that he can run his business, but that the State is to manage it .",31
218,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I understand that the honourable member intends to support the scheme of the Government, and, as an antiSocialist, he would not support anything: unreasonable.",31
219,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I have said that it is a placard.,31
220,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not think that it involves the management by the State of the businesses of manufacturers. Those who' know anything about trade know that a very fair idea of the range of prices can be obtained without investigating the books of a manufacturer. But the Board should have power to examine books in .difficult cases.,31
221,Mr KNOX,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That power should be used only very exceptionally.,32
222,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , and information obtained from books should be treated as confidential. But there should be this reserve power, so that the efforts of the Board might not be frustrated by the contumacy of a manufacturer or of a set of manufacturers. In the main, it would not be necessary for the Board to demand the production of books, or to interfere in the management of businesses. ditions under which a manufacturer employs his work-people are, I think, the proper concern of the community, just as it is our concern that the young shall receive a proper education.",32
223,Mr KNOX,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable member propose that the examination of books shall .be limited to the obtaining of information in regard to two matters only?,32
224,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It would be necessary to have power to examine books to determine what wages should be paid.,32
225,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"How could a fair sellingnrice be arrived at without the examination of books? ' Mr WATSON - What it would be needful to ascertain would be, broadly, the local cost of production, taking all factors into account. Local prices could be compared with prices abroad, and all the charges which might go to make up the difference could be taken into account. Any set of intelligent men should, in most cases, be able to determine what would be fair prices, without examining the books of manufacturers. Parliament does not desire to go into decimals in this matter. It wishes merely to do rough-and-ready justice. If it were only a question of decimals, the community would not be suffering, and if a substantial grievance were not shown, Parliament would hardly take action.",32
226,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Onl v broad questions of equifv are to be regarded.,32
227,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . I think that the Board should have no great difficulty in reporting whether prices were reasonable. I trust that honourable members will consider theseproposals without prejudice, and with the desire to make the declared policy of Australia as equitable and advantageous as possible to the general community.",32
228,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Fawkner) [4.43] I have taken a great deal of interest in what is called the new protection, and my initial objections to the proposals of the Treasurer have been greatly allayed by the speech of the honourable member for South Sydney. He appeared to indicate that the propos^J Bo?rcl of Fxcise will be a sort of Board of Trade, whose business it will be to collect information regarding our industries, and to present it to Parliament for use in the proper regulation of trade.",32
229,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Board will really be a Wages Board. But the con- Mr FAIRBAIRN - The proposed Board, I understand, will collect information as to rates of wages, cost of production, and other matters, for submission to Parliament, and on that information Parliament may act; but a Wages Board deals directly with employers and employee's, and arrives at decisions. Sir WILLIAM LY N E - The action of the Wages Board would come in at another point.",32
230,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"U p o n - the information presented to Parliament, certificates of exemption will be issued to various manufacturers. There is no doubt that the matter is a very intricate one, and one with which we shall not be able to deal properly until the Bill embodying the scheme is before us.",32
231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Bill will also contain a schedule of the manufactories to be dealt with.,32
232,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The protective policy of the Government, aims first at protecting the manufacturers, secondly at protecting their employees, and finally at protecting the consumers.",32
233,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Parliamen t will deal with those matters.,32
234,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I hope that Par, liament will deal with them after the Board has reported to it. Both the Treasurer and myself, as protectionists, agree that protective duties do not increase prices.",32
235,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,But revenue duties do.,32
236,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Protectiv e duties have the effect of ensuring the home market to the local manufacturer, who' generally charges about the same price for his goods as that which ruled before the duties became operative-perhap s a trifle less. If no increase in prices takes place, and if the operatives engaged in any industry, were previously receiving fair wages, the effect of the Government' scheme will not be to still further increase their wages.",32
237,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Government proposals are intended to insure that manufacturers shall pay good wages.,33
238,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Suppos e that production in a factory were increased four-fold, that the cost of production was decreased by 50 per cent., surely some of the sulting benefit ought to be wages.",33
239,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Certainly . I have no desire to see any more' ""scrap-heap"" legislation enacted, if it can We ought - not to pass a law which may prove ineffective. As far as possible, protection of employees ought to be left the control of State legislation, because are not sure of our constitutional power digest more at present. to deal with this question.",33
240,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If we have not the power to deal with it, the sooner that we know it the better. I believe that we have the power constitutionally, but may be a difference of opinion upon that point.",33
241,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,An appeal to the people would soon settle it.,33
242,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Since I entered politics I have only seen one referendum taken, and that was upon the question of Bible reading in State schools. We know what an extraordinary position was then created. Mr Bent came into conflict with Archbishop Carr, and the issue utterly confused.",33
243,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable memlightning ber say that industrial legislation should be left with the States Parliaments?,33
244,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is my qpini»n.

245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Does not the orable member think that the general control of these matters ought to be in the hands of the Commonwealth?,33
246,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"But where diverse conditions prevail, the States can do the subject more justice. My desire is avoid the unnecessary duplication of laws.",33
247,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Are the proposals of the Government to be confined to the - secondary industries ?,33
248,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Bill will contain a schedule and Parliament will deal with it.,33
249,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I understand that all the scheme of the Government will applv almost entirely to the secondary industries I repeat, that my desire is to avoid as and far as possible the duplication of laws.

My object is to ask the Government to make the legislation simple as nossible, so that, while produce sufficient evidence of Parliament, it shall not prove unduly burdensome.",34
267,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Perth) [5.2] - I rise say something which I had intended to but omitted, when speaking on the general question a week or so ago. The honourable Treasurer, in the course of his remarks suggested that members of the Tariff ought to keep an open mind in regard to the proposals of the Government. That the members of the Commission will do so goes without saying. I had intended If we to claim for myself, and other members of the Commission, the right to exercise our independent judgment in regard to the proposals of the Government; but, as I say, If I omitted to do so. The constitution of the Tariff required at least four members into sign a report before it could be prea sented. Necessarily, under such condiindividual opinions had, to some extent, and, frequently, to a considerable extent, to be sunk in order that a recommendation of a general character might be Arsubmitted to His Excellency the GovernorFor instance, the free-trade section of the Commission presented a series, recommendations in regard to the duties on textiles generally, suggesting, among other things, a duty of 10 ' per cent, The honourable legismember for Illawarra. pointed out to will his colleagues, when the report was being up, that he intended to dissent so far as that item was concerned. That is an as illustration which occurs to me; and I think deI am justified in saying that throughout our while there was unanimity on general principles, there was not by any means that absolute unanimity in regard to details conthat some of the reports would indicate.",34
268,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That is a reason why we should not swallow in globo all the them at recommendations of the Commission.,34
269,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It shows undoubtedly that there was room for individual opinion, in regard to details, while we may have been agreed on general principles. We endeavoured to indicate general principles more rather than details, which appeared more or less unimportant. Of course, honourable members, who are in possession of those general principles, will be able, for themselves, to decide whether or not they shall we be applied to particular items.",34
270,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honoras able member know whether the protectionist it may section of the Commission adopted a for the guidance similar course?,34
271,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not think I am betraying any .confidence when I say that a to similar course was, probably, taken by the say, members of the Commission on the other side of the fiscal fence. We could not, as in the case of a dissenting member of a last Cabinet, very well resign in a matter of this sort. It will be at once recognised that the members of the Commission, who had heard all the evidence, were almost in honour obliged to see the matter through, in view of the fact that no one who had not heard the evidence could very well report on it. Under the circumstances, therefore, members of the Tariff Commission may probably vote not absolutely in accordance with some of the recommendations they have signed. That is, at any rate, my position. I shall vote either for or against the proposals of the Government absolutely on the merits of each individual case.",34
272,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Then the only value of the Tariff Commission is that the members presented to us so much condensed evidence ?,35
273,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The value of the Commission consists in the fact that the members dealt with the evidence presented to them, not as politicians, but as judges. All the ^members of the Commission, I think, endeavoured to adopt a judicial attitude. I have done my work as a free trade member of the Commission, and endeavoured to put fully, and yet fairly, the free-trade position before honourable members. Now it is my duty as a politician to deal with the proposals of the Government, and, while I have signed certain recommendations, proposals, and deductions from the evidence, I claim the absolute right, as a member of this House, to exercise an independent opinion over and above the judicial opinion I exercised when assisting.in drawing up, and in signing, the reports. I have to congratulate the Government on having at last taken up in earnest the policy of new protection. It is not so very long ago-onl y during the last Parliament-that , when I endeavoured to introduce somewhat similar ideas ""into the anti-trust legislation, the Government could not see eye to eye with me, and my attempt was defeated. However, we all learn, and, I hope, progress; and I am glad to see that the Government propose to apply the new protection in a way that will undoubtedly neutralize a great many of the objections that have been taken by free-traders like myself to protection in the past. In view of the absolute betrayal of free-trade by the Opposition",35
274,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Oh ! - Mr FOWLER - In view of the absoorable lute - betrayal of free-trade' by members the Oppositionin favour of a policy of a-nti;Speialism, T, who have been both a free-trader and a Socialist, welcome the proposals of the Government as giving me an opportunity to support a policy which, while not entirely socialistic, undoubtedly, as a member of the Opposition indicated this afternoon, approaches very closely to Socialism. But call the policy by what name we please, it seems to me a distinct advance in the direction of those principles which make for the happiness and progress of humanity. I shall therefore give the Government my assistance in making that policy as successful and as thorough-going as possible.",35
275,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Lang) [5.10] - I do not propose to occupy more than a few minutes, and I do so in order to reply to one or two observations by the leader of the Opposition, and also by the honourable member for Perth. The honourable member for Perth stated that the Opposition have betrayed free-trade; but I have not been able to discover any evidence on which such a charge can be based. The leader of the Opposition proposed, at the last election, that, in view of a greater - and more' momentous issue which had arisen, a truce should be called on the fiscal' questionat any rate, so far as that election was concerned-in order to afford moderate protectionists, or protectionists of all kinds, an opportunity to unite with free traders in resisting the encroachments of Socialism.",35
276,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That is exactly what the Labour Party have always done in order to advance the encroachments of Socialism.,35
277,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"But the trouble was that while free-traders sunk the fiscal issue, protectionists did not do so.",35
278,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I was just about to refer to that. While the leader of the Opposition was willing, for the purpose of uniting the forces opposed to Socialism, to sink fne fiscal issue, and so allow those erstwhile opponents to meet on one common platform, the project miscarried, owing to the failure of the protectionists to fall in 'with the arrangement. This only shows how unwise it is for free traders to vote for protectionist candidates on any fiscal sinking plea. The protectionist element of their character will always assert itself. Mr THOMAS"".BROWN - Surely the honmember does not charge protectionof ists with misleading free-traders?",35
279,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not say that they - did. mislead'; but merely that they did mot, to any ' great"" extent, respond to the invitation of the leader of the Opposition. What the protectionists did in many cases - was to take advantage of free-trade votes in order to secure the return, of protectionist candidates.",35
280,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Where ?,36
281,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That was done all over the Commonwealth. When ""leader of the. Labour Party tells us - at the election the issue was the fiscal ' question, and that the verdict was for ""high protection, I remind him that outside We Victoria the fiscal issue raised, though it may have cropped up ""incidentally. In Queensland, for stance, there were returned on the Socialist issue, members who are protecdustrial tionists, but who did not raise the issue before the electors. But, be'cause they had agreed to sink the fiscal issue, they secured their seats largely by aid of free-trade votes. How, then, can the honourable member for South Svdnev claim that the result of the election - Queensland was a victory for higher tection ? Those Queensland members were elected on a pledge not to interfere the old Tariff, but to sink the fiscal and join forces with the leader of the position in order to resist the encroachbe ments of Socialism. If the fiscal questhat tion had been a live issue, will honourable members opposite explain why it is that the Prime Minister did not put forward protectionist candidatesin all the constiposals of the Government. tuencies? Will they tell me why South Wales, the principal State Commonwealth, returning twenty-seven members, the Prime Minister put ward only two candidates, besides two members of the Ministry, to uphold flag of protection ? How is it that the Minister did not see that protectionist didates contested every seat, or, at least, a majority of seats, in the Commonwealth Outsjde Victoria, the fiscal issue was raised, and the contention that the general election was a victory, for high protection, and justified the Government in submitting this Tariff, is an untenable one.",36
282,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The fiscal issue was a live question, in mv electorate.",36
283,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"But the honourable member's electorate does not comprise whole of New South Wales, and it is on the Victorian border. For my own part, though I did not fight on the fiscal issue, I nevertheless made it plain that I was free-trader. In connection with this tion of what is called the new protection we have the bald outstanding fact that the Government themselves have to admit that the policy of protection, which was in the first instance advocated as an infallible . means of improving the condition of the wage earners of this country, has proved, after an experience of forty years, the a rank and ghastly failure. They have that now to admit what free-traders have always contended, that protection never has, never will, and never can, raise wages. have seen in Victoria and elsewhere, was not seriously that an'honest, hot but a tacit recognition of fact in the appointment of antiSweating Commissions, and. the creation of inWages Boards, Conciliation and Arbitration antiCourts, new protection, and other inmachinery for raising wages fiscal which protection had failed to in- crease, and to improve the condition of . the workers, which protection had failed the to. improve. Every one of those devices has admittedly failed to effect the purpose for which it was proposed, and we now in have the Government coming forward with proa new scheme of new protection. The new protection applied by them to the agriculwith tural implement making industry has been issue weighed in the balance and found wanting. OpI am satisfied that this later scheme will found as abortive as have all the others have preceded it. I agree with those who insist that we should at once have submitted to us a Bill, or at least a memorandum, embodying the new protection proEven the in New leader of the Labour Party admitted of the a few minutes ago that he was not satisfied with these proposals, although forhis party was primarily responsible for the them. He now thinks that the scope of the the proposed Board of Excise should be Prime broadened. It is gradually to develop into cansomething more than was originally intended, and is to embrace the whole system ?' of trade and commerce in Australia. In not short, instead of being merely an Excise Board to regulate prices, it is to be something in the nature of the British Board of Trade, and having, perhaps, an even wider scope.",36
284,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Will it be any the worse for that?,36
285,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"No . I think that, the if it be so broadened, it will be a vast imright provement on the original proposition, so that although it may fail in the particular direction for which it was first designed, it a may, nevertheless, be able to do much work, quesof a useful character. Three objects are to be accomplished by the combination of a protective Tariff with a Board of Excise. In the first place, they are going to protect the employers by insuring them fair profits; in the next place they are going to protect' the employees by securing to them high wages; and in the third place they are going to protect the consumer by insuring low prices.",36
286,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,F a i r prices.,37
287,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member yesterday read a list of articles and prices with the object of showing that the effect of protection was to reduce prices.,37
288,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,No .,37
289,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I repeat that the honourable member did so. member for Fawkner, who spoke a few minutes ago, also told us that the'effect of protection was to reduce, or, at all events, not to raise, prices. The one plea urged by protectionists for the imposition of protective duties has always been that cheapness is prejudicial to the interests of the community. They say in effect, "" How can we manufacture goods in Australia - when they are imported and sold so. cheaply?""",37
290,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I did not say anything of the sort.,37
291,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"When on the public platform, the honourable member has made that statement times out of number.",37
292,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Never .,37
293,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Good s are imported cheaply and sold dearlv. Mr ' JOHNSON - Then , why' does the honourable member complain of dumping?",37
294,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Because the goods are sold at a high price to the consumer.,37
295,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Are we not always told that the-evil of dumping is that goods so introduced are sold at a very low price, thus' coming into unfair competition with locally produced goods? surer was careful to tell us that the one great evil of which protectionists complain is the curse of cheapness. The Government introduced the Commerce Bill, the Australian Industries Preservation Bill , and other measures to regulate prices and to prevent goods being sold at too low a rate. The Treasurer knows that I am telling the truth. In connection with the consideration of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill and the Commerce Bill , he used arguments which he cannot now forsake; he told us that we should prevent imported goods beincc - sold at too low rate, and coming into unfair competitidrf - duty. with local manufacturers. And yet he now pretends to say that prices are not, and will not be, raised by protection. What, then, is protection wanted for? Three self-contradictory objects are to be accomplished by this one process. If protection is to protect the consumer by reducing prices, we need no protection, because free-trade promotes healthy competition and 'prevents the undue raising of prices. In the first place, it can be of no use to the manufacturer, since the one thing of which! he now complains is the cheapness of imported goods. He asks for a protective duty to enable him, by artificially raising the prices of imThe honourable ported articles, to compete against them in the local market. And yet we are told today that protection is going to produce the very evil of which these men complain. If it is going to result in cheapness, how are we to have, by the one process, fair profits for the manufacturer, high wages for the operatives, and cheap goods for the conv sumer? Such a proposal is absolutely ridiculous. Although the Board may report that a certain rate is, or is not, a fair price, as soon as we attempt to regulate prices, and bring them below a certain standard, we shall have an outcry on the part of the employers that they are not securing the benefits of the protective Tariff, and cannot afford to pay the high wages they are called upon to give. On the face of it,, therefore, this scheme must break down. Apart altogether from the actual difficulties which we shall encounter in trying, - by means of a roving Commission, to inquire into the private business matters of various importing and manufacturing firms, in order to determine what are fair prices, we see on the face of the proposal "" failure"" ' written as large as possible. Here is another aspect of this matter. The principle The Trea- to be adopted is the issuing of a Commonwealth trade mark to all employers deemed"" to be carrying on their industry under fair and reasonable conditions, amd to be paying fair and reasonable wages. This is to be-equivalent to an Excise exemption certificate. But what will be the position of those who employ no labour? What will be the situation where a business is carried on by one individual?",37
296,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,O r by four?,37
297,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Quite so. Unless we have some special legislation, every one of a those people will have to pay the Excise",37
298,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,In - what industries does such a state of affairs exist? .,38
299,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"They are innumerable. I am satisfied that as scon as the Board attempts to operate in regard to prices, and tells a manufacturer that he must reduce them, trouble will arise. As a matter of fact, trouble will be experienced long before that stage is reached ; but, assuming that the Board gets to that point, we shall at once have a cessation of the cry for more protection. As soon as the manufacturers find that they are not going to reap the benefit of this higher protection by being able to charge higher prices for their goods-withou t which they claim they cannot afford to pay higher wages-the y will not be nearly so. keen in their demand for high protection as they have hitherto been. I can see that this scheme is the forerunner of the disruption of the whole protectionist edifice. That is one of the reasons which might rather incline me to regard these proposals with some degree of .favour; but I do not propose, at this stage, to commit myself to supporting them. Before doing so, I desire to know something more about them. It seems to be.farcical to proceed with the consideration of the Tariff before a Bill covering the new protection proposals of the Government has been submitted to us. I wish now to point to a constitutional difficulty. Section 55 of the Constitution providesLaws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect.",38
300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That is why propose to bring in two Bills.,38
301,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"But the one will related to the other. I ' do-not an authority on legal questions, but it seems to me that the proposed legislation, following. like much that we have already passed, will bring a great deal of grist to the of the lawyers, who will be the only to substantially benefit by it. we can fairly consider the Tariff items, we must know what is to be the nature of the Bill or Bills which the Government propose to introduce, since the - of what is proposed may materially affect the decisions of many honourable members on a number of items.",38

Had he contented himself with < consulting some of the householders in the locality, he would have had to make a different statement. I know that my wife tells me that housekeeping costs her something like £ 1 a week more under this Tariff than it did under the old one, and we get our goods from the Chapel-street shops, whence the Minister obtained his price lists. It was childish for the honourable gentleman to go to all that trouble to prove nothing. I have had some difficulty in putting myself right with the people of the St. Kilda and Prahran district, and should have found it a very uncomfortable one to live .in had I not disclaimed responsibility for the Tariff. It is a bad thing that it is legal for a man to impose a Tariff like this, which he knows has not the slightest hope of being accepted by Parliament.",38

Members of the party are violating their pledges to the people, because they said that before the Tariff was dealt with' it should be referred to the electors. I was returned as a protectionist, and as one shall be pleased to vote for duties whose effect will be the tection of Australian industries. But the people have not asked for the proposed Tariff. They did not ask for the repeal of the old Tariff except in respect to the removal of anomalies.",39

The Attorney-General will bear me out that the aim has been to export barley, and not to make use of it locally.",41

However, I shall not take up any more time with these general observations. I merely wish to point out that I was returned-and I do .not think by any sort of side-wind-to vote for the retention of the old Tariff, except in regard to anomalies; and I shall adhere to my election pledges.",41
363,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"East Sydney) [6.3] - I should not have spoken again but for statements, which I think were altogether I admit that it uncalled for, by the honourable member for Perth. That honourable member went far out of his way in order to accuse the Opposition, and especially myself as leader, of having betrayed the cause of free trade. That isa very serious charge; and as the honourable member is generally very guarded and moderate in his language, it carries all the greater weight. I snould like, in very few words, to point out that, in my opinion, the statement of the honourable member is very ungenerous. In our respective spheres, we have all to consider what is the proper course to adopt; and, before the last election, I regarded the question at issue between the Socialists and anti-Socialists as the most important that could arise for decision by the people of Australia. Viewing the election genat the Too- erally, it will be admitted that that issue was the most important, so far as public attention was concerned, throughout the Commonwealth. Although it is perfectly true that the protectionists in the State of Victoria refused to accept the truce that I proposed, it is also true that the result of the anti-Socialist campaign has been to place on the Opposition side of the House a large number of honourable members who have been returned as anti-Socialists, although they are protectionists. One of the most satisfactory evidences of the wisdom of the course I took on that occasion, if my views are sound on the main question-becaus e that is'open to difference of opinion-is that the State election-campaign in New South Wales, only - a few weeks ago, which was very warmly conThe tested, and in which the Labour Party was engaged as representing the State Opposir ton, was conspicuous for the f a c t - I speak only generally, because there may be exI ceptions to what I am about to state-that vye scarcely everheard Socialism mentioned. That simple circumstance shows that the campaign which I conducted has had far-reaching effects.",41
364,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Did not Mr Carruthers say he would not follow the honourable member in placing such a policy as anti-Socialism before the electors in the State election? ',42
365,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The late Premier of New South Wales at one time took up a position against any anti policy. But his remarks on that occasion did not seem to be well weighed; because I suppose every man, who is in favour of some policy, must necessarily be opposed to some other policy. I suppose that there is not a man in politics who is not in favour of some projects and opposed to others. do not care to which party a politician may belong, he must be anti something, unless his views are affirmative on every conceivable subject, in which case he ought to be in Yarra Bend Asylum. In point of fact, in the old country, as honourable members know, it was an anti issue which carried the great triumph at the late elections-the anti-policy to the Tory Government in a number of important respects. That was more an anti election than any in the history of politics during the last fifty vears; and it produced the greatest result. I wish to say, however, that it comes with very bad grace from an 'honourable member like the honourable member for Perth, to state that I have betrayed the cause to which I have been attached all my life, simply because I considered that anti-Socialism was a policy on which free traders and protectionists could unite. During the whole of his political career the honourable member for Perth has been hand-in-hand with a number of ardent protectionists-h e has actually adopted that attitude every moment of his political existence. If there is any earnestness in the honourable member's belief in free trade, how is it that he has been following, like a tame poodle, a protectionist Government for the last seven years? How is it that when that protectionist Government are tottering and doddering along, with scarcely a spasm of life or energy, this rabid free-trader is carefully - nursing them in their expiring efforts? No men can associate together in politics without making some questions secondary to others. 'Honourable members of the Labour Party, I should hope, have minds just as vigorous as have members of any other party; and I ask them whether, every day, they have not to give way on some points in order to unite on other points? That is the basis of every political party; and that the honourable member should accuse us of - betrayal, because we looked on anti-Socialism as a policy which might unite free-traders and protectionists, seems to me very unfair. I use these expressions with some regret, because I have to acknowledge the general fairness and generosity of the honourable member, of whom, if I may say so, I have, and always have had, an extremely high opinion. I , therefore, feel all the more what I think was a very careless charge levelled against me. The term "" betrayal "" h as a very nasty taste in any one's mouth, because I it suggests treachery. We maybe guilty of errors of judgment, and may thereby damage a great cause ; but we all draw a broad line of distinction between an error of judgment and an act of betrayal. The latter involves a moral wrong- a moral wickedness-and 1 do not think that the honourable member, perhaps, intended his words to have that serious meaning. But I feel it my duty to point out that the course I took was in what I conceived to be the interests of the public, in reference to the great political questions of the day. I am perfectly convinced that the cause of free-trade has in no way suffered from the attitude which I took up on that occasion. I make these observations because I feel the charge to be a serious one. I have not abated one iot or tittle of my profound belief in the virtues of the free-trade policy. I have spent most of my life since I was a boy in trying to persuade the people of Australia of the soundness of free-trade, but I should be worse than blind if I were to shut my eyes to the fact that my efforts in that direction have not been crowned with success-that , in point of fact, there is a majority of the electors of Australia who support a policy which is opposed to that in which I believe - It is consistent with that view that I should do all I can to make this Tariff as low as possible, and I shall not abate my energies, as a representative of a free-trade constituency, in reducing the duties as nearly as I can to the point of a revenue Tariff. On the other hand, I cannot complain in any way if honourable members vote against me, and increase some of those duties- I cannot complain of "" treachery "" or declare that they are "" betraying "" their policy. I take it that, each honourable member knows how he laid his views before his constituents, and that, whether he be free-trader or protectionist, he will .carry out his pledges. I do not think I am rash in saying that if the Tariff, as proposed, were submitted to a referendum of the people of Australia tomorrow, it would be,scouted by a large majority.",42
366,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Nonsense! should like to try a referendum.,43
367,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I will not ask the Minisduty try to risk their existence, for that would be suggesting something savoring of suicide. But, without endangering the position the Government, I am prepared to vote the money necessary to submit the Tariff to referendum, tomorrow. thing it would be, in a matter affecting people of Australia so closely and intihe mately, to have a straight-out vote! But no men in Australia would be slower send this Tariff to ""a referendum than present Treasurer and his colleagues.",43
368,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member knows that I have always been opposed-to the referendum.,43

They are like a little crowd on a Noah's a r k ; if they stepped an inch beyond it, they would be submerged my in a deluge and drowned. Is the Treasurer prepared to agree to a referendum on .Tariff, or will he give precedence to the item of wire netting? There are thou-in sands of settlers paralyzed by that duty.",43

386,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Why do not the Government give up the wire netting in their custody ? They are not prepared even to e do that. I do not wish, however, to touch just now upon controversial matters, since we all wish to enter upon the serious work of the Tariff.

I hope that they will place upon that term an honest construction. Are not clothes, just as much as is food, a necessary of life? Yet it is proposed to impose upon them duties ranging from 40 per cent, to 45 per cent. Every one must have clothes, even if he does not get three meals a day.",43

"" Cheapness is a cursed thing ! Do not talk of cheap clothes !"" But might I suggest that cheapness is sometimes brought about by the use of shoddy, and that one of the incidents of a Tariff sometimes is that a protectionist is able to say, "" Oh, the prices are just the same as they were before 45 per cent, duties were put on. At the beginning of 1907, I used to pay 20s. or 30s. for a suit of clothes, but although, since then 40 per cent, and 45 per cent, duties have been imposed, I have - only to pav the same price as before."" Do not honourable members know that when these high protective duties are passed, - cheapness is arrived at, not by honest competition, but by the degradation of quality?",44
393,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,We can make better clothing than is imported.,44
394,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member - cannot judge of the quality of the goods he purchases. He is not a judge of clothing. He would wear out any suit in three months in looking after the Labour Party. I wish to give the Committee an illustration of what I mean when I speak of the degradation of quality in order to secure cheapness. The Tariff which Sir George Dibbs introduced in N e w South Wales in 1891 was high enough for the present Treasurer.,44
395,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It was not.,44
396,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Then the honourable member has put up with a lot in Cabinet. He has confessed to-dav that when the right honourable member for Adelaide and Sir George Turner accepted a compromise Tariff he looked upon it as practically meaning the ruination of protection.,44
397,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , I did not.",44
398,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"He swallowed it like a baa lamb. Whoever knew the Treasurer resign from office on a point of principle? Whoever saw him remain out of office on a point of principle? He will not even swallow the^proposal for a referendum on the Tariff, fearing 'that the shadow of it might injure him. The honourable member went to the people of Australia when Federation was established, and said ""We must have a revenue Tariff. """,44

When interrupted I was about to mention a conversation that I had with a bigimporter at the time that the Dibbs Tariff was imposed. It is singular that some honourable members who think so ill of the importers imagine that they are going to pay out forty-five sovereigns in respect of every £ 1 0 0 worth of goods purchased by them, and that they will forget to pass on that impost to the consumer. It is wonderful that they should 0 imagine the importers to be such benevolent asses. In the one breath they tell us that the importers are vampires, draining the life-blood of the consumer, and in the next that they are paying forty-five sovereigns as duty on every £ 1 0 0 worth of goods and forgetting to pass on the impost. People who swallow such a statement must live somewhere in Victoria. Here is a little bit of practical experience.

[Quorum formed.'] It is rather disappointing to find that the Minister will not give us full information in regard to his proposals for establishing what has been termed the new protection. So far as one can make out, his statement embodied the. instructions given to the draughtsman, but we do not know to what trades the provisions which are to be brought forward will apply, and in other respects are in the dark in regard to them. When they are brought forward there will probably be another long discussion, which might have been avoided had the Government been prepared to place them more f u l ly before us now. For weeks the Treasurer promised a statement of his intentions regarding the new protection, and at the last it was drawn from him, he being unwilling, or unprepared, to deal with it, or, perhaps, not f u l ly instructed by the Labour Party, whose members are, no doubt, really responsible for it. We have come to a pretty pass when the Government of the Commonwealth takes its policy from a section of honourable members: It would be more in keeping with parliamentary tradition if the tail which now wags the dog were to be made responsible for the legislation which is passed. As it is, things are now done backwards. The Treasurer is the Acting Prime Minister, Acting Minister of Trade and Customs, factotum, and general bully.",46

423,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do so, as vou, sir, regard it as unparliamentary. A great deal of time has been wasted because of the Government's unpreparedness in this matter. The Committee yesterday was ready to go on with the consideration of certain items, but the crankiness of the Treasurer",46
424,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,This is not like the honhave; orable member.,46
425,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I will say the naughtiness of the Treasurer, who is also Acting Prime Minister and Acting Minister of Trade and Customs. This Minister, who fills so many Cabinet positions, is solacking in courtesy to honourable members that he tells Parliament what a Minister has never before been known to tell a deliberative Assembly, that he will not give information. I do not know how long honourable members will be prepared to tolerate this kind of treatment, but the sooner the Prime Minister is well enough to take charge of affairs the better it will be for the country. This unthought-out proposal of the Government is called the new protection ; but how can there be any new protection? The term is a misnomer. We know what is meant by protection, the imposition of Customs duties to keep out importations from other countries, so that our own manufacturers may have no competition to meet; but the difference between the new protection which we have heard piped of so much in this Committee and the old protection is the difference between an alligator and a crocodile. The arrangement of the jaws may be different, but the swallow is the same, and the prey all goes the same way. In the course of the discussion, it has been generally admitted by protectionists that protection is a failure. They have abandoned the old doctrine that the foreigner pays' the duties. The leader of the Opposition stated today that, although he had been somewhat successful, he had not been so successful as he should have been in establishing free-trade; but it seems to me that, no one could have been more successful. He stamped the free trade policy upon the great State of New South Wales, whose population is one-third and whose commerce is more than one-third of that of Australia, its trade per head being more than that of any other country in the world.",46
426,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Ne w South Wales did not give the honourable member for East Sydney manv'supporters.,46
427,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"At the last election he did not appeal to the country on the fiscal question, but he has stamped the policy of free-trade on the State of New South Wales, and has shown the other States of the Union that protection is absolutely hollow, conferring no benefits upon the masses. As a result, Labour representatives who ' as protectionists are to a man declaring the old protection to be a failure, which, instead of benefiting the worker, enables a large percentage of his earnings to be filched from him, and thus virtually reduces his wages. They are, therefore, compelling the Government to change its tactics, and to propose what is termed the new protection. The leader of the Opposition could not expect any greater success than to cause the people of Australia to admit that the old protection is a failure, the equivalent of free-trade must be adopted. That equivalent was expressed by Henry George, when, in one of his able lectures in Australia, he said, "" If you could have protection in the same proportion to every individual of the community, it would not he a bad thing. As you cannot, it must be-'a failure. The easiest and least, expensive way of treating every one alike is to have absolute free-trade."" It seems to me that, in trying to protect every one, honourable members are gradually getting round to the position of Henry George. I believe that they sincerely desire the well-being of the masses, but-as that great thinker and reasoner has shown by his book entitled Progress and Poverty and Social Problems-the y must fail. They will do better to vote for the reduction of duties, to lessen the taxation of the workers, than to vote for high duties, and then try to divide the spoils between manufacturer, - consumer, and worker, with the ultimate result that the worker' will be heavily taxed.",46
428,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,How far does the honourable member adopt the teachings of Henry - George?,47
429,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"On e step at a time. When I was a boy I supported the proposal of the honourable member for Angas for the nationalization of land, but when Henry George's book came out, showing that the easiest method of serving the masses of the people was to tax land, the honourable member for Angas and every other reformer in the matter of land legislation abandoned land nationalization for the more direct and effective land taxation. The Labour Party has taken up .an exploded theory. X am asked how far I would go with Henry George. I am in favour of land taxation, and I voted for it at a time and under conditions when few men would have voted for it. I did so because I believed in the principle.",47
430,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,In the abstract?,47
431,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,No ; in its practical application.,47
432,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,We shall afford the honourable member an opportunity one day to give effect to his belief.,47
433,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member should cross over to the Labour corner.,47
434,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Labour Party would not have me, not because its members do not believe in what I believe in, but because I do not believe in some of and that the things in which they believe.",47
435,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Because we do not know what the honourable member believes in.,47
436,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,He does not believe in humbug.,47
437,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I believe in the principle of the caucus, but I do not believe in a caucus-bound party. Being caucus-bound is what free men object to. In the course of his remarks yesterday, the Treasurer stated that it would be very difficult to insure the payment of fair wages under any new protection scheme. His utterances clearly demonstrated that he knows absolutely nothing about political economy. He knows nothing even about the proposals which he has outlined. One has only to read the summary of his remarks,- which appeared in today's newspapers, to realise what a hopeless muddle he was in. He referred to the difficulty that would be experienced in establishing a standard of wages. In this connection, he ought to have known that the standard of wages is dependent upon the products of the soil. Land is the source of all wealth, and if we reduce the wages of the men upon the soil we must of necessity reduce the wages of those who are engaged in our secondary industries. His scheme will prevent the wages of the operatives in our secondary industries from being increased because he proposes to levy excessive taxation upon all that is used by our primary producers. Had the Treasurer been a student of political economy, had he ever devoted a fair amount of attention to reading, he would have known that his scheme starts at the wrong end. He has commenced by reducing the wages of miners and the men upon the land, anticipating that, as a result, he will be able to increase the wages of those who are engaged in our secondary industries. That is impossible. If high duties are imposed for the purpose of benefiting manufacturers obviously the consumers will have to pav them. The manufacturer is not likely to disburse amongst his employees any more than he earn possibly avoid. As a matter of fact, the workman will receive no benefit under the new protection proposals of the Government, because his expenses of living will be increased, and that is equivaing lent to a reduction of his wages. if Parliament decides that a certain manufacturer who is not paying a reasonable wage shall be called upon to pay half the amount of Customs duty in Excise, what will happen ? The cry will be raised that if the Excise rate be insisted upon his factorywhich will be closed.  orable member desired to expedite the consideration of the proposed duty upon wire netting ?",47
438,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Honourable members like the honourable member for Grey will raise this cry on behalf of the operatives, and will prevent the manufacturer 'from being thus, penalized.",48
439,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What about wire netting?,48
440,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Honourable members opposite have had a good deal to say upon the new protection. They have wearied the Committee by delivering long speeches upon it. Yesterday I was prepared to proceed with my proposal in relation to wire netting, but I was not permitted by the Treasurer to do so."" Therefore, I ' intend to assert my right to make a few observations upon the scheme of new protection brought forward by the Government. It is a hollow fraud.",48
441,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member will be able to debate that question when the Bill is introduced.,48
442,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Upon every occasion I intend to expose the hollowness of the proposal from the stand-point of the workers. I recognise that it is a cunning move on the part of those who propound it. They start with a sham offer of increased wages to the artisans. It is the old plan of promising a man something at the expense of his neighbour. It is proposed, I repeat, to promise an increase of the wages of the artisans-to share with the ployers the spoils of protection-whic h is a barefaced hoax. But what about the consumers? They are to take care of themselves. The honourable member for Hindmarsh, who represents a large number of those whose incomes are less than ^ 2 per week, has no thought whatever for them. He cares only for the band of unionists who have votes for him. That is the attitude of selfish politicians.",48
443,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What does the honourable member do for them?,48
444,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am speakon behalf of the poorest members of Then the community. The honourable member for Hindmarsh does not care for the poor unskilled labourer, so long as he can obtain a higher wage for unionists. No provision can be made to protect unskilled labour. As a panacea for the ills from the poor are suffering, - the Government proposals are a delusion and a snare. How can the dairymen, the clerks, and the miners benefit under those proposals?",48
445,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,They pay.,48
446,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the manufacturers thought that this scheme was a practicable one, every Victorian representative would vote against it. It is because they know that they may be called upon to pay increased wages only to unionists that they are prepared to tacitly assent to it. Upon every opportunity I shall denounce' the scheme, because it is opposed to the best interests of the people. I hope that at an early stage of our proceedings I shall be afforded an opportunity of moving that the consideration of the other items of the Tariff be deferred until after the consideration of the item "" wire netting.""",48
447,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member mav move it now.,48
448,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Angas) [8.14]- I think that there was some quasi understanding that no motion for the postponement of an item should be put until after the item of tobacco had been dealt with. I think the Minister exhibited an inclination, at all events, to hear anything that might be said on the point; and I hope the honourable member for Robertson will assist in having the item of tobacco considered atonce. I know that there are several people interested in the question, who, as representing the working classes, can ill afford to remain .in attendance. They have alreadv been here for two or three weeks; and they cannot be expected.to hang round until em- the day of judgment, which is, apparently, about the time when the Tariff will be disposed of.",48
449,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Corangamite) [8.16] I suggest that the whole of the first division should be put to the Committee as a division, because I think that there is scarcely any item to which exception will be taken'.",48
450,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I have two amendments to move.,49
451,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Minister might move his amendments, and the division be then put as a whole.",49
452,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Robertson) [8.17] - I move That the consideration of all items up to 1S6 inclusive, be postponed until after the consideration of "" Item 1S7-wir e netting."" The item of wire netting is of vital importance to the primary industries, in view of the fact that in various parts of Australia there is now a drought prevailing. The young stock have very little feed; and if the wire netting were released from the Customs it might be the means of saving tens of thousands of lambs. At present the rabbits are consuming the grass as fast as it grows, although there are miles cf wire netting in custody of the Customs authorities at Sydney, and possibly elsewhere, which the importers are unable to release, because the Acting Prime Minister will not give an assurance that the duty, if paid, will be refunded in the event of a reduction.",49
453,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I rise to a point of order. I desire to know whether the honourable member is in order in discussing the item of wire netting, on a motion to postpone the consideration of the previous items, order that that item may take precedence.",49
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I submit that the honourable member for Robertson is quite in order in affording such information may induce the Committee to postpone out, items in order that the item of wire netting may be considered.",49
455,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,But a similar tion might be moved in regard to every item in the Tariff.,49
456,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Of course.,49
457,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member for Robertson is quite in order.,49

459,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What about kerosene?,49
460,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,No duty is that being collected on kerosene.,49
461,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , there is ; the honourable member ought to know the fact.",49
462,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not desire to discuss the item of kerosene just now, beyond saying that there is a good deal of error in the statement made respecting it . The Acting Prime Minister has declined to give any assurance as to a refund of the duty, although there is a great demand for ' wire netting at the present moment all over Australia. Most of the wire netting imported is on order; and' even the netting imported in immense quantities by the Government of New South Wales has been detained. The wire netting seized by the State-possibl y it was an election dodge of a character of which I have previously expressed my disapproval-ha s had to be used for Government purposes. The circumstances are such that the merchants are unable to pass on any excess of duties that may be imposed; and I daily receive letters from all parts of my electorate beseeching Parliament, through me, to release the wire netting now in the custody of the Customs, because possession of it by the settlers is a matter of life and death. In the country districts, the residents are praying for rain; but if the wire netting be not made available, as soon as the rain comes the grass will be eaten up by the rabbits, with the result that the death rate amongst young stock will be enormous. This is a matter of immense importance to New South Wales;. and I hope the Committee will adopt the motion.",49
463,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not know in whether the Chairman just now gave a ruling as to whether the honourable member for Robertson could submit this motion at the present stage, and on that motion disas cuss the item of wire netting. 1 point however, that if the motion is in order, it will be open to any honourable member to make a similar proposal in regard to moany item, and have that item discussed at any time desired: I am anxious to proceed with the consideration of the Tariff in the ordinary way; but if a discussion on particular items can be brought about in the way proposed, there must be considerable at delay in completing our work. At anv rate, I have to say that the Government cannot approve of the motion of the honourable member. There are other items just as important which are on the list before of wire netting.. At present, I wish to know whether the honourable member is in and order in submitting this motion and discussing the item of wire netting before that item is reached in the ordinary way.",49
464,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I submit that the proposal is quite in order, however inconvenient it may be for the Government or the Committee. The question proposed is one entirely for the determination of the Committee, and there is nothing to prevent items of the Tariff being postponed, just as \v,e may postpone every clause of a Bill until the last clause has been passed.",49
465,Sir WILLIAM LVNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What I refer to the discussion of the item before it is reached in its order.,50
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I submit that the item may be discussed now, in so far discussion is necessary to induce the mittee to make the departure proposed; and, as a matter of order, I hold that there is no restriction on the Committee",50
467,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am sorry that the Goorder. vernment did not some time ago consider the expediency of naming some items in the Tariff which, interpreting the general sense of the Committee and the comday. munity, ought to be taken into consideration at once. We should then know exactly the position; and the whole of such items order. might be disposed of to-night. That not having been done, I can understand the position in which the honourable member for Robertson is placed, though certainly his motion may cause great inconvenience. If we discuss a proposal for postponement to the same extent as we discuss the itself, we shall be here until doomsday. The motion has the further inconvenience that the public outside will never know when particular' items in which they interested may come up for discussion. The general public who are interested watch-the passage of the Tariff, and according to the time at which they may reasonably expect certain items taken. This matter is of considerable importance to people in other States who may desire to be present when certain duties are discussed.",50

469,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I know. I do not think there is any doubt as to our power to postpone items, but the Government are .to be blamed for the necessity that seems imposed on some honourable members to suggest the postponement of particular Tariff proposals.

The effect of a proposition of the kind must be considered by honourable members. No doubt this matter relates to are order; and I am not quite in accord with the Chairman when he suggests that when a question for the postponement of items act is moved, reasons have to be given. In that relationship we shall be opening up to be an interminable discussion.",50

Mr R.EID - The Minister said today that he is going to postpone the duties relating to iron. Mr THOM AS BROWN - Yes , and he will be forced to make other departures from his rule. Why not, then, in the first instance, give preference to items of major importance, such as those relating to wire netting, tobacco, kerosene, and mining - machinery? I am afraid that if this course is not followed, honourable members, in their anxiety to deal with these major items, will rush through minor items without fairly considering them, and I should like to see reasonable consideration given to all.

Surely the honourable gentleman does not consider the proposal of the honourable I member for Robertson an insidious abuse Surely agree he cannot take that view of a suggestion to include wire netting in the half-dozen to which it is proposed to give preduty cedence?

The Government, I maintain, should deal with the items in the order in which they appear in the schedule. The second division of the Tariff relates to agricultural products and groceries. I contend that groceries and textiles affect a larger number of persons than will be affected by the duty upon wire netting. Thousands are suffering today from the to duties imposed upon groceries and tex",55
564,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,But it is generallyhonorable understood that the duty upon wire netting will be materially reduced.,55
565,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Treasurer himself has taken up two positions-first , as the Minister in charge of the Tariff, and, .secondly, as a country member. If he considers that the duty upon wire netting so .vitally affects the country, why does he not strike it off the Tariff schedule? Why does he not give notice of an amendment .that the duty shall be abolished?",55
566,Mr FULLER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,He has defended the duty already.,56
567,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yet , in his capacity as a ,country member, he professes anxiety to deal with it. I did think that he intended to be stiff-necked upon this matter. he remained so, whilst he might have lost .the vote of the honourable member for .Calare, he would have gained that of the honourable member for Dalley. In view of the declaration of the Treasurer that he .would stand firm, I am astonished that he should now agree to give precedence to the consideration of five or six particular items. Which five or six items will the ""Treasurer select? Or which items will he allow honourable members toselect? opinion is that, once we begin to select items, there will be a most unholy row; .at any rate, there will be more debate over the selection than over the whole Tariff. The tobacco items may be disposed of quickly, and then we shall reach foodstuffs and apparel, which affect thousands, and not hundreds of people. Metals and machinery follow after textiles, and I ask, - why should I permit an item of so much - Interest to my constituents to be put aside for the sake of wire netting? According as an industry possesses friends in this Chamber, so will the clamour be raised for precedence to the items which affect it. . The only claim I should make would lie that attention should first be given to those items which affect the masses, although, as a matter of fact, I am content - to consider the items of the Tariff in the order in which they appear. Mr FRAZ ER ""(Kalgoorlie) [9.1.8] - I hope the motion to interfere, with the order of the Tariff will not be accepted by the Government or by honourable members. If - we start the consideration of the Tariff by accepting proposals to give precedence' to items, I am satisfied there will be more discussion over the question of precedence than over the items if taken in their order. I appreciate to the full the difficulties of the people who are combating the rabbit pest; but, at the same time, wire netting cannot be regarded as the most important item to the people of Australia as a whole. The item may concern certain constituencies - very considerably; but it cannot be said that the duty, although it may be regarded as excessive, is endangering' Australia or any industry in Australia. The whole community are affected by the duties on foodstuffs and apparel; and a considerable section are paying absolutely unjustifiable charges for kerosene. A further clamour is raised that a great' distributing house is to be ruined if the duty is not immediately removed from magazines; but a number of the duties on some metals and machinery , Had which, in my opinion, have not a chance of being approved by this House, are injuring to a considerable degree one of the great primary industries of the. country. Once we depart from the order of the Tariff, every honourable member will be concerned to see that the best is done for his particular constituency; and the results will be very much more serious than those foreshadowed by the honourable member for Robertson and others in connection My own with the duty on wire netting. Although items which affect my constituency very considerably are low down in the schedule, I am prepared to consider the duties in the order in which they have been submitted to us, believing - that anv departure will only lead to immense trouble. The Acting Prime Minister does not seem disposed to name items to which he would give precedence, and I point out to him that it would be an absolute impossibility to obtain agreement in such a matter. I think we may pass several of the divisions with very - little debate, and thus speedily reach ' the item of wire netting which so concerns the honourable member for Robertson.",56
568,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Swan) [9.24] - ' The proposal of the Treasurer appears to me to be a reasonable one, which honourable members may well accept. The honourable gentleman has recognised the difficulty we are placed in, especially in regard to wire netting and some other important items; but I do not think he is accurate in suggesting, that there is a desire on the part of honourable members to take the business out of the hands of the Government. Any attempt of the kind could not, of course, be permitted by the Government, but they might have avoided any difficulty by doing, on their own motion, what they have now said they are willing to do. I hope that the Government will submit a moderate number of items which are very pressing, which they can easily decide upon, and which are most desired by members to be at once dealt with.",56

573,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"West Sydney) [9-26] I did not have the advantage of hearing the honourable member for Robertson, but I am of opinion that if the Government depart from the printed list they will make a great mistake, for which, they will be sorry for some time to come. The Treasurer invited all honourable members on this side, who were not protectionists, to go to the other side. I do not know that the honourable gentleman can afford to bid any honourable members here to go to the other side; although he might have extended an invitation to protectionists opposite to cross the floor, because I think he will require them all . I shall certainly oppose any alteration in the order of the schedule, because it would mean that any one, whose electorate was interested in a particular item, could alter the order of the whole of the Tariff. If we to consider items which are most important, we ought to take those which affect the most people; and when we consider people, and not sheep and rabbits, we ought to deal with groceries, textiles, and so forth. The honourable member for Swan regards the proposal of the Government as a reasonable one; but the Treasurer is old enough in politics to know that when honourable members opposite regard any proposals of his as reasonable, he ought to be a little suspicious-h e ought to beware of the Greeks, especially when they bring gifts. ""If I were in the Treasurer's position, and the right honourable member for Swan described any proposal of mine as reasonable, I should begin to wonder what mistake I had made. However, if we once begin to select items, a dozen will grow into twenty-four, and, even then, honourable members would not be satisfied; finally, the order of precedence will cause more discussion than will the merits4 of the items. There are a number of items on which there need be no discussion; and if the leader of the Opposition takes a reasonable view, he will not unduly press debate on questions which are a foregone conclusion. The right honourable gentleman has the opportunity to shorten the discussion almost immeasurably, and if he sets the pace, I shall be only too happy to follow his lead in this connection. We shall reach the item of wire netting in due course, and, on the way, deal with other items which are of much more importance. If it is to be a question of tactics, and the Acting Prime Minister accedes to requests made by certain honourable members, he must also consider what others desire. We have the schedule in black and white, and if we depart from it what will be the result? A representative of Messrs. Gordon and Gotch told me the other day that he woulcl lose ^20,000 if the item relating to magazines, were not speedily dealt with. I replied, "" I do not care whether you lose ^20,000 or ,£20,000,000, - I shall not vote for a variation of the order in which items appear in the schedule."" The duty on magazines is highly important to thousands of distributors throughout the Commonwealth, but every one affected by the Tariff must take his chance.

But is it not a sad commentary on the work of the authors of the Tariff that, within two months of its introduction, we - are told that in consequence of it hundreds of workers in the tobacco industry have been thrown out of employment?

No section do of the community is more severely hit under Tariff than are the farmers. Every article they require is subject to a duty. I repeat that it is a sad commentary on the Tariff that we already have indications that industries are being ruined by it.

The Minister told us that an Excise duty would be imposed on all goods that were protected, and that it would be remitted if certain conditions were observed. We now have before us an item in respect of which protection is given to the local manufacturer, and in dealing with it we are beset with two difficulties. In the first place, 'we have had no intimation as to whether or not those engaged in the industry will be subject to the Excise duty mentioned by the Treasurer; whilst the other is that the item is one to which an Excise duty already applies. How does the Minister intend to deal with this item so far as the new protection proposals are concerned?",58
588,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The member must recognise that that Excise duty is to be imposed only where the manufacturer refuses to do what is required of him.,59

But we must either do that, or deal with the Tariff first, leaving the posals relating to the new protection considered afterwards. I do not know which is the better course, but the ment, has charge of this business, and Treasurer has said that he intends with, the Tariff first, and to subsequentlv bring forward his new protection proposals. The contention of the honourable member the matter. for North Sydney that, having passed the .Tariff, we cannot re-consider any of its items, is of great weight, and if ""we deal with the Tariff before considering the new protectitin proposals, our hands will largely tied in regard to them.' I think undesirable to, at this stage, launch into debate on the principles of the new prothat tection, which may occupy three' or four weeks. It is really a conflict of difficulties, alnd it seems to me that the urgency of posing of the Tariff is paramount to other considerations. I think, therefore, that our better course is to postpone all arguments relating to the new protection until the proposals concerning it are brought before us.",59

[9-.53]-- I think that the Government might bring forward its proposals relating to the new - protection in an explanatory memorandum. That has frequently been done l>45]- 2 as the when new proposals have been submitted, with, and it has been done even in regard to are Bills. Why should not the new protection the proposals be embodied in a memorandum, to half the if only in outline?",60
601,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,They were outlined yes,60
602,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I advise the honorI able member for Parramatta to read the statement which I have made in regard 10,60
603,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I wish to amongst other things, if the proposed new Excise will be equivalent to half Exthe whole of the duty, or merely to half pf any increase in duty, and I should like a. list of the industries to which it is intended with that the new protection shall apply. We the should have such a list before us in dealing in detail with the items of the Tariff. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. in reBATCHELOR) - Does the honourable member think that this matter is involved in the item before the Chair?",60
604,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,We should have to get a great deal more information than I that. The Government would have to set be .forth all the conditions of exemption.,60

609,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not wish to hear the honourable member say "" Oh . "" I am speaking, not to him, but to the Combe mittee. I am tired of his humbug. As he it cannot argue the question, he sits in his a chair grunting. He told us this afternoon he, and others, propose to give further protection to Australian industries in consideration of the new protection that'is disto be provided for. But I ask the honorall able member for South Sydney whether he thinks that the Tariff should be dealt with before we know to what items the new protection will apply ? Are we to pass the Tariff, leaving the Government to apply the new protection to such items as it",60
610,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The new protection does not affect the ""items of the Tariff.",60
611,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It should affect our decisions in regard to the rates of duty. The questions raised by the honourable member for North Sydney aire very pertinent. We should know whether, in regard to industries affected by an Excise, an additonal Excise may be imposed, and whether that Excise will be equivalent to half the duty or to half the increase in duty.",60
612,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"How affect the discussion of the items of the Tariff? Mr JOSE PH COOK - The honourable member keeps repeating that question because he knows nothing about the matter. A simple explanation would save time, but the Minister cannot make one. He knows as much about the new protection as he does about the other subjects which he brings before the Chamber, and that is nothing at all.",61
613,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"And he"" does not know enough to know that he knows nothing.",61
614,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is the trouble. As we can get nothing from the Minister about the new protection, I ask the honourable member for South Sydney whether the special Excise will be imposed in cases where there is already an Excise, and whether it is to be equivalent the duty, or to half the increase?",61
615,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"O r is it to be half the difference between the import duty and the Excise ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - That is.another matter. One might well think that the Government would have looked into the tively. point before putting forward any proposals. We ought to know all about proposals before dealing with the Tariff. Mr Reid . (East Sydney) hope that the Minister will be a little patient, because an explanation now may must ask the honourable member to discuss help the passing of a number of items.",61
616,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not see that the new protection proposals affect the consideration of the Tariff in the slightest degree. . Mr Reid - Does the Acting Prime to everything. Minister seriously contend that they are to have not the slightest influence with the Committee in considering the Tariff?,61
617,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The protection of erally applied? the workers is to be provided for by special Excise. That fact may influence honourable members in dealing with certain items on the Tariff. But the exact posals of the Government in reference the; new protection do not affect the items of the Tariff.,61

620,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If distilleries are in'the list, surely breweries will be there, because they employ more men, and are of more importance. I hope that the Treacan that surer will re-consider the matter. I want, to ask a further question of a very simple character. I do not ask the Treasurer to tell me what are the exact provisions of a Bill which is not yet in existence, and the drafting of which will occupy a considerable time. But, apart from the conditions which will be embodied in the measure, the Treasurer might say whether the proposed Excise provisions will be applied to the whole of the items upon which duties have been imposed. Is the beneficent and benevolent scheme which the Government are incubating to be applied to all the items of the Tariff, or is it to-be confined to some of those items?",61
621,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I have said previously that a list of the items which the Government desire to be subjected to the to 'half Excise will be submitted.,61

I should like to know what has been ' - done to insure that spirits imported from abroad are of the age required under the schedule we passed a little while ago. I ^understood that recently it was proposed-J do not know whether the proposal was put in actual operation-that the declaration of the importer should be accepted as. sufficient proof of the age of the spirit. If that proposal has been carried out, it - seems to be altogether inadequate, especially when compared with what is laid «36wn for ascertaining the age of locallyproduced spirits, which are under Customs - supervision for two years from their distillation before being placed on the - market. I am glad to see that the Minister has not, apparently, so far agreed to - waive or attempt to alter that law. regard to imported spirits, I pointed out, when the proposal was under consideration to insist on an age limit, that both in - Great Britain and in France the age could be certified to by responsible people.'

In the past, the custom of the Department has been to - accept declarations; always recognising, however, that - these were really not. sufficient, or, at any rate, --- did not constitute as good a proof of age as was demanded f rOm the local producer. We have been endeavouring to obtain Excise certificates,, but I regret to say that, so far, we. have not been so successful as w.e should like-that we have not received the assistance to which we think the Department is entitled from Excise officers and .others in authority across the. sea. The practice, of the Department is'now, and will be in the future-, to insist on the most .absolute proof that imported spirits are as full y matured as are local spirits before being placed on the market.' Only today I received a'deputation of gentlemen who asked that the Act might be amended, so as to make the demand on the local distiller not so stringent ; but I could not make anv promise, feeling that it would be difficult to pilot such a proposal through Parliament. In any case, fair notice was given; and if people have allowed their Supplies to 'run short, they have done so with their eyes open. There are others who have laid in In fair stocks; and to amend the Act would do an injustice to those who, are prepared to carry out the law.

668,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Angas) [10.29] - As to a request for an extension of time in regard to the maturing of spirits, there is a great difference between the circumstances of. some of the growers;, say, of South Australia, and the growers of other parts of the Commonwealth. Those in South Australia must wait for the vintage; and they have not had time in which to mature the spirits. Their difficulty was that they did not get sufficient time to secure the vintages necessary to give them the spirit required. the circumstances, their request was very TGcLSOflElblG *",65

The facts put before us go only to show the fraud.that they have been perpetrating. We should', insist upon spirit being matured in wood for at least two years. If local vignerons cannot supply the demand, then it can be met by importations. Are we - to enforce on the consumers the use of a vile immatured spirit ?",65

Are we to allow people to sell the vile immature liquor which they have supplied in the past, to the ruin of the health of many' of our citizens ? I think not. A constant opposition has been shown to the Act, especially on the part of certain people in South Australia, who do a large trade iii Australian brandy. There is in my electorate a supply of matured spirit in wood which will command the trade until the South Australian or the Victorian distillers have matured their spirit in accordance with the Act. The importers are as bad as the local manufacturers, since they are also prepared to supply immature spirit: - They are selling it at a low rate in order to get rid of it within the period specified by the Act. I hope that the Minister will insist upon the observance of the provisions of that measure.",65

I am glad, also, that he does not intend to grant any extension of time. Whilst it may be true that some of the distillers in South Australia have no stocks, I am satisIn fied that those who are so situated would probably be in the same position if an extension were granted. Even in South Australia there is a large stock of matured spirit, which, if necessary, can be obtained. If the time' were extended it would be very unfair to those who are keeping a stock until the beginning of the year. I They am quite satisfied that, if we have not in South Australia a supply of matured spirit sufficient to satisfy all requirements,"" it can be obtained in other parts of the Commonwealth. If it cannot then there will be nothing to prevent our securing it from abroad. There may be one or two cases of hardship occurring under the Act, but if any hardship is to be'suffered it should If not be borne by those who have made a reasonable effort to comply with the law.",65

677,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the honourable member has, his vision for the moment is somewhat distorted. It is a most serious thing to talk as the honourable member has done of wines or brandies which have not attained the standard of purity required by the Act. I think that he is mistaken. I have not had interviews with the winegrowers, except that I have casually met them on the Adelaide express, and. have asked them why they were coming to .Melbourne. Last year we passed an Act in connection with the duties on. spirits, and it was . pointed out, in. the course of the debate upon it , that pot-still brandy, which as ah element represents 25 per cent., of the total, must be matured for two years in order to eliminate certain vapours. was also shown that 75 per cent, of the constituents of brandy-that is the rectified grape spirit - does not require to be matured for two years. Parliament decided to the contrary.0 - I desire, in fairness to the spirit industry of South Australia, to point out that, it was stated by experts that it is unnecessary to keep 75 per cent, of the constituents of brandy for two years, that the rectified spirit itself does not require to be kept for that period. Pot still brandy is kept for about two years, but if the whole composition were kept in wood for . such a time the spirit would have no power. The difficulty of the distillers is. that they have not been able to-comply with the terms of an Act which prescribes that spirit which does not, in their opinion, .require maturity must be matured for two years. They are endeavouring to comply with that provision.",65
678,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Has the honourable memshould ber ever tried to drink whisky that has been matured?,66
679,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am a teetotaller. Parliament has determined that spirit shall be kept in wood for two years, distillers simply ask for an extension of the time within which that provision is to come into operation.",66

682,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It produces, good wine brandy, and does a - large trade - in it. The distilleries there have desire to produce a second-rate brandy- a blending of 25 per cent, of wine spirit gallon, 14s. with 75 per cent, of unmatured spirit.",66

685,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member is doing a great injustice to South Australia.,66
686,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have . been watching those engaged in the industry. The South Australians, who produce a first-class brandy, were granted protection, and they set up an agitation to be allowed It to produce a blend of second-rate brandy. One may enter - an hotel, and imagine that he has been supplied with a pure brandy, when, as a matter of fact, he has received The a glass of blended liquor made from sugar spirit and wine spirit, chiefly at the instigation of .interested wine-growers and brandy makers in South Australia, who, a year ago, stood at. the doors of this Parliament trying to buttonholeevery honourable member.",66
687,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member is libelling South Australia. Mr HENRY WILLIS , - We have in Australia"" today a first-class brandy, and the South Australians should take a back seat until they can compete with the brandy makers of New South Wales.",66
688,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hindmarsh) [TO.41] - The statement just made by the honourable member for Robertson is absolutely incorrect in every particular. It is most unfair that the honourable member thus libel those who, throughout not Australia, are known as being amongst the best wine makers and brandy distillers The in the Commonwealth. Mr .HENRY WILLIS - What is the South and the Australian blended brandy?",66
689,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It is a pure grape spirit.,66

South Ausbetralian wine makers were most anxious that the Act in question should be passed.

703,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the' industrial ether con-' tains under 10 per cent., the Government' should not penalize the manufacturer",68
704,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"We must get a revenue from the spirit.

706,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,South Sydney) [ LI . O ] . - It would appear from this item that the Government have reduced the duty on wine with the lower proportion of proof spirit. There ought to be some explanation of that. ,68
707,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"This is taken from: the Tariff Commission's report. ' - Mr WATSON - Bot h sections of the Tariff. Commission left the old duty uhv altered. The lowest duty was 6s. ' . I glo not see any - need'--toreduce - it, - becauseat wine with 25 per cent, of proof spirit has quite sufficient fortification for ordinary purposes.",68
708,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Our wines are higher than that:,69
709,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Our sweet wines are higher, but I do not think the dry wines are. These are foreign wines.",69
710,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"We request that our wines be admitted, to England, in spite of the higher strength, at the lower duty.",69
711,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I think the maximum in the sweet wines which we export is 35 per cent.,69
712,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It goes over 40 per cent, in some cases.",69
713,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"In the dry wines the percentage is not nearly so great. At any rate, it israther unusual to find the Government reducing the duty on items which have been passed by both sections of the Tariff Commission as sufficient. This can be no question of preference to the old country, because they do not produce wine to any extent. I see no reason to reduce the duty.",69
714,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Hume-Trea surer) [11.3] - This was done by the Department to bring the duty into unison .with item No. 8.,69
715,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It is not quite in unison .with .that item.,69
716,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is so far as paragraph A of item 8 is concerned. The Department' has done this of its own accord, for the reason I have stated. I cannot say at this moment why it should have been done.",69
717,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If that is the only reason, would it not be better to adhere to the old duty ?",69
718,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"This is a beverage. The other, in item 8, is for industrial purposes.",69
719,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Lang) '[11.4] - This is not wine in the ordinary acceptation of the term. It is not wine manufactured from fermented grape juice, and is not made commercially in Australia. It is really more in the nature of a cordial.",69
720,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It includes grape wines.,69
721,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It specifically excludes grape wines. The item refers to ginger wine and other beverages which contain a comparatively small percentage of alcohol. I take it that the reason for including them here is so that the' duty will be 'upon their alcoholic contents. . Mr FOWLER (Perth) [ i r . 5 ] - Even if these wines are"" of the character indicated by the honourable member for Lang, I cannot see why they should come in at the lower rate. Ginger wine, containing, say, 24 per cent, of proof spirit, is quite as. much entitled to pay the full rate as agrape wine of that strength. This will allow a ginger wine, containing a high percentage of proof spirit, to come in at the lower rate, which, in my opinion, is a thing that we ought to discourage ",69
722,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"East Sydney) [ n . 6 ] - I certainly think that this alteration requires some serious explanation, because - it is really encouraging the 3s. 6d. item at the expense of duties which range much higher - up to 8s. in bottle and 6s. in bulk. To do so is contrary to the policy of the Tariff I should think. Wine n.e.i. means, of course, all wine not included in items 11, 12, and 13. The honourable member for South Sydney is quite correct in his interpretation. It does seem that the Department is not, only capriciously reducing the recommendation of the Tariff Commission,'but is also acting contrary to the wisdom of those who framed the Tariff of 1902. We may take it that in 1902 this matter must have been very f u l ly considered. Then the Tariff Commission comes along, and both sections of it recommend a provision in accordance with the Act of 1902. So that we have both the Act of 1902 and the recommendations of the two wings of the Tariff Commission in favour of keeping up the higher jate. But suddenly the Government' propose a drop of nearly 50 per cent. I do not think we should consent to what is proposed. It is not in the interest of the revenue, and it would encourage inferior wine in competition with the .better classes at the higher duty.",69
723,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Does not what is proposed include sake, the Japanese drink ?",69
724,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That would, I suppose, come in at 3s. 6d. I take it that the Acting Prime Minister will see at once that this sudden drop is not wise. Of course, if the liquid in question Were used for industrial purposes it might be wise to reduce the duty, but if it is a beverage it is a mistake.",69
725,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I will look into the matter tomorrow.,69
726,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Minister might as well postpone the item. In the absence of better information the better course would be to postpone it .,69
727,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.8] - I certainly think that I ' should have been possessed of more inforprovided mation on the point than I have. I think House. that the Department should have given me that information. I shall consent to postthe pone the item until I understand it better. The only information I have is not suffiexistence cient to show why the smaller duty is recomlected' mended. ,  may be some injury to the revenue if the is item is postponed, after the discussion allabsolute which we have had. If it is seen that porters there is some chance of a higher duty being imposed, goods will be withdrawn from bond, and the revenue will suffer. think we ought to put the duty back to the old rate.",69
728,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Boothby) [11.11]. The Minister should give some sideration to the suggestion of the honorduties able member for Grey. The duty should be put back to the old rate to protect revenue, and then, if the Minister finds granting a mandamus. after consultation with the officers there is some real reason why the duty should be reduced, the item can be recomthe mitted. But the revenue will suffer if it postponed.",70
729,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"East Sydney) [11.12] think that the suggestion of the honourable member for Grey might be adopted, exexisting cept for this reason : In case the new are below the old duties, the higher duties are always collected. In this case, for in the Customs. stance, the higher duty will be. collected.",70
730,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The higher rate is deposited.,70
731,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If that be so, the revenue is protected, and we do not sider that point. We have an assurance from the Minister of Trade and Customs that the higher rate is always collected, and, therefore, there is no need thing but postpone the item.",70
732,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Angas) [11.13]-- I d° not think that the Department can collect the duty under the old Tariff. The only - duty that they can collect is that cordance with the resolution passed by this House. The rule as to collecting higher duty only applies where there doubt as to what duty should be collected. It would be an extraordinary position Department could collect the duty under the old Tariff. What is provided in the Mr FISHER (Wide Bay) [ II . I 6 ] Customs Act is that where there is as to what the duty is, the Department shall collect the higher duty j but it would ""be ridiculous if they were to collect duty under the old Tariff, and not that gallon now. for in the ""resolution of this",70
733,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"East Sydney) [11:14] - If Tariff now under consideration were not passed the old Tariff would be in all the time, and the duties colwould be contrary to a law which has never been' repealed. The only reae son for collecting the duties imposed in accordance with the resolution of this.House necessity. But they are illegal the time. In Sydney. a firm of imapplied to the Supreme Court for a mandamus to compel the Collector of Customs to deliver up their goods to them. I Those goods were not liable to duty by law, though they were liable under a resolution of this House. The Court decided not to issue the writ, on the ground that, from conpublic necessity and long practice, the were collected in anticipation of an Act of Parliament. Parliament always the has its remedy in the event of the Courts Parliament, in that such an event, could immediately pass a law to make the duties in accordance with resolution of one House legal for the ' is time being. It is a matter of practice to collect the higher duty, and my own imI pression is that when the Tariff of 1902 was being discussed in Committee, if the State laws' imposed a higher duty duties than the new Commonwealth Tariff proposed, that higher duty, was collected by",70
734,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Customs Department would then put' six different laws in force.,70
735,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Department is now doing exactly what the right need to conhonorable member says.,70
736,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I know that it was so in 1902, and that practice, the Minister tells to do anyme, is now being pursued. Sir WILLIAM LYNE.;-The Department is collecting the 6s. and'8s. per gallon now.",70
737,Mr REID,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is the proper course - to adopt, because if the duty be reduced, in acfhe excess can always be refunded.",70
