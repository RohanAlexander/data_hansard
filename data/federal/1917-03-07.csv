H is father was a German, biit he was born in Australia, has spent all his life in this country, and has all his interests here. I ought to have known better, because I have known Mr . Wetzel for many years, and I regret that I inadvertently misstated his nationality. As what I said may have caused him some l it t l e difficulty, I make this explanation ""in the desire to relieve him in that respect, and to express my regret for the mistake.",5
3,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"My attention has heen called to the following paragraph which appears in this morning's Age. The communication purports to have been sent from BallaratTt is stated in political circles in Ballarat ""thut Mr Manifold, M.P., of Camperdown, will probably not seek re-election as the representative of Corangamite, and that in the event of this being the case, the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) will be asked to contest the seat.

11,Mr GROOM,HOLDSWORTHY INTERNME NT,"The honourable member for Nepean has asked whether a Select Committee will be appointed to in quire into matters connected with the administration of theGerman concentration camp at Holdsworthy. The reply f u r nished to me is as follows:It is considered that a Select Committee to inquire into the system and conditions in vogue at the Holdsworthy Concentration Camp is unnecessary, as both of the matters mentioned are disciplinary, and can be dealt with by the responsible officers. As a matter of fact, certain charges on these matters were brought to the notice of the Minister, who at once despatched a senior officer from head-quarters, Melbourne, to make full inquiry and report. This report shows that there was gross exagin the charges. Where certain matters were found defective, steps were at once taken to prevent repetition. The treatment of internees is based on rules and regulations laid down for the government of similar concentraLondon, directtion camps in England. CAMP MEAL HOURS.",5

15,Sir JOHN FORREST,HOLDSWORTHY INTERNME NT,"I am under 1,000 the impression that the rates of the penskilled sions are governed a good deal by circuma stances. I shall be glad to do anything to facilitate the receipt of pensions by those entitled to them, but I ask the honnavvies, orable member to put his question on the notice-paper.",6
16,Mr FINLAYSON,HOLDSWORTHY INTERNME NT,"Will the Minister family, representing the Minister for Defence the make inquiries into the position that has arisen in the Seymour camp, where a and number of men from Queensland, some of for whom have already seen two years' serto Australia. vice at the front, and are now returning to the firing line, have, been refused final leave to visit their relatives in In some cases they have been refused local leave to see relatives who had come south to see them.",6
17,Mr GROOM,HOLDSWORTHY INTERNME NT,"It is possible that these cases final leave was taken > before the men came south. If the honourable member will give me the question I will endeavour to supply him with an answer tomorrow. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - In the event of favourable consideration being given to the suggestion made by the honthere orable member for Brisbane regarding members of the forces, who are resident in Brisbane, getting final leave to visit their relatives and friends, will a similar privilege be extended to the residents of other States who are similarly situated ?",6

20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I desire to a correction on behalf of the Prime Minister, who has sent me the following, Wit h reference to my reply on the 23rd Febto an inquiry by the honourable member for Wimmera as to the conditions under which carpenters are to be sent to Great Britain, I desire to add that the carpenters, being, artisans, will proceed to England under similar agreement to that which applies to munition workers. I find I incorrectly stated the position with regard to the dependants of the carpenters. That provision applies to the but not to the carpenters, who, as munition workers are, in the case of those married or are the sole support of mother o r entitled to an allowance as follows :For the first eight weeks after embarkation at rate of 25s. per week, and 2s. 6d. per week for each child under the age of sixteen years, thereafter 20s. per week and 2s. per week each child under the age of sixteen years until the date of their landing on their return, Brisbane ? SINKING OF AUSTRALIAN SHIPS.",6
21,Mr BOYD,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"In view of the very serious statement made yesterday by the Prime Minister that two vessels had been in sunk off the Australian coast, and the wild rumours to which the statement has given rise, will the Minister representing the Prime Minister obtain the consent of the Prime Minister to make the factspublic, in order to set the public mind at rest? It is a.good deal worse to haverumours circulated when we know that is an element of truth in theih than to set the whole facts before the people.",6
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,As to the fact itself I find that I inadvertently fell into an error last evening when replying to the observations of the honourable member for Capricornia. I am reported in Hansard to have said I understand that the honourable member for Capricornia has been saying that the statement as to the sinking of troopships is an electioneering dodge. Mr HiGOS - I spoke of stopping the sailing of troopships. I do not deny the sinking.,6
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"May I tell the honourable member, in order to dispose of this myth at once, that the information came i "" a cable from the Admiralty today, and there is no doubt whatever about the fact. The truth is that no troopships whatever have been sunk. I tried to make that clear in a statement. I made to the press.  ter nor you said that any troopships had been sunk.",7
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"At any rate the fact is that no troopships have been sunk, nor have any lives been lost.",7
25,Mr BOYD,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,Hav e any other ships been sunk ?,7
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,May I ask the honourable member to defer that question until tomorrow?,7
27,Mr BOYD,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,I do not think it should be deferred.,7
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"We are not entirely our own masters as to this information, and there are public reasons for not being precipitate in answering these questions. If the honourable member will repeat the question tomorrow, I will try to get him an answer. In the meantime I wish to make the fact perfectly clear that no troopships have been sunk and no lives have been lost. Mr Fenton/ - Has the Minister representing the Prime Minister read in this morning's Age a half column account of an investigation now in progress in Cape Town as to the mysterious sinking of a ship in the India n Ocean? Is the sinking of that ship in any way confused with the information that has come to hand?",7
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,I do not think there is any confusion or mix up at all . I think these matters are all related.,7
30,Mr TUDOR,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,Is it not a fact that the danger is not as bad near our coast as it is on the A f r i c a n side? The ships cannot complete their journey.,7
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,Thes e matters cannot be made public.,7
32,Mr TUDOR,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,Then why was publicity started by the Prime Minister.,7
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I suppose for the same reason that these questions are being asked now all round the Housebecause the people are anxious regarding this matter. Perhaps I had better say little on the subject, but this much may be said with propriety, that the dangers of the situation are not less than they were. For the rest, honourable members will have to wait for such information as can be properly made public. REGISTERED UNIONS. RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITUBE.",7
34,Mr GREGORY,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he will have regulations prepared and gazetted under the Commonwealth Arbitratio n Act which will compel all registered unions to lodge annually, or half-yearly, certified audited returns of receipts and expenditure, and showing specifically amounts distributed in sick, accident, out of work, aud other relief to members, and amounts expended in administration and organization ?",7
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I shall bring the question under the notice of the Prime Minister. Personally, I see no reason why this information should not be published. NORTHERN TERRITORY: ADMINISTRATOR.  the Government are doing in respect to the appointment of an Administrator for the Northern Territory. We have been informed that Parliament will be prorogued in a fortnight, and the term of the present Administrator expires at the end of March. The House and the country ought to know the Government's intentions in regard to the present A d ministrator, and the fillin g of the position.",7
36,Mr GLYNN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I think that the matter will be decided at a very early date. The Cabinet, have recently been devoting attention to the matter, which, of course, is one of paramount importance. I hope that a decision will be come to with in a week. _ Mr Mahon - F o l l o w in g up the question put by the honourable member for Maranoa, I desire to ask the Minister for Home and Territories whether an apfor pointment to the office of Administrator of the Northern Territory is about to made by this moribund Government. I so, it is quite unusual. The Government is now appealing to the people, and has no right to make any permanent appointhave ment until it bas been determined whether home ? it has the support of the people?",7
37,Mr GLYNN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I can assure the orable member that all tbese considerame tions have been taken into account by Government. The question is under conto me:sideration, and only pressure of Cabinet business prevented a conclusion being oorne to today. There is always tinction between continuing an adminisgranted tration-that is to say, filling positions which become vacant in the ordinary course-and making an appointment to a new office.",8
38,Mr KELLY,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"In considering the view nut before hi m by the honourable member that for Kalgoorlie-the view that this Gomembers vernment, beins moribund, is constitumediately tionally incapable of making any apI pointment-wil l the Minister for Home and Tprritories also take into considerathese tion the fact that he was asked a before onestion by the honourable member for Miiranoa which seemed to imply the beis not necessary. lief that, after the coming election, the honourable gentleman will still be in a factory to them. position to make this appointment?",8
39,Mr GLYNN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I was absolutely unconis scious of any relation of either distincthat is what we have to consider. tion or extinction between the elections and myself, or, as Mr Micawber would snv, as to the prolongation of longevity. I have, I suppose, retained some of my pristine simplicity, and when I answered the honourable member for Maranoa I was so confident of the future or so unconscious of the fact that an election was to tnke plane, that I spoke as if an appeal to the people was not to take place immematter. diately. RETIRED OFFICERS: LEAVE.",8
40,Mr ORCHARD,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that a regulation has recently been issued to the following effect:Officers of the Commonwealth Service who have served with the Australian Imperial ""Force are not entitled, after resuming civil - duty, to recreation leave in respect of the period of military duty with the Forces, nor the year in which they resume duty. Has the Government considered the be penalizing effect of this regulation on f members of the Service who have served their country in the M i l it a r y Forces at the front , as compared with others who not done so, but have remained at",8
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"The honourable honmember was good enough to intimate to his intention to ask this question, and the the following answer has been supplied The question was raised as to whether officers of the Commonwealth Public Service who have resumed duty, after service with a disthe Australian Imperial Force, should be recreation leave for the year in which they resumed duty. Consideration was given to the matter by Cabinet, and it was decided, on the recommendation of the Acting Public Service Commissioner, that annual leave would not be granted to such officers for the year in question. In arriving at this determination, it was borne in mind it is customary to grant military leave to of the Australian Imperial Force imprior to discharge. infer from the answer that the Public Service Commissioner is of opinion that men had already had their leave their actual discharge. If that be so, it seems to me that the further leave",8
42,Mr ORCHARD,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,That is not very satis,8
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"The question whether the decision is fair and justIf these officers have had their leave immediately prior to their discharge, it amounts to the same thing, I imagine, as if they got it after their discharge.",8
44,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,They got the ordinary leave given to returned men.,8
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I do not know about that, but I shall inquire into the If anything unfair is being done, I shall give the honourable member further information. IMPERIAL CONFERENCE: REPRESENTATION.",8
46,Dr MALONEY,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"In view of the fact that the elections may not take place u n t i l the middle of May, have the Government considered, and if not, will they consider, the question of appointing Mr Fisher, the High Commissioner, and, if a second representative be required, Sir George Eeid, to act on behalf of Australia?",8
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I can only say . that the work of the proposed Imperial Conference is such that no public servant, however highly placed, can be considered as adequately representative of Ausis tralia, ADMIRALTYCABLE : ORDINAEY parties",9
48,Mr HAMPSON,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"In reference to the cable received yesterday from the British Admiralty, I should like to know whether all sailings from Australia to Great B r it a in are prohibited at the present time?",9
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,That is so as regards troopships.,9
50,Mr HAMPSON,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,But not ordinary sailthat ings ?,9
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"No ; the cable applies only to troopships, and ordinary sailings will go on. EEPATEIATION.",9
52,Mr RODGERS,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,Is the House likely soldiers to have an opportunity to consider the complete Government scheme for repatriAs ation before we go to the country?,9
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"That does not look promising at the moment. I heartily wish it were so, and I am hopeful that the Minister, who is busily engaged on matter",9
54,Dr CARTY SALMON,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,Who is the M in ister?,9
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"Senato r M i l len, the Vice-President of the Executive scrutiny. Council. That gentleman has already given a good deal of time and labour to the question, and is still busily engaged in shaping a memorandum of ther the whole scheme, which will be subnominations mitted for the consideration of the Cabinet. I can only express the very earnest hope that the matter may be pushed to completion at the earliest possible moment. My colleague has been working very hard, and has been losing no time in dealing with the subject. He has interviewed number of people, and, I believe, sought the assistance - of the honourable member, amongst others, as I hope he w seek the aid of any honourable member ""who can give him any suggestion regarding this very important matter. ELECTIONS. SOLDIERS' VOTES - REVISION OF ROLLS POSTAL VOTE .",9
56,Mr BURNS,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,I wish to ask the M in ister for Home and Territories whether it the intention of the Government when taking a vote of the soldiers at the front and in England to allow the different to appoint scrutineers to supervise SAILINGS. the voting ?,9
57,Mr GLYNN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"Provisio n to that effect will be made. We shall give every opportunity for the scrutiny; and the voting of the soldiers will be, as I believe the last ought to have been, above suspicion.",9
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"This is a very important matter, and, by leave, I should like to say that the Government will welcome from the other side any suggestion will secure the bona fides of the voting at the front. If my honourable friends of the Opposition have any proposition of the kind to make I am sure that the Minister in charge will welcome it .",9
59,Mr GLYNN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I said that every care would be taken to make the poll of at the front above suspicion, as I believed the last ought to have been. that remark may give rise to some misapprehension, I wish to state, since the question of the referendum vote has been raised, that I have gone into the matter, and see no cause to doubt the absothe lute straightforwardness with which the whole of the voting at the front was conducted. To allay any possible anxiety on the point, provision is made so that the official Opposition, as well as Ministerial- ists, will have a representative at the",9
60,Mr KING OMALLEY,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,I ask the Minister for Home and Territories whethere will be sufficient time after the have been received to forward to Australian soldiers at the front and in England the names of the candidates? I . should like my name to be sent across.,9
61,Mr GLYNN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I was under the impression that the honourable member's name was known to the universe. Apparently a one cannot always judge by appearances. has I can assure the honourable member that what he suggests will be done, and that ill all necessary information will be cabled forthwith.",9
62,Mr BURNS,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,Can the Minister for Home and Territories state if it is a fact that the Prime Minister issued instructions to the Chief Electoral Officer at the late referendum that no scrutineers were to be allowed to check the votes of the soldiers at the front?,9
63,Mr GLYNN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I have not heard that such instructions were issued. I have endeavoured to find out generally so far as time would permit what has been done, and I know the scrutiny was conducted with very great care in England. Several men who acted as scrutineers there were actually officers of the Electoral Department on service, and other reliable men were associated with them, so that everything should be scrupulously fair in appearance and fact. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Will the Minister for Home and Territories arrange that the ballot-boxes for the votes of soldiers in Europe shall be left in the hands of the civil authorities, and not in the hands of the military, when the ballot is being taken ? Will he place General Anderson, for instance, or some other well known man at the head of the business?",10
64,Mr GLYNN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I cannot promise to put the ballot-boxes entirely in the hands of the civil authorities, because it would be impossible to get the poll taken at the front in such a way as to enable the greatest number of men to vote, if that were done. The scrutiny was conducted on the last occasion at head-quarters at our London offices by the gentleman to whom the honourable member has referred. He was assisted by the electoral officers I mentioned before, and by several other prominent men in England. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - In view of the fact that many thousands of reputable people-aged , infirm, or sickhave been deprived of the right to exercise their franchise through inability to go to the polling booths, will the Minister for Home and Territories ask the Government to take steps before the general election to restore the postal vote to enable those people to record their votes?",10
65,Mr GLYNN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,The matter is actually being considered at the present time. The only doubt is whether it will be possible to carry such an amendment of the Aot in the time now available.,10
66,Mr TUDOR,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I understand that in Victoria-and perhaps it is so in all the States-the letter-carriers have been engaged in the collection and the purification of the rolls. They hand to the Returning Officer lists containing the names of new residents in their district, and also the names of those who have removed. Will the Minister for Home and Territories have those lists acted upon, and a notification sent to the persons whose names have been handed into the Returning Officers as having changed their address? That would be a more economical course than issuing summonses against these people for being off the roll.",10
67,Mr GLYNN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"It has been the practice for some time to secure the assistance of postmen, and also. I think, the police, in checking .the rolls.",10
68,Mr TUDOR,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,The work was never so effective as at present.,10
69,Mr GLYNN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"It is being done now. Every month, with the assistance of the postmen,. changes which ought to be made in the rolls are noted by - the Department, and the necessary notice is given under the Act and regulations. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that the Act will be carefully administered, so as to insure that no elector shall lose his vote at the forthcoming election owing to any omission to include his name on the rolls. INTERNED MALTESE.",10
70,Mr ORCHARD,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,Will the Acting Prime Minister state whether any definite course has been decided upon by the Government in regard to the Maltese now interned on a hulk in Sydney Harbor?,10
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,No definite course has yet been decided upon. I hope something may be done very speedily. POSTMASTER AT GATTON.,10
72,Mr SINCLAIR,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"Will the Postmaster-General state whether there has been any difficulty in making a permanent appointment, to the position of postmaster at Gabton, Queensland?",10
73,Mr WEBSTER,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"There has been some difficulty. I furnished, quite recently, a full explanation in regard to it. The matter, however, is now nearing a solution. MURRAY WATERS COMMISSION.",10
74,Mr FENTON,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"Will the Acting Prime Minister state whether it is the intention of the Government, prior to the elections, to appoint the Chairman of the Murray Waters Commission?",10
75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I am nob aware of any such intention. The matter has not yet received the consideration of the Government. The honourable member will recollect that for the time being the M in ister in charge of .the Department controlling this question is ex officio chairman of the Commission. So far as I know, there has been no proposal to depart from thab rule. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",11
76,Mr HANNAN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I wish to make personal explanation. The honourable member for Grey is reported in the this morning as having said yesterdayMr Hannan had omitted to inform the House that on a memorable occasion in the Caucus he went with tears in his eyes to the Prime Minister and asked the to go to the executives and liberate him from a promise he had made. I rose at the time to a point of order, insisted on the withdrawal of the stateSenator ment, which is absolutely incorrect. occasion the honourable member refers was the result of a rather lengthy bate, and every member present then will give me credit for having acted from the inception to the end of the debate in cordance with the attitude I had adopted on the floor of this House. I opposed existing. the proposal for a referendum on the scription question, and I opposed the enactment of conscription by direct lation, both inside and outside the House, and particularly on the occasion referred to by the honourable member f I am prepared to admit that a member of our party did propose bo the Prime Minister that he should approach the executives, and that in speaking on the question I told the Prime Minister exactlv whab I felt-that I had no objecwith tion to him going to the executives.  OPPOSITION MEMBERS - No , he did not.",11
77,Mr HANNAN,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I said that it not affect my position personally, because I would not alter the attitude which I had adopted. I also said to the Prime Minister, as the honourable member for Grey will admit if he takes his mind trict. backSo far as this question is concerned, you lying it . have treated the Labour movement with contempt. This is the first occasion on which are going to appeal to the country without having the confidence and support of that ment behind you, and you will find out, you come back from the country, that without their co-operation and support you have been defeated. Those are the exact words I used that evening, and my prediction has been borne out by the result.  Gippsland with a name that will suit you. COA L CONTRACTS.",11

Baddeley, the president of the Miners a Union in New South Wales, and Senator Watson approached him to secure a Age further contract for Seaham and West Wallsend coal when, as a matter of fact, the present contract for 150,000 tons has not been consumed, and is not likely to be Prime Minister for some months?",11
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I do not know where the honourable member has obtained and the information, but it is a fact that Watson, the honourable member The for Hunter, and Mr Baddeley saw me to last week and put his case. They said desome of the mines there were working very poorly-abou t three days per fortnight-and asked if it were possible to acplace any contracts with those collieries so as to relieve the undoubted distress I promised to inquire, aud confound that we had already entered into contracts for supplies for the year much legisexceeding our probable requirements. In the circumstances, I expressed to them my regret that I could not help them to or Grey. relieve that distress.",11
80,Mr CHARLTON,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"Did not the deputation mentioned by the honourable member for Henty point out to the Minister for the Navy that, in consequence of the coal trade of the port being interfered by the war, the miners employed at the Borehole Colliery were working intermittently, and ask if it were possible to take such coal as was required for Gowould vernment purposes from the Borehole seam? The Minister asked which mines were the worse off, and it was pointed out to him that the Wallsend and Seaham were the worse off in the Newcastle disI ask for a reply to the question, because there is something under",11

My only regret was that the conditions of our present coal contracts prevented me from doing what was desired. WOOL APPRAISEMENT .",11
82,Mr HIGGS,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I have received several urgent telegrams fro m Rockhampton, asking whether the Prime Minister will receive a deputation which wishes to place before him its views regarding the appraisement of wool. I understand that at the present time there are four deputations from the other States waiting to see the Prime Minister, and I wish to know from the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether he will arrange that the Rockhampton deputation, when it comes to Melbourne, shall be heard?",12
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,Are the members of the deputation in Melbourne now?,12
84,Mr HIGGS,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"I have received a telegram from the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, saying that they have arranged to leave tomorrow.",12
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"Would it not be well for the honourable member to ask the members of this deputation not to start until he has received the reply to his questions, which the Government is shaping for him. Should they then still feel that they ought to come, they will be heard by a Minister. If the Prime M in ister cannot hear them, I shall endeavour to do so.",12
86,Mr WATKINS,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,I wish to know from the Minister representing the Prime M in ister whether the reply that is coming from the Wool Board will cover the position of Newcastle?,12
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,I shall be unable to say until that reply has been received. ELECTION S: SOLDIER S' VOT E.,12
88,Dr MALONEY,CARPENTERS FOR GREAT,"In view of the general dislike of the way in which the last voting was done at the front, will the Minister for Home and Territories insist upon all the ballot-papers being sent to Australia, to be distributed according to electoral divisions and subdivisions by an officer competent for the work ? .

106,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"M e l b o u r n e ) [4.2""| L as t n i g h t the honourable member for Grey referred to us on this side as having no love for the Homeland, and I shall, therefore, quote for his edification remarks that I .made in this chamber on the 28th August, 1912, when I tried to induce the House to agree to a method of transferring the State debts to the Commonwealth. I proposed to ask the money princes of Great Britain to advance the capital necessary for the scheme, and I showed that Great Britain would, under it , receive from Australia a g if t of at least £20,000,000. As a matter of fact, had the scheme been adopted, it would have released over £50,000,000, which could have been used to build a fleet of ironclads to protect the highways by which the food supplies of that country travel-chiefl y from Australia. I then said I should be glad if they would look at it as a suggestion coming from one born in Australia, and loving his native land, with the blood from an English mother coursing through his veins, and desirous of giving to the country that gave his mother birth the best of his help, so far as voice, vote, or hand can do it. I remarked that were the highways along which her food is transported blocked, Great Britain would have food sufficient for only six weeks. Her food supplies I regret to say, are being greatly interfered with at the present time. To continue my quotationAlthough I , being over age, could not take a weapon and fight, everything I had would be handed into the war fund, for the maintenance of our flag and race.",13
107,Mr HIGGS,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,5 do not think that the honourable member could be kept back in our case.,14
108,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,I would give everything I had.,14
109,Mr HIGGS,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,The honourable member would go to the front himself.,14
110,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"Yes , if I could do the slightest good there; but when a man is approaching sixty, his time for active service is nearly closed. Those remarks were made before the honourable member for Grey had ever spoken from a platform in favour of conscription. I was over sixty years of age when I offered my services to the country, and hold a badge which proves that I offered them. The honourable member, as ex-Treasurer, knows that for the little money that I was able to put into war bonds I have not received a penny piece in interest. If I had £50,000, I would invest it in the loan, and would not take a penny in in terest.  the interest while I was in office. Dr Maloney.",14
111,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"And before that, too. I have a love for England second only to my love for Australia. I hate and loathe the franchise which deprives the Englishman of his vote, and places women on a level with criminals and lunatics, but I love the people from whom my mother sprang. I should like to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.] If we were wisely governed, as Switzerland is, £1,000 would have been paid into the Consolidated Revenue Pund last Thursday in fines imposed on members who were not in their places in this House while business was being transacted. Our quorum is only twenty-five m a House of seventy-five. A complete majority of members is required to form a quorum in most European Parliaments. In my opinion, the forthcoming election will be fought on three great questions. The first will be a protective Tariff so that Australia may be able to manufacture all its requirements. A f t e r protecting Australian products we should show our kindly feelings for the Mother Country, by which I mean the four Kingdoms. A f t e r that, we should give a preference to our Allies, then to the neutrals, and finally we should have a prohibition to the h i l t against enemy countries. Such a Tariff would, I feel sure, give an opportunity to our Australian industries. In Great Britain the Government has seized various factories, and is today manufacturing all kinds of goods. I do not know of a single factory that has been started by the Australian Government, although we are pouring out our millions like water, and rightly so.",14
112,Mr BOYD,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,I think we should have a quorum. [Quorum formed.],14
113,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"A protective policy such as I have indicated will , I think, be a burning question on the hustings. The second great issue will be the referendum, initiative, and recall. When the people of Australia have the right of recall, they will not allow a Government that is in its dying days to make appointments carrying with them salaries up to £2,500 a year. I have not met a Liberal of my acquaintance. who believes that the present Government will be returned to office. If the people had the right of recall, they would recall every man appointed by the present Government recently. It is an infamy to give these returned positions for five years at salaries from £2,500 downwards for possibly a political purpose, or for reasons that they dare not disclose. On the eve of going to the country, I tell the House that I am prepared to contest my constituency with any honourable member of the Ministry, or to go to Sydney if the Prime Minister will show his face in that city. It is an infamy that these appointments should be made by a dying Government. Another burning question will be our love of Australia. I do not think the people will permit the Government to override the freest, highest, and greatest constitution in any part of the English-speaking world. Such a proposal is infamous, whether it comes from an Australian-born like Sir John Forrest, or from an Australian by adoption like one of the other proposed plenipotentiaries, who came from a country that has not yet given manhood a vote. Neither in England, Scotland, nor Wales is a man given a vote because he is a man. He must own or rent property. It is recorded in Hansard that even Mr . Asquith had his name crossed off the voting list because he lived in a house owned by his wife, and had not arranged to become a lodger. England, with a population of 45,000,000, has only 8,000,000 voters, whilst Australia, with only 4,800,000 people, has 2,800,000 voters. England, with over nine times our ' population, has not three times as many voters as Australia. In regard to voluntary enlistment, I give place to no man in my advocacy of that system.. In company with Mr Billson and Mr Solly, I have spoken on platform after platform. The Chairman of the Victorian Recruiting Committee (Mr Wise), and the Director General have honoured me by adopting my suggestion to utilize moving pictures to assist the recruiting movement. I will tell honourable members some of the things that are stopping voluntary enlistment. One of the hindrances to recruiting was the asinine act of Senator Pearce in discharging upwards of 2,000 soldiers in New South Wales because of a small riot in Sydney. General MCCay went to Liverpool Camp and increased the hours of d r ill , and reduced the leave. made a little trouble in Sydney, and the high and mighty Minister for Defence discharged them. Granting that they were wrong in making a disturbance, why were they not placed on board transports and sent to the front, and if they did damage to the property of Sydney citizens, why was not that damage paid for by deductions from the pay of the rioters? Instead of that action being taken, Senator Pearce said, "" Leave the A r m y ; you are not fit to fight."" Some of those men who were unjustly discharged-for the Minister discharged the innocent as well as the guilty-hav e gone to the front under assumed names, and are amongst the finest men that ever left our shores. Another thing which did in j u r y to the voluntary system was the infamous lie about Lieutenant Jacka, who holds a higher honour than any man in the British Army, an honour higher than was held even by the late Lord Kitchener and the late Lord Roberts. It is true that Lord Roberts held the V . C , but as he had not won it twice, he had not the right to wear a bar as well as the cross. The father of Jacka took the platform against conscription - His three boys had gone to the, front, and he desired them to return to Australia free men. A letter purporting to be from Jacka to a man in the township in which Jacka's father. lives was published, and in it Jacka was alleged to favour conscription. Jacka senior made a sworn declaration that there was no man of that name in the town, and that he believed his boy still held the opinion which he had expressed in his earlier letters. Was that denial permitted to be published in the newspapers? No ; the cursed censorship intervened.",14
114,Mr BOYD,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,I tliink we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed?],15
115,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"Thoug h Lieutenant Jacka's father rendered himself liable to ' be charged with perjury if he was stating an untruth, the Government did not permit his sworn declaration to be published in the press; but it was distributed in leaflets. Another circumstance that has militated against recruiting is the treatment of women and children whose male relatives are at the front . Did any one hear of any delay in paying the £4,500 that Parliament voted to Lady Bridges? I do not care if she got £10,000, poor soul. She was a widow of the war; but I have more pity for a woman with four or five The men children, who has lost her husband, than I have for any one connected with the Government House "" push."" This widow came from Government House, and the money was poured out like water, whereas in cases where little children are concerned, weeks go over without their getting a penny. Every member who has supported the retention of black labour in Australia, and the only genuine. Pree Trader we have, the honourable member for Lang, are now on the Government side of the House, together with all the Conservatives who would not give women the vote.",15
116,Sir JOHN FOHHEST,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,I gave women vote in my State.,16
117,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I am not accusing the Treasurer in this instance, and hope, .he is proud of the action he then took. All who have hitherto against equal pay for equal work are on the benches opposite, and of ithe old Liberals there is only one remaining in the person of the honourable member for Gippsland, though of the company is keeping the least said the better. other day, when another matter was under discussion, honourable members posite felt that they had two men "" i the bag."" In Elizabeth-street, of this city, I met a man who holds a very imthat, portant position in the State, he expressed regret at the illness of Senator Loner and Senator Guy, I said that tbese gentlemen would be able to pairs. In this House, where the Governbelieve, ment have a majority, pairs can be tained by the Opposition, but not in another place, however ill a man may This man said to me, "" They have two ' make. men ' in the bag,'"" and I replied, "" I a damned lie, and I do not believe it . I am sorry to say, however, that my confidence was ill-founded. I now repeat what I said the other day, and what shall say on every platform, that, though I regarded Senator Ready as almost a son, who had a bright future in fron t of could be relieved. him, with possible Ministerial honours, would rather see him dead in his coffin than in the degraded and disgraceful position he occupies today. I saw the late Sir Frederick Holder fall dead in this chamber, and I was here when that great fighter, Mr Roberts, who latterly never rose without danger to his life, fell dead at the foot of the statue in Queen's information. H all ; and I am sure that both of these men would have scorned the idea of rethat signing to make room for a political opponent. The conscience of Senator Ready will plague him as long as he lives; and, certainly, never in my twenty1915-16, seven years of parliamentary experience have I come across a similiar instance. ing a credit balance of £304,000. As Senator Ferricks justly said at of the mightiest meetings ever held in the Melbourne Town H all , it was just though Admiral Jellicoe, if he intended to resign, had informed von Tirpitz or the Kaiser before telling his own Government. Good-bye, Senator Ready! Y o u are dead politically, I believe, for all time, for I have never known a man arise the again after such action! Then, on the question of the food supply, I say that the Minister for the Navy is screening I one of the richest men in Melbourne by not allowing his name to be held up to voted infamy- a man who supplied to the Forces livers impregnated with hydatids and fluke, all for the sake of the cursed now lucre. ""Whab does it matter if he has half-a-million of money, if he makes that he money by supplying such food, and is The screened by this Government?' The late Minister for the Navy was man enough opto say in the House that he would give n the name of this scoundrel, but the present Minister cannot see his way to do urging thab it is nine months since and when the offence was committed. * * * # *",16

Cases are constantly cropping up for which we cannot immediately provide by legislation. Here is one that should come within the scope of the repatriation scheme: Two brothers went to the front, six months intervening between their departure. News was received later on that one of them had been killed. The parents, who were fairly well advanced in years, died, unfortunately, shortly afterwards, and soon after their death the family received news of the death of the second son at the front . A little later an invalid sister died, leaving one poor gir l who cannot fight life's battle, and whose case should come under the repatriation scheme, or who should receive assistance from some other fund .

128,Mr FENTON,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"The view I take is that as soon as a case of this kind comes to the knowledge of the War Pensions authorities in the Treasury Department relief should be granted. Why should the relatives of a man killed at the front bave to invoke the assistance of a member of Parliament in pleading for help when the facts are already known to a Department of the Commonwealth Government, and should be sent on as a matter of course by the War Pensions authorities in the Treasury, or the proper quarter, for consideration and help ? There should be a ready, expeditious means of dealing with such cases. The Minister representing the Prime Minister agreed that relief should be granted in this instance, and I hope that it wil l be speedily forth coming. I would prefer to make the mistake of paying money to many undeserving persons rather than miss doing justice to in a deserving case of this kind. The Treasurer said last night that the expenditure of the Commonwealth was going ahead by leaps and bounds, end that he was puzzled to know how these liabilities were to be met as they arose. I had the temerity to ask "" if the Treasurer is not going to tell the Committee how he proposes to meet these liabilities, vvill the Government set out - in their policy speech, when they go to the counthe try, the course they intend to pursue?"" The right honourable gentleman answered t in the negative, and seemed to be offended Our liabilities are mounting up, and if the Treasurer has no proposal for meeting them to put before n Parliament, he is not acting up to his duty as the purse-holder for the Commonwealth. If the Uovernment are not so going to inform the taxpayers of their proposals for financing the country, that itself should justify the electors in them down. Before this Bill is passed, we should be informed of the in I tentions of the Government in this reAre they going to try to dodge responsibilities until the turmoil of the elections is over, and then, if returned to power, increase the burdens - n the already overburdened taxpayers ?

129,Mr JENSEN,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,They are not going to propose any such thing.,17

133,Mr JENSEN,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,There is no the ight of taxing tea or kerosene.,18
134,Mr FENTON,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"The Minister for Trade and Customs, after all, is only one member of the Cabinet, and his section of the Coalition is in a minority. The right honourable member for Parramatta said, while in Opposition, "" There are worse things than a tax on tea.""",18
135,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,You can responsibility take it from me that there will be no on tea and kerosene.,18
136,Mr FENTON,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"The honourable memnever ber is only one of the rank and file, and that kind of thing is decided in Cabinet, where the members he helped to put there are in a majority, and many of them not particular about overloading the poor taxpayer. It may be somewhat heterodox to express this opinion, but I do not think it will lead to international cations with our Allies if I say that I would absolutely prohibit the importation from any other country of articles that we can produce and manufacture in Australia for our own requirements.",18
137,Mr LIVINGSTON,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,Then what about tea?,18
138,Mr FENTON,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"Will the honourable member say that we at present proparty. duce tea. in Australia? I would not even exempt the Mother Land or jority. New Zealand from that prohibition. We should put all other on the same plane with regard to with anything that we can produce or manuparty facture. The Prime Minister the other day told a deputation, in order to soothe their troubled feelings, that somehow, under the War Precautions Regulations, or by some other means, he could stop certically tain importations as far as luxuries are concerned. In the absence of the Prime Minister, I appeal to the Treathe surer, if anything like that is to be done, to have it done by Act of Parliament. us enumerate in a schedule all the goods that can be produced and manufactured here, and refuse to allow a single item that list to be imported. The honourable member for Barker will agree with me that that will mean giving employment to thousands and thousands of our people, spending our own money among ourselves, and enabling Australia to become self-contained. We are blest with one of the n - grandest countries, and if Germany took charge of Australia to develop it , she could, with her organization, in twentyyears make it one of the richest.",18
139,Mr LIVINGSTON,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,It is the richest now.,18
140,Mr FENTQN,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"But it needs developing. There is untold wealth at our very feet. The country is overflowing with raw material, which we are sending away by the shipload to be made into the finished article- a disgrace to every Australian; and I accept my portion of the for it . The Minister for tax Trade and Customs who came into Parliament with me in 191.0 knows that I can be charged with having failed on any occasion to do what I could to advance Australian industries; either at party meetings or in this House. Immediately are the war ends, Great Britain's munitions machinery will be turned into industrial channels, and France and Russia w i ll do the same; but what are we doing in this delightful, much-blessed country? We complihave a Bureau of Science.",18
141,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,And we are running into debt.,18

The Commonwealth Government prachas control of the sugar industry, especially in regard to the importation and sale of sugar; and i would remind Treasurer-who , no doubt, has not yet had the matter closely under his attenL e t tion-that a large number of people in this country are not allowed the same p r i vileges under the Colonial Sugar Refining in Company's agreements as others are. I mentioned, by way of a question the other night, that the country storekeepers and others formed an organization of their own to . supply their own requirements, including sugar. The Colonial Sugar Kefining Company, under their old arrangements, had their own particular curled darlings, who were allowed 6 per oent. rebate on sugar sold. This newer organization was formed, and sold from £80,000 to £100,000 worth of sugar to its clients during.the year; but when they asked for the same rebate as is allowed to other customers of the oompany it was refused to them by the company, and also by the Commonwealth Government, which has control of the company's operations just now. Will the Government either abolish rebates altogether or put all purchasers of sugar over a certain amount on the same basis ? The Colonial Sugar Befining Company today, under the auspices of the Commonwealth Government, are making as much money they made, and, according to statement of the. ex-Treasurer last night, they were prepared even to put their hands into the Commonwealth Treasury to the tune of another £60,000 or £70,000, and would have done so if the ex-Treasurer had not detected some flaw in the new agreement. If the Treasurer has not direct control over this matter, w i ll he convey my remarks to the Minister who has charge of the business ? It is not fair that all traders should not be placed on an equal basis. No right-thinking Government should allow the existence of privileged individuals in the community who w i ll operate favourably to the Colonial Sugar Befining Company. There are in the Supply Bill some items . which the Treasurer' well have touched on. Some of these I note with pleasure. Why is it estimated that a less reurn will be received during 1916-17 ""from the land tax than in 1915-16 ? Is it owing to, the large estates being split up, and a consequent reduction in the taxable area ?",18
145,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,That was the ject your party had in view when the Act was brought in . Your forecast was that the revenue under it would become less and less.,19
146,Mr FENTON,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I hope it is so. We argued at the time that the Act would not only be a revenue-producing instrument, but would also have the effect of splitting up large estates. [398]",19

I was down there today, and I thought the as ever Commissioner charged me 150 per cent, the more. They have a peculiar method of calculation down there, and I parted with a cheque three or four times bigger than I expected. However, I do not regret it , because I know the money is required, and I am glad to pay if I am in a position to do so, even though an election is hanging over our heads, and those'fortunate enough to get back w i ll have to miss at least five weeks' pay. I was also pleased to notice the increasing revenue from detained enemy vessels. This proves that we are making use of them, and that they are earning money for t i e Treasury. Whereas we had a revenue last . financial year from this source of £646,000, it is anticipated that we shall receive £1,000,000 this year. might Sir JOHN FORREST - There is an expenditure on the other side.",19
153,Mr FENTON,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I admit thab the expenditure will increase in proportion, but still the revenue is increasing. I have no wish to indulge in the recriminatory language of which we have heard so much lately. Much ob- has been said in this chamber that might well have been left unsaid. Unfortunately, a leading actor in these scenes has been the Prime Minister himself. He is in possession of a most varied and vitriolic vocabulary, and has lashed out with it with that nimble tongue of his. Whilst asking on the one hand for peace, quietness, calm deliberation, and thought, he unfortunately fires himself off in this chamberlike a veritable volcano, forth those harsh statements such a cruel effect upon the soft hearts of honourable members sitting on this side. I hope and trust that some of his quieter and calmer colleagues will try, in a heartto-heart talk, to calm down his troubled feelings, and induce him to indulge in much less recriminatory language than in the past. Honourable members have frequently stated that we on this side are the bond slaves of leagues and executives outside. They suggest that bodies hold up their hands, and we simply do as they dictate. The air is full of intrigue and ugly rumours. One of the facts standing out very clearly, on the eve of a general election, is that there has been a split of parties and much bargaining for office. Large sums of money are being mentioned. A few ago, when Mr Holman and those associated with him were anxious to obtain the help of the Labour leagues in New South Wales, Mr Holman was so offended on one occasion that h'e actually his position, and, for twenty-four the present Leader of the Labour in that State was appointed understand thab there have' been communications with the Colonial Office in regard to that resignation, and some disputes with the State Governor. thing that happened during that time of turmoil was this: Two Ministers on a number of others associated tihe Labour movement, and one of the many suggestions made by these isters was, ""For goodness sake, as leagues and executives, don't too far at the present time. are not far off a State election, and we understand that the Colonial Sugar Refining .Company and other have provided - aa election fund of not less than £100.000 to fight the Labour That statement can be verified by a number of witnesses in whose presence it was made. As an individual member of the Labour party, I would much rather take instructions from or listen to advice given by Labour leagues and executives than be the tool and vassal of rich men behind the scenes.

Those same people today are providing funds to fight - the elections opposite against the Labour party. In to whose coffers will those funds go? From the press gallery of this chamber at least one these man has been taken at a good salary for a three years' engagement. Who is finding the money? The trusts, the squatters, and the big land-owners. They know especially that; if the Labour party were to get back to power, they would be called on to pay the taxes, instead of the poor people being forced to keep the country going. months During the war the poor have responded magnificently in blood and in boodle.

This election will be fought Min- with the money thus contributed. If I have an opportunity to appeal to my conpush us stituency-and none of us knows exactly We whether he will be able to seek the suffrages of the electors- I shall make my voice heard regarding this matter. The organizations trusts and combines are not on our side. In the lobbies of late, I have seen faces party."" , that I have rarely seen since I haye been a member. "" Wheresoever the carcase is, theire will the eagles be gathered together."" We on this side are not being supported by the rich, the trusts, and the combines. We are out against them, and they know it . If we could get an amendment of the Constitution, we should try to deal with them as they ought to be dealt with . But , after some of the decisions matters? of the High Court, I question whether our legislation would be wholly effective. I would therefore go further, and, to make From his this at r u l y National Parliament, I would put into the melting-pot all the Federal and State Constitutions, and frame a new Constitution, under which there would be a National Parliament, to deal with the best and vital interests of the people. Some persons might call such an arrangement by what they consider the ugly name of Unification. I would not, however, entirely deprive the States of local government. I would give them magnified municipal councils, transferring the more important departments of governmenb to the control of the National Parliament, which I would make supreme. Those on this side will not do the slimy work of the trusts and combines. We do not want their money, because it is tainted. It has never, and will never, come our way. Into whose pockets does it flow ? For whom are trusts and combines organizing? A r e they not organizing against the Labour party? During the forthcoming campaign, we on this side will not need to find language with which to expose their designs; we shall have the manifestos and the speeches of Willia m Morris Hughes, the present Prime Minister, with which to condemn him and those behind him, and these should win us the election. Mr ARCHIBALD""(Hindmarsh ) [5.10]. - The honourable member for Maribyrnong says that he has it on good authority that intriguing is going on in New South Wales in connection with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Probably that statement is on a par with many that come from the other side of the chamber, and based purely on imagination. Certainly, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is not likely to provide money for the support of members like myself or those with whom I am associated; we shall have to find for ourselves what may be needed. I do not think that, in the past, anything such as he has suggested has been done, nor do I consider it likely that it will be done in the future - The honourable member spoke of seeing strange faces in the lobbies. It would be a relief if the faces to be seen in the Queen's H all could be changed, because of late it has been difficult for members to move through that apartment; it has been so full of officials and emissaries from the Trades H all who come here to instruct and watch the members of the Official Labour party. If one-hundredth part of what goes on in our lobbies- I refer to the attempts of these persons to interfere with the actions of members-were to occur within the pre[398]- 2 cincts of the House of Commons, those concerned would soon find themselves in gaol. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has announced that he is quite prepared to be the lackey of the Trades H all , and of the Labour leagues, and, of course, if the electors of Maribyrnong prefer as their representative a iackey to a free man, he will be returned. But I doubt that the people generally desire such representation. He pretends that the only alternative to being a lackey is to be the slave of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and other combines. I do not think that such organizations are exercising influence on this or any other Parliament in the Empire. If there has been any interference at all, it has been only in isolated cases. I rose chiefly to protest against the action of honourable members in airing here grievances which should be brought directly under the notice of the Defence Department, and remedied. Honourable members opposite, however, desire not so much to remedy grievances as to get their statements published in the Age, so that the limelight may be thrown on their doings, and the people may give them credit for their energy. Their desire, moreover, is to retard recruiting. There is hardly an honourable member on that side who has nob spoken regarding the war with his tongue in his cheek. They have tried to make recruiting unpopular. I have had some hard cases to deal with, but I have never brought them before the House. I consider it my duty to help the Defence authorities, and, therefore, I have gone, not to the Minister, but to the proper officials. An y honourable member who attends properly to his parliamentary duties knows where to go to get grievances remedied. Honourable members opposite, however, desire to air their eloquence by way of advertisement. They try to make it appear that the Defence authorities do not wish to be just and fair to the dependants of our soldiers, though they know that the contrary is true. I do notsay that mistakes are never made by the Department-it would be impossible to avoid them, and there must be delays occasionally-bu t those who have grievances are responsible if they allow serious delays to take place. I know that the cases in which I have been interested have not been hung up by the Defence Department. However, the Government is anxious to get on with business, and I shall have another opportunity to show that it is part of the programme of honourable members opposite to do all that they can to retard the war, and to assist the Germans. Mr KING O'MALLE Y (Darwin) [5.18] - I congratulate the Treasurer upon the quantity of information that he has given to the Committee, although there is much that he has omitted to give. He is not a man who is afraid of giving information, which is the fault of most Ministers. They adopt a tango-dancing method of secrecy in corners, and bring about wars because they are not open with the people - I - have gone through the Treasurer's statement as carefully as I . could. We have arrived at a stage when we must stop and think regarding the financial position of Australia, From the Treasurer's statement. I find that it is estimated that the war loan expenditure for the current year 1916-17, including our liability to the British Government for the maintenance of Australian troops abroad, will be £80,000,000. War loan funds in hand on the 1st January, 1917, amounted to £31,000,000. From the fourth issue of the war loan the Treasurer has received £18,250,000. The amount of loan money required, in addition to present flotations, in order to finance the war expenditure to the 31st December, 1917, is £30,750,000, roughly £31,000,000. The annual interest on £31,000,000 at 4£ per cent., exclusive of a sinking f u n d , is £1,395,000, say, £1,400,000. We cannot discuss Commonwealth finance unless we include the operations of' the various States and the municipalities. We make a great mistake in attempting to consider our Commonwealth finance operations apart from those of the States and municipalities. We must get the taxes out of the same workers, the same producers, and the same consumers. Assuming that the State indebtedness increases £357,808,000, as it was on the 30th June, 1916, to £370,000,000 on the 31st December, 1917, and the municipal debt at the latter date is £18,000,000, the total public debt of Australia then may be estimated as follows: State indebtedness ... £370,000,000 Commonwealth indebtedness ... 190,000,000 Municipal indebtedness ... Total £578,000,000 The total private property of the Commonwealth is valued at £1,000,000,000. That does not include the utilities of government.",19
154,Mr LYNCH,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,What do public and private debts amount to ?,22
155,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I am not touching private debts at all . The £1,000,000,000 represents the private property, of the people.",22
156,Mr LYNCH,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,Is it unencumbered?,22
157,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"No . I suppose private and corporation mortgages would represent £300,000,000, bu t I am not taking them into consideration. I am talking only of the public debt. I deduct for the transferred properties, and the loans contracted by the Commonwealth for the States, £15,000,000. Though the Commonwealth has taken over the transferred properties, they do not belong to us as an asset; they are still in the debt books of the States. Therefore, I have deducted £15,000,000 on that account, and that leaves the total public debt at £563,000,000.",22
158,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,My figures deal with the financial year. Why did you not stick to that?,22
159,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"The Treasurer menltdoned £18,000,000 for .the financial year, and I have deducted the amount of cash he has in hand. My. object is to call the attention of the Australian people to the dangerous position we are gradually reaching because of the unfitness of the men whom we allow to carry on our great operations. I believe that in the Defence Department millions of pounds are wasted, but the Minister cannot help that. These losses are made because we have never called in trained business men to carry on these operations. If we did, we would not be depending on clerks who, though absolutely honest, were trained to handle shillings, not millions of pounds. The from interest on the various public debts on the 31st December, 1917, will beInterest on State debts ... £14,050,000 Interest on Commonwealth debts ... ... ... 7,250,000 Interest on municipal debts ... 800,000 Total £22,100,000 I know that the Treasurer will insist on 18,000,000 a sinking f u n d , just as I would. A sinking fund of 1 per cent, on the estimated war debt as at 31st December, 1917, would entail an annual payment of about £1,550,000, making the total annual debt charge £23,650,000.",22
160,Mr FENTON,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,That is nearly the annual revenue of the Commonwealth.,23
161,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I shall discuss that later, because I feel, as an Australian taxpayer and citizen, that I cannot complain of the .position in which we find ourselves if from my place in this Bouse I have not called the attention, of honourable members to tbese considerations. The time has come when this matter must be handled seriously. From the Treasurer's figures it would appear that at the 31st December, 1917, the annual charge on revenue in respect of war pensions will be not less than £3,250,000.",23
162,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,I did not say that. freehold farmers.,23
163,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"The Treacensus surer mentioned £2,000,000, but added that already there was a charge of £1,250,000. Adding these £3,250,000 which I have already mentioned, makes a total annual debt charge of £26,900,000. Of that amount the Commonwealth w i l be liable for £12,050,000. This tion must be met by the Australian payers before any ordiuary expenditure any kind is discussed. I may remind honourable members that my mind is purely constructive. I cannot a bad percentage. make a destructive speech. members know that for years I stood alone in the advocacy of a Commonwealth Bank and a note issue. I was laughed members on the Liberal side, and many of my own brethren were sorry for me. What would Australia have done during this war without the note issue and the Commonwealth Bank ? I notice that nobody has bothered to make a calculation of the financial loss in the reproductive industries of Ausand tralia occasioned by the , absence of 300,000 men from industrial and agriper cultural activities.",23
164,Mr BAMFORD,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,Thos e men are our i surance.,23
165,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I am not to questioning that. The census showed that the number of males in the Comto monwealth engaged in agricultural and pastoral pursuits was on the following dates5fch April, 1891. 290,633-26.7 8 per cent 31st March, 1901, 349,000-27.1 8 per. oent. 3rd April, 1911, 420,823-26.8 5 per cent. Reliable figures in respect of occupations are available only at the time of a census. It will be seen that during the twenty years from 1891 to 1911. there was an in crease of 130,180 in the number of males engaged in agricultural and pastoral pursuits in the Commonwealth, and that the proportion of total breadwinners represented by males so engaged remains practically the same-that there was absolutely no increase of any consequence.",23
166,Mr LYNCH,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,Do you take into consideration the great effect of machinery inventions in increasing the reproductive powers of men in agriculture],23
167,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I am a modern man; at least I hope I am.. There are no particulars available concerning the increase of tenant as compared with According to the of 1911, the private dwellings in the Commonwealth were distributed as follows in respect to method of occupancy : - Occupie d by owners, 402,637; rent purchasers, 39,318; tenants, 404,371; and other and unspecified methods of ocl cupancy, 48,063; or a total of 894,389. obligaI n the returns furnished under the War taxCensus Act 1915, there were 460,000 of male and 223,000 female residents of the Commonwealth as owners of land, a total of 683,000, which does not represent I now try to ascerHonorable tain the value of the productive power; and it is calculated that the average earnings of an employee was, approximately, at by £127 for the year 1914. The total number of recruits enlisted in Australia to date is, approximately, 300,000; and if these had been earning the average mentioned, their annual earnings would have been about £38,000,000. These recruits have performed miracles, and the name "" ANZAC "" will live in history as long as the world lasts. If we make a calculation, allow only a small percentage of this annual production of £38,000,000-sa y 5 cent - w e arrive at £1,900,000 a year. Our position is very serious, because it n - means that we have that much less production-so much less to export on which build up a large foreign bank balance, which could be brought back to Australia distribute amongst our own people, and thus increase opportunities and the wealth per capita and also the luxuries for our enjoyment. I noticed the other day a great deal of talk about shutting out certain "" luxuries "" fro m Australia. What constitutes a luxury ? One man told me that, in his opinion, a motor car is a luxury, while others so described the telephone and telegraph conveniences - This may be so; but how about the farmer, or any man in the back blocks, from 40 to 100 miles from his market? Is a motor car a luxury for such a man?",23
168,Mr LYNCH,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,He does not try to do any farming then!,24
169,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"At any rate, he is doing something-runnin g some kind of industry. The other day a man from the Gwydir district told me that there a motor car is absolutely an essential-mor e essential than a railroad. ",24
170,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"That may be. As to our soldiers, I think the Government ought to encourage these men to meet and decide amongst themselves as to the best system by which they can be helped. I am afraid that if something like that is not done, we shall place men on the land who are not fit to go there. Why have nearly all such land propositions failed ? It is because they have not been in the hands of business men. The land grants given to the great American railroads by the United States Government are managed by business men. In the cities of the east men with no money were selected, and sent, with fares paid, to the west, where, in many instances, houses and barns were provided for them, and they were given assistance until they could make a fair start for themselves. All this was done because at the head of these railway enterprises there were business men. But what is the system here ? Here we have a clerk in an office to see to the repatriation of soldiers and he possibly writes a letter to Johnson, who, in turn, writes to Will i a m s; there is no in vestigation, nothing is done that ought to be done to see that men are placed in positions in the country for which they are fitted. There is no psychological investigation as to whether or not a man is qualified for such an occupation. A man may be a good clerk, but not a person to make a farmer of.  entirely wrong in his description of the method.",24

174,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I do not wish to say anything unkind, but I am .afraid that Governments will never be a success in anything. I think that, if today you gave Governments the biggest corporations and businesses in the world, they would, in a few years, be almost hopeless- I am commencing to think that.",24
175,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,Y o u do not believe in nationalization ?,24
176,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I do, if we could take over the men who create the industries. I believe in nationalization, with the Governmenb owning 51 per cent., and the men who create the corporation or industry owning 49 oer cent., and operating it . I believe in a physical valuation of all these corporations, and in their operation for the benefit of the people, with a Government director on the Board. Last night I told the Treasurer that, in my opinion, instead of heavily taxing in comes, he ought to try to tax expenditure. The word "" tariff "" means anything, and that is the reason I made that remark to the Treasurer. Great expenditure is more dangerous than great incomes. Big expenditure, used for unproductive purposes which only represents lavish extravagance, is double destruction - it destroys the capital so expended, plundering society in its services, and frequently it destroys the ability' of the spenders to render society full service.",24
177,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,This discussion is so valuable that I think we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.],24
178,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I fail to see why a man who does not save should not be called upon to pay taxation. The man who, by sound judgment, t h r if t , and economy, by modest living and moderate expenditure, accumulates a competency, which he invests in reproductive undertakings, is rendering the highest type of service, while those who are responsible for profligate expenditure plunder the people, and leave the country poorer by its double reaction. But the man who, as the result of "" staggerjuice,"" profligacy, and other methods of waste, spends all he has, goes free, while the accumulating man is taxed. It is good to look back at what one has said in the years gone by, and I propose to make a few quotations from a speech that I delivered seventeen years ago. little while ago great enthusiasm was aroused by a proposal on the part of the Government to establish a great public laboratory. Not a word was said, however, about the man who first suggested it-seventee n years ago. Let me read from this speech of mineA Federal laboratory should be founded, with different departments, for the purpose of original scientific research on a scale similar to what prevails in America and Europe. Among the departments should be metallurgy, chemistry, biology, geology, bacteriology, and electricity. A Federal school of mines, and a Commonwealth school for technical education, should be established. The school of mines ought to be free of access to all prospectors and miners, wbo should have the right of forwarding specimens of their discoveries, and have tliem assayed, with a geological description of the country where found. On that occasion I also saidFederal civil servants should be paid an honest wage, and not starved, like these of the Tasmanian service. That was seventeen years ago. Here is yet another quotation as to the T a r i ff questionAll workers sliould read the Bulletin and Age, the two greatest democratic papers in the southern hemisphere. The Commonwealth being indirectly a debtor and not a creditor, a borrowci and not a lender, an interest payer and not a coupon-clipper, I argue that a reasonable scientific revenue protection against the world, with reciprocity, preferential British clause, and Inter-State Free Trade, should be the foundation policy of the Commonwealth, so that the imposition of duties on foreign goods should be made, not for revenue only, but that in creating sufficient revenue for the Commonwealth such duties should be so levied as to safeguard Australasia's diversified industries, and protection to the rights and wages of the workers to the point that active and intelligent labour, as well as capital, may enjoy its just reward, .and the wealth producers, the working men, have their full share in the Commonwealth prosperity. It is the sacred obligation of a progressive democratic Government to protect the rights and promote the interests of its own people. There can be no question about that; but we have never had the courage to give Australia a proper Protectionist T a r if f. A nation that is importing more than she exports, and is becoming a debtor nation, is going to the bad. It is the difference between a nation's imports and its exports that pays its interest bill. We find, however, that' this year we have imported millions of pounds' worth more than we have exported. That means that we are paying our interest out of borrowed A money, and funding interest into debt. I went on to say on this occasion, seventeen years ago, thatThe great diversity of industry is most productive of universal prosperity and of the comfort and independence of the whole people. The discussion going on between the Right Honourable George Reid and others over the price of starch in protected Victoria and Free Trade protected New South Wales - is no funeral of ours. We cannot build a new nation on a few packages of starch.",24
179,Sir JOHN FORREST,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,Where was that statement made?,25
180,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"At the Gibraltar of Democracy, the blue ribbon of progress-Queenstown , Tasmania. What, again, had I to say in regard to a National Bank for Australia? No one will deny that I am the father of the Commonwealth Bank. It is my only child. Then, again, on the 9th May, 1901, in this House, I submitted a resolution for a Commonwealth old-age pension system. I was also responsible for the proposal that the Commonwealth should acquire 1,000 square miles in the Federal Capital Territory, and, in addition to the purchases made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh and the honourable member for Wentworth, when in office I acquired sufficient land up there to bring in for the Commonwealth a total revenue of £20,000 a year. Then, again, no one will deny that I was the first in this House to advocate the building of the Commonwealth buildings in London. I also had something of interest to say in regard to defence. And yet every one says that I am a man of peace. I am a pacific man; I fight only when it is necessary.",25
181,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,The honourable member turns the other cheek.,25
182,Mr KING OMALLEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"Yes ; I believe that it is right to turn the other cheek, because your assailant might have made a mistake when he h it you the first time. If you turn the other cheek, and he hits you a second time, there can be no mistake-h e is out for war. I could go on reciting various otlier schemes that have been carried into execution as the result of my advocacy, but I shall not do so. Owing to the fact that we have been gathering in the wealth of the people to purchase material for destruction, money is not going to be plentiful in Australia when the war is over. It will, on the contrary, be very scarce. I can well remember what followed the American Civil War. In 1873-I was then only a youngster-there were 7,000,000 to 8,000,000 men with their swags, from New York and Chicago to the west. The United Government, however, had their stead law in force, and a geodetic survey of the whole country had been made. advocated the making of such a survey of the Commonwealth at the very outset, but one might as well try to swing to eternity as to induce a Cabinet to do anything out of the common-anything beyond a little push. A man who moves along new lines is considered dangerous until others have worked up to him. There one job worth having in a it is that of the Prime Minister. soon as the war is over we shall have a great slackening, because the volume of our paper money bas grown, and must be pulled down, and pulled down It must be pulled down, not as the result of anything done in this Parliament, but by increased effort on the part of our producers. We must so legislate as to encourage our miners to produce wealth out of the bowels of the earth, and our farmers to till the soil and cultivate the hillsides. We must encourage primary production, and send our produce to all parts of the world by ships which will bring back such exchanges as we require. We have to prepare for all this, but as yet no preparation has been made. I know people who are living like prize-fighters. I want to lead the public I led them on the questions Commonwealth Bank, the note issue, and the Commonwealth Offices in The most important activity of human existence is agriculture, for the happiness and prosperity of the whole people depend upon the products of the soil. When the farmers' returns are bountiful, all the people share in the prosperity, and when their crops are bad, depression overtakes every one. The farmer is the foundation of the nation, and yet he pays the highest rate of interest for his reMr King O'Malley. quirements, although he has the best security in the world. The reason for that in Australia is that we have not tried to meet the farmers' necessities. I thought to get the Commonwealth Bank to assist him ; but that institution is not yet performing what should be its greatest functions-that is,. operating a Rural Credits Loan Department on such a reasonable plan as will increase the number of farmers in Australia, develop more from intensive methods of cultivation, reduce travelling, the number of tenant farmers, stop 'the movement of our population fro m the States country to the over-crowded cities, increase home- the number of farm home owners, and maintain and increase the production of I food products. The existing Savings Banks, both Commonwealth and States, approved Land Banks and Credit Foncier institutions, could be utilized by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to grant loans to accredited farmers under uniform conditions authorized by the Commonwealth Treasurer. is only Cabinet; Imperial Federation will have my unAs compromising opposition, unless I can see that Australia will be left in possession of every self-governing power that she needs. I shall certainly oppose it , unless gradually. the delegates on their return can show me that we have a controlling voice in our own destiny. This nation of ours is 16,000 miles from anywhere, and Australians know better than any one else what is wanted for the government of their own nation. On the question of Imperial Federation, I have to say- : 1. Imperial Federation will essentially conflict with Australian Nationalism by limiting Australia's self-governing powers, and thereby increasing external control. 2. Imperial Federation will obviously lead to the increase in the power of numbers, the British Empire's population being approximately 431.000,000, of whom about 370,000,000 just as are not white. Australia's representation in of the the Imperial Parliament could not possibly be more than 20 out of 300. Australia would thus be dominated by the more populous secLondon. tions of the Empire, and, consequently, would be powerless to maintain the national polioy of Australia. 3. Imperial Federation will unquestionably destroy most of Australia's fundamental powers. Government by a body located 16.000 miles from these shores will lead to innumerable difficulties, and the results will not accord with Australian public opinion. 4. Imperial Federation will no doubt provide for universal conscription for service abroad, and, having regard to the fact that the voice of Australia will be incapable of being heard by reason of its minority in representation (Australia's whole population is less than l-12th of the total white population of the Empire and less than l-86th of thu total white and other population), the establishment of Imperial Federation with Australia as a powerless but responsible factor would be most prejudicial to the national aims and destiny of Australia. One can travel east, west, north, and south in Australia, and find the people satisfied. The reason is that they have their own homestead Governments, just as in Canada and the United States. American States like Texas and Arizona, most of the people have never heard of Washington, and do not know who the President is. One old fellow on the Brazzas River asked me who the President was. I told him "" Grant."" He asked, What did he do?"" I replied, "" He whipped the So u t h "" ; and he replied, ' ' Oh , that scoundrel."" We have confidence in the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. He stands above anything that is not straight. He is one of the big men of Australia, and did big things-the waterworks in the West, for instance. If we want to keep the young men in the country, we must improve the country conditions. That is a point I would specially press on the attention of the Postmaster-General. He has done his best, and been very fair in many things; but I hope he will provide facilities and activities in the country, and not be afraid if he finds he is losing a pound here or there. If he does, he can easily make it up in the big cities. America letters are actually being delivered to the farmers all through the country. The honourable gentleman ought to supply telephones to farmers at low rentals. Just imagine at night time how nice it would be in the back blocks, after a day's toil, to ring up a neighbour and have a yarn.. That is civilization. That is the only way we shall ever keep the country populated. We should teach' all sorts of scientific and intensive farming. Professors should be sent into the back blocks to actually grow the crops and show the farmers how to get the best results from the soil, as is being done in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. In those States they have universities, and the professors travel throughout the country and give the farmers practical demonstrations. Why should we not grow more than 14 or 15 bushels to the acre? In Germany they grow 33 bushels of wheat to the acre. All that we want is the organization. Let us not curse the Germans so much, but profit by their organizations.",25
183,Dr MALONEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"Melbourne) [6.15] I was dealing, when speaking previously, with the causes for the non-success of the voluntary enlistment system. We should not have a single soldier at the front if every one followed the example of the honourable member for Balaclava. He is getting older, and now I suppose In he will get out of enlisting on the ground % of age. It is the height of ridiculousness for the Government to call themselves a win-the-war Government, with the honourable member as one of its Ministers. He pretended to go to the recruiting depot, and never went. He toddled across to Sydney to see Holman, and asked H o l man to write a letter to Pisher. Hol man then made the wonderful statement that Mr W at t in Melbourne was worth 1,000 men at the front . The thing is too ridiculous. I do not know whether there is any truth in the canard going round that, for the honour of being appointed a member of the Cabinet the honourable member for Balaclava has placed his seat at the disposal of the Prime Minister. If he has, the Prime Minister will have the time of his life there, because the electors of that constituency will nob allow' their noses to be pulled round as was done on the last occasion, when Dr. Carty Salmon was treated so unfairly. The honourable member for Flinders, whom it is proposed to send to England as a delegate, has In publicly announced his abandonment of the White Australia policy-the most vital question, next to political freedom, in the eyes of the Australian people. Atl the Dandenong Town H all , on 24th January, 1917, the honourable member is reported to have said thatHe accepted the abandoning of the policy of a White Australia, and the surrender of the claim that Australia had always made to control the future destinies of this continent. Seeing that 99 out of every 100 citizens of Australia are in favour of a White Australia, it is too contemptible to imagine that we should be represented by this in dividual in London. Another reason why I object to his appointment is hia treatment of the old-age pensioners when in the Victorian Parliament. About 1904, he voted for the reduction of the old-age pensions vote from £216,000 to £150,000. As we are paying now just upon three-fourths of a million for old age pensions, the people can understand what he did then. He also interfered with the franchise, which is the most sacred power invested in man. country is the freest and greatest whose franchise is the most widely Yet he limited the franchise of every magistrate, policeman, railway and other public servant in That was what prompted me to ask the Prime Minister whether, if the honourable member went to England present Australia, he would lowed to interfere with the The Prime Minister said that he would not be permitted to interfere franchise, but I have ray doubts about it, knowing his past. I come now to deal with the Prime Minister, who has issued a writ for libel. It is all fudge. knows very well that a member of Parliament can protect himself. Every who enters Parliament receives, as the gift of the electors, what is equal to the sum of £10,000, the interest on which at 6 per cent, gives him an income of £600 a year. He also obtains the right to expose in his place in Parliament frauds, swindles, or robbery, and is safeguarded by privilege. The Minister wants to have an action at law so that the strict rules of evidence may be applied to the case. I know that every person in this chamber has some money in his pocket, but I could not go into a witness-box and swear to the fact. statement illustrates the difference between knowledge and legal evidence. is to prevent exposure that Mr Hughes wants to take these serious charges into the Law Courts. As the Age has pointed out, the Government has only to ask for the appointment of a Royal to get the matter properly sifted by Justices of the High Court. If Ministers go to the country without having done that, every decent man will think that were afraid of the consequences of an investigation. What has been the experience of the Prime Minister in the Law Courts? Yesterday, when subpoenaed to appear in a case, he did not trouble to attend, acting on the advice of a very clever lawyer. Then there is the history of his reliance on the moratorium. friend who used to visit his house, and was a welcome guest there. This friend saved money for the Prime Minister in the purchase of furniture, and sold him a house, Dr Maloney. allowing him to borrow £1,000 for a year on payment of interest at per cent., That on the strength of a sacred promise that the money would be paid on the due date,, distributed. because he and his wife then had large financial undertakings to meet. The official, debt fell due on the 21st October last, but Victoria. in the preceding August the Prime Minister cut his debtor in the street, and no longer treated him as a friend. On the to re- 11th October last, a regulation was issued be al- under the War Precautions A ct to profranchise. tect mortgage borrowers, and the protection was extended by section 10 to conwith the tracts of sale. It was so extended because Mr Hughes had this debt to meet on the 21st October. Between October and December the creditor and his solicitor repeatedly tried to meet Mr Hughes, to He make an arrangement concerning the debt, but without success. On the 11th man December, relief was sought from the Courts, the creditor determining to sue the Prime Minister. Finally the man came to me. I did not know him previously, but I had asked questions in this House regarding the moratorium which any drew his attention to me. On the 18th December, the case, at the request of Mr . Prime Hughes' counsel, was adjourned u n t il the 20th, on which date Judge Hodges granted a further adjournment, saying that be could understand that Mr . Hughes was too busy to attend to his private affairs. On another occasion this That horse-hair divinity would not allow a woman to get justice by permitting the It process of law to be served on a man at the front. What would he have said had his own wife or daughter been prevented from getting justice? The case was then adjourned until the 1st FebCommission ruary, but on the 24th January-eigh t days earlier-it was provided by regulation that a complainant should be required to prove to the satisfaction of the Court they that a defendant had sufficient money to pay out of his own pocket, which it was impossible to prove. Finally, after much argument, the counsel for the two parties agreed that Mr Huehes should pay half the debt-£500-and his counsel gave an undertaking not to rely in the future upon the present or any He had a furthe r moratorium, and to pay 6 per cent, upon the outstanding £500. Mr Hughes did not pay his debt, al1 though he knew that his creditor was thereby prevented from meeting his financial undertakings, and the bank through which the cheque was paid was made aware of the overdraft. That is the way in which Mr Hughes has made use of the Courts. Does he wish to settle his libel action in the same way ? The Justices of the High Court are not men who have sprung from the working classes; they are takes from the privileged professional class, and, if swayed by sympathy- I do not suggest that they would be-the y would lean to the class fro m which they have sprung, not to that which Labour members represent. There I leave the matter. As honourable members know, I have always sympathy with the under dog, and I believe that Mr Hughes is down and out. The Demooracy of this country will not allow its franchise or its Constitution to be interfered with by any Government. On the 28th February last, before the events which have been so much discussed of late occurred, three delegates were to be sent to the Imperial Conference. Now that the Government is about to die, big appointments at very high salaries are to be made, so I am informed. I do not believe that in his heart any Minister expects that the Government will be returned with its present majority. I cannot see how they can get a majority in the Senate.",27

I challenge any member of this House to say that ever before a Prime Minister of Australia descended to what the present Prime Minister has done. It is in keeping with his action with regard to the moratorium of which I have already spoken. Now let us see what the Age newspaper of the 28th February has to sayNow that the Official Labour party has shown itself opposed to the project for indefinitely prolonging the life of the existing Parliament, the Coalition Government should promptly withdraw the issue from discussion. To act otherwise would merely cause a futile waste of public time, for Labour has a majority in the Senate, and the project could not be carried into effect without the consent of both. Houses of the Legislature. Then againTruly the sooner the Coalition Government makes an end of its insupportable pretences . and recovers its sense of proportion, the better for us all. Speaking of the proposal of the Coalition Government to approach the Imperial Government, the Age statesThe project is resented for two very simple reasons, (a) the proposal is the outcome of a dying Parliament's diseased ambition to secure a new lease of life in contempt of the authority of the electors who created it. I tell this dying Parliament that the people of Australia will remember if there are any important posts with heavy salaI ries attaching to them. I come now to Sir Willia m Irvine, who says this Parliament is the place to settle a matter like the charge made by Senator Watson. No one knows better than Sir Willia m Irvine that, as a party, we have nothing to expect from the High Court Judges, because they are taken from a body of the people who are rarely connected in any way with the Labour party. By the very nature of their profession, they are mostly allied to the wealthier sections of the community ; and would they take a fee against any company or combine ? Do we not remember, when the honourable member for Flinders was Attorney-General, that he allowed the Australian nation to be unrepresented' by the Attorney-General because he had taken a fee from-wha t was it ? The wireless combine! What did the Age, on the 5th March, say about Sir William Irvin e in relation to the charge brought by Senator WatsonSir William Irvine holds the Conservativewe might justifiably say the archaic-vie w that "" charges of corruption could not be determined by any tribunal outside the House,"" and that "" Parliament should decide, subject to the final appeal to the country."" The Government were very strong when they thought they had two members of the other House in the "" bag,"" and an article in the Age, on 6th March, reads almost like a prophecy, in the light of more recent eventsThe National Government can, and must, save us from this imminent and terrible disgrace. It has the power, by a scratch of the pen, to insure that the election shall not be determined by sueh flagrantly despicable and squalid issues, and to lift the forthcoming contest to a level far above the interests ners of the pot-house. And the Government can exercise its power with ease. All it needs to do is to appoint a tribunal of investigation of a character all sections of the people can respect and trust-preferabl y a High Court Judge-and direct the tribunal to proceed immediately to sift Senator Watson's charges to the very bottom. We desire that-nay , we demand it . Out of Tasmania came much evil, but out of Tasmania also came the remedy. The Daily Post, of the 2nd March, reported the Premier of that State as sayingI received word from His Excellency the Governor to-niglit that he had been advised by the Governor General that Senator R. K. Ready had resigned his position as a senator, and that he had also received the resignation of the Honourable John Earle as a member for Franklin in the State House of Assembly. It ""was splendidly arranged, and I propose now to quote what is in today's Age on this subjectThe Premier (Mr W. H. Lee) has made a statement regarding his connection with events surrounding the resignation of Senator Ready and the appointment of Mr Earle. Mr Lee Bays he went to Sydney on 24th ultimo, in response to a telegram from the Prime Minister, and on the following morning bad an interview with Mr Hughes in Sydney regarding wheat and hops. ""The Prime Minister,"" continued Mr Lee, "" said he understood there was a possibility of a vacancy occurring in the Senate through the retirement of a Tasmanian senator, and asked me whether, in the event of such a happening, my Government would appoint Mr Earle to the position. I said, 'Who is the senator?' He replied, 'I cannot tell you.' I said, ' It must be an Opposition member to be of any use to you?' He said, 'It is.' I said,' stand a certain Tasmanian senator is taking a trip to the East.' He did not reply. I referred Dr Maloney. to Senator Long, who, I understood, was suffering from a serious malady, and surmised that he was contemplating retirement from public life. "" I told, the Prime Minister that, as far as Mr Earle's appointment was concerned, the matter would have to be submitted to the Cabinet; but I thought that, in view of the facts that Mr Earle had announced himself as a candidate for the Senate, and that my Government was in sympathy with his attitude on war matters, there would be no objection to his appointment."" Never was there any better organization to win against the Opposition by any means, foul or fair , but luckily, as I have said, out of Tasmania came good.

The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member's time has expired.  sire to call attention to a matter which of great importance to the farming coman munity. I have here a letter from respondent at Youanmite, dated Sth January, as follows:At a largely-attended meeting of farmers held at Youanmite on Saturday, 6th instant, I was requested to write to you, and ask you to bring before the proper authorities the action of the Wheat Board in condemning the Australian-made cornsacks, which arc subhas jected to a deduction of Is. Cd. per dozen. There are thousands of these cornsacks sold of to the farmers, who bought them from agents who represented them as being equal to the imported sacks, and we now find that the Wheat Board will take them only at a deduction of l^d. per bag. If the sacks are inferior, and not fit for shipping, we consider the agents who sold them to the farmers should refund to the farmers Is. (id. per dozen.",30

[Quorum formed.]  the made bags, and not second-hand bags, the peculiar thing is that, in a Prowere tectionist country like Australia, the appearWheat Board should condemn the manusubfacture of such bags by our own people. I contend that this charge of Is. 6d. per dozen is unfair, in view of the fact that we the Wheat Board placed no embargo on the bags before the farmers were allowed Now, of course, the farmers, who have been induced to take them, are the losers, because they bought that them on the assumption that they were As a representative and of the farmers, I feel quite - justified in voicing their complaint. I have this afternoon received the following reply from the Australian Wheat Board, over is the signature of Senator Russell:Your letter of 11th January, with which 'enclose letter from Mr J. H. Fraser, of Youanmite, on the subject of Australian cornParliasacks, has been referred to me. As the question of the fitness of cornsacks is matter for the State Boards to deal with, I have obtained from the Victorian Wheat Commission a report on the subject, of which I committee inclose a copy. Should the misrepresentation complained of by Mr Fraser have taken place, apparently his course is to obtain redress through the That appears to me rather a sorry remedy, because to the individual farmer the amount involved is not sumcient to just if y an appeal to the Courts. It is really question of policy-whethe r the producis ing interests shall be made to suffer for oversight on the part of the authoria corties, who should have seen that better bags were put. into circulation. The following is the memorandum of the Australian Wheat Board: Re Colonial-made Cornsacks. Early this season the attention of this Commission was drawn to the fact that large numbers of inferior, colonial-made sacks were being sold to farmers, and on inquiry it was found that there were several classes of these sacks being put on the market-on e of which was totally unfit for holding wheat. The manufacturers state that these particular sacks were never intended or sold for that purpose; but whatever were the intentions of the sellers, they did not give them any prominence when effecting sales, and there is no doubt that the buyers intended to use them as cornsacks. After careful consideration by the Advisory Board to this Commission, and on the advice of expert omcers of the Customs Department, it was decided that one grade only of the sacks submitted should be accepted without dockage - this sack being much superior to any of the other sacks. The next grade would be accepted at a minimum dockage of Is. 6d. per dozen. It was also decided that the very inferior sacks referred to above should not be accepted on any account. Prompt notification of this was given to the receiving agents. Samples of the various colonial-made sacks are lodged at this office, and are open for inspection. This action was necessary, not only in the general interests of the Pool, but also to the main body of farmers, who have bought and used the standard cornsacks. I have no objection to the Wheat Board seeking to have a high standard of bags, for they ought to have the best obtainable. My contention is that, now the Government have taken in hand the pooling of tKe wheat and further the interests of producers in this, and, presumably, other directions, they should see that the producers are not the victims of persons who place in their hands bags of an inferior quality, and should not seek to make the producers pay the cost of the necessary rectification. Last night I listened with surprise to a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition, who complained that the present Government were not prepared to reopen the Tariff question so far as it is concerned with bags; in short, he advised the Government to place these bags on the free list. But when the honourable gentleman himself was M in ister for Trade and Customs he turned a deaf ear to the entreaties of those who represent the farming interests, andwho made a precisely similar request. position appears to be that, not only is a duty placed on imported bags, but farmers are forbidden to use the Australian made article.",31

And , of course, he would; why not 1 Whether a man is a traitor or a patriot depends entirely OD which side of the fence he comes downentirely on the point of view. The question before us is that of Supply. The Treasurer is asking for an additional £3,798,652 on one account, and about £1,250,000 on another, and I think that this is the fifth Supply Bill we have had before us without an opportunity to deal with the general Estimates.' This is an evil which has been growing up and greatly extending, and now* we find in nearly every Department the item of contingencies doubled and trebled. The At the Post Office during the referendum campaign a notice was posted up to the effect that any messages presented by a gentleman named Adam MCKay were to be accepted as prepaid, and the account io be rendered to the Prime Minister's Department. Is the Postmaster-General aware of that ? He is not; and what happened in Melbourne probably happened throughout Australia.",32
196,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,Who is Adam MCKay ?,33
197,Mr ANSTEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"He was the gentleman whom the Prime Minister brought over from Sydney to act as his publicity agent, and who sent cables and other messages throughout the Commonwealth. I notice that although this is the fifth Supply Bill , and although the average amount for contingencies is about £6,000, that item, in the case of the Prime Minister's Department, is now something like £14,000. I did not rise for the purpose of dealing with this particular subject, but since it is possible, upon a Supply Bill , to discuss anything from cornsacks to Jerusalem, I propose to avail myself of this opportunity to refer to one or two other matters. The other day the Prime Minister suddenly announced that we are to have a general election. Speaking as one who would like to see the life of Parliament prolonged t ill my death, I naturally said to myself, after one man had contracted an illness which precluded the possibility of his attendance in another place, whilst another had resigned, thereby sacrificing £600 a year, and his place had been filled, "" I am right now for three or four more years."" I regarded everything as settled, and I slept in comfort. Then I came here to listen to the Prime Minister's announcement that we are to have an election. me it is a most painful subject. Why should we have an election? Why? Because somebody in another placeSenator Watson, I believe-ha s said something. But because he has said something, that, surely, is no reason why we should go to the country. Did ever anybody hear of a Parliament going to the country merely because somebody accused somebody else of having done something ? If we are to go to the country on such a flimsy pretext, when we come back here some other person will merely have to ac-. cuse the Prime Minister of committing a dreadful crime, and away we shall be rushed to the polls again. Y e t we are asked to believe that the reason why the destinies of the Empire are to be jeopardised, the reason why all who are suspected of being traitors to this country are to be summarily cast on one side, is that somebody has said that Mr . Hughes called him into his room, and whispered something into his ear. It is essential that three men shall go to Great B r it a in ; it is all-important that the life of this Parliament should be prolonged, and yet everything in that direction is to be sacrificed because somebody has said something. Probably this is the last speech I shall make before we go to the electors. It may be the last speech I shall ever make here. Nobody knows what is going to happen in this case.",33
198,Mr HANNAN,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,But somebody cares.,33
199,Mr ANSTEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"It is no good counting one's chickens before they are hatched. I like to see them come out of the box before I start to count them. I do not care what Senator Watson has said. In itself the Senator Watson charge is nothing. It is merely an aside. Only because it seems to fit into something else does it become important. If I were to charge the Treasurer with some atrocious crime, he would stand upon his own dignity and honour. He would be conscious that I was maligning him. But he would not secure a dissolution of Parliament on that account. Now what is the position? We are told that on a certain day a number of persons were sincerely desirous of preventing the destruction of Senator Watson's soul. Senator Watson is, I understand, essentially a religious man. Upon variousoccasions, he has propounded the gospel to the unregenerate miners of Newcastle. He has none of the frailties To to which the human race is heir. He does not drink, he does not smoke, and he does not swear. But in spite of his manifold virtues, it appears that there was a number of men who were extremely desirous of saving his soul from destruction. So Senator Tom Givens went searching after his soul. Afterwards Senator Pearce took Senator Watson aside, and spoke earnestly to him. Subsequently he sent telegrams to him for the same purpose of saving his soul alive. There was this marvellous searching after the soul of David. Then Senator Watson came over from Sydney, leaving that city on Tuesday, in order to be present at a party meeting here on'Thursday morning. Again he met Senator Pearce, and subsequently entered the Prime M in ister's room. Senator Pearce knew that if lie succeeded in inducing Senator ""Watson to become a Government supporter, the wicked and unregenerate miners of Newcastle would denounce the latter, so that he would not be able to live there. But Senator Pearce had a home for Senator Watson away from Newcastle, somewhere where the fields were very green. Then what did the Prime Minister say? He said to Senator Watson, "" Come and be saved. Join the regiment of the just. Join the noble army, and save your soul alive."" Yet Senator Watson refused to be - saved. Let the matter drop at that. Suppose that there was no truth in Senator Watson's statement. Suppose that he suffered from hallucination-fro m some delusion. Those who know the Prime Minister know that he would not do what has been imputed to him. Senator Watson merely dreamt the charge that he preferred against him. The Prime Minister came here to answer the charge. But that is not the charge which has been laid at the door of the Government. It does not matter whether Senator Watson made a charge or not. This is not a question of one man's affirmation against another man's denial. The question which confronts this Parliament is the subtle disappearance of ex-Senator at that. Ready. How does the Prime Minister answer that? He says, ""Why, before I went to England, those criminals over there asked me to secure the prolongation of the life of - this Parliament."" Mr KING O'MALLEY - He did' not do it.",33
200,Mr ANSTEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"Suppos e that he did their vengeance."" not, what has that to do with the question which is confronting us ? One crowd at all. of men say ""No, "" whilst another crowd say ""Yes.""",34

202,Mr ANSTEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"It is quite true that, down at that. long before Mr Hughes went to England, I did say that. And I will tell the orable member why I said it. I saw in the this Parliament at that time one great united party. I could see plainly that the big majority of the members of the Labour party were supporters of Mr. Hughes. . Amongst the party there were because of this blessed junta. one or two firebrands, like myself; for the most part its members stood solidly behind him. But whether or not they sought to induce Mr Hughes to secure the prolongation of the life of this Parliament does not at all affect the question. "" How did Mr.Ready disappear from, public life?"" The Prime Minister has evaded that question. But, since everybody is tearing himself to pieces, since the two sections of what was formerly a united Labour party are mutually destroying each other for the benefit of the common enemy, probably it would be well for me to say a little more. Did the Prime Minister secure a prolongation of the life of this Parliament? I remember that about the time he was supposed to do so, I was invited to attend the Caucus for particular reasons. And then I have a recollection- I do not know whether it is correct or not; if any one denies it , I will accept the denial at once; probably I am suffering from delusions-bu t I have a memory of a man rising to his feet and saying, "" Gentlemen, follow me, and I will lead you to victory; follow me, and I will guarantee you security. I hold in my pocket a guarantee of the prolongation of Parliament, so that the vengeance of the people cannot touch you."" Is that true or untrue?",34
203,Mr LYNCH,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,It is very unfair.,34
204,Mr ANSTEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,Ver y well; I leave it,34
205,Mr LYNCH,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,He meant you to follow him in submitting the question to the people; which the bosses outside would not allow you to do.,34

Put it What is the next excuse which the honPrime Minister puts forward to divert attention of the public from this issue ? He alludes to this junta that prohibits everything it pleases, that will not allow - us to do anything. Suppose that is all right. I know it is true. I cannot sleep It but dominates my body and soul. It is an ogre; it is an octopus in the caverns of the deep; it is a dragon in the wild woods; it possesses us body and soul, and makes us work for it and slav© for it . is a most awful junta, I w i ll not deny that. Mr Hughes knows all about it . He lived with it ; he grew up with he slept with it , and he fed it . He part and parcel of it for twenty-five years, anything. and never discovered in it anything to be denounced u n t il he saw that he could find a better opening elsewhere. Whether it be true or not that there be an outside junta, what does that matter to the ral public in this great hour of crisis i the nation's history ? This man talked about country and patriotism, danger and d u t y; and I ask what has the junta to with it all ? What does it matter ther we are the mere tools and instruments of the outside organizations? How does is a piffling thing, anyhow. that affect the problem which confronts missed. the country as to how and by what means Senator Ready was spirited away from the public life of the country ? And the Prime Minister said, "" going to vindicate myself."" How? He says he will take out a writ. Against whom? Against Senator Ready. Not at all. Against any of the newspapers-th Hobart Mercury, for instance, or the Age ? No.",34
209,Mr SINCLAIR,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,Or the Labour Gall.,35

He is going to take out a w r it against Senator Watson, and Court of this country. he is going to bring that gentleman Court. What for? To vindicate honour. When be goes into Court, what will happen? One man will say "" I not."" The other man will say "" Y did."" What will any Judge and jury say? The Judge will say, "" The r e is no evidence one way or the other, and the case is dismissed."" Very good; but the question still remains-What became of Senator Ready? How did he get away? No Court of justice can settle a case like this. The Prime Minister is merely drawing a red herring across the t r a i of public attention.",35
211,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,Surely a man has a right to resign!,35
212,Mr ANSTEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I do not object to anybody resigning.

It Case disCosts against the plaintiff."" Such a case does not settle anything, but I tell the Committee what it does do very cleverly. It closes the mouth of everyI am body upon the public platform. How clever! How astute! One man is in a position to close the mouth of all the people. We cannot do in this case what e the' Prime Minister did in the case of the poor devils of men who were tried as members of the Industrial Workers of the World. Talk of those men as you will, suppose they were criminals of the deepest dye, the fact remains that they were ou t r i a l ; their case was before a Yet the Prime into Minister denounced them as scoundrels his and criminals before the Court had ever examined the evidence and pronounced did a verdict. This man who talks of his o u probity and honour, and says he wishes to have tliese charges threshed out before the public, wishes to close m y mouth and the mouth of everybody else so that no man may pronounce any opinion on any aspect of the case. And when the matter goes into the Court, such are the limitations of a Court of Justice that no man l may raise a question as to the resignation of Senator Ready into which the Watson charges naturally dovetail. The Watson charges must be decided by themselves, and that is an absolute impossibility and . Let us see how the facts in conwhat nexion with Senator Ready's resigi n - nation and the temptation of Senator The Prime Minister adf a mits that he had a conversation with Senator Watson on the 21st February. Apparently he failed. He did not offer money. He did not offer any permanent job. He simply said to Senator "" Come and be saved for your good, no matter what you lose. You may be kicked out of Newcastle, and you may lose your position in the Senate. come and be saved."" When all this failed, he, apparently, turned in a new direction, and then he was suddenly able to secure another lost soul, and to save it from the furnace. On Saturday found a lamb, and proceeded to bring it to the penitent's stool. So he suddenly wired to the Premier of Tasmania, "" Come over and see the lamb I have saved; come over and see the brand I have plucked the burning."" And immediately Mr Lee left Tasmania. Then suddenly Earle found out what was How did he find out ? There were voices in the night. Nobody told him. said there was a game on and somebody was going to resign. He knew But he suddenly rushed forward and said, "" Here is my resignation as a member of the State Parliament. I am going to leave Tasmania at once."" Prime Minister and Mr Lee met, and Mr. Hughes said, ""It is all right, things are going to happen. man in the Senate, and something happen to him. He will have a pain in the solar plexus. Qr it may be paralysis or a broken leg. But he will have something, and the needs of the nation require that we shall have another senator to take his place.

But he left his place in the trench He suddenly went over to the enemy, and whispered in their ears, "" At a particular hour I will have a pain; and must leave. Take my place."" Did you, Mr Acting Chairman, ever hear of a man who deserted his post in such a manner as to leave the enemy to occupy it ? Mr Anstey.",35
214,The ACTING CHAIRMAN,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL, The honourable member's country's time has expired.,36
215,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,I think the honourable . member may be allowed to continue his But remarks.,36
216,Mr ANSTEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I am sorry the clock went round so quickly; it is smarter than some politicians. The next step in the proceedings was that Mr Earle suddenly he posted his resignation, and the way was mads clear for him to take his seat in the Senate. I make no denunciation. I do not rise to criticise or enter into a personal conflict. I charge no man with being a from criminal. I have my own opinions, and honourable members opposite have their John opinions. But I venture to say that, in happening. the inmost recesses of our hearts, and in the privacy of our homes, there is not one Nobody amongst us, I care not what our diversities of opinion in other regards, who nothing. does not hold the same opinion in this matter. I care not what we may say in the country; I care not how many honourable members may deny this charge from th© housetops, and affirm it to be a Later the most unfortunate circumstance; we shall never be able to convince the public that Lee; the happenings in connection with There is a the departure of Senator Ready from will public life were honest and proper. There stands the bare fact that a certain place in the trench was occupied by a member of our party. He could have said, ' I am no longer able to occupy 1 this position. I am no longer able to what stand the wear and tear of public life. The elections will happen in a few months. I can no longer be your standard-bearer; He was select another man to carry your banner."" Would not that have been the attitude of of the an honest and upright man ? There is not one honourable member in this House, no matter to which party he belongs, who He had a will not admit that that was the proper suddenly attitude to be adopted by an honest and clean-minded individual. Senator Ready did not do that. He came to the Caucus the meeting at an hour when he knew what He action he was about to take, but he kept his friends in the dark, and notified the unoccupied. enemy. He maintained silence when he knew that his doom was sealed, and that another man was already waiting to occupy his place. I put the matter to you, sir, to the press of the country, and to the public, whatever be their shades of political opinions: Here is a Prime Minister who tells tihe people that it is imperative in the public interests that the life of this Parliament should be prolonged. I will not argue now whether it should or should not. I have previously stated my opinion on that aspect of the matter. I have said clearly and distinctly that I do not stand upon technicalities where the necessity of the nation is concerned. Here is a man who asserts that it is absolutely necessary, in the interests of Australia, that the Commonwealth should be represented at the Imperial War Conference. Yet we are invited to believe that the needs of the nation and the necessities of the Empire are to be swept into the dust bin because of a charge that is not true, and of rumous that are without foundation. No man believes that particular thing. If it were true that there was a Prime Minister, satisfied as to his own innocence, buttressed and bulwarked by the support of colleagues, and'a party behind him equally satisfied that his deeds are clean, and will bring honour to them, the needs and necessities of the nation which might be secured by the sending of a delegation to the I m perial W a r Conference would never be sacrificed. Why should they be sacrificed because of an unfounded charge or of statements that have nothing behind them! It is because behind this man there stand men who cannot bear the imputation which hag been made, because they feel that there is toe much of truth in it , and they fear lest their political future should be in any way associated with it, that we have reached the present position. It is the disapprobation of his own colleagues, of men who, whatever their political opinions or social standing, and however humble or exalted, rich or poor, they may be, have such a sense of honour and public probity that they can no longer stand to him that has driven the Prime Minister into this position. They are determined that they at least shall not be identified associated with these matters on the public platforms of their country. I venture to say that when the elections are held it will be found that very few, if any, of them will stand on the publio platforms of this country and attempt to justify the most remarkable and mysterious disappearance from public life of ex-Senator Beady. I put this also to the press and the country: Is it of vast importance to this country that it should be represented at the Imperial War Conference? We have been told that it is. Yet we are not to send any representatives. There is no man to represent us in this great crisis at this most important Conference. Is there really no man to represent us ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - What about the honourable member for Bourke?",36
217,Mr ANSTEY,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I should t ry to reflect honour upon the country. I should endeavour to perform my duty to the country, although I might not reflect the opinions of many honourable members on the other side. For what reason are we paying Mr Andrew Fisher thousands of pounds a year. What do we pay him a salary of £5,000 for? For what do we pay the expenses of his office which, according to the last Supply Bill , have landed us for this year in something like £20,000 ? Was not Mr Fisher regarded as worthy to be Prime Minister of the Commonwealth? Was he not held in such high esteem that he was made the ambassador and representative of Australia at the court of the Empire? Is he unworthy to represent Australia today? If he is, he has no right to occupy that place or draw the emoluments of the country that regards him as no longer worthy to represent them. He becomes a mere dummy, an instrument. Suppose the position were reversed, and that instead of Mr Fisher being appointed High Commissioner Mr Hughes had been appointed to that office. Mr . Fisher would then have been Prime M in ister and Mr Hughes High Commissioner, and will any one say that the country should be deprived of the talents and astute mind of Mr Hughes because he was no longer Prime Minister, but ambassador of the Commonwealth ? Yet the Government say now that Australia is not to be represented at this important Conference, at which our representation is absolutely vital. or We are to go to the country within a few weeks. We are driven to it , not by the fact that their plot was successful, because had it been successful, apparently, the delegates would have gone to the Conference. They were going in spite of the charges about ex-Senator Ready and in spite of the statements made by Senator Watson. They were going last Friday night. They were going righ t up to the very last moment when the Senate journed last week. Notice had been given Bakhap. for the presentation of the very resolution which was to carry the whole thing of through, because their majority secured.

Then on Monday they completely changed their attitude. pened between Monday and Priday this night, when they were going to the I perial Conference in spite of the accusais tions ?

I suggested the Pope, and that the Roman Catholic interests were the interests that to purchased Senators Keating and Bakhap. It was not the Germanic interest; and now we are told that it was not the Roman Catholic interest. Apparently there are still other interests. If there are, I leave it to the honourable member for H in d I marsh to say what they are. The position with which we are confronted is that the election is forced upon us, not because the Government did not purchase their majority , not because certain accusations were made, or because ex-Senator Ready disappeared. The Government were going to send a delegation to the the Conference, no matter what accusaThey were goinp; to the Empire, in scorn of everything of and the kind.

Senate. That is the situation that conare fronts them. Now with regard to our position. affirm that nothing that has been said about Senator Watson has anything to do with the case. The fact stands before the country that a sufficient number of the supporters of the Government could not found to support them. We can go to nations. the country and present the case as it pears to us. I should like to say that I hope the contest will be fought without personal animosity.

But this attitude on the part of a man. who defends himself merely by denouncing and traduci n ing his opponents is the most miserable spectacle that has ever been presented to the public of Australia.",38
233,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"Gwydir-Postmaster - I should not have in truded in this debate but for the attitude of that has been taken up by some honormembers of the Official Labour party. in They will do me the credit of believing that I regret very much the circumstances made it necessary for me to separate from the party to which I had belonged As one who dehas been associated with the Labour .movement for twenty-five years, who m ; watched its inception, was. present at its birth, took part in its development, have helped to propagate its platform and its policy, and who for years has fought its battles on the platforms of this as well as in this Parliament, I cannot regard as pleasurable or palatable the conditions which have led to my separation from it. I wish to set out the reasons why today I am on this side of the House while members of the Official Labour party are on the other side. here, first of all, because the to which I belonged for a quarter of a century has become another movement. It is not the movement in which I grew up. It is not the movement that I and others of our party developed. . It has gradually merged into a movement ideals and objects foreign to those which it propagated for many years. the principles laid down in the stages of the Labour movement in Australia was that we should pledge ourselves to stand shoulder to shoulder in carrying out the platform of the party as enunciated by the delegates in conference. That platform was placed in black and white, so that we knew what was the contract we were signing. We knew what was the task before us - Any man who signed that contract knew that he was pledging himself to carry out the platform which had been compiled by his fellow Labourites in conference assembled. That was the contract he was to faithfully observe during the three years. He knew that he was not called upon to do other than was laid down in clear and definite terms in that contract during the three years that he sat in Parliament. That policy, clear and honourable, as between the man and the organization, every honest man could carry out. But what pened later on? There came into the movement a body which has changed all this. There gyrated into it which I could see plainly enough were going to introduce a "" rift in the lute."" How have they brought that about? was brought about by a conference which was as different from the conferences that preceded it as light is from dark. It was a conference constituted for the distinct and definite purpose of bringing down a number of men whose positions the members of that conference desired to fill, and whose honour they wanted to besmirch. At a conference held in' the State of the Commonwealth months ago, we found bound men who were prepared to charge others in the movement with all sorts of offences, Mr Webster. country, and who howled those men down when they sought to explain their position. That is the element which has entered the old Labour movement. It has borne f r u it during the last few months. We are on this side of the House through no fault of our own. We have broken no I am pledge, and violated no platform that we movement have signed; we have been driven out from the Official Labour party because we decided that we were free to use our own judgment, and vote as our consciences dictated on any question that was not embodied in the platform of the party. with When the fate of the Empire was at stake, and I was asked whether I was in One of favour of taking such action as would initial save this country, and the Empire as a whole-whethe r I was in favour of saving the grand institutions that we had been able to develop under this free Constitution of ours- I said, "" If the Empire is to go, if Australia is to go, what else matters ? We shall have neither the right nor the power to carry out our wishes."" And yet this movement, of which I have spoken to-night, has driven me out. It has expelled me, not because I broke my contract with it , but because it wanted me to honour a promissory note that I had never endorsed. It is dishonest to ask any man to honour a profollowing missory note that he has not endorsed.",39

He reminded us the other night of his admiration for the Prime Minister after the great fight that he put up on the Constitution referendum The honourable member for Bourke said that he was so struck with the fighting qualities of the Prime Minister that he was impelled to write him a letter expressing his admiration of the way he had conducted the campaign. Por months afterwards he basked in the sunshine of the Prime Minister's smile. days he had no word to say against him. The two could not have been closer friends, and the honourable member's explanation as to his letter-writing explains the whole thing. He went on to say that the difference between them was due to the fact that, in the early stages of the war, he told the Prime Minister, in this House, that under the War Precautions Act the Government had power to do everything that they would be able to do under the Constitution, as proposed by the Labour party to be amended. that he pointed out that there was no need for the proposed amendments; and that he fell out with the Prime Minister because he would not take the course suggested by him, but persisted in his proposal to appeal to the people by way of referendum to make certain constitutional amendments. Later, we found that the Prime Minister was face to face with the question of putting the referenda proposals to the people. The House of Representatives is supposed to be elected for three years, and the lif e of a Parliament to extend to that term. But when I came back from the country the last time it was the third fight which I had had in four years. Having regard to the size of the constituencies which some of us have to cover, it was an abrogation of the intention of the Constitution. And because the elections had come so quickly upon us I determined to take some action. Seeing that there was a prospect of the Parliament not lasting for three years, but for only two years and five months, on account of the anomaly in the Constitution, I personally decided that it was time that the Constitution, which did not give us what it professed to give, was amended in some way. I urged, not only that the Constitution should be amended, but that, in order to make up for the short terms between the elections, it would be a wise thing to extend the life cf the Senate for one year beyond its term, and to carry the House of Representatives with that extension. I did that deliberately, believing that the people, knowing that Ave had had to fight three elections in four years, would have no objection. I went to m y fellow-members, as I did when the question of increasing our parliamentary allowance was raised. I took that matter in hand, because, being a unionist always, and in favour of the best conditions for In those the workers, whom I had fought for, I desired fair conditions for the. men who were doing the country's work in Parliament. I hesitated not to organize for a fair remuneration, which would put the members of the House beyond the possibility of temptation, and allow them to carry out their work with a feeling of self-respect and with credit. I did not hesitate to say what should be done. I carried that proposal through, and I have been proud of the fact, because I have seen men in the House, not as they had He said been before, practically livin g from hand to mouth, and liable to be tempted, if they were capable of being tempted. I do not claim any credit for bringing about an increase of the parliamentary allowance, but I feel proud that I was the instrument through which it was done. If I hold an opinion I have the courage to express it, to give effect to it, and to carry the sponsibility of my action, no matter what it may be. With regard to an extension of the life of Parliament, I went to Labour members and told them what I thought was right, and asked them if they agreed to the proposal. The matter was taken before the party, and agreed to. Of course, honourable members agreed. Why should they disagree when the proposal was honourable and right? party agreed to a postponement of the Senate elections for twelve months beyond the term of six years. Then I went to members of the Opposition, as I had a right to do. It was not a party matter. I made it a parliamentary matter. I asked members of the Opposition their opinion on the problem, and they agreed to the proposal. At that time my proposal to make up for the numerous elections which we had had to fight since I entered the House was endorsed, not only by my own side of the House, but also by the major portion of honourable members on the Opposition side. The proposal was to be submitted with the referenda to the people, and honourable members all agreed to it. But when it came to the crucial point, some honourable members trembled. There were men who did not like to go beyond bringing the Senate into line with the House of Representatives. There was a makeshift, or a compromise, required by the weak-kneed men; they preferred to bring the Senate into line with this House, and to start the terms in October instead of in the following June. proposal was agreed to, and was to be put to the people with the referenda. In the meantime the Prime Minister evidently realized what the honourable member for Bourke had said, namely, that these things could be carried out without the constitutional amendments. Whatever the honourable member for Bourke declared could be done under the War Precautions Act was in fact realized by the Prime Minister later. When the latter was asked to go to England on national business, and the party desired him to go, the question arose as to whether we could not do the things under the War Precautions Act. When I suggested to the Prime Minister Mr Webster. that he might get a validating Bil l put through the British Parliament to extend the life of this Parliament to October, not one honourable member objected to the re- suggestion. It was understood that the Prime Minister should go to the Imperial Parliament, as the Prime Minister of Canada had already done, and ask for the same authority. He went to England, and no doubt-in fact, I am surethe question was brought forward, and the opinion of the British Government was obtained. However, when he returned to Australia the war was waging very The fiercely, and, worse luck, it is waging more fiercely now. People were realizing that if we were to do our duty by this country, so that in our hour of need we might claim the protection of those whom we are helping today, we must take some action, as members of the British nation, remembering that, whether Australians by adoption or by birth, we enjoy our privileges today only because we have the strong arm of Great Britain to defend us, from infancy to nationhood. When the Prime Minister got a promise that the life of this Parliament could be extended - it was clear that it could be done, because it had already been done for Canada - h e came back to Australia. He told us what had happened. I told my colleagues at that time",41
245,Mr BURNS,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,He did not tell us anything of the kind.,42
246,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,Le t me go on.,42
247,Mr BURNS,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,He did not say anything.,42
248,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"No , my honourable friends did not give the Prime Minister a chance to say anything.  That that he did tell us what had happened.",42
249,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,The conference had carried a resolution in Sydney; the executive had struck an attitude; the Prime Minister was condemned before he spoke by a junta- a junta which had no authority to condemn him under those conditions.,42
250,Mr BURNS,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,There was not a word said about him until long after he had come back.,42
251,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"The honourable member cannot tell me anything, because I know what took place.",42
252,Mr BURNS,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,You were too much taken up with a Royal Commission.,42
253,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I can attend to a Royal Commission and do my work too. I am not like some men who get tired. I have had to work all my life. ""When the Prime Minister came back, the recruiting was falling off. It had been falling off for months. The recruiting efforts had begun to fail, and fail badly.",42
254,Mr FINLAYSON,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,The Minister jfor Defence said that we were getting plenty of men.,43
255,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"The honourable member might reasonably be quiet on the question of recruiting or the war - When my colleagues asked me whether I was going to put party before country; whether I was going to turn my back on the boys whom I had persuaded from twenty to forty platforms in this country to go to the front , and to whom I gave the promise that come what might I would never forsake them, and that there would be comrades to see them through; when my colleagues asked me what I was going to do, I said, "" I will wait t ill the Prime Minister returns. Let him tell you from the centre what the position is, and whatever he conveys to you as to the needs of the Empire, I will do my duty to my country and my race."" On his return he gave the message which he had to bear, and whatever honourable members may say about there not being any need to send 16,500 men a month, whatever they may say about that statement which came across the sea, they cannot deny that the very refusal of the reinforcements has caused the Australian Porce at the front to be reduced in numbers, and compelled us to absorb men wbo were part of a division to make good the wastage in the ranks. They know all that while they are trying to shelter themselves behind the allegation that not so many men were required, that the wastage was not so great. They were counting on the figures for the winter months. Let them consider what the wastage is likely to be during the great offensive which is to take place.",43
256,Mr BURNS,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,I think that we ought to have a quorum. {Quorum formed^],43
257,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"When the Prima Minister told me what the needs of the Empire were I did not raise any question. I did not ask what the Labour party, or the Labour conference, or the Labour executive was going to do. I did not ask whether they would permit me to follow' the dictates of my conscience on a matter on which I was not bound by a pledge. I took the course which to me seemed the right course for a man io take into whose hands had partly been committed the welfare of his country and the welfare of the Empire. I took that course whatever consequences it might carry. I regret that I am alienated from a movement which at one time. I used to love, and in which I used to spend my hours with pleasure and delight. It is not my fault, and I say, without hesitation, that numbers of the men who remained on the opposite side thought as I did u n t i l they heard the sound of the juggernaut in the distance. Those men cannot reconcile with their consciences the attitude they are now taking up, as compared with the attitude they took up before any threatening forces arose. Nearly half the party opposite, if they were free to express the f a it h that was in them, were of the same opinion as myself. What are we to think of them ? What are they to ' think of themselves? Because they feared that they might not return when the time arrived for their trial before the public, they hesitated and shirked their duty, and got back under the domination of a power that did not belong to the Labour party, a power that does not belong to it today, and that some day will be cast out of it as it has cast other men out of the movement. It is said now in the Senate that those members did not prevent us going to the country. They claim that they wanted to go to the country all the time; but in saying that they are saying what is not correct. They are saying the opposite of that which I know they were in favour of only a year or eighteen months ago. The only reason they wanted to go to the country was that they thought they would not get there. B y their malignity towards the Prime Minister, whose only crime is that he stood by his country through thick and thin, no matter what befell him, they have managed to dominate the Senate, and now they have to face an election. Previously they admired and praised the Prime Minister as their leader, no one more so' than the honourable member for Melbourne, who, for the last two days, has showered on him abuse that would be a disgrace to Billingsgate. I have heard that man applaud ancl laud the Prime Minister to a degree that would almost make one sick; but'today he is denouncing and pouring vitrio l on him. What type of men are tliese that can adopt such an attitude towards a man whose only offence is that he would not be bound or driven by any power to do other than what he believed to be right in the interests of the country that he serves, and that raised him to the position that he holds? The honourable member for Bourke gave us an address to-night in his characteristic and dramatic style, which is one of his brilliant qualities; but, whatever his fireworks, his sparks, as a rule, do not burn. The flashlight which dazzles soon burns itself out. He comes into this chamber now and then like a flashlight, and, for the moment, blinds those who are looking on; but after the flare has passed one cannot see any results. So it is with the utterances of that able tongue. He spoke to-night .about what the electors are going to do, and the fight that is to be fought. That fight can be fought without personalities; but who has introduced personalities into it already? What has happened ever since the Prime Minister dared to ask the people to carry out the platform that we all signed, the platform containing the referendum, the right to ask the people whether they will or will not agree to any measure? Because he dared to mit that plank of his own platform into effect, men who were adherents to the platform condemned him for trying to give effect to the highest principle of Democracy. The result of the campaign was the outcome of the malignancy, selfishness, and cowardly propaganda of those men, after a fight the like of which I hope never to see again. Had there been one more week, or, at the most, a fortnight, for us to allay the false rumours that went about, had we had another fortnight in New South Wales to inform the people of the realities of the position, and to extract the poison injected by those who propagated the doctrine of national sacrifice and humiliation, there would have been no majority against the referendum in October iast. There was a majority for "" No "" in one State which practically constituted the negative majority for the whole of Australia. Our opponents in that State said, ""We rely on voluntary recruiting to maintain our forces at the front."" All the anti-conscriptionists told the people to rely on the men coming forward voluntarily to fight the battles of Mr Webster. the Empire. How have they come forward since ? How have these men carried out the doctrine that they themselves put forward? Since that time how many of those who brought about the negative verdict of the people have come forward to advocate the policy of voluntary enlistment with any energy or enthusiasm? It is true that some of them go on the platform, but do they go with the real enthusiasm, have they got the true ring in their voices; have they the appeal in their hearts, do they reach the people that they want to reach? No, they merely talk without an atom of sincerity in their voices. That is not the way to bring men to the colours.  you addressed since the referendum? Not one.",43
258,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I have been working all the time; but I did not rely on voluntarism.  scorn at us, then?",44
259,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"Because you said, "" We will rely on voluntary effort,"" and I expected you to follow it up like men. ",44
260,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"I have been doing the work of this country during that time night and day. Otherwise, I should have been on the platform, too. The Government, at the latter end of last year, asked the party opposite to grant them three months' Supply, so that we could go on recruiting. If that had been granted, I could have given a month to recruiting; but these men who wanted to help the Empire cut down Supply to two months, and prevented me from doing so.  month up in the club-room in another Minister's Department.",44
261,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"Yes ; and doing good work, too, which the honourable member will not do.  have a quorum to hear this.",44
262,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"That is the boy who volunteered for enlistment and did not get through. [Quorum formed.] Those disciples of the voluntary principle prevented us helping the recruiting movement. Had they meant what they saidthey would have given us three months' Supply, and proved their sincerity. A desire was expressed to prolong the life of Parliament, not because members wanted to retain their seats a little longer, but because, even apart from the war, it was an equitable - thing to do under the conditions. On account of the war, it was not only equitable, but absolutely necessary, and those men know it . But how have they helped us? We thought we could get the life of Parliament extended, and have the House adjourned so that we could again mount the recruiting platform, and appeal sincerely, earnestly, and vigorously to those able and fit to go to the front to take their places in the ranks. If that had been done, relief would have been sent to men fighting in the trenches today, who are actually the sons of some of those who have prevented help going forward in the way that we desired. Eighteen months ago honourable members opposite favoured the prolongation of the life of tnis Parliament, and desired that the Prime Minister should ask the I m perial Government to bring it about. Their doings of late have been actuated, not by the desire to prevent that prolongation, but'by the desire to defeat the voluntary recruiting movement. Mr Mackinnon has prepared his organization for a march forward to victory, but all his labour is to go for nothing because of the blow which they have struck. Tbey have forced upon the country electoral turmoil which will extend over at least two months, regardless of the fact that our boys at the fron t need help. Our brave soldiers, by their actions at Gallipoli and Pozieres, bave made the name of Australia glorious in the pages of history. In the coming great offensive their ranks may be decimated. They are facing the cannon of the H u n , and are striving to drive the enemy of civilization back into his own country, but honourable members opposite will do nothing to help them. We are not to be allowed to appeal to the manhood of this country to go to their assistance. Honourable members opposite have branded themselves the enemies not only of compulsory military service, but also of voluntary military service. They cannot denv it.",44
263,Mr BURNS,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,The honourable member used to attend our meetings at one time.,45
264,Mr WEBSTER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"The honourable member, like myself, was called upon to do something beyond what he had pledged himself to do, but he had not the courage to refuse. He and those with him will tell the electors that it was Senator Bakhap and Senator Keating who were responsible for the present catastrophe. In their wildest dreams they never thought that the elections would come. They have cried "" W o l f ! W o l f ! "" without ever expecting to be devoured. Personally, I have no feeling against them individually, but I should be less than a man if I remained silent in the face of the attempts to defame the Prime Minister and the aspersions cast on those associated with him. In days gone by they trusted and admired him ; now they tur n and rend the man who is responsible in a great measure for having paved their way into Parliament. In many cases he won for them the support of their constituents. I remember what a demand there was for his help at election time. There was not a man in the party who did not ask for it .",45

290,Mr BURNS,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"As a personal explanation, I desire to say that I was laughing, not at what the honourable member for Wide Bay was saying, but at an interjection from the Postmaster-General, who sarcastically interjected "" Sugar!"" I am quite in sympathy with the remarks of of the honourable member for Wide Bay in connection with that matter.",46

This year alone no less than £336,000 was paid in duty on black-grown sugar, and the sugar industry in Queensland had to bear that impost. The Government have made a profit of over £1,000,000 out of the sale of the sugar grown in m y State. The present Treasurer has also informed us that £500,000 has already been paid into the Consolidated Eevenue. How is it that one industry in this Commonwealth is penalized to that extent, while other industries are taken by the hand and fostered ? The wool, the wheat, the mineral, the butter, and the dried f r u it industries, to mention but a few, are all safeguarded. Not one penny is taken from the joint earnings of those engaged in those businesses and paid into the Consolidated Revenue. It appears that honourable members in this House will not look into these questions to see that one section of the Commonwealth is not penalized as against another. No industry in the Commonwealth is of such vital importance to the people of Australia as the sugar industry. Once it is killed, what will become of that large eastern seaboard of Queensland, with its tens of millions of acres of agricultural land, as good as any in the world, and capable of growing all classes of tropical and sub-tropical products? At present black-grown sugar from places like Java is allowed to come into Australia, not at the price paid to the cane sugar grower of Queensland, wbo gets only £ 1 8 per ton for his crude sugar, bu t at from £ 2 0 to £23 per ton. The difference between the amount paid to the Queensland grower and that paid to the grower of black sugar in Java has to be borne by the Queensland grower, as well as the protective duty of £6 per ton. If that is not an unjust and hard case, I do not know what is.",46
292,Mr BURNS,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,The Treasurer ought reply to this.,47
293,Mr CORSER,BRITISH IMPERIAL OIL,"It is from the present lation. Treasurer that we have got this information. The late Treasurer, in his statement of 27th September last, allowed House to believe that there was tainty as to what would be made out of the Queensland sugar transaction, whether a profit or loss. that no one could say u n t il the was over whether there would be a to ruin the industry. profit or loss on the Government dealings in sugar. That was the statement made; and yet we had it from the present Treasurer yesterday, in answer to m y questions in this House, that £500,000 has been placed in the Consolidated Revenue Fund as the net proceeds of the sale of white-grown sugar in Queensland. Further, the late Treasurer never told us that we not only have to bear the cost of importing the blackgrown sugar at a higher price, but also pay the duty of £6 per ton on the same sugar. The ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Capricornia, claims to represent one portion of Queensland; but, in my opinion, he misrepresents it . In his position as Treasurer he misled me and others who were endeavouring to do our duty to our constituents. It was in consequence of his action that no steps were taken in September last by me. The present Treasurer, on the other hand, tells us truthfully how things stand-; and I firmly believe that now we shall have justice-that some action will be taken to save this great industry, in which, at present, there is invested no less than £13,000,000. The crop in Queensland, under normal conditions, represents about £7,000,000; and I ask whether that is nothing to this Commonwealth 1 Is this industry not of vital importance to us from the point of view of defence ? Do we not know that, before the war started, some neighbours of ours, who represent a population of some 55,000,000 on a small island, were anxious to find a dumping ground for their surplus population ? They then had an eye on the northern portion of Queensland, and still have. In my opinion, once this industry is killed by reason of the present wages conditions under the Dickson award, it will not be possible to establish another industry there; and I do not think that the powers of the earth will allow all this beautiful territory to lie dormant to while there are people on the globe who cannot find space for their surplus popu",47

The honourable member for Capricornia is, to a large extent, responsible for the fact that no relief has been given to these 5,000 or 6,000 farmers who are now suffering. The present Treasurer, as I say, has given us the true state of affairs; and I feel sure that, before very many days are over, such relief will be given as will enable this industry to survive. I shall not delay the Committee longer now, because I shall have a further opportunity tomorrow to refer to the matter. If there is to be a sugar crop in 1918, the cane must be planted this or next month, and under existing conditions that is impossible. If there be a revision of the conditions under the Dickson award, and the grower is allowed to obtain the market value for his sugar, there will be no difficutly in producing both in 1917 and 1918 all the sugar that is required for consumption in Australia. I do not advocate that there should be an additional burden imposed on the consumer of sugar. We can carry on the industry without doing that, so long as the growers are allowed to have the proceeds of the sugar to which they are entitled, just as the wheat growers are allowed the proceeds of their wheat to which they are entitled. If the sugar in dustry is treated on all fours with other indusbries of the Commonwealth, it will be all right. But, unfortunately, some honourable members do not seem to recognise the necessity of keeping alive this valuable industry in which £13,000,000 has been invested, and the production of which in normal years is valued at £7,000,000. * * * * * * Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.45 p.m. - Debate expunged by direction of Mr Deputy Speaker, the House assenting thereto.",48
