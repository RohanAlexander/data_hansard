0,NA,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"NA FIRST SESSION OF THE THIRTY-FIFTH PARLIAMENT Pursuant to the Resolution of the House House of Representatives met in the new at 4 p.m .. Monday, 22 August 1988 Madam SPEAKER (Hon. Joan Child) took the chair at 4 p.m., and read prayers. NA SPEECH OF THE GOVERNORNA",10
1,Madam SPEAKER,GENERAL,"Order! I wish to report to the House that I have received a copy of the message from Her Majesty the Queen and the speech of His Excellency the Governor General, delivered earlier today in the Great Hall to mark the inaugural sittings of the two Houses in this building. In order that there may be a full written record of today's proceedings, I propose that they be incorporated in Hansard. The document read as followsNA NA GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE NA NA NA PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA ON MONDAY, 22 AUGUST 1988 I begin with a message from Her Majesty the Queen, sent on this historic occasion: I am delighted to learn that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia today begins its work NA NA Hansard 1988 (THIRD PERIOD) of Representatives passed on 3 June 1988, the Parliament House on Monday, 22 August 1988, in its new home. I have happy memories of the opening ceremony which, for me, was a highlight of the bicentennial year. I take this opportunity to send to the people of the Commonwealth of Australia my heartfelt wishes for their prosperity and happiness and am confident that the deliberations of the Parliament in this building will be directed to that end. Elizabeth R. 22 August, 1988 Nations, like people, take their shape, their style and character, from their inheritance and from their environment. If today is, for Australia, historic, it is because this occasion, today, in the nation's capital, is the outcome of all that has shaped Australia over the past 200 years. For thousands of years the first inhabitants of this then isolated continent lived their lives free of the need of principles for the governance of a nation in the modern world. But from the first day of that landing of the First Fleet in Sydney Cove 200 years ago, perhaps in all history the most curious of beginnings of any nation, a policy has been evolving: from governor's rule of a penal settlement, through stages of representative and then responsible government, first colonial and then federal and national, to this day; the day when, for the first time, the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia will sit in its own permanent home in the national capital. Today when the members of this Parliament take their seats in the two chambers of this Parliament House they will know that in doing so they mark a momentous milestone in the long history of Australian democracy. That spirit of democracy asserted itself in colonial days and was the sure foundation upon which our fede-al nation was created. It has been dear to us ever SInce. This is the third home of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Our Constitution makes short work of Parliament's place of sitting; almost abruptly it declares, in section 125, that: The Parliament shall sit at Melbourne until it meet at the seat of Government. And sit in Melbourne it did, in borrowed splendour, for a quarter of a century, in that great palace at the top of Bourke Street, Victoria's own Parliament House, while the seat of government was duly determined and a provisional Parliament House built there, in Canberra. It sat in Melbourne from its first day of sitting on the afternoon of 9th May 1901, until late in the afternoon of 24th March 1927. Then, both to the intensely emotional strains of Auld Lang Syne and to the no less intense relief of long dispossessed Victorian legislators, it adjourned; to meet next, in May 1927, in Canberra in that much more modest, white stuccoed brick building down the hill which, to the minds of at least three generations of Australians, has been the symbol of our federal parliamentary democracy. Now, some sixty years on, Federal Parliament moves again but Australia's long traditions of democracy continue unchanged. As the measure of these things goes in the world community of nations, Australia is among the most enduring continuous democracies that the world has known, even if we reckon only from the time of Federation, which, incidentally, does scant justice to our own vigorous colonial democracies of the second half of last century. Apart from Britain, from which our free institutions spring, and the two great democracies of North America, no one of the now many nations of Asia, Africa or the Americas, and only two, I think, of all the nations of Europe can count a similar uninterrupted span of over 87 years of democratic government-years of governments which have come to power by the free vote of the people and which have at all times held themselves effectively accountable to the people. This great new Parliament House is itself a celebration of our democracy, of the success on this continent of what, in the heady days of Britain's reform bills of the last century, was thought to be a too hazardous experiment: the giving of the vote to all of the people. We inherited from Britain the traditi0!1s of parliamentary democracy; we took from the Umted States its own bold experiment in federahsm. Then, bolder still, we combined the two and produced a f-deral. and parliamentary commonwealth of which thiS building now becomes the symbol. Perhaps we Australians haven't'In the pas t been very. strong on sY!l1 bols; at least away from the sportIng field. We hke to think we don't I store by them or by the titles of officeP aTche muhc always been the style of our democracy. But here on Capital Hill, we now have a symbol we can't ignore, one that will remind the Australian people of the weight of responsibility that rests on those it elects to Parliament, that will affirm to all who are elected to represent the nation in this House of the Parliament that it is upon the quality of their deliberations and the wisdom of their decisions that this nation's future and the welfare of all Australians, now and long into the future, will depend. May the splendour of this building inspire them, and the nation, to high achievement and to noble goals. NA HOUSE: VOTE OF THANKS",10
2,Mr HAWKE,GIFTS TO NEW PARLIAMENT,"I move: That this House expresses its thanks and appreciation to the Parliaments, Governments and peoples of those countries, States and Territories and to those organisations which have so graciously presented gifts to Australia's new Parliament House and extends a warm welcome to those Presiding Officers and representatives who are present today. Madam Speaker, on the historic first sitting day in this building, I should like to take the opportunity to express the appreciation of the Parliament, the Government and the people of Australia to the parliaments, governments and peoples of those countries, States and Territories and those organisations which have generously presented gifts to Australia's new Parliament House. It is particularly pleasing that representatives of many of those donors, including the presiding officers of other parliaments, are able to be with us in the House today. The internal spaces of the building now display the embroideries, tapestries, paintings, maps and other gifts sent here from the four corners of the world and the four corners of Australia. They are already part of this building's own history. And, of course, outside the building we see sculptures, benches and trees presented by our friends to add to our enjoyment when we escape our duties within these walls. It is appropriate that I make special mention of the gifts located within this chamber. The chamber table, made in Australia to the Parliament House architects' design, was sponsored by the Canadian House of Commons, and the Hansard table is a gift from h the State of South Australia. All these gifts . at as will remind us and future generations of parliamentarians of our international ties, our bonds with the Australian States and the responsibility that we owe to the Australian people to cherish and preserve our system of parliamentary democracy. In expressing my thanks to those who join us for this special day and to those who have presented gifts, I believe that they share our pride in this great building. Their generosity indicates the respect in which Australia's system of parliamentary democracy is held and which will prosper in these new surroundings.",11
3,Mr HOWARD,GIFTS TO NEW PARLIAMENT," The Liberal and National parties join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the members of the Government in expressing thanks to people in Australia and around the world and organisations and nations that have contributed gifts to mark the opening of the new Australian Parliament House. They will over time add to the character and history of this building. The enormous number of countries which have presented gifts clearly demonstrates the enormous impact and interest that this building and its completion, scope and size have created around the world. A wide range of organisations, including such Australian bodies as the Country Women's Association, the National Australia Day Council, the Returned Services League of Australia, the War Widows Guild, the Embroiderers Guild of Australia and many other organisations representing ordinary Australians going about their ordinary lives, have presented gifts. The Opposition joins in thanking those people for the contributions they have made. As we are talking about gifts, there is one gift that I regret we cannot talk about today in a positive sense. That is the gift of the United Kingdom Parliament on the establishment of the provisional Parliament House in 1927. It is a matter of very great regret that it is not in this place; but in time, I can assure the House, that gift will be returned to its rightful place in this chamber.",12
4,Mr SINCLAIR,GIFTS TO NEW PARLIAMENT,"Madam Speaker, this is a House in which we all still need to settle. It is a forum where some will survive and others will not. The important part about the institution and the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is that the institution itself is a gift from another country. We have inherited the parliamentary system of the United Kingdom. Our Constitution translated that into the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Within this Parliament, the third House of the members of the Australian Parliament, it will be translated into interpreting the will of the people on behalf of the people in the democratic system to which we belong. The first and most significant thanks that I extend, in supporting the Prime Minister's motion, are to the British nation for having passed on to us the traditions of parliamentary democracy. There is no doubt that over the last few months so many people have contributed to making this building something more than just an architect's dream. Both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) have listed some of those who have made specific contributions. The important thing about those contributions is that they are reflections of the way in which the people of the world and the people of Australia are brought together through this place. This place is a forum where we can express, on behalf of all Australian people, the views and attitudes we have to international affairs and the views and attitudes we have to affairs within our own country and where we interpret and listen to those views that might be sent to us from abroad. People around Australia and people from abroad have contributed to making this House what it is. All of us say thanks to them. Perhaps in turn we can give thanks by continuing to be a positive member of the international community. This House will never be memorable and it will never be a place within which a positive contribution can be made towards good government in Australia unless we are prepared to interpret to those gifts and to our own gift of democracy to other countries some of the hope and opportunity that are essential within Australia. We are fortunate in so many aspects of our democracy; others sadly are not. Perhaps in thanks for what has been given to us we can pass on to others some of the hopes for freedom, including freedom of speech and freedom of religion, and those essences that came to us from Great Britain. By doing that no doubt we will be able in the best way to say thank you to those who have been generous to us. On behalf of the National Party I share totally in the sentiments of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NEW PARLIAMENT HOUSE: VOTE NA",12
5,Mr HAWKE,OF THANKS,"I move: That this House extends its sincere following persons and organisations associated with the planning and construction of the new Parliament House: (I) Mitchell/Giurgola and Thorp Architects who designed it; (2) the Parliament House Construction Authority, Concrete Holland Joint Venture and all contractors and workers who built it; (3) the artists, craftsmen and craftswomen who advised on and assisted in its furnishing decoration; and (4) the members of the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, all past and present members of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, officers of the National Capital Development Commission, Parliamentary and other staff, for their endeavours in providing a magnificent manent building for the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. Madam Speaker, the care and dedication that have gone into the construction of this building give us a lasting debt of gratitude to all those men and women who have been involved. To the architects, Romaldo Giurgola and Richard Thorp, we say thank you for your vision in designing a building of which all Australians, present and future, can be justly proud. We thank also the Chairman, members and the Chief Executive of the Parliament House Construction Authority and their staff for their hard work and dedication throughout the construction phase of the building. To Concrete-Holland Joint Venture, the construction manager, and all the other contractors and workers involved in the project who, by the labour of their minds and bodies, have made it the remarkable reality it is, we also express our gratitude. We also recall the work which has been done by the members of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, officers of the National Capital Development Commission and parliamentary and other staff in the building. The Clerks must feel relief today that, after so much planning, these ceremonies are taking place at last. The new Parliament House embodies the work of over 10,000 men and women with contributions from individuals and manufacturers from every State and Territory. It is a national showcase demonstrating the skills and energy of the Austrathanks to the lian work force. Madam Speaker, the integration of Australian art and craft into the new Parliament House is a key part of the building's architectural expression. The artists, craftsmen and craftswomen have created significant works now displayed throughout the building. The meeting place mosaic, designed by Papunya artist Michael Nelson Tjakamarra and faband ricated by masons William MCIntosh, Aldo Rossi and Franco Colussi, stands in the centre of the ceremonial pool at the heart of the forecourt and is, appropriately, the first work of art visitors see when approaching this building. In the Great Hall the tapestry, by 14 weavers of the Victorian Tapestry Workpershop, dramatically depicts an Australian coastal landscape created from paintings by Arthur Boyd. In the first floor public gallery, the embroidery, designed by South Australian artist Kay Lawrence and produced by more than 1,000 members of the Embroiderers Guild of Australia, narrates the history of Australians' involvement with the land. The marquetry, designed by South Australian Tony Bishop and interpreted by Sydney craftsman Michael Retter, can be found in the Cabinet entry waiting room, the Cabinet Room itself, the formal entrance foyer and in your chair, Madam Speaker. There are many more craftspeople and artists who have contributed to the national character of the new Parliament House. Tasmanian woodworker Kevin Perkins and others have handcrafted tables and desks for the use in principal suites. Other important works of Australian woodcraft include the King table in the reception hall and display cases in the foyer exhibiting constitutional documents. We could continue enumerating at length for, wherever we look, we see work worthy of praise. I am sure, Madam Speaker, that for many months to come we shall continue to discover new delights as we move around the new building. To all those who worked to give us this home for our Parliament I express my sincere thanks. I hope that many Australians will have the opportunity to share our gratitude-and, indeed, excitementwhen visiting this Parliament House.",13
6,Mr HOWARD,OF THANKS," On behalf of the Opposition I again join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in expressing our thanks to all those who have been involved in the original concept of the design and construction of this new Parliament House. More than 10,000 people have been involved in the construction of the Parliament House. It has been the largest construction work in the Southern Hemisphere. It is, as the Prime Minister said, a tribute to the workmanship, skill and vision of Australians from many walks of life. We owe a lot to the original design concept. It is worth recalling the words of the former Prime Minister who said in November 1978: It will be the centrepoint of modern Canberra, the peak of the Parliamentary triangle, the hub of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, a place in which the affairs of the nation can be conducted in a more efficient way ... The new Parliament House symbolises our unity as a nation and as a people and is an expression of our joint pride, faith and confidence in Australia. I think those words would represent the views of all honourable members in this chamber, particularly on this opening day in the new parliamentary session. Those of us-and there are many-who served through the middle 1970s when the debate was raging over whether we should have a new parliament building will remember the intensity of that debate, and at various stages many would have imagined that this day would never come about. All of us would have to be honest and concede that there was an enormous range of opinion, varying from those who were dedicated with unremitting zeal to having a new Parliament House to those who were utterly committed to the preservation in some form or another of the old building. It has to be said that whatever the merits of that argument, what has been produced and what we are now in is a remarkable Australian achievement. It is a remarkable compliment to the architects; it is a remarkable compliment to the Parliament House Construction Authority; and it is a remarkable compliment to the men and women who worked on this site. On behalf of all members of the Liberal Party of Australia, I express our thanks to all those people. I also, on behalf of the Liberal Party, express the hope that the aspirations and confidence of the people of Australia about the quality of government and opposition in this building will, over the years ahead, be fulfilled and that in time this building will generate and transmit the feeling of affection and nostalgia that three generations of Australian politicians developed for the building down below us. On behalf of the Liberal Party and the Opposition, I warmly endorse the Prime Minister's remarks and thanks to those associated with the building.",14
7,Mr SINCLAIR,OF THANKS,"I would like to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). Winston Churchill, commenting on the checks and balances of the Westminster parliamentary system, said: It is not parliament that should rule; it is the people who should rule through parliament.",14
8,Mr SCOTT,OF THANKS,Turn back the clock!,14
9,Mr SINCLAIR,OF THANKS,"A few of the honourable members on that side of the House should remember that occasionally, from the sound of it. The important aspects of this building have been its concept, its funding and the people who built it. I think we have a few Australian taxpayers out there who should share the sense of pride in the achievement of this building. It is truly a tremendous complex, and we all need to thank them for providing the funds from which it was built. Secondly, we thank all those who through your office, Madam Speaker, and that of the President, have been instrumental in making sure the decisions of the various authorities have been put in place. To the Clerks and Deputy Clerks and to Don Piper, who is the Director of the New Parliament House Secretariat, I give particular thanks and congratulations. Certainly, they have been instrumental in trying to translate the wishes of a disparate group of senators and mentarians into reality in this place. The architects have certainly had an enormous challenge. We all have views about some of the things that we like and other things that we do not like about this place, but individually they have come up with one row at 2 p.m. of the largest buildings-in area at least-in the Southern Hemisphere. It is a tremendous concept and it has been described as one which will serve this nation and its people well, subject to the performance of those of us within it. They have provided the framework and it is now for us to carry out our duties in the same exemplary manner that they have displayed. We then move to the constructor: the Concrete Holland Joint Venture, David Chandler as the construction director, and the lO,OOO-strong work forcethe subcontractors and the workers themselves. Rod Driver, Peter Berry and all of the members of the Building Workers Industrial Union have made an enormous difference to this place. It has been built on time, opened as scheduled and, in our bicentennial year, is a tremendous accomplishment. All of us pay them due tribute. The Parliament House Construction Authority, the original board- Sir Bernard Callinan, Sir John Overall, Bob Ling, Tony Powell and Neil Macphillamy-the second board under Alex Morokoff, and the members and executives who served with them have contributed enormously to translate the concept into reality. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have spoken briefly of the artists and the craftsmen: Michael Tjakamarra Nelson, Arthur Boyd, David Upfill-Brown, Bernie Koker, Gordon Andrews, Rob and Rhyl Hinwood, Peter Travis and Paul Harvey. I could go on. All, be within their responsibilities, have made place a reality. While I think each of us see some parts of it that perhaps we might have liked to do differently, they have produced magnificent Parliament House. We pay them years due tribute and only wish that who live and work within this place can maintain the same high standards of excelparlialency as we perform our duties. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until tomorHouse adjourned at 4.22 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Hawke to move That this House(1) acknowledges that: (a) Australia was occupied by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who had settled for thousands of years before British settlement at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788; (b) Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders suffered dispossession and dispersal upon acquisition of their traditional lands by the British Crown; and (c) Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders were denied full citizenship rights of the Commonwealth of Australia prior to the 1967 Referendum; (2) affirms: (a) the importance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and heritage; and (b) the entitlement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to self-management and self-determination subject to the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia; and (3) considers it desirable that the Commonwealth further promote reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens providing recognition of their special place in the Commonwealth of Australia. Mr Beazley to move That so much of the standing and sessional orders suspended as would prevent notice No.2, govern this ment business, being called on forthwith. Mr Cobb to move That the first referendum question regarding a 4-year parliamentary terms does not guarantee 4 between elections and will weaken the indethose of us pendence of the Senate. The following answers to questions were circulated: Capital Gains Tax (Question No. 12) Mr Reith asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 September 1987: (I) Has the Australian Taxation Office analysed capital gains tax revenue for 1986-87 to ascertain the main categories of transactions which generate a liability for capital gains tax; if so, what sum of revenue is attributed to transactions involving the principal residence of taxpayers. (2) What percentage of the estimated capital gains tax revenue in 1987-88 is expected to accrue from transactions involving the taxpayer's principal residence. (3) Will the Government conduct an information campaign to ensure that taxpayers become aware of the circumstances in which the principal residence is subject to the capital gains tax.",14
10,Mr KEATING,NOTICES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) The available income tax statistics for the 1986-87 income year indicate that 85 per cent of capital gains tax revenue is attributable to share transactions, 3 per cent to real estate transactions and 12 per cent in respect of all other gains. A gain on the disposal of a family home by a person is not subject to capital gains tax, provided that during the entire period of ownership it was used only as the person's sole or principal residence. If during the period of ownership the family home has been used in some other way (for example, as business premises or rented out), capital gains tax may be payable where a gain has been made on its disposal, but only to the extent that the home has been used for those other purposes. Statistics of transactions involving dwellings which were not used as the sole or principal residence during the entire period of ownership are not available. (3) The Taxation Office has issued two informative booklets which provide information about the capital gains tax and the principal residence exemption: Income tax and Capital gains, which explains the operation of the capital gains tax generally, and Income tax and Capital gains and your home, which deals specifical\y with the principal residence exemption.

Ingestion of Radioactive Meat by Sami People of Sweden (Question No. 75) Mr Milton asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 18 September 1987: (I) Has his attention been drawn to a report contained in Wise News Communique number 277, dated 24 July 1987, which alleges that Swedish scientists from the University of Umea, in collaboration with the Swedish military, are studying the health effect of radioactive caesium ingestion in the Sami population after eating contaminated meat. (2) Is he able to say whether the Sami population has not been cautioned against eating contaminated reindeer meat; if so, will he register a protest with the Swedish Government at an experiment involving the deliberate increase in radiation levels in human subjects. (3) If the population has not been cautioned and he will not register a protest, why not.",17
13,Mr HAYDEN,MEETINGS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I am advised that the Swedish National tute of Radiation has actively pursued the issue of the effects on the Swedish population as a whole of Chernobyl fallout. Increased doses of radiation for all Swedes have resulted from external radiation as well as internal radiation arising from the intake of food contaminated with Caesium-134 and Caesium137 from the Chernobyl fallout. Food stuffs such as reindeer meat and lake fish can give a relatively radiation dose to a person with a high consumption of these products. In order to map the doses from internal radiation, whole body measurements have been performed on a random selection of individuals as well as on individuals belonging to affected groups including the Sami people. The whole body measurements are performed in Stockholm (National Institute of Radiation Protection), in Gothenburg (Department of Radiophysics) and in Umea (Department of Radiophysics at the University in collaboration with the Research Institute of National Defence). These measurements are supported by grants from the National Institute of Radiation Protection. (2) There is no deliberate exposure of humans to increased radiation levels. The National Food Administration, moreover, has issued special cautionary diet recommendations for people with a high consumption of own-produced food stuffs such as reindeer meat and lake fish, which include a large proportion of the Sami population. (3) As cautionary advice has been issued by the Swedish authorities, it would not be appropriate to lodge a protest. Christmas Island (Question No. 84) Mr Braithwaite asked the Minister for the Arts and Territories, upon notice, on 17 September 1987: (I) Since II September 1985, when the Prime Minister announced that selective redundancies would apply to assist with the orderly closure of Christmas Island's phosphate operations, how many employees have applied for redundancy under the voluntary selective schemes of 1986 and 1987. (2) How many of these applicants were (a) selected and paid out and (b) denied selection. (3) How many of the employees selected in August 1986 were (a) members of the Union of Christmas Island Workers (b) not members of that union (c) of Asian extraction and (d) not of Asian extraction. (4) Did the termination payments made in August 1986 to those selected as redundant include the mainland parity rates announced by the Prime Minister. (5) Did the termination payments to applicants for the voluntary selective schemes of 1986 and 1987 include payments in lieu of notice in addition to the award conditions at mainland parity rates.  Insti- member's question is as follows: (I) 1986-132; 1987-122; Total 254. (2) (a) All; (b) Nil. (3) The Phosphate Mining Corporation of Christmas Island does not keep records of employees' union membership or ethnic background, but to the best of the Corporation's knowledge the answers are: high (a) all; (b) nil; (c) all; (d) nil. (4) No. Initial termination payments were at award rates only. These payments were subsequently augmented by a resettlement benefit which included a mainland parity adjustment. (5) Yes.

Radioactive Waste and Rare Earth Plants (Question No. 546) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, upon notice, on 9 December 1987: (1) Ha, reseurch been conducted in Australia into the storage of radioactive waste; if so, (a) by whom, (b) what type l)f radioactive waste was considered for storage and (c) what was the radioactive level of the waste. (2) Has any research or work been undertaken into the construction of a rare earth plant; if so, what research or work has been undertaken. Mr Barry Jones--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (a) The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and its predecessor, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC), have conducted research and development programs into radioactive waste management for some years in areas such as: Development of the Synroc concept in conjunction with the Australian National University and Griffith University. The Synroc program is a significant contribution to international efforts to velop an improved solution to the storage and disposal of high level radioactive waste. Construction of a Synroc demonstration plant was completed during 1987. The facility will be fully commissioned in 1988, with the aim of demonstrating the feasibility of fabricating, on a commercollaboration cial scale, Synroc containing simulated (non-active) radioactive waste. This research is being pursued in collaboration with establishments in the United Kingdom, Japan and Italy Analogue studies of radionuclide migration to improve understanding of the possible behaviour of radioactive waste disposed of underground. These studies will involve examining the geological and hydrogeological processes acting on uranium ore bodies in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory which may resemble those processes acting upon a high level radioactive waste disposal facility. The project will be carried out under the auspices of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency. The three-year program will involve participants from Japan, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Uranium environmental studies concerned with the formation, detection and characterisation of pollutants and their geochemical fate and toxicity. These studies focus on low level waste materials and cover research on topics such as uranium mining and milling practices, leaching characteristics of Australian ores, alternative treatment processes, neutralisation of mill effluents, reduction radon release from tailings dumps, determination of pollutant sources from open-cut mining, transport of contaminants by ground and surface waters, soil-SOlute interactions, toxicity of heavy metals and the uptake of pollutants by flora and fauna. The o-ly other research on the storage of radioactive waste In Australia is the work being undertaken by CSIRO on t-e thermosyphon loop concept for high level waste disposal. This is a way of cooling down the waste (in whatever form it may be, including Synroc) by circulating water over it using a thermosyphon-the system of water circulation that naturally occurs in solar water heaters. This creates a local hydraulic short circuit which confines the groundwater in the near vicinity of the waste, so preventing the waste from being transported away from the site and back towards the surface. (b) The main type of waste which is being considered for immobilisation in Synroc is the high level liquid waste resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear power reactor fuel. A typical 1000 MWe nuclear power station produces about 30 tonnes of spent fuel per year After useful nuclear material is recovered for future recycling as reactor fuel, about I tonne of high level liquid waste remains, which contains almost all of the radioactivity originally in the spent fuel. Mill wastes from uranium mining operations contain low levels of radioactivity from radium and other daughter products of uranium and radon. Most of dethe radioactivity present in the original orebody remains in the mill tailings. (c) Research conducted in Australia into high level waste storage and disposal has involved simulated (non-active) radioactive materials. ANSTO's with other countries is expected to extend the research in the future to the use of active materials. (2) ANSTO recently initiated research into certain aspects of rare earth processing following an increase in interest by a number of companies in establishing a rare earth processing plant. Several companies (including Allied Eneabba PL, Rhone Poulanc and Currumbin Minerals PL) have undertaken feasibility studies and prepared Environmental Impact Statements in support of development applications for rare earth processing plants. The main areas of ANSTO's research are: Treatment and management of radioactive wastes generated in the rare earth extraction process. Investigation into the behaviour and fate of radioactive materials in various stages of the rare earth extraction process. Research into the solvent extraction process. Environment aspects of rare earth processing plants. of The results of research in these areas would have a bearing on the design and construction of rare earth processing plants. The proceedings of a conference entitled ""Rare Earth Horizons 1987"", which was jointly organised by the CSIRO Division of Applied Physics and the then Department of Science, were published in September 1987 by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. A copy of this publication is held by the Parliamentary Library. Dismissals from Commonwealth (Question No. 551) Mr Rocher asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, upon notice, on 9 December 1987: How many public servants have been dismissed since I January 1985 and what were the reasons for each dismissal.",44
18,Mr WILLIS,UN FAO UNESCO ILO IPU,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Public Service Commission has advised that, since I January 1985 14 officers and employees have been dismissed from the Australian Public Service. Of this number the former Public Service Board dismissed six officers and two employees from the Australian Public Service. Of the six officers dismissed: one was dismissed following convictions for fraud against the Commonwealth; one was dismissed for personation at an APS entrance exam; three were dismissed for engaging in improper conduct as officers; and one was dismissed for inefficiency within the officer's own control. Both employees were dismissed for assaulting their respective supervisors. On I January 1986 the power to dismiss staff on disciplinary grounds was devolved to departments and authorities. This coincided with the Merit Protection and Review Agency assuming responsibility for the operation of the discipline appeal process. Following devolution, each department and government agency has been responsible for maintaining records of its own discipline cases. Under these arrangements details of individual dismissal cases are not provided to the Public Service Commission. The Commission has advised that, since I January 1986, Departmental Secretaries have notified in the Gazette the dismissal of six officers from their respective departments. The information provided in the Gazette indicates that three of the officers were dismissed following criminal convictions and the other three were dismissed for misconduct. Soviet Naval Presence in Indian Ocean (Question No. 557) Mr Rocher asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 9 December 1987: (I) Is he able to say how many warships of the Soviet Union were sighted in the Indian Ocean in (a) 1983, (b) 1984, (c) 1985, (d) 1986 and (e) 1987 to 30 November. (2) Is he able to say what is the estimated number Employment of ship days spent in the Indian Ocean by each warship.",46
19,Mr BEAZLEY,UN FAO UNESCO ILO IPU,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) For the reasons outlined in the answer to Question No. 514 (Hansard, 16 February 1988, page 75), it would not be in Australia's security interest to provide the information sought. (2) I can, however, confirm that the USSR has maintained a continuous, but fluctuating, presence in the Indian Ocean since 1968. The Soviet presence has generally declined since 1984, consistent with the general downward trend in Soviet deployments outside home waters world wide, over the past few years. This is shown in the number of ship days spent by Soviet naval vessels in the Indian Ocean in recent years. The figures provided to you in previous responses and recorded in Hansard (rounded to the nearest hundred days) are: 1983-8600, 1984-9000, 1985-7100,1986-5\00. The figure for 1987 (to 30 November) is 5100. Strategic and Defence Studies Centre (Question No. 558) Mr Rocher asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 9 December 1987: (1) Does his Department fund 2 Research Fellowships and 2 Visiting Fellowships at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre of the Australian National University. (2) Who holds fellowships at 9 December 1987. (3) What are the names of the holders of these positions for each year they have been in existence. (4) What sum has been spent on funding these positions for each year since they have been in existence and what has been the total sum spent on funding these positions. (5) What are the terms and conditions of appointment for prospective Fellows. (6) Are (a) Australian Defence Force (ADF) service personnel or (b) civilian officials of his Department permitted to apply for the Fellowships; if so, (i) have any done so, (ii) have any been appointed as Visiting or Research Fellows and (iii) what are the names and dates of appointment of any ADF or civilian departmental personnel who have become Research or Visiting Fellows. (7) Do holders of Visiting or Research Fellowships complete any research or consultancy projects, or other work relevant to their area of expertise, for his Department during their tenure: if so, what are the relevant details for each holder of a Research of Visiting Fellowship awarded since the establishment of the positions.",46
20,Mr BEAZLEY,UN FAO UNESCO ILO IPU,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The holders of the research fellowships as at 9 December 1987 were Dr C. J. Downes and Mr D. W. Hegarty. The two visiting fellowships are awarded annually, normally for three month periods. At 9 December 1987, Dr Carlyle Thayer held one of these (3) Two Defence-funded Research Fellowships were established in 1975. This was reduced to one fellowship between 1978-1986. The second Research Fellowship post was re-established in 1986. Holders of the Research Fellowships have been: 1974-1978 Dr. J. Ball  1978-1980 Dr P. A. Towle 1980-1983 Dr P. Keal 1983-1986 Mr G. E. Fry 1986- Mr D. W. Hegarty The visiting Fellowships were established in 1985. Holders of these Fellowships have been: 1986 Dr M. MCKinley 1986 Dr G. Lockhart 1987 Dr C. Thayer (4) The following sums have been spent on funding these positions for each year since they have been in existence: Financial Year 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83 1983-84 1984-85 1985-86 1986-87 1987-88 Total (5) Department of Defence Research Fellowships at the SDSC are non-tenured positions for a period of not !'lore than three years unless the Department otherwlSC agrees. Department of Defence Research Fellows are employed by the University under the usual conditions of service .appl.icabl- to research fellows employed by the Umverslty wltho-t tenure. One appointment is in the field of Austrahan Defence and the second in Regional Security. The Visiting Fellowships are awarded to people capable of carrying out advanced research on strategic and defence issues of relevance to Australia. These Fellowships have a value of $5,000 which can be used to cover removal expenses to Canberra, salary supplementations, fieldwork or other costs associated with the research. (6) (a) Yes; (b) Yes; (i) Yes; (ii) and (iii) No, but several members of the Australian Defence Force and civilian defence officials have been appointed to fellowships. other research posts at the SDSC. (7) Research Fellows and Visiting Fellows normally complete at least one major research project and frequently many medium and small-scale projects. These are usually published as books, monographs or as articles in journals. The Department of Defence does not maintain a register of the very large number (more than one hundred) of research projects completed by Research and Visiting Fellows during their tenure. Taxation: Primary Producers (Question No. 603) Dr C. J. Downes Mr Hunt asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 February 1988: (I) What tax deductibility arrangements apply to the clearing of land for the purpose of primary production? (2) What would be the estimated cost of introducing full deductibility in the year of expenditure for such activity? (3) What direct and indirect benefits would accrue Sum as a result of the increased activity flowing from $25,000.00 deductibility in the year of expenditure, and is he $6,000.00 able to estimate the benefits in dollar terms? $41,068.00 $25,483.01",46
21,Mr KEATING,UN FAO UNESCO ILO IPU,"The answer to the honour$13,469.71 able member's question is as follows: $31,048.00 (I) Where a person carrying on a business of $34,215.69 primary production on land in Australia incurred $15,632.97 capital expenditure on or before 23 August 1983 on $21,784.00 certain land improvements, including land clearing, $29,587.67 the expenditure is deductible in equal instalments $42,728.87 over ten years under section 75A of the Income Tax $24,278.79 Assessment Act, commencing with the year the ex$15,026.14 penditure was incurred. The annual deduction re$83,864.00 mains available as long as the person who incurred $122,260.52 the expenditure uses the land in a business of pri$546,620.48 mary production or derives rent from the land while it is used in a business of that kind by a tenant. Capital expenditures incurred after 23 August 1983 on such activities are ineligible for deduction under s75A. Recurrent land clearing expenditures may be deductible in the year incurred under s51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act (the general deduction provision of the law). (2) There is insufficient information available to accurately estimate the cost of introducing full deductibility in the year of expenditure for land clearing expenditure. (3) The benefits and costs arising from immediate deductibility in the year of expenditure of land clearing activities from changed tax treatment would be very difficult to assess. This is because the value of such a concession is dependent on the tax position of the individual primary producer-a primary producer in a loss position, for example, would not be able to take advantage of immediate tax deductibility. It is also the case that any kind of business activity, including land clearing, is dependent on the future financial returns from that activity, which are only partially determined by the tax treatment applicable to it. It is not practicable for me to determine the impact of granting immediate deductibility on the total financial returns from this activity. Benefits from increased land clearing will initially be dependent on the value of resultant increase in agricultural output. However, to the extent that land clearing activity would have been undertaken anyway, concessional taxation treatment would involve a net cost. Environmental considerations might also need to be taken into account when considering the net benefits of taxation concessions for land clearing. The section 75A provisions were abolished in order to discourage indiscriminate land clearing, as well as for revenue reasons. Suspected War Criminals: Investigation (Question No. 606) Mr Reith asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 17 February 1988: What have been the total costs up until the most recent date for which figures are available, for the (a) review of material relating to the entry of suspected war criminals into Australia and (b) Special Investigation Unit.",47

27,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,STUDENTS PRESENTING ASIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have assumed that the honourable member's question refers to the number of formal requisitions made by Australia for the return of fugitives from other countries. On the basis of this assumption the answers are as follows: (a) 1982No. of Requisitions 4 Hong Kong 2 United States of America 2 1983- No. of Requisitions 6 United States of America I Malaysia I Hong Kong 2 Switzerland I Sri Lanka I 1984- No. of Requisitions 7 United States of America 4 Switzerland I Ireland I United Kingdom I 1985- No. of Requisitions 7 United States of America 2 Extraditions France I Federal Republic of Germany I United Kingdom 3 1986- No. of Requisitions 8 United States of America I France I United Kingdom 3 Austria Hong Kong 1987- No. of Requisitions United States of America United Kingdom Luxembourg Sri Lanka During the relevant period 7 persons whose surrender was sought by Australia waived extradition proceedings and were returned to Australia.

(7) What are the commencement and expiry dates of the current contract.",54
28,Mr WILLIS,STUDENTS PRESENTING ASIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The answer sheets were not printed in Australia. They form part of a computer marking system for selection tests which uses an Optical Mark Reader. The only firm able to supply answer sheets meeting the specifications for this system was National Computer Systems (NCS) which at the time was represented locally by Techway Ltd. The answer sheets were printed by NCS in the United States of America. (2) Approximately 60,000 answer sheets are used by the Australian Public Service each year. (3) The charge for the printing of 100,000 answer sheets purchased in 1986 was $13,516.93. (4) No. Techway Ltd as local agent for NCS was the only company able to meet specifications for the answer sheets. I (5), (6) and (7) Techway Ltd as local agent for 2 NCS, was asked to supply the stationery as required. 4 In December 1987 Techway Ltd advised that Barradene Press in Melbourne had replaced Techway as the agent for NCS, and as the local supplier of answer sheets. There is no period contract, answer sheets being purchased as and when required.

Examinations (2) Is he able to say on what occasions and with what results has the South Pacific Forum considered ratification of the Convention.",55
29,Mr HAYDEN,STUDENTS PRESENTING ASIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following members of the South Pacific Forum have signed the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea; Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Of these countries only Fiji has become a party to the Convention. (2) The South Pacific Forum has not considered ratification of the Convention on its own behalf. However, in 1982 the Forum expressed satisfaction at the adoption of the Law of the Sea Convention and urged members to sign the treaty at the signing conference; and in 1987 reaffirmed the importance of the Law of the Sea Convention and its significance to the countries of the South Pacific, and urged all countries to sign the Convention and to pursue its ratification.

30,Mr HAYDEN,STUDENTS PRESENTING ASIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) Australia is the only member of the South Pacific Forum which has become a Party to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. (b) No member of the South Pacific Forum is a Party to the Protocol of the Convention. (2) No meeting of the South Pacific Forum has considered the question of ratification of the Convention and Protocol. International Financial Institutions (Question No. 641) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 22 February 1988: (I) Is he able to say whether any international financial institutions receive their contributions in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) rather than national currencies; if so, which institutions do so. (2) Is he able to say whether there have been discussions within international financial institutions about introducing the practice of making payments in SDRs; if so, what are the advantages and disadvantages of this system.",55
31,Mr KEATING,STUDENTS PRESENTING ASIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The SDR is an international reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and allocated to its members as a supplement to existing reserve assets. Members of the IMF are required to pay amounts not exceeding 25 per cent of their contributions (ie, of their quota) in reserve assets specified by the Fund (SDRs or usable currencies), with the balance of quotas to be paid in members' own currencies. All member countries of the IMF are participants in the SDR Department and are eligible to receive SDR allocations. They may use SDRs in transactions and operations among themselves, with the IMF itself and with official entities prescribed by the Fund. The category of prescribed holders currently comprises four central banks, three intergovernmental monetary institutions, and nine development institutions as follows: the African Development Bank, Abidjan; the African Development Fund, Abidjan; the Andean Reserve Fund, Bogota; the Arab Monetary Fund, Abu Dhabi; the Asian Development Bank, Manila; the Bank of Central African States, Yaounde; the Bank for International Settlements, Basle; the Central Bank for West African States, Dakar; the East African Development Bank, Kampala; the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, Basseterre, St. Kitts and Nevis; the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Washington, DC; the International Development Association, Washington, DC; the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Rome; the Islamic Development Bank, Jeddah; the Nordic Investment Bank, Helsinki; and the Swiss National Bank, Zurich. Prescribed holders can acquire and use SDRs in transactions and operations with other prescribed holders and with any of the IMF's 151 member countries. Prescribed holders have the same degree of freedom as IMF members to buy and sell SDRs, both spot and forward; to borrow, lend, or pledge SDRs; to use SDRs in swaps and in settlement of financial obligations; or to make donations (grants) with SDRs. It follows that, as far as the IMF requirements are concerned, the institutions listed above are free to receive contributions in SDRs rather than national currencies, if they so wished. Besides the IMF, my Department is aware of the Arab Monetary Fund and the East African Development Bank having accepted SDRs for payment of capital subscriptions from some of their member countries. Furthermore, my Department understands that the IMF is not aware that other prescribed holders would object if their member countries wished to make their contributions in SDRs. (2) Since the first allocation in 1970, SDRs have been used in a wide variety of transactions and operations. I am informed that the African Development Bank and the African Development Fund have been considering the use of SDRs in their operations, and have expressed interest in receiving contributions in SDRs. For institutions using the SDR as their unit of account, the use of SDRs for donations, capital subscriptions and loans has the advantage of avoiding exchange rate exposure. The adoption of the SDR as the unit of account, and in particular as the denomination of capital subscriptions, may provide more stable values than obtained from the use of individual national currencies. SDRs earn a market rate of interest and as such could form part of the prescribed holders' short-term investment portfolios. For these purposes, a prescribed holder may need to acquire SDRs with currency or may need to sell SDRs already held to obtain currency. These purchases or sales may be made by entering into transactions by agreement with another holder of SDRs. The IMF can arrange those transactions on request. United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Question No. 642) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 22 February 1988: Is he able to say whether there are any Western or developing countries which are members of the UN which are not also members of the UN Conference on Trade and Development; if so, which are they.",56

The attitude of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia who are also members of the Forum towards succession to treaties since the Compact of Free Association of those countries with the United States came into effect in [986 is still under consideration. So far as the ICAO conventions and amending protocols are concerned it is expected, in accordance with past practice, that it will be necessary for the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia to accede as new parties.

(2) What part IS Australia taking in these negotiations. (3) What factors might contribute to the completion of a convention during 1988.",60
37,Mr HAYDEN,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Significant progress was recorded during the 1987 session in the negotiation of a Chemical Weapons Convention. The 'rolling text' of the draft convention, which was produced at the end of the session, constitutes a highly developed document. Main developments during 1987 were: agreement that past transfers of chemical weapons should be declared the further elaboration of provision for verification arrangements including the monitoring of existing chemical weapons stockpiles after entry into force of the Convention, and provisions for the destruction of those stockpiles, and for the declaration, closure and elimination of chemical weapons production facilities intensive consideration of how toxic chemicals produced commercially should be dealt with under a convention comprehensive preparatory work on the powers, functions and inter-relationship of the various gans of the International Organisation to implement the Convention. (2) Australia plays a very active role in the negotiations, through its membership of the Conference on Disarmament, the body in which the Convention is being negotiated. The Australian delegation to the Conference is supported by experts from the Department of Defence's Materials Research Laboratories. The delegation participates in the work of various working groups of the Chemical Weapons Committee of the Conference and has contributed a number of working papers. Australia has given particular attention to facilitating the development of regime to verify that chemical weapons are not produced in the civilian chemical industry. Australia has also been active outside the Conference in seeking to resist the spread of chemical weapons while the Convention is being negotiated. This activity has included the successful negotiation and arrangement of a resolution at the 1987 United Nations General Assembly to secure consensus to authorise the Secretary-General of the United Nations to undertake investigations of experts of the use of chemical weapons. Australia has also contributed expert manpower and other resources to such investigations. In addition Australia has undertaken consultations bilaterally with some fifty countries on the question of export controls on chemicals capable of being used for the manufacture of CWo The number of countries applying such controls has expanded and some twenty of them have met at approximately half-yearly intervals for policy consultations organised and hosted by Australia. (3) The major conceptual items of the Convention appear to have been resolved but a vast body of technical detail remains to be settled. This will require a sustained effort by all forty countries participating in the Conference on Disarmament negotiations and is not likely to be completed in 1988. (Question No. 654) Mr Spender asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 23 February 1988: (1) Did he make a request of the Mozambique Government, during his recent visit to that country that Mr I. Grey, an Australian citizen held without trial in Mozambique, should be allowed to leave Mozambique with him; if so, what reasons were given for refusing this request. (2) What assurances did he receive from the Mozambique Government concerning a fair and speedy trial for Mr Grey. (3) If he did not receive assurances for a fair and speedy trial, what assurances did he receive from the Mozambique Government concerning Mr Grey. (4) Is he able to say whether the President of orMozambique said that he would take a personal interest in the trial of Mr Grey; if so, what did the President say on the issue. (5) Did the Minister say that he had been told that Mozambique's established legal procedures would be followed in relation to the trial of Mr Grey; if so, what are those procedures. (6) What kind of trial does he expect Mr Grey to receive, given the record of the Mozambique the Government on human rights issues, especially in cases concerning alleged opponents of the Mozambique Government. (7) Has his attention been drawn to the nona existence of (a) an independent judiciary, (b) independent lawyers and (c) basic rules of judicial procedure in Mozambique. (8) Is he able to say whether the Mozambique Foreign Minister has now denied that any assurances concerning Mr Grey were given to him. (9) Is he able to say why Mr Grey has not been put on trial.",62
38,Mr HAYDEN,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I did not make any such request. What I made, was an offer that Mr Grey could leave Mozambique on my flight if the Mozambican Government decided to release him rather than bring him to trial. (2) The Mozambican Foreign Minister told me that Mr Grey would have access to legal representation and I understood him to say that Mr Grey's case would be brought before the courts during the week following our discussion. (3) See (2) above. (4) The President of Mozambique told me that he would take a personal interest in Mr Grey's trial. He said he did not have authority to release him and he undertook to have the status of the case clarified quickly. He also gave a guarantee that Mr Grey would receive adequate medical attention. Mr I. Grey (5) I have not made any public release on what I had been told in relation to Mozambique's established legal procedures but the President of Mozambique did tell me that his country had a legal system whose procedures would be followed in relation to Mr Grey's trial, including the right of appeal. In addition to what the President told me we know that Mozambique's legal procedures fall broadly into two categories-trial by a civil court for regular civil and criminal matters and a military-run court relating to security-type cases. The procedures provide for legal representation and this was confirmed to me by the Foreign Minister. (6) I expect Mr Grey to be tried under established Mozambican procedures. The Mozambique Minister of Justice has told our Ambassador-designate that an Australian Government representative will be free to attend the trial. (7) I have indicated that there are established legal procedures in Mozambique. I am aware that those procedures and Mozambique's judicial system differ in many respects from our own. (8) Since our discussions in Maputo the Mozambican Foreign Minister has stated that there was a misunderstanding over what he said to me in Maputo. It was the papers concerning Mr Grey's case and not Mr Grey himself which were to be brought before the courts during the week following our discussion. The Attorney-General has confirmed that he received the papers on 26 February. (9) The Mozambican authorities have stated that Mr Grey will be brought to trial when their investigations are complete. Substantial delays in bringing people to trial occur in judicial systems throughout the world including our own. I am continuing to press the Mozambique Government to bring Mr Grey to trial at the earliest possible date, and our understanding is that our representations in this regard are likely to be successful. We have an Embassy officer in Mozambique to ensure that Mr Grey receives full consular protection. UNESCO Convention on Cultural Property (Question No. 658) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 24 February 1988: (I) Did he say in his answer to Question No. 2672 (Hansard, 29 November 1985, page 4271) that when the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Bill 1985 became Law, Australia would be able to become a party to the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property? (2) Has assent been given to the Bill; if so (a) on what date was assent given, and (b) why has Australia not yet become a party to the Convention?",63
39,Mr HAYDEN,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) Yes. (a) The Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act (No. II of 1986) was assented to on 13 May 1986. (b) Australia will be in a position to ratify the Convention when the remaining regulations identifying objects to be protected under the Act are promulgated. An interdepartmental Committee has been meeting to examine the outstanding draft regulations and I expect to receive a report on its deliberations within the next two weeks. I am hopeful that the matter can then be resolved quickly. Attorney-General's Department: Expenditure (Question No. 661) Mr Blunt asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 24 February 1988: (I) What was the total budgeted expenditure in 1987-88 by the Minister's Department and instrumentalities and organisations responsible to the Minister for (a) advertising, (b) public relations and (c) opinion research. (2) What has been the actual expenditure to date in 1987-88 on each area referred to in part (I). (3) Is it estimated that expenditure on these areas in 1987-88 will be under or over budget; if so, by what sum will it be under or over budget and what is the reason for the discrepancy. (4) What has been the expenditure by the Minister's Department and instrumentalities and organisations responsible to the Minister on (a) job advertising and (b) other advertising. (5) What major advertising projects, campaigns or information campaigns have been undertaken, are being undertaken or are being planned, and in each case, (a) what was the cost of each project, (b) who undertook the project, (c) how were they selected, (d) were public tenders called and (e) which firms were invited to tender.",64
40,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The total budgeted expenditure (excluding salaries) for 1987-88 by the Attorney-General's Department and instrumentalities and organisations in the portfolio is: (a) for advertising: $541,800 (b) for public relations: $186,904 (c) for opinion research: $25,850 The Constitutional Commission has budgeted as follows$250,000 for promotion and advertising; and $290 for consultants This budget was not subdivided into the categories listed in the question. (2) Actual expenditure (excluding salaries) from I July 1987 to 31 December 1987 has been: (a) for advertising: $474,799 (b) for public relations: $180,135 (c) for opinion research: $29,729. (3) Expenditure is expected to be in accordance with budget, with the following exceptions: The advertising budget for the High Court of Australia is estimated to be $8,000 over budget due to the unexpected retirement of the Clerk of the High Court in March 1988 and the necessity to advertise the vacancy in all major metropolitan Australian newspapers. The Trade Practices Commission's advertising expenditure is expected to be $6000 under budget because advertising costs associated with filling the position of Chairman have been paid by the Attorney-General's Department. The advertising expenditure for the Law Reform Commission of Australia is expected to be $12,000 under budget due to a lower than anticipated level of recruitment. The NCSC is expected to be approximately $5000 over budget because high staff turnover has required greater advertising than anticipated. The Bankruptcy Division is approximately $30,000 over budget estimates due to the increasing number of bankrupts and increased advertising charges. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is $60,000 (approx) under budget estimates. This is the first full year of operation for the Commission and some programs have not been fully established. Expenditure for the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs for advertising is expected to be under budget by $15,200. The Information Co-ordination Branch in the Department of Administrative Services advised against using the funds for buying advertising time on radio nationally and a more restrictive program was devised. (4) (a) Expenditure attributed to the portfolio by the Information Co-ordination Branch of Department of Administrative Services from I July 1987 to 31 December 1987 was: $385,013. Actual expenditure incurred in this period was $408,550. (b) $66,249.14 (attributed to the portfolio for campaign advertising by the Information Co-ordination Branch of Department of Administrative Services). (5) ASIO Recruitment Campaign. (a) $37,770.93. (b) (i) Charlton & Charlton. (c & d) The standard procedure for appointment of creative agencies is that a number of agencies are invited to submit competitive proposals for a campaign and are assessed on the basis of their submissions. On some occasions an agency may be directly appointed to an assignment on its known performance where (i) the deadline to produce a short term campaign does not allow sufficient time to call for com-ti-ive submissions (ii) the proposed advertising budget IS very small or (iii) where the required expertise is possessed by a particular agency. (e) Nil. Australian Federal Police Recruitment. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) participates in a number of information/public relations campaigns, for instance Police 7, Junior Police 7, both of which are relayed by the local Canberra TV Station, road safety campaigns at Christmas and Easter, and Police Week. In respect to these campaigns no advertising agency was used, as the campaigns are run in conjunction with the local Canberra media and/or the shopping centres who cover the majority of cost involved. The main cost of the campaigns to the AFP relates to salary costs of members partaking in them. (a) $28,478.21. (b) Creative Oasis. (c & d) The standard procedure for appointment of creative agencies is that a number of agencies are invited to submit competitive proposals for a campaign and are assessed on the basis of their submissions. On some occasions an agency may be directly appointed to an assignment on its known performance where (i) the deadline to produce a short term campaign does not allow sufficient time to call for competitive submissions (ii) the proposed advertising budget is very small or (iii) where the required expertise is possessed by a particular agency. (e) Schofield Sherbon Baker. Clifton Court Smith. IHJ. The Constitutional Commission's terms of reference require it to inquire into and report on or before 30 June 1988, on the revision of the Australian Constitution. Thus the Commission has held or sponsored public hearings and meetings, circulated draft proposals and put forward initiatives and views, made interim reports and evaluated the reports and recommendations of various advisory committees. (a) The total salary and administrative costs of the Constitutional Commission from I July to 30 December 1987 is $920,600. It is not readily broken down into the categories envisaged by the question. (b) Hill and Knowlton Australia Pty Ltd, Ms D. Officer-Brewster, Ms M. White. (c & d) In relation to the Constitutional Commission: Hill and Knowlton were selected in accordance with Finance Direction 25/29. Nine firms were invited to submit proposals for undertaking public relations work for the Commission. Eight of those responded. Of those eight, five were invited to elaborate further on their submissions. The Public Relations Sub-Committee, consisting of Sir Rupert Hamer and Messrs Purcell, Garrett and Cunliffe assessed Hill and Knowlton as the best firm for the job. Ms M. White was engaged by the Commission to prepare discussion leaders' notes on the booklet 'Australia's Constitution-Time to Update' summarising the five Advisory Committee Reports. Ms White is an expert specialist writer and in accordance with Finance Regulation 52AA (2) her engagement was exempt from the normal tendering procedures. Ms D.

(2) What were the major items in the advertising budget. (3) What were the major public relations initiatives. Relations (4) What subjects were covered by the opinion research.",68
43,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) The total expenditure on advertising (excluding salaries) in 1986-87 by the Attorney General's Department and instrumentalities and organisations responsible to the Attorney General, including those parts of the portfolio which were previously responsible to the Special Minister of State, was $825,417.

(2) The major component of the advertising budget was for recruitment. The Constitutional Commission's advertising budget was about equally shared between advertising the Commission's terms of reference and calling for submissions, and promoting the public hearings of the Commission's Advisory Committees. The Law Reform Commission's advertising expenditure, apart from recruitment, was spent on the notification of public hearings for its references on spent convictions and contempt. (3) The Constitutional Commission launched Issues and Background Papers of the Commission's five Advisory Committees to increase public awareness of its work and stimulate discussion on constitutional reform. The Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs launched a video on consumer rights, responsibilities and problems relevant to youth. The Family Court's major public relations initiatives for 1986-87 were: (a) participation in, and facilitation of, a feature film on a custody dispute; (b) participation in Law Week; and, (c) the promotion of community awareness of Family Court procedures through the metropolitan, regional and suburban media. The major AFP public relations initiative was Police Week which was held from 10 to 16 May Expenditure 1987. This involved displays and stands at a Canberra Shopping Centre informing the local public about their community police force, its functions and its easy accessibility. As part of Police Week each of the police stations in the ACT and some police complexes were open to the public for one day each on alternate days. This was to further emphasise the easy accessibility of the AFP to the public. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission advertised two Public Inquiries. The Trade Practices Commission, the High Court of Australia and the Legal Aid Commission (ACT) prepared and di,trihuted information brochures, bulletins and cIrcular;.. (4) A survey on Public Atlitudes to the Police was undertaken for the Australian Institute of Criminology.

47,Mr HAYDEN,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There have been no developments since my reply on 28 October 1987, to question number 113 by the honourable member on the same subject. UNESCO: International Program for the Development of Communication (Question No. 752) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Upon notice, on 25 February 1988: (1) Is he able to say whether the Executive Board of UNESCO appealed to member states in October 1986 to strengthen, by means of voluntary contributions, the financial resources of the Special Account of the International Program for the Development of Communication (IPDC). (2) Was Australia among the 143 states which voted in the UN General Assembly on 3 December 1986 in favour of a resolution again calling upon member states to respond to the appeals of the Director-General of UNESCO to contribute to the IPDC by making financial resources available, as well as staff, equipment, technologies and training resources. (3) Was Australia among the II states which abstained in the vote in the United Nations General Assembly on 8 December 1987 on a resolution again calling upon member states to respond to the appeals of the Director-General of UNESCO to contribute to the IPDC by making financial resources available, as well as staff, equipment, technologies and training resources. (4) Is he able to say which states have made resources available to the IPDC. (5) Has the Government given consideration to making resources available to the IPDC since he answered my question No. 3786 (Hansard, 7 May 1986, page 3329).",71
48,Mr HAYDEN,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I), (2), (4) and (5), I refer the honourable member to my reply to his question No. III of 22 September 1987. This reply appeared in Hansard on 18 February 1988. (3) Yes. Australia abstained on this resolution in Sport because of its reference in the second preambular paragraph to the ""Harare Appeal to the Mass Media"" which among other things equated zionism with racism. The resolution covered a wide range of issues in the area of information and did not focus exclusively on IPDC. Defence Science and Technology Organisation (Question No. 763) Mr Smith asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on IS March 1988: (I) What are the terms of appointment and duties of Mr G. Spurling as special advisor to her. (2) Has she established any companies within her portfolio relating to activities of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation; if so, (a) what are the names, (b) who are the directors and (c) what are the proposed functions, of these companies. (3) If she has not established any companies, are any such companies in the process of being established.",71
49,Mrs KELLY,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Given the very wide ranging commercialisation opportunities presented by the world class research, skills and facilities available within the Defence Science and Technology Organisation I considered that it would be inappropriate for an advisor with the breadth of commercial experience of Mr Graham Spurling to be unnecessarily restricted by detailed terms of reference. While Mr Spurling's primary role is to advise me on the establishment of a commercial cell within DSTO he will be able to provide me with advice, as I need it, to develop the full range of DSTO's commercialisation opportunities. (2) I have yet to establish any companies. However, as I advised the House on 19 May 1988, DSTO will participate in a joint venture company established to commercialise the infra-red technology developed at DSTO Salisbury. The company is to be set up by the Adelaide Innovation Centre. Arrangements for this participation are close to conclusion following discussions on equity and licensing arrangements with the industry involved. (3) To obtain maximum value from DSTO commercial opportunities it is my intention to use the most appropriate commercial mechanism in each case. Licensing agreements, and umbrella agreements with organisations such as SIROTECH and State Innovation Centres have been in place for some time. Although no companies have been formed so far they, along with other arrangements such as joint ventures with established Australian companies, are being pursued as appropriate.

(5) Did the Embassy in Washington receive a telephone call from a Mr Howard on 21 November 1987 notifying the Embassy of Mr Grey's arrest; if so, what action was taken by the Embassy. (6) When did the Australian High Commission in Harare, Zimbabwe, first become aware of Mr Grey's arrest. (7) Did the Embassy in Washington receive a letter on 8 December 1987 from the Mozambique Research Centre concerning Mr Grey's arrest; if so, what action was taken by the Embassy. (8) Did the Embassy in Washington receive a telephone call on II December 1987 concerning Mr Grey; if so, what action was taken by the Embassy. (9) Was it not until 19 December 1987 that an officer of the High Commission in Harare went to Maputo. (10) Did Dr Mocumbi refuse the official permission to see Mr Grey. (II) Was the officer in Maputo principally on aid business. (12) When did the Government, either through the High Commission in Harare or any other channel, first make (a) informal or (b) formal inquiries or representations concerning Mr Grey. (13) What was the nature of each of those inquiries or representations. (14) Was a formal request for information concerning Mr Grey refused by the Mozambique Government on 19 December 1987; if so, what reasons were given for this refusal.

(16) Did the meeting occur in private; if not, who else was present during this meeting. (17) What was the result of the meeting. (18) What was the reason for the delay between Mr Grey's arrest on 3 November 1987 and the visit by the officer from the High Commission in Harare on 14 January 1988. Mr I. Grey (19) Are there any restrictions in place on travel to Mozambique by officers of the High Commission in Harare. (20) Was Mr Grey ever examined by an Australian medical doctor. (21) Was any examination performed in private; if so, when did it occur. (22) What was the (a) opinion and (b) recommendation of any medical doctors who examined Mr Grey. (23) Were those opinions and recommendations made known to the Mozambique authorities; if so, when. (24) Was any action taken by the Mozambique authorities as a result of the opinions or recommendations.",71
50,Mr HAYDEN,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The following charges were madeEspionage Inciting insurrection Mobilisation Association with the enemy Illegal entry. (3) No. The Grey family was told on that day that their son was missing. (4) Yes. The Embassy advised the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Canberra. (5) No. The Embassy in Washington reported a discussion with Mr Howard on 20 November. (6) On II November 1987. (7) Yes. The Embassy reported to Canberra. (8) Yes. The Embassy reported the approach to Canberra. (9) No. An officer from Harare first went to Maputo on 12 January. (10) No. The officer who visited Maputo was given permission on 13 January to see Mr Grey. (II) No. He was principally in Maputo on the Grey case. (12) (a) On 9 November 1987 (b) On 17 November, 19 November 1987 and 27 November 1987. (13) They sought confirmation of the arrest of Mr Grey and requested consular access to him. This is normal consular practice. (14) No. (15) Mr Grey was first seen by an officer from Harare on 14 January 1988. (16) No. Officials of the Mozambique Ministry of Foreign Affairs and prison officials were present. (17) The High Commission official was able to provide a Consular report the results of which were passed on to Mr Grey's family. This included a report on Mr Grey's welfare. This demonstrated to the Mozambique authorities our concern for Mr Grey. (18) The delay between Mr Grey's arrest on or about 3 November and the visit from the High Commission in Harare on 14 January was in the first place due to difficulties in establishing what precisely had happened to him and whether he had in fact been arrested. Because of the dislocation in Mozambique resulting from widespread attacks by Renamo rebels, communication between Maputo and provincial centres is not as efficient as it might be. Secondly, there was difficulty in confirming Grey's precise whereabouts, whether in Tete Province or in Maputo. Lastly, there was delay in the procedures for getting permission to visit him. As soon as this permission was received on 28 December, the Acting High Commissioner made arrangements to visit Maputo as Soon as he was able to do so. (19) No. (20) Yes, by Dr M. Fish who accompanied me on my visit to Maputo. (21) No. It took place on 6 February in the presence of a prison official. (22) (a) No abnormalities (except for pallor) (b) Anti-malaria tablets, vitamin pills and exercise were recommended. (23) Yes, on 6 February. (24) Yes. The Prison authorities permitted the officer of the Australian High Commission visiting Grey to provide him with substantial quantities of food to supplement his diet. Mr Grey's health since appears to have improved substantially. United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (Question No. 790) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 22 March 1988: (I) Is he able to say what the UN Fund for Drug Abuse Control is. (2) What are the purposes of the Fund. (3) How does the Fund plan to work. (4) Has Australia joined the Fund; if so, (a) what financial contribution are we expected to make and (b) what would be the benefits for the Australian anti-drug campaign through the Fund.",72
51,Mr HAYDEN,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The UN Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC) was established in 1971 by resolution of the UN General Assembly to develop and implement short and long term narcotics control programs. (2) The purpose of UNFDAC are to plan, implement and monitor multilateral and country programs designed to reduce the global production of narcotic raw materials such as opium (for heroin) and coca leaf (cocaine), and to restrict the processing, distribution and consumption of refined narcotic products. (3) UNFDAC works by providing resources for projects to overcome specific narcotics related problems in countries or regions. These projects normally involve the provision of technical assistance and personnel training programs to increase the capacities of individual governments in areas such as expansion of research and information facilities of drug control organisations; law enforcement and drug control administration; crop substitution and rural development; and the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts. (4) Yes. (a) There is no assessed scale of contributions for UNFDAC. All contributions are made by donors on a voluntary basis. Australia contributed $400,000 for the 1988 calendar year, representing in part a catch-up payment for 1987 when the contribution was reduced from the previous years' figure of $200,000 to $50,000 due to budgetary constraints. No commitment has been made to UNFDAC for 1989 at this stage. (b) The benefits to the Australian anti-drug campaign flowing from our participation in and contributions to UNFDAC derive principally from overall reductions in the global production and trafficking of narcotics, which should lead to lower quantities of drugs being available for illegal import into Australia. Australia is also recognised internationally as a nation in the forefront of the campaign to reduce drug dependency and ameliorate drug related social problems. Contributions to the Fund allow for direct Australian input and involvement in developing global drug control strategies. Membership also promotes an increased knowledge and awareness of international drug issues within Australian government agencies, non-government organisations and the general community.

52,Mr RUDDOCK,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 16 March 1988: (1) Is the Government reconsidering its decision not to participate in the third replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). (2) Has the Government, since its decision was announced, received a request from the US. State Department Deputy Secretary of State, Mr J. C. Whitehead. (3) Did the Deputy Secretary of State advise him that Australia's non-participation would lead to the perception that OECD donors do not accord IFAD high priority and, in turn, encourage OPEC not to make maximum efforts to provide adequate funding in the third replenishment. (4) Did the Deputy Secretary of State advise that the US. State Department is of the view that IFAD is an effective development agency directed at the important objective of improving the productivity and income of small farmers in poor countries.",74

56,Mr HAYDEN,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not have the resources to provide a response to this question. The honourable member could perhaps draw on the resources of the Parliamentary Library to assist him in this matter. Mr J. Georgiev (Question No. 817) Dr Woods asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 17 March 1988: What assistance will he provide my constituent, Mr J. Georgiev if Mr Georgiev follows his advice to contact a solicitor and is successful in obtaining a custody order from the Australian Courts for the recovery of his children who were taken by his estranged wife, without permission, to Bulgaria.",78
57,Mr HAYDEN,OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS OF FAO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My Department did suggest that Mr Georgiev consult a solicitor as this is a private legal matter. My Department did not however suggest that Mr Georgiev should seek an Australian custody orderthat is a matter to be determined by the solicitor. In addition to the suggestions that Mr Georgiev consult a solicitor in relation to the matter of the custody of his children, my Department in its response to his request also suggested that he may wish to discuss the matter with the Attorney-General's Zaire Department under the provisions of the Overseas Custody (Child Removal) Scheme. Until Mr Georgiev is able to make available the advice he receives from these sources, it is not possible for me to say what assistance, if any, the Government will be able to provide. The Government cannot take a position on the basis of a hypothetical court order whose terms it does not know. Royal Commissions and Joint Inquiries (Question No. 823) Mr Scholes asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 17 March 1988: (1) How many royal commissions or inquiries were established in the 10 years from 1977 to 1987.

(4) How many of the recommendations of each inquiry have been implemented. (5) Where inquiries have been into matters involving illegal activities, how many persons have been subsequently prosecuted arising from the recommendations, or information obtained from, the royal commission. (6) What has been the cost to revenue of complying with royal commission findings.",78

Such information is not readily available and I am reluctant to authorise the considerable time and effort which would be required to be expended in order to obtain it. (5) Statistical information in regard to prosecutions is not generally kept in a form that indicates how particular prosecutions arose. As a consequence statistical information in relation to the number of persons prosecuted as a result of a particular royal commission is not readily available. As a result of inquiries of the Director of Public Prosecutions and an examination of records relating to the former Crown Solicitor's Division of the Attorney-General's Department it can be said that at least 59 prosecutions have resulted from royal comState /Northern Territory Reported Total Cost Involvement 28.7.85 $9,409,956 New South Wales ($4,300,575recouped from States)-ineludes cost of Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking 31.7.85 $3,877,667 20.12.84 $2,317,101 9.2.84 30.4.86 $1,632,413 20.11.85 $3,509,893 30.4.86 $657,915 ($296,955 re- New South Wales couped from States) Victoria 2.4.86 22.5.87 Financed by Northern Northern Territory Territory 18.2.88 $2,140,600 (expendi- All States ture not finalised) except Tasmania estimates expenditure All States 31.12.89 not yet finalised and the (some expenditure Northern is to be provided by Territory all States, except Queensland, and the Northern Territory) missions in the period specified, 46 relating to the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union and 13 relating to the Royal Commission into Australian Meat Industry.

Cleaners Telecom Office, Bunbury, Western (Question No. 843)  ing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 24 March 1988: (I) What agreement was reached between Telecom and the relevant unions regarding the impact on staff levels at Telecom's Bunbury, WA, office arising from the country districts amalgamation policy. (2) Was it agreed that any staff reductions should be implemented by means of attrition only. (3) Will there be no forced relocations or redundancies arising from Telecom's decision to reduce certain staffing levels at its Bunbury office.  Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom Australia: (I) There was no formal agreement by the various staff associations to the Western Australian country districts amalgamation. However, several concerns, including the impact on staff levels at Telecom's Bunbury Office, have been the subject of continuous review and consultation with the relevant staff associations and staff concerned. (2) No. However, staff reductions are expected to be minimal and will occur through voluntary transfers to Perth, natural attrition or redeployment within the Bunbury Office. (3) The country districts amalgamation policy itself is not expected to involve any forced relocations or redundancies. However, separate arrangements for closure of the Bunbury Office of the Engineeering Department have led to one Telecom officer being directed to relocate to Perth. Discussions are stilI proceeding with a view to a suitable alternative placement of that officer. 2 Mozambique (Question No. 847) I Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Foreign 4 Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 24 March 1988. 10 What evidence is there that South Africa is backing the (Renamo) resistance forces in Mozambique.",85
62,Mr HAYDEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honour I able member's question is as follows: 12 It is clear that RENAMO continues to receive 3 assistance from external sources. Only recently, on 26 March, Mr Ian Grey, the Australian missionary who was charged with various offences in connection with his assistance to RENAMO, provided some information indicating support from South Africa Australia (and elsewhere) for that organisation. The Mozambican Government says that there can be no question but that South Africa is supplying RENAMO. For example, an attack by three to four hundred insurgents in February on the Mozambican town of Moamba was launched from a training camp at Phalaborwa in South Africa. Observers in Mozambique have said that it is difficult to escape the conclusion that South Africa, at the minimum, allows its territory to be used as a base for RENAMO activities. This would amount to material assistance which South Africa, in the 1984 Nkomati Accord, undertook to cease. It seems possible that, while official South African assistance to RENAMO may have ceased with the 1984 Nkomati Accord, unofficial assistance continues through clandestine means. It is partly for this reason that concrete evidence of South African support is hard to find. An exception was in 1985 when Zimbabwean troops in Mozambique captured a RENAMO base at which documents were found which showed continuing South African support for RENAMO after the Nkomati Accord. Some of these documents were published and the South African Foreign Minister conceded ""technical"" violations of the Accord. I would also refer the honourable member to the 4 March 1988 issue of Africa Confidential, which contains further information on South Africa's links with RENAMO. He might also wish to consult the testimony of US Assistant Secretary of State Crocker before the US Senate Subcommittee on African Affairs on 24 June 1987. African States (Question No. 848) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 24 March 1988: (I) How long has (a) Djibouti (b) Sao Tome and Principe and (c) Lesotho been recognised as national states. (2) What is the (a) population and (b) average per capita income of each of those states. (3) Is he able to say (a) who is the recognised leader of each of those states and (b) (i) how and (ii) when he or she attained that position. (4) Does the leader of each of those states head a political party; if so, what party. (5) Are opposition parties allowed in each of those states; if so, (a) how many democratic elections have been held, and (b) when was the last democratic election held. (6) If opposition parties are allowed, (a) how many political parties are there and (b) what are their names. (7) How many distinct tribal or similar groups are there in each of those states. (8) What is the largest tribal or similar group and to which group does the leader belong.",89
63,Mr HAYDEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not have the resources to provide a response to this question. The honourable member could perhaps draw on the resources of the Parliamentary Library to assist him in this matter. (Question No. 854) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 11 April 1988: (1) How long have (a) Liberia (b) Upper Volta and (c) Togo been recognised as national states. (2) What is the (a) population and (b) average per capita income of each of those states. (3) Is he able to say (a) who is the recognised leader of each of those states and (b) (i) how and (ii) when he or she attained that position.

64,Mr HAYDEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not have the resources to provide a response to this question. The honourable member could perhaps draw on the resources of the Parliamentary Library to assist him in this matter. Imparja Television (Question No. 855) Mr Macphee asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 12 April 1988: (I) What is the (a) sum and (b) source of Commonwealth money being provided to Imparja Television and its shareholders to assist its commercial television service. (2) What are the sums, sources and purposes of Commonwealth money which have been and are being provided to Imparja's owner, the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA). (3) Is the Minister able to say what assistance was provided to the Imparja application by the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). (4) Is the Minister able to say what effort was made by the ADC to investigate the purchase of a shareholding in NTD-8 in Darwin. (5) Is the Minister able to say whether the ADC, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or CAAMA obtained the valuation of Territory Television; if not, why not. African States (6) Did the Minister receive a request prior to the central zone Regional Commercial Television Services hearing from the Chairman of the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account (ABT A) for a meeting to consider Aboriginal investment in television. (7) Did this meeting occur; if not, why not. (8) Would the Minister's approval have enabled the ABT A to purchase a controlling interest in Territory Television for a lesser amount than the present level of Commonwealth funding for Imparja Television; if not, what attempts were made by officers of the Minister's Department to investigate this option. (9) Would Aboriginal ownership of NTD-8 have been a satisfactory alternative; if not, why not.  Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question, based, in part, on information provided by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs: (1) The Australian Bicentennial Authority (ABA) has provided a cash grant of $2.5m following application by Imparja. The grant application was independently assessed by the ABA and approved by them. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has provided $3.2m to CAAMA for the technical training of 35 people to work for Imparja. Total funding provided by the Aboriginal Development Commission to Imparja Television and its main shareholder, CAAMA, is $2.0m. This was partially in the form of a loan at call to CAAMA for $34,554 for legal costs to fight the appeals against the granting of the RCTS licence to Imparja Television. The remaining funds have been used to purchase 1,965,646 $1 ""B"" class Preference Shares from Imparja Television Pty Ltd. The funds from this share issue have been used for the purpose of: fitting out an interim studio for satellite casting services; consultancy and other establishment costs; and satellite and other uplinking equipment. It should be noted that the figure of $2.0m has been supplied by the Aboriginal Development Commission and exceeds the $1.8m that was put forward as evidence to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal inquiry for Imparja's licence. The Commission also owns the present site and buildings occupied by Imparja Television and leases these premises to Imparja. Negotiations are in progress for the Commission to purchase a site near Alice Springs and for Imparja Television to lease this for its future broadcasting and production studio. (2) Sum: 1987-88-$545,650 Purpose: To operate 8KIN-FM to service Alice Springs, Ali Curung, Hermannsburg and Santa Teresa. To produce relevant videotape material for distribution to Aboriginal communities throughout Australia. Also see (I) above. (3) See (I) above. (4) No effort was made to purchase a share holding in NTD-8 in Darwin. (5) The Department of Aboriginal Affairs did not obtain a valuation of Territory Television. The ADC did not arrange a valuation of Territory Television. Imparja Television applied for the central zone Remote Commercial Television Service. I understand that it did not apply to take over Territory Television. I am unable to comment on whether or not CAAMA sought or obtained a valuation. (6) A detailed check of Departmental records has not revealed such a request. (7) See (6) above. (8) (a) The Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account (ABTA) was established under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 to receive and distribute mining royalty equivalent incomes derived from Aboriginal land. The ABT A is not a body corporate and, therefore, could not purchase a controlling interest in Territory Television. (b) Officers of the Department of Transport and Communications and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs arranged a meeting in Alice Springs between Imparja and principals of Capricornia Television with a view to discussing the possibility of the two organisations forming a joint venture to operate the RCTS service. This meeting took place in Alice Springs prior to the second hearings for the central zone RCTS. (9) In the course of the discussions noted in (8) above, the principals of NTD-8 made some offers of a part holding by Imparja Television in NTD-8 but broadthis was rejected by Imparja. The ABT adjourned its licence hearings pending the outcome of the discussions which resulted from (8) above but, when agreement could not be reached, the inquiry and public hearings proceeded. I am not in a position to comment on whether or not Aboriginal ownership of NTD-8 would have been a satisfactory alternative to the RCTS. Social Security Beneficiaries (Question No. 857) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 12 April 1988: (I) How many Social Security clients are there for each category of benefit and pension. (2) Are there files on all these clients; if so, what information is recorded for each benefit and pension category. (3) What happens to a file when a client no longer becomes entitled to that benefit or pension. (4) If the file is destroyed, (a) why, (b) how and (c) when is it done, and what is the procedure for destroying files. (5) If the file is not destroyed, (a) why not and (b) what happens to it. (6) How many files have been destroyed for each category of benefit and pension each year since 1983. (7) How many files exist on previous social security clients. (8) If the number of files on previous clients is not known, why not. (9) How many files does his Department have and are they all on computer.",90
65,Mr HOWE,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) As at 30 April 1988, the number of Social Security clients for each category of benefit and pension was as follows: Pensions Age . . . . . . . . . . . I 351 969 Invalid . . . . . . . . . . 386359 Sheltered Employment Allowance 10604 Rehabilitation . . . . . 2583 Widows . . . . . . . 145659 Supporting Parent's Benefit 182433 Total. 2079609 Unemployment Benefit (including Job Search Allowance) 490408 Sickness Benefit . . . . . . . 75045 Pensions Special Benefit Family Allowance Child Disability Allowance Double Orphans Pension Family Allowance Supplement (families). . . . . Mobility Allowance . . . . Disadvantaged Persons Scheme (2) Files are held for all clients with the exception of those under the Disadvantage Persons Scheme whose records are batch stored. The information recorded on files is that which is necessary to assess a person's eligibility for a pension or benefit and the amount of payment. The information consists of personal details such as age, marital status, name of spouse (where necessary), names and dates of birth of children, income and asset details, rent paid and medical information where applicable (e.g. Invalid Pensions and Sickness Benefit). (3) All client files are destroyed except cases where: administrative action is outstanding such as overpayment recovery action; the unusual nature or special features of the particular case have resulted in change to legislative or administrative policy. Such files may be used for research or reference purposes and are regarded as having permanent value. (4) (a) These files are destroyed because there is no further administrative need to maintain the information and the Australian Archives has determined that the records have no permanent value. (b) Files which have been selected for destruction are stored in sealed classified waste bags and bins. These are collected by security companies or the Department of Administrative Services for destruction under supervision. In areas where the security companies or Department of Administrative Services do not operate, arrangements are made by Regional Offices for the local destruction of files. This involves, under close supervision by Departmental officers, the use of hospital incinerators or other secure destruction facilities. (c) The vast majority of clients' files are destroyed 12 months after the date of their last payment. Cases that are retained for longer periods fall into the categories set out in (3). Lists of terminated/cancelled cases are produced at regular intervals by computer. This culling action removes the clients' records from the data base and the list is used to cull files from holdings in Regional Offices. The files are examined to ensure that all action has been completed. Destruction takes places as described in 4 (b). The disposal of these records is authorised under the Archives Act 1983. (5) (a) See answer to 3. (b) If a file is considered to have permanent value, it is transferred into the custody of Australian Archives. Access to these records is restricted by the 22295 exemption provisions of the Archives Act 1983. Files 1915089 which relate to cases involving the recovery of money, 32672 i.e. overpayments, compensation and assurance of children support payments, are held by my Department for 6 3735 years after write off. Some overpayment case files children are held for longer periods if the overpayment is very substantial and there is some possibility that the 113530 debtor might have a subsequent social security enti12 544 tlement that may enable all or part of the debt to 117 444 be recovered. (6) The Department does not keep specific records of the number of files destroyed for each category of benefit or pension. (7) Precise figures on files held on previous Social Security clients are not kept. The files held are in three distinct categories, namely: those held in the department that are awaiting the elapse of 12 months from the date of last payment before they are destroyed; those considered to have some permanent value warranting transfer to the custody of Australian Archives; and those related to outstanding overpayments where the pension or benefit is not current and recovery action is in progress, or subsequent entitlement to a social security payment may aid in recovery of all or part of the debt before it is written off as irrecoverable. The Australian Archives hold approximately 3458 shelf metres of Social Security client files. I am advised that the bulk of these files are not considered to be of permanent value and that arrangements have been made to begin destroying most of them. The files not considered to have any permanent value are the result of two administrative decisions taken in the early to mid I 970s. The first decision related to the department's decentralisation programme in New South Wales which resulted in large numbers of non-current files being transferred to Australian Archives for subsequent culling and destruction. Unfortunately the culling and destruction did not go ahead as planned at the time. The second decision was when a pilot project to test the viability of changing the Department's records-keeping strategy from a paper based file to microfilm for Family Allowance and Pensions files was undertaken in South Australia and Tasmania. Paper files held in those States were transferred to the custody of Australian Archives to be held on a temporary basis until such time as they were due for routine culling and destruction. The department did not proceed to extend the microfilm concept and has reverted to paper files in all States. (8) The Department has no administrative requirement to know the number of files held and it would take considerable resources to maintain this information if it were required. (9) The Department has some 4.5 million current paper files. A sub-set of the information on client files is also held on computer for enquiry, assessment and payment purposes. Australian Taxation Office: Alleged Offence by Employee (Question No. 858) Mr Rocher asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 12 April 1988: (I) Has a charge been laid against an employee of the Australian Taxation Office in Perth for either a breach of the Income Tax Assessment Act or other serious employment-related offences; if so, what charge or charges have been laid. (2) If charges have not been laid, are possible charges being considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions.",91
66,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) I presume, that the questions refer to the alleged release of confidential information concerning the taxation affairs of a Perth journalist. Director of Public Prosecutions has examined a brief of evidence in the matter and has decided that there is no basis for criminal proceedings against any employee of the Australian Taxation Office. The matter is now being examined by the Australian Government Solicitor to advise whether any employee has committed a disciplinary offence against the Public Service Act 1922. Drug-related Offences (Question No. 859) Mr Rocher asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 April 1988: (a) Have convictions been recorded against an employee (or employees) of the Australian Taxation Office, Perth, for drug-related offences? (b) If so, what disciplinary action has been taken by the A TO against the offender(s)?",93
67,Mr KEATING,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Yes, two officers were convicted of offences. (b) An officer authorised to deal with such matters examined the convictions and penalties recorded against the officers and, having had regard to the provisions of the Public Service Act, and guidelines contained in the Disciplinary Handbook, took action that was considered appropriate in the circumstances of each case. One officer was formally charged with a disciplinary offence under the Public Service Act and was counselled. The other officer was counselled but not formally charged. Veterans: Transport to Repatriation Hospitals (Question No. 861) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 13 April 1988: (I) What sum was spent on the provision of Commonwealth cars for veterans and other patients utilising facilities at the Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg, Vic. since April 1987. (2) What sum was spent for the same provision of Commonwealth cars for the use of patients at Repatriation General Hospitals in (a) Brisbane, (b) Hobart, (c) Perth and (d) Sydney. (3) What criteria does his Department utilise when allowing Commonwealth cars to be used for veterans at Repatriation hospitals. (4) What sum was spent on the provision of public transport for patients at the Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg, Vic. since April 1987. Mr Humphreys-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The amount paid to the Department of Local The Government and Administrative Services for the provision of transport (both Commonwealth cars and taxis) for veterans and other patients utilising facilities at RGH Heidelberg for the period I April 1987 to 31 March 1988 is estimated to be $3,821,489. This reflects the high rate of use of the RGH by entitled persons both as in-patients and out-patients. In Victoria most patients requiring in-patient treatment, who live in country areas, are admitted to RGH Heidelberg. In most cases this is seen as having some cost advantages when compared with the cost of obtaining treatment at local facilities. In cases of medical emergency or where continuity of care is medically desirable, patients may be treated in their local areas. In Victoria patients requiring specialist out-patient treatment are also generally referred to the RGH rather than to private specialists as there is no direct referral to metropolitan specialists as occurs in Sydney. (2) These figures include Commonwealth cars and taxis: (a) Brisbane $1,784,406 (b) Hobart $320,919 (c) Perth $997,274 (d) Sydney $2,324,177 (e) Adelaide $935,924 (3) Wherever possible, veterans attending Repatriation hospitals should use public transport. Car transport may be authorised by an entitled person's Local Medical Officer where there is no public transport available, and the person does not have access to a private vehicle, or there are medical reasons which prevent the person from using these forms of transport. (4) The sum spent on reimbursement to patients for arranging their own transport to RGH Heidelberg either by private car or public transport for the period I April 1987 to 31 March 1988 is estimated to be $189,305. Note-The Department is currently reviewing beneficiary transport arrangements. This review was announced in the 1987-88 Budget. The review will not affect entitlement to travel for treatment purposes. Those beneficiaries whose use of Commonwealth transport cannot be justified on medical grounds will still be entitled to reimbursement of transport costs if they drive their own vehicles or use public transport. International Civil Aviation Organisation: (Question No. 863) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 13 April 1988: (I) Is the Minister able to say which countries are in arrears in their contributions to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and by what sum is each country in arrears. (2) What are the consequences of the financial crisis within ICAO caused by these debts.  Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) As at 16 May 1988 there were 68 of the 157 Contracting States of ICAO whose contributions were in arrears. These are as follows: Contracting State I. Afghanistan 2. Angola . . 3. Antigua and Barbuda 4. Benin 5. Burkina Faso . 6. Burundi. . 7. Cameroon . . 8. Cape Verde 9. Central African Republic 10.

Forecast income for 1988 is now esti34,249.40 mated at US$28.1 m. The economy measures being 95,500.94 taken to reduce expenditure in 1988 are summarised 107,909.18 as follows: (a) Budget Part I-Meetings deferred from 1988 to 1989 and beyond: Caribbean/South American, Second Regional Air Navigation Meeting 4 air navigation panel meetings 4 air navigation workshops or implementation meetings I air transport panel I air transport workshop. Total estimated savings US$330,000. (b) Budget Part 2-The Secretariat: 23 professional posts and 45 general services posts to be rendered inoperative, in addition to those rendered inoperative by attrition this will make a total of 88 professional and 80 general services posts vacant by the end of 1988. Total estimated savings US$2,419,000. (c) Budget Part 3-General Services: changes to security arrangements at ICAO headquarters publication of the ICAO Bulletin quarterly instead of monthly reduction of paper and printing supplies, postage, etc. as a result of reductions under Parts I, 2 and 5 of the budget. Total estimated savings US$449,000. (d) Budget Part 4-Equipment: reduction in purchase of office automation equipment. Total estimated savings US$257,000. (e) Budget Part 5-0ther Budgetary Provisions: reduction of provision for special implementation projects deferral of ICAO 1988 familiarisation course to 1989. Total estimated savings US$130,000. (f) 1988 expenditure estimates (before economy measures) were US$417,000 less than the 1988 appropriation of US$32, I 05,000. Estimated savings US$417,000. Grand Total Estimated Savings = US$4,002,OOO. Tasks in the ICAO work programme which are being adversely affected in the air navigation field incl-de airworthiness, search and rescue, aircraft operatIOns and communications. Air transport matters in the field of facilitation and air transport studies will also be adversely affected. Approximately 50 out of a total of 129 air navigation tasks and 33 out of a total of 39 air transport tasks will either be delayed in 1988 or postponed to 1989 or beyond. With the. objective of stimulating Contracting States to pay their 1988 contributions early and to reduce any arrears, Council passed a resolution which was sent to States in January 1988 strongly urging all States which have not yet done so to meet their financial obligations on an urgent basis. The ICAO Council will review the economy measures in June 1988 in the light of the existing and expected income circumstances at that time. Australia's assessed contribution for 1988 of US$514,746.00 was paid in full on 23 December 1987. International Financial Institutions: Contributions (Question No. 865) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 April 1988: Is he able to say whether the US is in arrears in its required contribution to any of the international financial institutions; if so, (a) by what sum and (b) what proportion is this of its most recent required annual contribution.",93
68,Mr KEATING,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In terms of the international financial institutions for which I have primary responsibility, I am advised that the United States is not in arrears in quota subscriptions to the International Monetary Fund or in capital subscriptions to the World Bank or Asian Development Bank. However, I understand that in respect of its contributions to the Asian Development Bank's concessional loan window, the Asian Development Fund (ADF), the United States has still to make available to the Bank about $US45 million, representing about 34.5 per cent of the fourth and final tranche payment of its contribution of $US520 million to the third ADF replenishment (ADF IV). I also understand that the US has yet to deposit its instrument of contribution of $US584 million to the current ADF replenishment (ADF V). The agreed ADF V arrangements envisaged that these events would occur by the end of 1987. African States (Question No. 870) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 13 April 1988: (I) How long have (a) Sierra Leone (b) Ghana and (c) Guinea been recognised as national states.

(Question No. 881) Mr Macphee asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 18 April 1988: (I) Was one of the conditions imposed on News Ltd by the Trade Practices Commission (TPC) in 1987, following the takeover of the Herald and Weekly Times by News Ltd, to divest it of the Daily Sun and the Adelaide News. (2) Has his attention been drawn to reports that both divested assets are using News Ltd's facilities, including print and distribution facilities. (3) Is he able to say whether (a) either paper uses unacknowledged stories from News Ltd's interstate and overseas bureaux and (b) some employees connected with either or both papers are receiving payment on News Ltd cheques or other methods of payment connected with News Ltd. (4) Has the TPC investigated these matters; if so, what have been the results. (5) If the TPC has not investigated these matters, why not. (6) Will he raise these matters with the TPC with a view to determining whether the newspapers are totally independent and divested assets; if not, why not. (7) If News Ltd is found not to be complying with the TPC's ruling of March 1987 or any part of the Trade Practices Act, will he take any action; if not, why not.",96
71,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Arising out of discussions between the TPC and interested parties, News Ltd and News Corporation gave a number of undertakings to the TPC including undertakings that, conditional upon News Ltd acquiring not less than 40% of the issued ordinary shares of the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, they would sell the Brisbane ""Daily Sun"" and ""Sunday Sun"" and the Adelaide ""News"" and arrange for Herald and Weekly Times Ltd to sell the Perth ""Daily News"". (2) Yes. (3) to (6) I am informed that the TPC is investigating various claims made in relation to these matters and is seeking legal advice. In the course of its investigations, the TPC has interviewed a number of people in the industry. Investigations are continuing. When the investigations have been completed and legal advice has been received, the TPC will consider the matter further. (7) I will await the outcome of the Commission's investigations. East-West Airlines (Question No. 882) Mr Macphee asked the Attorney-General, News Ltd upon notice, on 18 April 1988: (I) Did the Trade Practices Commission (TPC) in 1987, following the takeover of East-West Airlines by TNT-News Corporation, rule that Ansett Airlines had to divest itself of a number of East-West routes. (2) Did the TPC expect the process of divestment to take I month. (3) Does TNT-News Corporation through Ansett Airlines still retain some East-West routes which the TPC hoped Australian Airlines would take up. (4) Is the Minister able to say for what reasons Australian Airlines decided not to buy the divested East-West routes. (5) Is the Minister able to say why the divestments ordered by the TPC have not taken place. (6) What are the TPC's reasons and explanations for the delay. (7) Will the Minister or the TPC take any action against TNT-News Corporation to ensure that it complies with the TPC's 1987 ruling so that Australia's aviation industry is competitive; if not, why not. (8) If buyers are not forthcoming for the divested routes of East-West airlines, what action will the Government take to ensure commuters are not disadvantaged because of the East-WestjTNT-News Corporation takeover.",96
72,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Arising out of discussions between the TPC and TNT jNews interests, agreement was reached regarding basic principles for the divestiture of tain parts of the operations and assets of East-West Airlines. Details of these principles were published by the TPC in a media release dated 10 November 1987. (2) In its media release of IO November 1987, the TPC expressed the hope that Australian Airlines would be the purchaser of the Western Australian and New South Wales operations and assets to which the divestiture agreement related and indicated that if Australian Airlines did not agree to acquire these assets and to assume relevant routes within an agreed period, the TPC and the interested parties would discuss the question of an alternative purchaser. It was agreed that Australian Airlines would have one month in which to decide whether or not to acquire the relevant operations and assets. (3), (5) and (6) In accordance with the agreements announced by the TPC on 10 November 1987, there have been ongoing discussions between the TPC and TNT jNews interests concerning the sale of the relevant operations. The TPC has advised that, as at I 1une 1988, the situation in relation to the divestiture of relevant operations and assets is as follows: several routes previously operated by East-West Airlines in New South Wales have now been allocated by the NSW Government to Eastern Airlines (those being Grafton, Taree, Kempsey, Inverell and Glen Innes). . East-West Airlines shareholding and associated mterests in Eastern Airlines have been sold, the buyer being Australian Airlines. the Port Macquarie and Armidale routes have yet to be divested and are still being examined by NSW authorities and the TPC. Several parties, including Eastern Airlines, have expressed interest in acquiring these two routes. Hazelton Airlines is negotiating with Australian Airlines to move from Ansett hosting to Australian Airlines hosting (which involves on-carriage and associated arrangements such as reservations and ground handling). no sale has yet been arranged for East-West Airlines routes in Western Australia, but EastWest Airlines has closed its regular public jet transport services to the Pilbara and WA authorities are considered likely to licence other operators (The TPC understands Australian Airlines is interested in fiying the Pilbara route when the airport at Karratha has been upgraded). The TPC has held discussions with WA authorities and with some other possible entrants in respect of the other commuter routes in WA which continue to be operated by East-WestjSkywest. The TPC has also advised that the Albury and Tamworth routes may also be taken up by a second operator (in addition to the current East-West operations) . (4) The Minister for Transport and Communicacertions has advised me that the decision by Australian Airlines not to purchase East-West Airlines routes identified for divestiture was made on commercial grounds by the airline. (7) to (8) The TPC will continue to take necessary action to ensure that the divestiture is completed at the earliest possible date and will keep the honourable member informed of progress. Mr A. J. Grassby (Question No. 885) Mr Sharp asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 18 April 1988: (I) Is Mr A. 1. Grassby currently employed in any capacity by the Commonwealth; if so, (a) in what work is he engaged, (b) for how long has he been engaged by the Commonwealth and (c) what travel entitlements does he have in his work. (2) What are the details of all travel at Government expense undertaken by Mr Grassby since October 1986. (3) Is Mr Grassby still entitled to travel at Commonwealth expense. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) I can answer only in relation to my portfolio. The Hon. A. 1. Grassby is not employed in any capacity by the Commonwealth in any area of my portfolio. (2 and 3) The Hon. A. 1. Grassby qualified for a life gold pass on his retirement from the Parliament. Holders of life gold passes may travel within Australia at government expense for non-commercial purposes on scheduled commercial/commuter air services, mainline rail services and other government services, or by motor coach or other vehicles operating as regular carriers. The cost of such travel by all former members of the Parliament who have qualified for a life gold pass is met by the Department of Administrative Services.

(i) The only costs incurred are for replacement flags at $87.50 each. (ii) Approximately 65 flags are distributed on loan each year. (iii) See (c) above. Dairy Industry (Question No. 940) Mr Andrew asked the Minister for Primary I-dustries and Energy, upon notice, on 21 Apnl 1988: (I) What is the current level of Government Amount assistance provided to the dairy industry. $ (2) What is the estimated level of assistance to be 6,500 provided to the dairy industry in (a) 1993 and (b) 1998. (3) What moves are being contemplated which 5,000 might assist a recovery in the dairy industry from its present situation. 6,000 Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 3,000 (I) The dairy marketing and assistance arrangements which were introduced on I July 1986 have as their main objective the development of a more 11,000 efficient and profitable dairy industry able to respond as quickly as possible to changing market conditions and technology. Among other things, this involves the progressive reduction in domestic price support 174,200 to a level no higher than the price level at which New Zealand products could be sold in Australia on a fair trade basis. Under these arrangements, domestic prices for manufactured dairy products are underpinned by a system of market support payments on exports of all dairy produce, funded by a levy on all milk produced. The market support levy is subject to a ceiling of 45 cents per kilogram butterfat produced (or 2c/litre milk). The rate of market support is 30 per cent of the estimated average export price, unless insufficient funds were to be available from the market support levy. To assist the industry in the adjustment to the new marketing arrangements, a system of supplementary market support payments on exports of all dairy produce was also implemented. The supplementary market support payments are funded by a product levy on domestic sales of butter /butteroil and certain cheeses. These product levies are currently being phased out, together with the supplementary market support payments. The assistance level to an industry can be measured by estimating the nominal assistance (NA), as used by the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC). The NA is the amount by which gross returns to manufacturers are raised above the world price. The rate of nominal assistance is obtained by expressing the nominal assistance as a percentage of world price. The rate of nominal assistance to the dairy manufacturing sector for 1986-87 was approximately 40 percent and is expected to fall to approximately 38 percent in 1987-88. With average export prices expected to increase significantly in 1988-89, current estimates suggest that the rate of nominal assistance for that year will fall further to approximately 28 percent. In addition to the above assistance, the market milk sector receives assistance via consumer transfers as a result of State regulations. For example, estimates made by the Industries Assistance Commission indicate an effective rate of assistance to the market milk sector in excess of 250 percent in 1985-86. (2) The levels of assistance to be provided in 1993 and 1998 depend on Government policies at these times. The Commonwealth legislation for the current dairy marketing and assistance arrangements expires on 30 June 1992. It is envisaged that the arrangements to apply after that date will be determined after an enquiry by the lAC. It is not possible therefore to predict levels of assistance to the manufacturing milk sector to apply in 1993 and 1998. Just as it is not possible to predict levels of assistance to the manufacturing milk sector it is not possible to predict assistance levels to the market milk sector which result from State arrangements. (3) The current marketing arrangements appear to be working well, with industry taking up the challenge of exploiting new opportunities which have opened up under the arrangements. However, for the reasons outlined above, it would be premature to indicate any course of action at this time. Aboriginal Properties, Redfern, New South (Question No. 945) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 26 April 1988: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the correspondence between Mr G. Wotherspoon and his Department concerning the condition of properties held by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or the Aboriginal Development Commission located at 3133 Cope Street, Redfern, N.S.W., which have been occupied for many months by squatters, with a subsequent build-up of rubbish.

Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The property in question was gifted to the Aboriginal Development Commission in 1982 by the Uniting Church and is part of a larger property known as the Black Theatre. The Commission is currently working with local community groups and New South Wales housing authorities to arrange suitable accommodation for the homeless Aboriginal people currently living on Wales these premises. The Commission has arranged for regular clearing away of refuse and will continue to do so. A development plan for the properties is currently being prepared. (3) Mr Wotherspoon has received a reply and will be kept informed of developments. (4) See answer (2) above. Pollution from Ships: Convention (Question No. 954) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 27 April 1988: (1) Is the Minister able to say which Pacific states have accepted (a) Optional Annex III (packaged harmful substances), (b) Optional Annex IV (sewage) and (c) Optional Annex V (Garbage) of the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships as modified by the Protocol of 1978. (2) Is the Minister able to say whether Annex II has been accepted by a sufficient number of qualified states for it to enter into force on 30 December 1988. (3) Is the Minister able to say what Federal, State Wales and Territory action has been taken since the second reading speech made by the then Minister for Transport (Hansard, 8 October 1986, page 1676) to enable Australia to accept each Annex.  the Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Tuvalu is the only South Pacific Forum country which has accepted the optional Annexes III, IV and V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (MARPOL). (2) Annex III has not yet achieved the required level of international acceptance to enable its entry into force on 30 December 1988. (3) The Commonwealth and the States are currently finalising means of ensuring prompt ratification of the optional Annexes. As for Annexes I and II, which came into force on 14 January 1988, this could take the form of overriding Commonwealth legislation, with a savings clause preserving the operation of State and Territory legislation. Australian Coastal Waters: Illegal Fishing (Question No. 956)  upon notice, on 28 April 1988: (I) Was legal aid provided for the skipper and crew of the fishing vessel Rahmat Ilahi, arrested for illegal fishing off the Australian coast in January 1988; if so, what charges were laid against the skipper and crew following that incident? (2) Were the skipper and crew repatriated to their homeland; if so, at what cost? (3) Is he able to say whether the Rahmat Ilahi was given a warning after being suspected of illegal fishing in Australian waters during November 1987?",100
76,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. Legal aid for the master and owner of the vessel was provided by the Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia. Aid was provided ""inhouse"" by a solicitor employed by the Commission. The master was charged under sub-sections (I) and (2) of section 20 as well as sub-section (I) of section 29 of the Quarantine Act 1908; section 28 of Migration Act 1958. I should point out, however, that the grant of aid in a particular case is a matter for the Legal Aid Commission itself to determine. I have no power to intervene in the day-today decisions of the Commission. (2) Yes. The master and crew were returned to Indonesia in February 1988 together with the masters and crews of 5 other vessels and a seaman stranded from an earlier episode. A total of 103 people were returned over a two day period on two chartered aircraft. The cost was $58,000. (3) Yes. The ""Rahmat Ilahi"" was suspected of illegal fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone and was boarded by a naval patrol vessel on 20 November 1987 approximately 50 nautical miles north of Mermaid Reef (17 0 6'S, 119 0 38'E). The master was instructed to leave the Zone immediately. Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Question No. 958) Mr Downer asked the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, upon notice, on 28 April 1988: (I) What were the functions, by category, of the 895 management and administrative staff employed by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) as at 30 June 1987. (2) How many of those staff were employed at the equivalent of the senior executive service levels of the Australian Public Service. (3) What proportion of CSL sales were (a) imported, (b) made under licence and (c) made in Australia. (4) Is the CSL art exhibition still in existence; if so, what is the cost of the exhibition. (5) Did the CSL hold any social functions to celebrate its 70th anniversary in State capitals; if so, at what cost were these functions held. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) In answer to a previous Question upon notice No 358 of 29 October 1987 from the honourable member to the Minister for Community Services and Health it was reported that at 30 June 1987 CSL staff consisted of 138 involved in Research and Development and 895 involved in management, administration and other activities. Due to a clerical error the answer should have reported that 1,033 staff were involved in management, administration and other activities. A breakup of the 1,033 staff is as follows Production . . . . . . . 466 Quality assurance and Animal services . . . . . . 147 Corporate Management 4 Audit . . . . . . 3 EDP . . . . . . . 26 Administration Control . 3 Personnel and General Services 79 Finance and Supply 65 Marketing 139 Engineering . . . 101 1,033 (2) Eleven. (3) The proportion of CSL sales imported, made under licence, and made in Australia is considered to be confidential commercial information. (4) Yes. Original cost $70,000. There is a programme partly completed of exhibiting the collection at numerous galleries around Australia. The cost of transporting the collection from gallery to gallery since I July 1987 has been $7,740. (5) For many years, the Commission has made a point of acknowledging its Commonwealth-wide status and responsibilities, and its obligations of reporting to its shareholders, the Australian public. One of the means of doing this was by conducting meetings in one or two cities other than Melbourne each year, followed by mixing with local representatives at a social gathering. Typically, those attending have included the State Ministers for Health and Agriculture, and representatives of the Australian Medical Association, the Australian Veterinary Association, the Australian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, the Medical and Science Faculties of local universities, the pharmacy profession and the pharmaceutical industry. With the proposal to mark CSL's 70th Anniversary in 1986, no such interstate visits were made for several years before 1986, with a view to making visits to all capitals during 1986. At the 1986 events, reference was made to the 70th Anniversary theme, but in practice, the visits were substitutes for those which would otherwise have been made over a four or five year time span. In this sense, the expense involved was not 'additional' as like expenditure would have been incurred over a longer term. The cost of the functions in 1986 was $26,449.98. Alleged Leaks of Balance of Payments (Question No. 959) Mr Blunt asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 28 April 1988: (1) Does he accept the findings of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) study of alleged leaks of balance of payments figures. (2) Were the contents of this report leaked. (3) Has his attention been drawn to the article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald, dated 7 March 1988, by Mr S. Burrell; if so, will he make a response to the article. (4) Will he direct the ABS to examine the relationship between movements in the final hour of trading and whether the actual figure is above or below market expectations.",101
77,Mr KEATING,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Various investigations have been conducted by the ABS, and also two by the Australian Federal Police, into alleged leaks of balance of payments figures. The particular ABS study to which the question apparently refers examined exchange rate movements on the day of release of monthly balance of payments figures. It provided no evidence to support the leak allegations. (2) The contents of the report on the study were not leaked. The report is publicly available and is provided to any interested person on request. (3) I am aware of the article by Mr S. Burrell in the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 March 1988 and also the Statistician's response in a letter published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 8 March. In his response, the Statistician rebutted a number of claims made by Mr Burrell and also gave his assurance that the ABS will keep its strict security arrangements under review and will continue to take any specific leak allegations very seriously. (4) Each month the ABS examines the relationship between exchange rate movements on the day of release of monthly balance of payments statistics and whether the actual figure is above or below market expectations. Movements during the morning and immediately prior to release are examined as part of these studies; they have provided no evidence to support the leak allegations. Radio Licence Renewals (Question No. 962) Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 10 May 1988: (I) Has the Government issued guidelines to the ABT suggesting that it adopt a more involved and management-oriented approach to establishing conditions for radio licence renewals; if so, why. (2) What are these guidelines. Figures (3) Does the Government have guidelines concerning Australian content of music broadcast by radio stations; if so, what are they. (4) Did the ABT, in the course of renewing a licence for Radio Station 6NW /KA, impose a condition that the station was to employ a B-Grade journalist; if so, (a) what was the basis of imposing this condition and (b) did the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal consider the cost of this condition and the impact on this station's profitability.  Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal: (I) The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is an independent statutory authority within the Transport and Communications portfolio and has not been issued with any guidelines by the Government as characterised in the question. (2) Not applicable. (3) The Government has no guidelines concerning Australian content of music broadcast by radio stations. Section 114 of the Broadcasting Act 1942 requires broadcasting stations to make an undertaking to use, as far as possible, the services of Australians in the production and presentation of radio programs. It also requires that no less than 5 per cent of the time occupied by a radio licensee in the broadcasting of music shall be devoted to the broadcasting of works of composers who are Australian. Section 16 of the Broadcasting Act empowers the Tribunal ""by instrument in writing, to determine the standards to be observed by licensees in respect of the broadcasting of programs and in respect of programs to be broadcast"" Pursuant to this power, the Tribunal has a Radio Program Standard (RPS4) which requires radio licensees to ensure than not less than 20 per cent of the time occupied in the broadcasting of music each day by a licensee shall consist of performances by Australians. This standard has recently been reviewed by way of a public inquiry. As a result of that inquiry, the Tribunal has determined a new standard to take effect on I July 1988. The new standard will require radio licensees to ensure that 20 per cent of the time spent in broadcasting music, or 20 per cent of musical items, between 6.00 a.m. and 12.00 midnight, is given to music performed by Australians unless during that time a licensee plays less than one hour of music in which case the quota will not apply. (4) The Tribunal, when it renewed the licences for commercial radio stations 6NW and 6KA in December 1987, imposed the following condition on the licences: The licencee shall engage a journalist and use the services of that journalist, full-time, in connection with the provision of local news and information programs to be broadcast on 6KA and 6NW from I July 1988. The reasons for imposing this condition were detailed in the Tribunal's report nos. 610/87 and 611/ 87 released on 15 December 1987. The Tribunal's News Release no 67/1987 dated 18 December 1987 summarised that part of the report relating to the station's local news bulletins as follows: As a result of the limited resources devoted to the local news service, local news items are often poorly written for broadcast and appear to rely too heavily and too often on press release material supplied to the station ... Northwest is the only company licensed to use the commercial radio medium in the Pilbara region. Yet the limited resources it is prepared to commit to its local news service means that it is not of a standard which the audience in this region deserves. Northwest is under-utilising the scarce public resource allocated to it. During the inquiry, the licensee, Northwest Radio Pty Ltd, claimed that a condition to engage a full time journalist could not be justified on the grounds that it would not be economically feasible. However, having considered all the evidence before it the Tribunal decided to impose the condition because it felt confident that the scope and quality of the local news service would improve markedly as a result. In regard to the likely financial impact of the condition the Tribunal concluded, at paragraphs 99, 100, 102 and 103 of its report as follows: I accept the licensee's evidence that a condition - eq-iring the engagement of a full-time journalist IS likely to require an expenditure of $55,380 per annum. It may be though that means can be found by management to secure the services of a journalist for its local news service for less than this amount. Northwest did not contend that such a condition would render 6KA and 6NW no longer commercially viable. I am satisfied that notwithstanding the imposition of this condition, the stations will remain commercially viable. During the financial year 1986/87 Northwest out laid $299,614 in an unsuccessful attempt to acquire another broadcasting licence. Notwithstanding this expenditure Northwest said that its stations remained commercially viable . . . and that it could meet various capital expenditures planned for the next three years form its own resources. There is of course nothing unusual or improper in a licensee company attempting to obtain additional stations. However, in this case, it is clear that the funds used to support Northwest's application for the Mandurah licence are no longer available to improve the service to the Pilbara in the way this condition will require. The business interest of licensees must at all times be subordinate to the principle that the possession of a licence is a public trust for the benefit of the community. The community which is entitled to expect to receive the benefit of the proceeds of 6KA/6NW's broadcasting operations is the community in the Pilbara. The Pilbara should not be expected to subsidise or be disadvantaged by Northwest's licence application in Manduah. I have taken these considerations into account when evaluating Northwest's submission that the condition contemplated in this report would not be justified or economically feasible. The licensee has lodged an appeal against the imposition of the condition in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The matter is due to be heard in Perth, commencing on 14 June 1988. A copy of the ABT's report on the renewal of the licences, has been forwarded to the honourable member for his information. Ballot Papers (Question No. 965) Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 10 May 1988: (I) Is any attempt made to balance and reconcile the number of ballot papers issued to Returning Offices with the number counted at the close of polling; if so, how is this done. (2) If an attempt to reconcile the number of ballot papers is not made, why not. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) and (2) The answer to the honourable member's question is contained in the answers to House of Representatives Questions 767 and 771. (Question No. 984) Mr Sharp asked the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, upon notice, on 18 May 1988: What consultations took place between the former Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and himself regarding the decision announced by the former Minister on 17 December 1987 that it was not possible to involve the Australian Customs Service in arrangements concerning the $5 arrival fee. Mr Barry Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No consultations took place between the former Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and myself about involving the Australian Customs Service in arrangements concerning the Immigration Service Fee. Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (Question No. 988) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 18 May 1988: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a National Health and Medical Research Council research grant made to Dr G. A. Nicholson and Professor J. G. MCLeod at the University of Sydney to conduct research into gene mapping of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. (2) Why was the level of this grant $183,365 in 1987-88. (3) What performance criteria have been applied to the work resulting from the payment of this grant. (4) What monitoring and auditing of the expenditure of this grant has been carried out by the Government. (5) To what extent were persons diagnosed as suffering from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease examined and assessed by Dr Nicholson or Professor MCLeod during or subsequent to this period. (6) What progress has been made to overcome Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. (7) Has his attention been drawn to any other research as being conducted into this disease.",102

Vic. Qld 23,230 14,846 12,571 (2) On data currently available to my Department, the average time between admission and disArrival Fee on the recommendation of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). On this basis, I approved a grant to Dr G. A. Nicholson and Professor J. G. MCLeod for the period 1987-89 for their research entitled 'Gene Mapping in CharcotMarie-Tooth Neuropathy'. (2) The funding level was $90,026.47 per annum for years 1987, 1988 and 1989 for salary for two researchers, equipment, chemicals and supplies for studying linkage of DNA probes to the CharcotMarie-Tooth (CMT) gene. (3) The performance criteria to be applied will involve the usual NHMRC review at three years. The review will be conducted during 1989 by the NHMRC Grants Interviewing Committee and overseas and Australian referees. (4) The grant is administered by the University of Sydney and will be formally acquitted by the NHMRC at termination, as required by the Commonwealth Audit Act. (5) Over 400 individuals in 30 CMT families have been assessed clinically, electrophysiologically and had blood samples prepared and held for DNA gene linkage analysis. (6) The research has proven that there are at least two genes responsible for CMT neuropathy, one of which may be located on chromosome I. Although chromosome I is the largest human chromosome, the laboratory has been successful in finding evidence suggesting a possible location for one of the gene defects. Much further work is required to locate the gene and define the molecular defect before any treatment modality can be developed. (7) No other gene mapping research is being carried out on CMT in Australia. Four to five research groups are working on CMT in the USA. Public Hospitals (Question No. 994) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 18 May 1988: (I) How many public hospital beds are available in each State and Territory.

(2) How many of these claims received benefits arising out of savings sections in the Veterans' Entitlements (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Amendment Act in relation to (a) acceptance of a disability and (b) determination of Capital Repairs and a pension. Works (I) Maintenance (2) (2) Mr Humphreys-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: $m $m (I) As at 15 May 1985 there were about 20,700 - (4) disability pension claims from veterans and 11,000 - (4) applications for increased pension remaining to be - (4) finalised by the Department. - (4) 7.2 (2) It is assumed that the question refers to sub8.0 section 7 (3) of the Veterans' Entitlements (Transi7.5 tional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) 11.0 Amendment Act 1986. 14.2 In general terms, sub-section 7 (3) provides that, 16.4 after 22 May 1986, a Repatriation determining au15.1 thority cannot assess a degree of incapacity as a percentage of the general rate less than the existing pension rate paid to the veteran, unless the actual incapacity has decreased or the previous incapacity assessment was based on a false statement or misrepresentation. The intention of the sub-section was to protect existing pension rates from reduction by application of the ""Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions"" (the Guide) which was promulgated from 22 May 1986. The sub-section applies only to the assessment of the degree of incapacity for deciding the rate of pension payable and not to the issue of acceptance or otherwise of a new condition as war-caused. From 22 May 1986 to 22 April 1988 sub-section 7 (3) has applied to the incapacity assessment in 1,756 claims and 2,767 applications for increased pension, i.e. 16% and 34% respectively of claims or applications decided by the Repatriation Commission where the Guide has been used. Figures are not available for the Veterans' Review Board or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is not possible to tell how many of these Commission decisions, where sub-section 7 (3) applied, were of claims and applications outstanding as at IS May 1985, although some of them would have been in respect of that group of claims/applications. Most of the sub-section 7 (3) decisions would have been made on claims and applications lodged after IS May 1985. War Graves and Sites (Question No. 1006) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 23 May 1988: (I) Has his attention been drawn to recent letters published in the ""Australian"" of 5 and 18 May 1988, regarding the administration of war graves and war sites at Gallipoli. (2) What guarantees are given to the Government that graves and monuments at ANZAC Cove are adequately maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. (3) What action will he take to ensure that graves and monuments are preserved. (4) What action will he take to ensure that there is suitable access to important Australian war sites at Gallipoli, notably at Lone Pine and Bolton's Ridge, where encroachment of scrub has made those areas virtually impenetrable and observation of the sites exceedingly difficult. (5) Is anything being done to rectify this situation. Mr Humphreys-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The Commonwealth War Graves Commission advised the Director of War Graves on 24 May 1988 that it is committed to the maintenance of the cemeteries and memorials on the Gallipoli Peninsula and will continue to ensure that they are so kept as to honour fully the memory of those who died there. The Commission maintains a staff of 14 Turkish gardeners and stonemasons under the supervision of one of its Commonwealth-based staff on the Peninsula and these resources are carefully matched to the work required. (3) The Australian Government will continue to contribute to the maintenance costs of the Commission. It will also continue to monitor the condition of the Australian war graves throughout the world, including Gallipoli. The Director of War Graves visited the Peninsula in September 1987 and was satisfied as to the standard of maintenance. The Director also receives regular reports from visitors to the area. (4) The area is well served by a network of all weather roads which permit access to all cemetery sites and the more important lookout points. The commission has an arrangement with the Turkish National Park Authority that trees may be felled on certain viewpoints to enable visitors to see across the old battlefields. It would be extremely difficult to provide access to all areas of the battlefield and the funds presently available to the Commission would not permit the cutting of trails through the scrub in the gullies of the area. At present, the vistas from the high ground still permit a good view across the area. (5) In accordance with its agreement, the Commission will arrange for necessary felling of trees to permit observation from selected viewpoints. My Department has an allocation of funds to maintain the war cemeteries and memorials but these would not stretch to the clearing and maintenance of tourist trails. Expenditure on the Production, Printing and Distribution of Towards a Fairer Australia (Question No. 1007) Mr Downer asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 25 May 1988: (I) What was the cost of producing, printing and distributing (a) the report entitled ""Towards a Fairer Australia: Social Justice under Labor"" and (b) its summary.

Discussions are continuing between my Department and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs on the matter of AIDS screening of migrants and refugees and the subject will be canvassed in a Green Paper to be issued later this year. (2) Refugees are required, as part of their medical examination, to have a blood test for syphilis. However, my Department does not have complete statistics on refugee movements except for the region in South-East Asia which is served by an Australian Government Medical Officer seconded by my Department to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur. The figures from this area show that of 11,083 refugees screened for syphilis between January 1983 and April 1988,291 gave positive serum reactions to syphilis. All such cases received treatment as recommended by the World Health Organisation and were rendered non-infectious before departure for Australia. In addition, all State and Territory health departments were notified of these cases so that any necessary follow up could be done on arrival in Australia. Curative treatment for gonorrhoea is given to any refugee presenting with symptoms of the while in the country of first asylum or at the time of the general medical examination governing admission to Australia.

Nursing Homes (Question No. 1031) Mr Leo MCLeay asked the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, upon notice, on 23 May 1988: (I) What measures are being taken to ensure that the Outcome Standards for Australian Nursing Homes published in the report entitled 'Living in a Nursing Home' are being achieved, including whether Standard 1.8 is being achieved. (2) Does the provision of dental care through visiting personnel and the education of nursing home staff in dental care of the elderly come within the scope of the Nursing Home Program. (3) Have any applications for funds for dental services for (a) residents of nursing homes and other forms of residential care or (b) frail and homebound elderly living in the community, been received under either the Home and Community Care Program or the Innovative Projects Program, as detailed in the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review. (4) What are the details of any of the applications for resettle- that have been supported. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Sixteen mUlti-disciplinary (in some States, joint State/Commonwealth) teams are carrying out standards monitoring on a full-time basis throughout Australia. There is at least one team operating in each State. Of the first 150 nursing homes visited, two were not meeting the oral care standard (standard \.8) and nineteen partly complied with the standard. (2) Under the new funding arrangements, each nursing home has the flexibility to employ the range and level of staff appropriate to meet the individual needs of residents. Therefore, where specific dental needs are identified, the service provider has the freedom to engage dental hygiene services to address those needs. In addition, the Government is currently funding a dental consultant to develop an oral care manual which will promote a quality dental hygiene program for residents in nursing homes and assist nursing home staff to carry out the program. (3) (a) I am not aware of any such applications for residents of nursing homes and other forms of residential care, or (b) frail and homebound elderly, living in the community, under either the Home and Community Care Program or the Special Services Program (Indisease either novative Projects Program). (4) See (a) and (b) above. Publishing Laws (Question No. 1032) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 24 May 1988: (I) Are there laws requiring books, publications, brochures and cards, which are printed outside Australia to have the name of the country in which they were printed included on them; if so, what are they and when did they come into effect. (2) Which Commonwealth or State agencies are responsible for the administration of those laws.",109
90,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The Minister for Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) I am advised that there is no Commonwealth legislation that addresses comprehensively the question of the identification, by country of origin, of books, publications, brochures and cards printed outside Australia. I draw the honourable member's attention, however, to Regulation 4 (2) of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations which, together with Item 2 of the Third Schedule to those Regulations, requires articles to which there is applied any marking in a language other than the language ordinarily used by the people of the country of origin of the article, to bear a statement in English indicating the country in which the articles were made or produced. This requirement came into effect on 14 December 1956 (although a similar requirement had been in place since 25 January 1935) and has, I am advised, been interpreted to cover publications. Hence a book in the English language printed in Japan would be required to indicate that it was printed in Japan. However, a book printed in the United States of America would not be required to indicate where it was printed. I am advised that, with the exception of South Australia, each State and Territory has legislation requiring printers in the State or Territory to print their name and address on publications which they produce. As a general rule, this legislation would not apply to printers operating outside the particular State or Territory and thus would not extend to publications printed outside Australia. The relevant legislation is: N.S.W.: Printing and Newspapers Act, 1973, s.3 Vic.: Printers and Newspapers Act, 1958, s.5 Qld.: Printing and Newspapers Act, 1981, s.6 WA.: Newspaper Libel and Registration Act, 1884, s.16 (newspapers only) Tas.: Printers and Newspapers Act, 1911, s.4 N.T.: Printers and Newspapers Act, 1984, s.4 A.C.T.: Printing and Newspapers Ordinance, 1961, s.15 (2) The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations are administered by the Australian Customs Service. The ACT Printing and Newspapers Ordinance 1961 is administered by the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The honourable member could obtain information about the administration of the State and Northern Territory legislation referred to above from the relevant State and Territory Governments. Sale of DC3 Aircraft (Question No. 1034) Mr Donald Cameron asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 24 May 1988: (I) Is the Minister able to say whether a verbal agreement was made in 1987 between Australian Airlines and Mr G. Twycross for the sale of 4 DC3 aircraft at a price of $650,000 for the aircraft and spares. (2) Did Australian Airlines or Air Queensland, the previous owners of the 4 DC3s, subsequently offer them for sale by tender. (3) Did ASICO Pty Ltd subsequently make a tender for $789,000 and did Australian Airlines accept a tender offer of approximately $650,000; if not, what was the successful tender price.  Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Australian Airlines's management have advised that they did not in 1987, or at any other time, prior to or since, have any verbal agreement whatsoever with Mr Twycross concerning the Air Queensland DC3 aircraft and spares. (2) Australian Airlines, acting on behalf of Air Queensland, offered the aircraft and spares for sale by tender in December 1987. (3) Tenders submitted to the airline are matters for the commercial judgement of Australian Airlines's management. However, I am also advised by the airline's management that the tender accepted by Australian Airlines was the highest received and was substantially higher than that of ASICO Pty Ltd's. Australians Imprisoned in Indonesia (Question No. 1045)  upon notice, on 26 May 1988: (I) Is the Government providing financial or legal support for the 3 Australian citizens who are facing charges in relation to diving activities within Indonesia's exclusive economic zone; if so, what support is being given. (2) If support is not being provided, has the Government undertaken to ensure that those Australians are receiving adequate legal assistance. (3) What legal aid has the Indonesian Government made available to those Australians.",110
91,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. None of the 3 Australian divers referred to in the honourable member's question, or anyone on their behalf, has made application to me or my Department for legal or financial assistance. (2) Once informed of the detention of the 3 Australian divers, the Australian Embassy in Jakarta adopted its standard consular practice of an Embassy official visiting the detainees with a list of law known to the Embassy. Again, as standard practice, the Embassy did not provide a recommendation but left it to the detainees to choose a legal representative. The Embassy understands that the detainees did not select a lawyer from the list of law firms provided, but chose another lawyer on the basis of other contacts in Indonesia. I understand that the Embassy has been in constant contact with the lawyer selected; reports received from the lawyer together with the court decision of 2 June 1988 when it was held that the prosecution case, at that time, had failed would suggest that adequate legal assistance is being provided to the 3 Australian detainees. (3) The Embassy in Jakarta has been informed that legal assistance is available within the Indonesian legal system; the Embassy understands that the detainees or their legal representative have not applied to the relevant Indonesian authorities for legal aid. ASEA Pty Ltd (Question No. 1046)  ing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 26 May 1988: Is the Swedish-based company ASEA Pty Ltd, which is to be involved in the electrifying of the Perth metropolitan rail system, or any of its associated companies or subsidiaries, involved in any offsets agreements with the Government; if so, what are the relevant details. Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Commonwealth does not have an offsets agreement with ASEA or with any of its associated companies or subsidiaries. I am advised that ASEA Brown Boveri, the company which won the contract for rail cars for the Perth Urban Rail Electrification project, has reached an agreement with the Western Australian Government on the provision of countertrade equivalent to 100 per cent of the value of the contract. The construction of rail cars for this contract will be undertaken largely in Queensland by Walkers/ ASEA Pty Ltd. Telecom Australia (Question No. 1048)  notice, on 26 May 1988: Why is the actual level of refund of sales tax and customs duty to Telecom expected to fall more that $50m below the $80m figure originally appropriated for 1987-88, as revealed by the Statement of Savings firms Expected in Annual Appropriations released by the Department of Finance.",111
92,Mr KEATING,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In the May Expenditure Statement 1987 I announced that from 1987-88, Telecom's exemption from sales tax and customs duty would be removed. I also announced that Telecom would be entitled to a refund of up to $ I 00 million, for any sales tax and customs duty paid in excess of $360 million in 198788. It was agreed that the refund would be paid in instalments. A first instalment of $20 million was paid in October 1987. The second and third instalments, payable in January and April 1988, related to expenditures actually incurred in the September and December quarters 1987, respectively. A final instalment, based on an audit of Telecom's accounts for the whole year by the Australian Audit Office, will be paid in December 1988. It was estimated in the 1987-88 budget that $80 million would be refunded in 1987-88 and the remaining $20 million in 1988-89. In the event, Telecom's expenditures in the September and December quarters 1987 were below expectations and as a consequence only $29,140,838 has been paid in 198788. Telecom has advised that it expects its capital expenditures in the second half of 1987-88 will be much higher than in the first half, and that it will be entitled to a refund of the balance of the $ I 00 million in December 1988. For this reason, the Government has budgeted on the basis that it will be required to refund the remaining $70,859,162 in \98889. Management Meetings and Team-Building Exercises (Question No. 1061)  notice, on 3 June 1988: (\) What weekend conferences, including management meetings and team-building exercises, and involving overnight accommodation have been conducted out of Canberra for staff of the Minister's Department for the year ending 31 May 1988. (2) When and where were the meetings held. (3) How many days were involved. (4) What was the agenda for each meeting. (5) Who attended each meeting from the Minister's Department and from outside the Minister's Department. (6) What was the total cost to the Minister's Department. (7) What were the itemised costs, including transportation, accommodation, speakers, food and drink costs.",111
93,Mr HAWKE,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) to (7) The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet did not conduct any weekend conferences out of Canberra for staff of the Department for the year ending 31 May 1988. Management Meetings and Team-Building (Question No. 1072)  Security, upon notice, on 3 June 1988: (I) What weekend conferences, including management meetings and team-building exercises, and involving overnight accommodation have been conducted out of Canberra for staff of the Minister's Department for the year ending 31 May 1988. (2) When and where were the meetings held. (3) How many days were involved. (4) What was the agenda for each meeting. (5) Who attended each meeting from the Minister's Department and from outside the Minister's Department. (6) What was the total cost to the Minister's Department. (7) What were the itemised costs, including transportation, accommodation, speakers, food and drink costs.",112
94,Mr HOWE,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) None (2) to (7) Not Applicable. Destruction of Census Form (Question No. 1078) Mr Blanchard asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 June 1988: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the concern of genealogical societies in Australia at the destruction of valuable material contained in the census form which would be of value to future generations. (2) Since several countries, including the USA, UK and New Zealand, retain census forms for research and evaluation studies for a number of years, will the Government consider the retention of census forms in future censuses, including the next census in 1991.",112
95,Mr KEATING,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (J) Yes. (2) The Australian Archives, with Australian Bureau of Statistics assistance, is currently studying the respective merits of retaining or destroying future census forms. The result of the Archives' study will be brought to the attention of the Government when it considers, in detail, 1991 Census content and procedures. Medicare Offices: Computers (Question No. 227) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 8 October 1987: Exercises (I) Are Medicare offices connected by an integrated computer system; if so, what sum did it cost to (a) purchase, (b) install and (c) train staff to operate the system. (2) Is the system compatible with STRATPLAN. (3) Is the system meeting its aims; if so, what were its aims. (4) If the system is not meeting its aims, why not. (5) What personal information is held on the system. (6) Has any personal information been disclosed from the Medicare computer; if so, (a) when did it occur, (b) from where did it occur, (c) how much information was disclosed, (d) what action was taken after the disclosure and (e) will disclosures occur in the future. Dr BleweU-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Medicare offices are connected by a single data transmission network to the central computer site in Canberra. (a) The total purchase price of all equipment operated by Medicare at 30 September 1987 was $35.9 million. (b) This cost is included in (a) and is not available separately. (c) On the job training is provided as part of installation. (2) No. (3) and (4) Yes, its aims are being met. They are essentially to (a) provide an efficient and cost-effective claims processing service and (b) to preserve the privacy of individuals' records. (5) Information which could be described as ""personal"" includes: (a) an enrolment file which lists personal identification information for enrollees, such as name, address, date of birth; card records, such as date of issue, number of cards issued, and eligibility data such as length of eligibility for visitors; (b) a claims history file which lists claim information including item numbers and payment details; and (c) a provider file which lists identification details of medical practitioners authorised to provide medical services, including their specialties and practice locations. (6) Section 130 of the Health Insurance Act provides for the secrecy of Medicare data. The same section authorises the use and release of information in certain circumstances such as by an officer in the performance of his duties; to a prescribed authority or person; where I believe it to be necessary in the public interest; or where I am of the opinion that the release has been authorised by the person concerned. I assume this question is seeking information about the possible improper release of Medicare data. There are from time to time accusations concerning the improper release of Medicare information. Each accusation is fully investigated to determine whether information has been improperly released and what action, if any, is appropriate. There are three instances in which the Commission has been able to establish that information has been improperly released. Case 1: (a) March 1984; (b) Centrepoint Branch Office, Melbourne; (c) date of birth of a person; and (d) dismissal of the employee concerned. Case 2: (a) September 1985; (b) Chatswood number 2 Branch Office; (c) name and address of a person; and (d) the officer concerned tendered his resignation and no further action was taken. Case 3: (a) Mid-1986; (b) Brisbane office; (c) name of a doctor who last treated a deceased person. Information had been requested by solicitors to finalise the deceased person's estate; and (d) the Commission was unable to determine the source of the disclosure. (e) Legislation cannot prevent the improper disclosure of information but can provide penalties (which also act as a deterrent) where it does occur. Commission staff are made fully aware of their responsibilities under the legislation and, as the above examples show, the Commission has acted to dismiss or remove staff found to have improperly disclosed information. National Prices Network (Question No. 601) Mr Burr asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 16 February 1988: (1) What status does the Government's prices task force have and under what authority was it established. (2) Is the prices task force responsible to a Minister: if so, which Minister. (3) What methodology does the prices task force use to collect information. (4) What criteria is used to collate information and draw comparison between States, regions and urban centres.",112
96,Mr HAWKE,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) In October 1986 the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party established a Prices Task Force under the chairmanship of Mr George Gear, the member for Canning, to oversee a limited operation of community-based Price Watch Committees in Labor held electorates. In March 1987 I announced the Government's intention to build upon the Labor Party's system of Price Watch Committees and involve the broader community in the surveillance of the prices of consumer items. The resulting National Prices Network currently oversees local price action groups operating throughout Australia. The price action groups are solely dependent on the volunteer efforts of community groups for the collection and collation of data at the local level. In this regard, members of consumer organisations and pensioner groups have been the most enthusiastic participants. The Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations and the Australian Pensioners' Federation, jointly co-ordinate the operation of the National Prices Network. The National Prices Network has been encouraged to pass on information on significant instances of overpricing to the Prices Surveillance Authority. (2) While the Government has provided funding to the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations and the Australian Pensioners' Federation to assist in the National Prices Network, it is an independent body and does not come under the portfolio responsibility of any Government minister. Currently, an electorate officer employed by the Minister Assisting the Treasurer for Prices, Senator Bolkus, oversees the collation and distribution of survey data. (3) The National Prices Network publishes a monthly national survey of supermarket prices, based on the total price charged for a representative basket of groceries by supermarkets across Australia. (4) The survey ranks both States and major regional centres according to the total price charged for the basket of groceries. It also details the average capital city, regional city and rural area prices of individual grocery items. Department of Transport and Communications: Public Relations (Question No. 695) Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 24 February 1988: (I) Which firms or organizations have undertaken public relations campaigns on behalf of the Minister's Department. (2) How was each firm or organization selected. (3) Were public tenders called; if not (a) why not and (b) what other procedure has been adopted for inviting firms to quote. (4) Which firms or organizations undertook research projects, and in each instance, (a) what was the cost of each project and (b) how long did it take to complete. (5) Will the Minister provide copies of the results of each survey and details of the questions asked. (6) How were firms selected for this research work. (7) Was there a public tender; if not, why not.  Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) None. (2) to (7) Not applicable. Attorney-General's Department: Payments to Overseas Legal Representatives (Question No. 623) Mr Reith asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 18 February 1988: (I) What is the approximate value in Australian dollar terms of the total of the payments made to overseas legal representatives which are outlined on pages 199 and 200 of the 1986/87 Annual Report of his Department. (2) Does the Government have a policy to give preference in instructing legal firms overseas to firms which are based in Australia; if not, why not. (3) Are there Australian law firms operating in the USA, the UK and Europe; if so, why were they not instructed in the matters referred to in the Annual Report.",113
97,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) $1,261,172.64. (2) No. Legal services to the Commonwealth of Australia are provided by the Australian Government Solicitor established under Section 55E of the Judiciary Act 1903. In any instance where a question of foreign law, custom, practice or procedure arises, if that question cannot be resolved within my Department, the Australian Government Solicitor will engage as agent as and where appropriate a foreign legal practitioner with the expertise, experience and right to practice in the foreign country concerned necessary to fulfil the instructions of the relevant client. (3) The Australian Legal Directory (1988 Edition) published by the Law Council of Australia shows that some of the major Australian law firms have representation in one or more of Singapore, New York and London. The Directory does not make it clear what the nature of the representation is, namely, agency or other collaboration with a local firm or whether the Australian law firm practices in those jurisdictions in its own name and right. Thus, it is not clear to what extent Australian law firms are ""operating"" in the USA, UK and Europe. Background Radiation Levels (Question No. 995) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 18 May 1988: (I) Will he ascertain the background radiation level (a) near the walls of the Members' Hall of the new Parliament House and (b) on the stairs of the entrance hall to the new Parliament House and indicate the results in his reply. (2) What is the background radiation level at Mururoa Atoll, as measured by Australian and New Zealand scientists.",114
98,Dr BLEWETT,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) and (b) Measurements of the background radiation level from natural sources near the walls of the Members' Hall and on the stairs of the entrance hall to the new Parliament House both showed values of 0.3 microsievert per hour. These values are within the normal variation of background levels from natural sources measured in other parts of Canberra. (2) The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation has advised that the AustralianNZ-PNG Scientific Mission to Mururoa Atoll did not directly determine the prevailing background radiation level at Mururoa. However, the Mission noted in its report that 'because of the low concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides in Mururoa soils the background radiation level to which persons employed on Mururoa are exposed is lower than for most populated areas of the world'. Retrenchment of Officers (Question No. 1016)  the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 23 May 1988: (I) Subsequent to 1 July 1987, for how many officers has the Minister's Department provided written advice of the kind specified in paragraph 6 (b) of the Australian Public Service Redeployment (Redundancy) Award 1987 to the relevant unions that those officers were redundant or potentially redundant. (2) How many officers have been invited to submit elections of retrenchment by the Secretary of the Minister's Department. (3) How many officers within or formerly within the Minister's Department have received formal advice that they are excess to capacity. (4) How many notices to excess officers required under subsection 76w (1) has the Secretary of the Minister's Department issued in the case of notices of (a) reduction in classification with consent, (b) reduction in classification without consent, ment with consent and (d) retirement without consent.

Food Irradiation (Question No. lOSS) Mr Scott asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 26 May 1988: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a study conducted at the Monash University and reported in the Age of 25 May 1988, on the effects of gamma irradiation on certain foods, including coffee. (2) Does the article say the study found that gamma irradiation, used to sterilise reactive molecules, called free radicals, to form in some foods and the Monash team concluded that a free-radical molecule that can survive the acidity of the human stomach could be a potential carcinogen. (3) Who commissioned the Monash University study. (4) Has a report been issued; if so, (a) has he read it and (b) does it show a higher degree of risk to a person if a drink made from irradiated coffee were consumed into a resting stomach which has little or no food in it. (5) If a report has not been issued, will one be publicly available when it has been compiled.",114
99,Dr BLEWETT,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) The study was not commissioned by anyone. I am advised that it was part of research work being undertaken by university staff. (4) (a) No. At this stage, I am not aware of any report being issued. However, I am informed that the work on the irradiated foods is soon to be published in 'Search', the Journal of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science.

ATT ACHMENT ""B"" Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Recruitment (Question No. 1082) Mr Spender asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 3 June 1988: (I) What changes have been made to recruiting practices for trainee diplomats joining his Department since I March 1983. (2) Have the requirements for appointment to his Department, particularly with regard to serving overseas, changed since I March 1983.",115
101,Mr HAYDEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, like its predecessor Departments for many years, has maintained a policy of updating recruitment practices in conjunction with the then Public Service Board and its successor, the Public Service Commission, so as to ensure that its annual graduate intake is of the highest attainable quality. These procedures are reviewed in detail each year to ensure that they Exercises conform with best selection practice. An important consideration has been the elimination of procedures which might result in the unintentional undervaluing of the merits of applicants from the four groups designat-d under the Public Service Reform Act (1984), that is Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, people with disabilities, people with a non-English speaking background, and women. It would not be feasible to set out in detail the incremental procedural changes which have been introduced since 1 March 1983. I can assure the honourable member, however, that, as I said in a statement on 25 May 1987, selection will continue to be based on merit. (2) Requirements for appointment to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its predecessor Department have maintained conformity with those which apply to all Departments of the Australian Public Service. In relation to overseas service, the integration from different Departments of officers with diverse career expectations has made it necessary to modify the requirement that officers be willing to serve overseas as directed. It is now required that officers be willing in principle to serve overseas at a mutually convenient time. I consider that this will meet my Department's need to have well-qualified officers both overseas and in Australia. Non-Government Colleges (Question No. 755)",116
102,Mr RUDDOCK,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 25 February 1988: (I) How many non-Government colleges receive assistance as non-profit organisations in the form of Austudy allowances to students. (2) Are there conditions of eligibility for funding support which require use of up-to-date equipment and appropriate teaching standards. (3) How many non-profit organisations have been refused continuing support for failure to meet these criteria. (4) Does his Department also administer Traineeship Programs which use private providers. (5) Are there conditions of eligibility relating to the use of up-to-date equipment and appropriate teaching standards for determining which private providers will be utilised in this Scheme. (6) Are the same criteria applied to evaluate both schemes administered by his Department. (7) Have any non-profit organisations receiving support from his Department been refused registration as private providers under the Traineeship Scheme. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) AUSTUDY benefits are available to students undertaking approved courses of study (i.e. courses which attract Government funding). Five non-Government teachers' colleges and fifty-five non-Government business colleges attract funding under the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1987, or in the case of the teacher's college in the ACT, in line with that Act. In addition one agricultural college (Marcus Oldham Farm Management College) receives Government support through departmental appropriations and as a consequence eligible students attending it receive AUSTUDY benefits. (2) The Commonwealth recognises that higher education institutions, including certain non-Government teachers' colleges, need to purchase equipment in order to provide for growth in enrolments and new academic developments, to replace worn out or obsolete items, and to keep abreast of technological progress. It provides grants of financial assistance specifically for such purchases in response to expenditure proposals by institutions. It is a condition of the provision of equipment grants that the sums concerned be fully expended in respect of each calendar year in which they are made available. Assistance for approved courses of teacher education in certain non-Government teachers' colleges and the advanced Diploma in Farm Management course at the Marcus Oldham College is made on the condition that the courses concerned are taught at an appropriate standard in that they meet the various requirements of the approval process, including currency of accreditation. In assessing eligibility of non-Government business college courses for assistance under Section 25 of the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1987 the quality of facilities and the standards of the course are taken into account. (3) None. (4) T AFE is the major provider of off-the-job training, but off-the-job training may also be provided in other approved training centres, including employers' premises. Private (i.e. non-TAFE) training providers have to be approved by the relevant State Training Authority. State Training Authorities are responsible for approving training arrangements in the States and Territories and for monitoring the quality of training provided, including ensuring that private training providers have the capacity to provide adequate training. The (Australian Traineeship System) ATS is administered and funded by Commonwealth and State/ Territory Governments. Commonwealth outlays include payment to employers of $1000 per trainee, with an additional $1000 for each disadvantaged employee, and payment of training fees to off-the-job training providers. State and Territory Governments make available to trainees accommodation allowances and travel subsidies to attend off-the-job training. In most cases, they also provide payroll and workers' compensation concessions to employers of trainees. (5) Under the approved Commonwealth/State Territory Agreements for the operation of Traineeships the endorsement of training arrangements and the monitoring of traineeship delivery arrangements is a State/Territory Government responsibility. The assessment of non-Government business colleges in receipt of grants under the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1987 is undertaken in the State Offices of my Department and by an advisory committee appointed by me. (6) No. It would be inappropriate to apply same criteria to both schemes because their purposes are different. Courses funded under the Non-Government Business Colleges Scheme concentrate on shorthand typing and are full-time pre-employment courses. The Australian Traineeship System is a new cational training system which provides a combinatorian tion of onand off-the-job training for young people entering the workforce. Its aim is to achieve longthe term fundamental improvements in training arrangeowner ments for young people in non-trades employment, thereby improving both the long-term employment prospects of young people and the national skill base. (7) Yes. In a small number of cases, non-Government business colleges in receipt of assistance under Section 25 of the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1987 have been assessed as not meeting the requirements for the Australian Trainproved eeship System. Western Australian Aboriginal Legal (Question No. 835)",117
103,Mr MCARTHUR,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 23 March 1988: (1) Does the West Australian Aboriginal Legal Service receive Federal Government funding if so, what sum does it receive each year? (2) How is the sum calculated? (3) How is the funding provided? (4) Were Federal funds used for the purchase of three fully equipped caravans from a firm of Victorian caravan makers? (5) Did the Western Australian Aboriginal Legal Service subsequently sell these caravans? (6) How were the funds from the sale deployed? (7) What was the reason for the Western Australian Aboriginal Legal Service cancelling a further order for two caravans? Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes, the West Austnilian Aboriginal Legal Service (WAALS) receives Federal Government funding. The Federal Government is providing a total of $2,241,700 to the WAALS in 1987/88. (2) This sum is calculated on the basis of annual financial budgets detailing the recurrent and capital costs of operating the WAALS. (3) Funding is provided through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs as a Grant for Aboriginal Advancement. (4) Yes. Aboriginal Organisation Training (AOT) funds were provided in 1986/87 to purchase three caravans as part of a T AFE mobile instructor project to train Aboriginal supervisors, on site in CDEP the communities. The caravans were to provide mobile accommodation for instructors to move from one community to another to carry out the training. T AFE Aboriginal Access negotiated construction and and purchase of the three caravans with a WA caravan firm known as Luxury Caravans. Luxury voCaravans arranged the construction through a Vicbased caravan builder, Condor Caravans. Although T AFE Aboriginal Access were to use vans as part of the mobile project, the legal of the vans was the Aboriginal Legal Service. This arrangement would ensure that at the end of 'the project the caravans would be owned by an Aboriginal organisation for training purposes. (5) Yes. On initial inspection the caravans appeared satisfactory, delivery was taken and final payments made. However, in towing from Perth to the Kimberleys where they were to be used, the caravans to be totally unserviceable for remote, rugged conditions and faulty workmanship became evident. The vans could not be used in remote Aboriginal Service communities, requiring towing over rugged roads, because of their flimsy and poor construction. The ALS, in conjunction with T AFE Aboriginal Access and DAA decided to sell the vans, in situ in Broome, to prevent deterioration during the Wet season. (6) The funds from the sale are currently held by the ALS. They, in conjunction with TAFE Aboriginal Access and DAA are currently negotiating with other caravan makers in WA to construct two more caravans specially designed for outback conditions. The funds from the sale will be used to purchase the new caravans. (7) Once advised by TAFE Aboriginal Access that the caravans showed poor workmanship and were totally unsatisfactory for use in rugged outback conditions the ALS immediately cancelled orders for further caravans from Luxury Caravans. The caravans ordered were to be used for a similar purpose to the original one purchased. The ALS is currently negotiating with Condor Caravans over this matter. Domestic Terminals at Sydney Airport (Question No. 862) Mr Moore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 13 April 1988: Further to the written assurance given to me by the Minister for Aviation on 7 July 1987 concerning the introduction of baggage trolleys at domestic terminals in Sydney, (a) when will some form of luggage transport become available and (b) what is the reason for the delay.  Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The domestic terminals at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport are operated by Ansett and Australian Airlines, and the respective airlines are responsible for the provision of baggage transport. The airlines were given approval last year to introduce baggage trolleys at the domestic terminals. Ansett and Australian Airlines have advised that contracts have been let for the provision of baggage trolleys, and that full installation will be completed shortly. Delay in introduction of the trolleys was due to the supplier's inability to meet the demand at various airports. United Nations Bodies: Contributions (Question No. 867) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 13 April 1988. (1) What (a) has been the level of funding in each year since 1985 and (b) level of funding is budgetted for 1989 for (i) each of the UN Commissions on Social Development, Narcotic Drugs and Status of Women and (ii) the UN Committee on Crime Prevention and Control. (2) What are the functions of these bodies. (3) What has Australia's contribution been for each of these bodies in each year since 1985 and what is the budgetted level of contribution for 1989. (4) Does the Government support increased funding for each of these UN Commissions and the Committee. (5) What action is Australia taking to support increased funding for them by other countries. (6) Is he able to say which countries are proposing reduced funding and how do they justify such a destructive stance.",118
104,Mr HAYDEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) UN. Commission on Social Development 1984-85 biennium 74,100 US. dollars 1986-87 biennium 78,000 US. dollars 1988-89 biennium 79,700 US. dollars UN.

Conference costs are absorbed in the United Nations regular budget. (2) The functions of these bodies are described in the United Nations Handbook published annually by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A copy is available in the Parliamentary Library. (3) The bodies are funded from the United Nations regular budget. Australia's assessed contribution to the regular budget is 1.66%. (4) and (5) The Government believes that adequate resources should be provided to UN bodies . dealing with the priority areas of drug control, women and crime prevention and control. At the same time, in pursuit of greater restraint and rigour in the financial programs of international organisations, the Government has advocated zero real growth in the budgets of UN bodies, with maximum absorption of the costs of inflation and currency depreciation. The Government looks to the UN itself to redeploy resources, where necessary, from low priority areas, in order to ensure that higher priority areas are properly serviced. (6) Several other members of the United Nations also support budgetary restraint and efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations and its agencies. The Government does not consider that such concerns impair the effectiveness of high priority UN activities. International Atomic Energy Agency: Membership (Question No. 873) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 13 April 1988: (1) Which countries are members of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). (2) Are there any countries who are not members of the IAEA which the Government considers could endanger the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes; if so, (a) what are these countries and (b) what action is being taken to have them become members of the IAEA. Mr Hayden - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The 113 member States of the IAEA are as follows: Afghanistan Albania Algeria Argentina Australia Austria Bangladesh Belgium Bolivia Brazil Bulgaria Burma Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic Cameroon Canada Chile China Colombia Costa Rica Cote d'Ivoire Cuba Cyprus Czechoslovakia Democratic Kampuchea Democratic People's Republic of Korea Denmark Dominican Republic Ecuador Egypt El Salvador Ethiopia Finland France Gabon German Democratic Republic Germany, Federal Republic of Ghana Greece Guatemala Haiti Holy See Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran, Islamic Republic of Iraq Ireland Israel Italy Jamaica Japan Jordan Kenya Korea, Republic of Kuwait Lebanon Liberia Libyan Arab Jamahiriya Liechtenstein Luxembourg Madagascar Malaysia Mali Mauritius Mexico Monaco Mongolia Morocco Namibia Netherlands New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria Norway Pakistan Panama Paraguay Peru Philippines Poland Portugal Qatar Romania Saudi Arabia Senegal Sierra Leone Singapore South Africa Spain Sri Lanka Sudan Sweden Switzerland Syrian Arab Republic Thailand Tunisia Turkey Uganda Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic Union of Soviet Socialist Republics United Arab Emirates United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland United Republic of Tanzania United States of America Uruguay Venezuela Viet Nam Yugoslavia Zaire Zambia Zimbabwe (2) The IAEA's membership includes all countries with nuclear energy programs. It does not include the Chinese province of Taiwan where there is a nuclear energy program safeguarded by the IAEA. However membership of the IAEA itself does not preclude countries from developing or utilising nuclear technology for military purposes. Australia has therefore long urged all non-nuclear weapon states to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the membership of which now stands at 137. African States (Question No. 905) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 20 April 1988: (1) How long have (a) Madagascar, (b) Rwanda and (c) Uganda been recognised as national states. (2) What is the (a) population and (b) average per-capita income of each of those states. (3) Is he able to say (a) who is the recognised leader of each of those states and (b) (i) how and (ii) when he or she attained that position. (4) Does the leader of each of those states head a political party; if so, what party. (5) Are opposition parties allowed in each of those states; if so, (a) how many democratic elections have been held and (b) when was the last democratic election held. (6) If opposition parties are allowed, (a) how many political parties are there and (b) what are their names. (7) How many distinct tribal or similar groups are there in each of those states. (8) What is the largest tribal or similar group and to which group does the leader belong.",119
105,Mr HAYDEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not have the resources to provide a response to this Question. The honourable Member could perhaps draw on the resources of the parliamentary library to assist him in this matter. Secondary Education (Question No. 907) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 21 April 1988: (I) Is he able to say how many Year 12 secondary school students are studying (a) science and (b) languages in 1988. (2) Is he able to say how many students in Year 12 were studying (a) science and (b) languages (i) 10 and (ii) 20 years ago. (3) What is the comparison, in percentage terms, of the number of students studying science and languages in 1988, 1978 and 1968. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Information is not uniformly collected in the various school systems in the precise form sought. Data is not readily identifiable, for example, in respect of mature age students studying these subjects, nor on those students studying in institutions outside the ambit of the examining or accrediting boards, as for example, those students in Victoria in Tertiary Orientation Programs or in Technical Year 12 courses. It should also be noted that many students study more than one science or language so that these figures should not be taken to indicate the proportion of the cohort studying sciences or languages. (I) At this time, student numbers for 1988 are not available from the various systems. However, 1987 enrolments were as follows: (a) Sciences-147,078 (b) Languages21,091 (2) (a) Sciences (i) 105,982 (b) Languages (i) 14,387 (ii) Not Available (3) The following figures indicate the percentage change in the number of students studying sciences and languages between 1978 and 1987. Figures in parentheses indicate the comparative percentage increase in total Year 12 enrolments over this period. Subject Percent Change Sciences (1978-1987). +36.2% +57.5% Languages (1978-1987) +43.7% +(57.5%) Bicentenary and Aboriginals: Overseas Media Coverage (Question No. 925) Mr Miles asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 21 April 1988: (1) Has the Government received reports from any Australian missions overseas concerning overseas media coverage of Australia's Bicentenary since July 1987. (2) How many reports referred to the coverage of Aboriginal issues. (3) What did each report covering Aboriginal issues state. (4) Is the Government taking any steps to minimise damage to Australia's international standing in the light of coverage of Aboriginal issues abroad.",121
106,Mr DUFFY,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The records of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reveal a total of 44 reports referring to overseas media coverage of Aboriginal issues in the context of the Bicentenary. (3) The coverage referred to in the reports included some criticisms of Australia over the treatment of Aboriginals, balanced in most cases by recognition of the government's efforts to correct these problems. (4) The positive and far-reaching programs put in place by the government to benefit Aboriginal and Islander Australians have in themselves done much to minimise potential damage to Australia's international standing. In addition, liaison officers have been nominated in each Australian overseas mission to act as contact points and sources of up-to-date, factual material for media enquiries on Aboriginal issues. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provides regular briefing for the liaison officers. African States (Question No. 938) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 21 April (ii) Not Available 1988: (I) How long have (a) Burundi, (b) Kenya and (c) Somalia been recognised as national states.

Antarctic Treaty: South Africa (Question No. 969) Mr Scott asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 17 May 1988: (I) Is South Africa a signatory to various Antarctic Treaties and protocols; if so, to what specific treaties and protocols is it a signatory and when were they signed. (2) Is or was Marion Island a South African Antarctic Research Station. (3) Is he able to say whether any military or nuclear activities have been carried out in the vicinity of Marion Island which may be in breach of South Africa's Antarctic Treaty obligations. (4) What right of inspection does Australia or other Antarctic Treaty signatories have to inspect Marion Island.",123
112,Mr HAYDEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) South Africa was an original signatory of the Antarctic Treaty which it ratified in 1960. It is also a signatory to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972) and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) (1980). In June this year South Africa also signed the Final Act of the Antarctic Minerals Convention. (2) South Africa has operated a scientific research station on Marion Island since 1948. The station is supported under the South African National Antarctic Research program. (3) The Government has no evidence that South Africa has carried out or plans to carry out any nuclear or military activities on or near Marion Island. While the Antarctic Treaty does contain provisions prohibiting nuclear explosions, weapons testing and other military activities, Marion Island (which lies north of latitude 60 degrees South) is in fact outside the area covered by the Treaty. Marion Island does lie within the CCAMLR area, but that Convention contains no provisions of its own regarding nuclear and military activities. If South Africa were to engage in such activities on Marion Island, it would therefore technically not be in breach of its obligations under the Treaty or under CCAMLR. (4) Because Marion Island lies outside the area covered by the Antarctic Treaty, neither Australia nor any other Antarctic Treaty Party has a right to inspect South Africa's activities there.

The honourable member could perhaps draw on the resources of the Parliamentary Library to assist him in this matter.

(Question No. 990) Mr Moore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 18 May 1988: (I) Is there a requirement for matches, either locally made or imported, to be treated with fire retardant. (2) Is there a minimum splint strength requirement for matches sold in Australia. (3) How do Australia's minimum requirements with regard to the standards referred to in parts (I) and (2) compare with world standards. (4) Where do matches rate in the list of products hazardous to children as a cause of accidents resulting in death or injury. (5) What percentage of the matches sold in Australia are imported and are they made to a different minimum standard than those which are locally produced.",124
114,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The Minister for Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) There are currently no Australian requirements for matches, either locally made or imported, to be treated with fire retardant. (2) There is currently no Australian splint strength requirement for matches sold in Australia. (3) As previously mentioned, there are currently no Australian minimum requirements with regard to the standards referred to in parts (I) and (2) and therefore there is no basis for comparison with world standards. (4) According to the National Injury Surveillance Prevention Project (NISPP) data base, there have been 18 recorded accidents involving matches causing injury to children since late 1986. This comprises approximately 0.04% of the total number of injuries that NISPP has on its data base. However, it is not possible at this stage to pinpoint the percentage in relation to products which are hazardous to children. (5) The two major official sources of information regarding the quantity of matches imported into Australia each year are the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Australian Customs Service (ACS). The ACS will not release any information at all in relation to quantities of imported matches, on the grounds of confidentiality, and the ABS will not release information relating to the quantity of matches manufactured each year in Australia, for the same reason. The major portion of matches imported into Australia come from 8 countries (Sweden, Taiwan, Indonesia, Japan, USSR, Korea, Czechoslovakia, and Hong Kong), with negligible amounts being obtained from other countries. Neither Sweden nor Taiwan have standards relating to the safe operation of Matches matches. Information has been sought from the other countries and will be provided as soon as it is available.

Student Numbers (Question No. 993) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 18 May 1988: Are there figures available for the number of students in various faculties at Australian universities who attended (a) government schools, (b) Catholic schools and (c) other private schools; if so, what are they. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Data on the type of school last attended by higher education students are not collected in the Commonwealth's annual collection of higher education student statistics. Thus, there are no comprehensive data available on this subject. However, there are a number of other sources which provide some partial informationThe 1984 survey of full-time tertiary student finances, conducted by the then Commonwealth Department of Education, revealed that of the higher education students surveyed, 60% had last attended a government school, 20% a Catholic school and 19% other non-government schools. In the same year, some 64% of Year 12 students were attending government schools, 22% Catholic schools and 14% other non-government schools. A longitudinal survey conducted by the Australian Council for Educational Research traced the educational and labour force experience of a national sample of young people from the age of 14 (in 1975) to age 21 (in 1982). This study found that, by 1982, only 15% of persons who had attended government schools had participated in higher education, compared with 23% of students from Catholic schools and 55% of students from other private schools. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey report ""Transition from Education to Work, Australia"", May 1987, shows that of those persons aged 15-24 who had attended school in 1986 and were attending a higher education institution in 1987, some 58% came from government schools and 42% from non-government schools. The Discipline Assessments of Law and Engineering conducted in 1986 and 1987-88 provide some information (based on survey data) on students in those particular fields of study: 41 % of law students surveyed had last attended government schools, 23% Catholic schools and 32% other non-government schools; (the balance of 4% is not explained but is assumed to be due to non-response) 61 % of engineering students surveyed had last attended government schools, 21 % Catholic schools and 18% other non-government schools. (These percentages exclude overseas students.) African States (Question No. 1003) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 19 May 1988: (I) How long have (a) Guinea-Bissau, (b) Mali and (c) Senegal been recognised as national states.

(2) and (3) All of the issues matters that are discussed on a continuing basis between Ministers and Departmental Heads. It is not possible to rehearse those discussions here. Income Tax Assessment Act (Question No, 82) Mr Hawker asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 September 1987: (I) How many pages were there in the Income Tax Assessment Act, incorporating all amendments, up to (a) 5 March 1983 and (b) II July 1987. (2) What was the retail price of the Act on (a) 5 March 1983 and (b) II July 1987.",127
120,Mr KEATING,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) & (2) A check of the records at the Australian Government Publishing Service reveals that at 5 March 1983 the Income Tax Assessment Act contained 1184 pages and the retail price was $21.00. At II July 1987 the Act contained 1795 pages and the price was $50.00. Public Opinion Polls (Question No. 388) Mr Downer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 5 November 1987: (I) What was the total sum spent by the Minister's entire portfolio on public opinion polls in the period covered by the 1986/87 Budget. (2) What was the objective of each of the opinion polls and what did each cost. (3) Who was commissioned to undertake each opinion poll. (4) Are the results of each opinion poll publicly available.  Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The majority of the Portfolio's authorities are business enterprises utilising such polls, by way of market research, as part of their normal commercial activities. The release of the requested information in regard to authorities other than the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) could compromise their commercial position and so the information provided below refers only to polls conducted by the Department and by the ABC, SBS and ABT. (I) The total sum commissioned in the 1986/87 financial year on surveys, studies and opinion polls by the three departments which now make up Transport and Communications was $213,234. The total sum spent on audience surveys and opinion polls in 1986/87 by the ABC, SBS and ABT raised are, naturally, was $191,950. (2) & (3) The following projects were conducted over the specified period: (i) The Department of Communications spent $60,000 in the 1986/87 financial year on a major information study conducted by Data Sciences Pty Ltd. The objective of the study was to enable the Department to best utilise its resources for publicity activities associated with the introduction of UHF television in regional Australia. Information for this study was gained via questionnaires. (ii) In May 1987 the Department of Aviation conducted a poll to determine the profile of passengers and visitors using the Canberra air terminal, as part of the development of the Canberra Airport Master Plan. The cost of the poll was $8,214. (iii) The Department of Transport commissioned several studies in the 1986/87 financial year (a) Spectrum Research was commissioned to market test a proposed community service announcement directed at the aged community, concerning pedestrian safety, at a cost of $2,800. (b) Reark Research was commissioned to conduct a community attitude survey on road safety at a cost of $17,000. (c) Roy Morgan Research Centre was commissioned to undertake an omnibus survey designed to measure long term trends in community attitudes and behaviour in relation to drink driving at a cost of $3,900. (d) Reark Research was commissioned to conduct a community attitude survey on road safety enforcement at a cost of $5,100. (e) Research International Australia was commissioned to assess the response for the target audience to the ""Road Worrier"" video, concerned with over-confidence in young drivers, at a cost of $25,300. (f) AXIA: Social and Marketing Research was commissioned to assess the impact of the ""Out and About"" materials, a road safety program for pre-schools and primary schools, at a cost of $36,500. (g) Roger James and Associates were commissioned to establish the effectiveness of the distribution of ""A Simple Guide to Child Restraint Usage"" booklet at a cost of $8,700. (h) AXIA: Social and Marketing Research was commissioned to evaluate the proposed approach for a road safety film at a cost of $6,120. (i) AXIA: Social and Marketing Research was commissioned to assess the response of young people to the ""Big Gig"" video, directed at young drivers; attitudes to drinking and driving, at a cost of $4,200. (j) Peter Steidl and Associates were commissioned to gauge the effectiveness of the ""Right Rider"" video, concerned with motor cycle safety, at a cost of $8,100. (iv) The former Bureau of Transport Economics (BTE) conducted surveys of bus and rail passengers over Sydney-Canberra and SydneyNorth Coast NSW, as part of an Intrastate Bus Service (Trial Entry Liberalisation) study undertaken by the NSW Department of Motor Transport (DMT). The cost of the surveys is estimated at $27,300. (v) ABC: The objective of the opinion polls conducted by the ABC's Television Audience Research section was to measure the audience for ABC Television in areas where regular ratings are not available. A survey covering rural Australia had the additional purpose of measuring audience attitudes to the service provided by ABC Television. Polls carried out by the ABC Television News and Current Affairs sought comment on specific issues with the intention of being used as program material. Tasmanian Opinion Poll Research, MCGregor Darwin Omnibus Survey and Newspoll were commissioned to undertake the opinion polls. (vi) SBS: The objectives of opinion polls and ratings surveys conducted on behalf of the SBS were to gauge audience viewing and reaction as well as consumer needs and attitudes. Audience surveys were undertaken by MCNair Anderson and Frank Small and Associates. (vii) ABT: The objective of opinion polls commissioned by the ABT was to discover public opinion on the amount of advertising on commercial television. Reark Research was commissioned to undertake an opinion poll. The cost of individual surveys in (v), (vi) and (vii) above is agreed between parties and is considered Commercial-in-Confidence. (4) The results from studies conducted for the Department are not available from the consultants concerned, but can be made available on request from the Department. The results of the surveys conducted by the BTE for the NSW DMT are detailed in the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics Occasional Paper 85, titled 'Intrastate Bus Services in New South Wales: Trial Entry Liberalisation'. The results of each opinion poll undertaken on behalf of the ABC are not publicly available; like ratings surveys, they are used to schedule television programs in a highly competitive market. For the SBS, the results of the Frank Small and Associates surveys are available only at the discretion of the Service, while the results of the MCNair Anderson surveys are not publicly available. The results of the Reark Research opinion polls, undertaken on behalf of the ABT are publicly available. Safety of Flights over Mozambique (Question No. 543) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 9 December 1987: (I) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an incident on 6 November 1987 when an Air Malawi Skyvan civilian aircraft carrying 6 Malawians, 3 British citizens and I South African was shot down by Mozambiquan Government forces in the Tete province of Mozambique, killing all on board. (2) Since this aircraft was following a normal commercial route used by scheduled Air Malawi flights, and as Qantas must fly across Mozambique air space on its flights to Harare in Zimbabwe, what steps has the Minister taken to guarantee the safety of Qantas flights and its Australian passengers who must fly this route.  Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (\) Yes. (2) I have been advised that Qantas officers sought specific advice from Australian Government officials on the incident and on the capability of the arms alleged to have downed the Air Malawi aircraft. After discussions with these officers, and examination of safeguards already in place, Qantas management were satisfied that its operation to Harare were not at risk. (Question No. 602) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 17 February 1988: (I) What are the arrangements for overseas visitors who have a valid work permit to pay the Medicare levy. (2) Are these persons able to receive full health care under the Medicare system on payment of this levy, or is there a qualifying period. (3) What arrangements apply in respect of any qualifying period to persons who have migrated here and have a valid resident's permit. (4) Does a person's liability to contribute to the Medicare system by way of paying the levy equate to that person's usage of Medicare services and benefits. Dr BleweU-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Commissioner for Taxation has advised me that there are no specific arrangements for overseas visitors who have a valid work permit to pay the Medicare levy. A person visiting Australia for a short period whose usual place of abode is outside Australia and who does not intend to take up residence in Australia is treated as a non-resident for income tax purposes. In these circumstances, the visitor is not liable for the Medicare levy and generally is not eligible for Medicare cover. However, where a person comes to Australia for an extended period with the intention of residing here, in the ordinary course of events, he or she is considered a resident of Australia and liable for the Medicare levy. Where the visitor's approved length of stay is more than six months or the visitor is a foreign student undertaking a course of study in Australia, the visitor is eligible for Medicare benefits in respect of services, treatment and care covered by the Medicare scheme. Whether the visitor is liable for the Medicare levy, however, turns primarily on whether he or she is a resident of Australia. The entitlement to Medicare benefits does not establish liability to the levy. (2) and (3) Overseas visitors who are permitted by law to remain in Australia for more than six months, are eligible for Medicare benefits and free treatment in public hospitals from the date of arrival in Australia. Medicare eligibility for such long term visitors is thus based on duration and not purpose of visits. There is no qualifying period for such eligibility nor is eligibility dependent on payment of the levy although it should be added that most of these visitors would be in employment and therefore liable for payment of Australian taxes and the Medicare levy. Short term visitors who are entitled to remain in Australia for six months or less, and these represent by far the greater proportion of overseas visitors to Australia, are not generally eligible for Medicare benefits or free hospital treatment, unless they come Medicare from countries with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement (currently the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Malta). (4) An Australian resident's liability for the Medicare levy is not generally related to the extent to which a person has access to benefits under the scheme. Medicare is a universal scheme and liability to pay the levy is based solely on an individual's capacity to pay, as measured by his/her taxable income. As such, it is a progressive health insurance scheme, and an important component of the social wage. This is in marked contrast to flat rate insurance, which, because it ignores the income of the family or individual, is regressive. Income Tax (Question No. 619) Mr Hunt asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 February 1988: (I) Is an Australian citizen working in the UK required to pay income tax under both British and Australian law? (2) Does this also apply to a British citizen working in Australia?",127
121,Mr KEATING,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (\) and (2) Under the terms of the Australia/ UK comprehensive taxation agreement for the avoidance of double taxation, each country may tax salary or wages and other remuneration for personal services performed in that country by a person who is a resident (and not necessarily a citizen) of the other country. This general principle is subject to special rules, also contained in the taxation agreement, for short visits by employees, for professors and teachers, and for entertainers and athletes. In the case of a resident of Australia working in the UK, double taxation relief would generally be provided by Australia by way of exemption from Australian tax of income that is taxed by the UK or by allowance of a credit for the UK tax against the Australian tax payable in respect of the income. Where, in accordance with the taxation agreement Australian taxes salary or wages and other remuneration for personal services performed here, the UK is required under the agreement to grant credit against the UK tax payable, if any, for the tax paid in Australia. Electoral Enrolments (Question No. 744) Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 24 February 1988: (I) Does a dual electoral roll agreement exist between the Commonwealth and the NSW Government; if so, what are the obligations of the Commonwealth under this agreement. (2) Will the Commonwealth be providing the NSW Government with rolls for the March 1988 State election; if so, (a) what is the closing date for the enrolment details that the Commonwealth will be supplying, (b) in what form will this information be provided, (c) will it include provisional enrollees and itinerant enrolments. (3) What procedures and checks has the Commonwealth undertaken since the 1987 general election to ensure the accuracy, completeness and validity of the information provided to the NSW Government. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Under the Joint Rolls Arrangement with New South Wales the Commonwealth is responsible for the preparation, alteration, revision and maintenance of Joint Electoral Rolls. These tasks are done through the updating of a computer file which contains the names of all persons enrolled for either Commonwealth or State purposes; the names of persons enrolled for Commonwealth but not State purposes, or vice versa, are specifically flagged on the file. (2) For the March 1988 State election, the State Electoral Office was provided by the Australian Electoral Commission with magnetic tape copies of the computer file referred to in (I), from which ""Commonwealth only"" electors had been deleted. The roll close date as of which the copy of the file was taken was 25 February 1988. Itinerant and provisional enrollees were included in the copy of the file. Steps were subsequently taken by the State Electoral Office to exclude from the printed certified lists provisional enrollees who had not reached the age of 18. Itinerant provisional enrollees were entitied to vote at the State election pursuant to section 5 of the State Parliamentary Electorates and Elections (Amendment) Act 1987. (3) Since the 1987 general election the Australian Electoral Commission has undertaken objection action to remove names from the roll following non-voter follow-up and normal changes to rolls resulting from receipt of electoral enrolment forms, notifications received by Divisional Returning Officers pursuant to section 102 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 of transfers of electors to another State, notices received pursuant to section 108 of the Act of deaths of electors, and advice from electors regarding changes in relevant particulars. Since the roll is a joint one, these alterations automatically apply for State as well as Commonwealth purposes, without any explicit exchange of information between the Commonwealth and the State. Companies: Taxation (Question No. 787) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 March 1988: Is he able to say whether the tax paid as a percentage of pre-tax profits for certain companies is as follows: (a) Adelaide Steamship, 0.18; (b) Equiticorp Tasman, 0.71; (c) Overseas Strategic Investment, 4.04; (d) IEL, 4.08; (e) Westfield Capital Corporation, 4.24; (f) Northern Star, 4.40; (g) linter, 4.43; (h) Southern Farmers, 5.60; (i) Ariadne, 8.16; (j) AFP, 8.75; (k) Bond Corporation, 8.95; (I) Kern Corporation, 9.17; (m) Bell Group, 10.46; (n) Elders IXL, 10.48; (0) Hooker, 11.56; and (p) News, 12.22; if so, what are the major reasons for these low average tax rates.",129
122,Mr KEATING,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The taxation affairs of particular taxpayers are strictly a matter for the Commissioner of Taxation and the taxpayers concerned. It is therefore not possible for me to comment on the particular taxation circumstances of the companies listed in the question. There are, however, some observations that can be made on issues relevant to average tax payments by companies generally. The percentages quoted from the annual reports of companies usually reflect tax expense, rather than actual tax payments. This distinction is important as tax expense for reporting purposes is calculated in accordance with accounting standards, and may vary from the tax assessed on taxable income measured under the income tax law. Average tax rates based on a reported measure of income tax expense do not necessarily reflect the current tax position of a company; tax expense does not, for example, reflect the actual amount of tax paid in a given year because it is not adjusted for items which alter the timing of tax payments from year to year. A notable item here is 5/3 depreciation, which accelerates depreciation deductions for tax purposes relative to those provided for in the accounts, and so provides a deferral of taxation. Tax payments in any particular year may therefore be higher or lower than reported tax expense, depending on the particular circumstances of each case. A major factor reducing the average tax rates of particular companies below the company tax rate is the intercorporate dividend rebate, which effectively frees from tax dividends received by one company from another. This rebate prevents company income, which may have already been taxed in the hands of the company in which it originated, being taxed over and again as it passes from one company to another before being paid to its ultimate recipients. The rebate can, therefore, give rise to reductions in the measured tax rate of any selection of companies, particularly those receiving large amounts of dividend income, without implying any overall shortfall of company tax. Many other factors may also influence the ratio of tax to reported profit, including the nature and scale of capital gains, the jurisdiction of the source of the income, the use of tax concessions, and the extent of non-deductible expenses. Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme (Question No. 819) Mr Sharp asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 17 March 1988: (I) Will the Minister indicate whether all applications in the Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme were handled strictly in chronological order of their receipt and processed and completed by the department in this order. (2) If the Minister cannot provide an answer to part (I) above could he (a) provide a list of any departures from such a method of considering applications and (b) identify the reason for such departures.  Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme applications were handled strictly in chronological order of their receipt and processed by the Department in that order except when an application was in an un processable state. If the processing of the applicaseas tions could not be finalised, for example if further information was required, processing of the application ceased until the problem was overcome. Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme (Question No. 820) Mr Sharp asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 17 March 1988: (I) What is the 'face value' of applications lodged by Australian National Railways (ANR) under the Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme. (2) What is the (a) level of expenditure proposed by ANR which was approved under the scheme and (b) nature of its marketing activities. (3) Have any surveys of the effectiveness of ANR marketing activities ever been conducted; if so, what were the results.  Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Australian National Railways was not a claimant under TOPS. However, Railways of Australia was a claimant. See the answer provided to question 821. (2) See Part I above. (3) No surveys of the Australian National Railways Commission's marketing activities have been conducted by my Department. Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme (Question No. 821) Mr Sharp asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 17 March 1988: (I) What Government owned or controlled companies or agencies have sought funds under the now defunct Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme. (2) How much funding was (a) applied for and (b) approved. (3) Can the Minister advise whether these funds were additional funds gained by these companies or agencies beyond normal Government funding sources.  Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) & (2) The Guidelines for the Tourism OverPromotions Scheme (TOPS) made it clear that applicants under the scheme would not be publicly identified, but did envisage that details of payment would be published. Government owned or controlled companies which received TOPS funds were QH Tours, $196,248 for promotional activity in 1985-86 and Railways of Australia, $97,790 for promotional activity in 198687. (3) They were additional funds. Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme (Question No. 822) Mr Sharp asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 17 March 1988: (1) Will the Minister indicate the (a) value of applications, (b) value of approvals and (c) Government's Budget for the Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme (TOPS) in (i) 1985-86, (ii) 1986-87 and (iii) 1987-88. (2) Was the Minister aware of the exact extent of the unanticipated value of applications under this scheme. (3) What action has been taken by the Government in its incentive scheme where the number and value of applications meeting scheme guidelines have been more than anticipated in the budget. (4) Will the Minister provide an administrative comparison of the treatment of TOPS applications and that of other Government incentive schemes which have been over-subscribed in (i) 1985-86, (ii) 1986-87 and (iii) 1987-88.  Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) Value of Applications ($M) * in 1985-86 1986-87 1987-88 (b) Value of Approvals ($M) * in 1985-86 1986-87 1987-88 (c) Budget-Appropriation ($M) 1985-86 1986-87 1987-88 * Face Value. (2) No. (3) The operation of TOPS was reviewed. (4) No. This Government has a considerable range of incentive schemes. The details sought by the Honourable Member are not readily available and would require a substantial commitment of resources to extract and collate. Given our strong commitment to containing public expenditure and to the sensible use of resources I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure which would be required to provide an answer to the Question. Taxation Avoidance and Evasion (Question No. 824) Mr Macphee asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 March 1988: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a Tax Report of 1982 entitled ""Avoidance of Income Tax-Interim Report"" involving a stallion scheme which allowed an individual to claim almost $900,000 as a tax deduction, whilst there has been a nil return of income. (2) What was the final uutcome of the Tax Office's investigations into this matter. (3) Has he initiated any moves to stop the creation of vehicles for the transfer of large sums of money out of Australia for tax fraud purposes such as the one canvassed in the Tax Report; if not, why not. (4) Has his attention been drawn to the Auditor General's recent claims that there are now thousands of companies that have established facilities to engage in off-shore tax evasion. (5) Does he intend making any changes to an earlier decision to abolish most foreign exchange reporting requirements in an effort to prevent abuses, such as those mentioned in the Tax Report, any tax avoidance in the future.",130
123,Mr KEATING,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Commissioner of Taxation, whose comments were sought, advised me that participants in the stallion arrangements referred to by the Honourable Member received no tax benefits from entering into the arrangements. (3) The existing tax law was adequate in the case of the stallion arrangements to protect the revenue. The Government has recently enacted several 25.1 57.1 10.2 measures which will further help in discouraging or countering tax fraud. The measures are the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and the Proceeds 7.5 11.2 0.0 of Crime Act 1987. (4) I am aware of the Auditor-General's Report on the Efficiency Audit of the Australian Taxation 5.0 5.0 9.0 Office-International Profit Shifting. As the Honourable Member would be aware, that report was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration under the Chairmanship of Mr S.P. Martin, M.P. In evidence given before that Committee, officers of the Australian Taxation Office indicated that the Auditor-General's figure of 40,000 entities being in a position to possibly shift profits away from Australia seemed excessive. According to recent estimates it has available, the Taxation Office believes that the number is between 12,000 and 18,000. However, it should not be assumed that all taxpayers with related entities overseas do in fact engage in profit shifting practices. The Commissioner of Taxation commented that companies with international transactions, including those with related entities in tax havens, are identified by special schedules lodged with tax returns. These companies can also be identified through the tax screening arrangements. The Commissioner said that audit activities are tailored according to the information available. (5) The deregulatory measures taken at the time of floating the dollar included the removal of requirements to seek approval from the Australian Taxation Office for bringing certain funds into Australia. Re- 531 . consideration of the deregulatory measures taken would not assist in combating the types of tax avoidance arrangements envisaged by the Honourable Member which rely on the movement of funds out of Australia. These transactions are presently subject 546. to tax screening requirements. Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme (Question No. 828) Mr Sharp asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 17 March 1988: (I) How many applications for the Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme were lodged with the Minister's Department after 30 October 1986. (2) How many of these applications were (a) approved and (b) have had claims paid. (3) What were the individual values of those (a) approvals and (b) claims paid.

(2) Where the budget allocations and approved forward commitments at 30 October 1986 less than 10% of this figure. (3) Is the Minister aware of his predecessor's statement and assurances on the financial position of TOPS at the Australian Tourism Conference on 30 October 1986 and on other subsequent occasions. (4) Do those statements and assurances suggest the financial position of TOPS was healthy.  Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) No. (2) Total of budget allocations and forward commitments to 30 October exceeded 10% of $70 million. (3) Yes. (4) They suggest that the then Minister believed that TOPS would continue. Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme (Question No. 830) Mr Sharp asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 17 March 1988: Is the Minister aware of the discrepancy between the figures submitted to Senate Estimates Committee F regarding companies which submitted applications under the Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme and computer printouts relating to the scheme. Claim  Paid Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to 5,200 3,640 the honourable member's question: A No. It is not clear as to which printout the A honourable member is referring. 4,480 A Company Dividends 274 (Question No. 846) 494 Mr Cobb asked the Treasurer, upon no274 tice, on 24 March 1988: 874 (I) How many of the listed companies on the Sydney Stock Exchange are paying (a) dividends, (b) unfranked dividends, (c) partially franked dividends and (d) fully franked dividends. (2) What is the average percentage of the dividend that is franked. (3) What percentage of shareholders are utilising the franked dividends. (4) What categories of shareholders are utilising the franked dividends. (5) What categories of shareholders are not utilising the franked dividends and is he able to say why those shareholders are not utilising franked dividends.",132
124,Mr KEATING,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) An analysis was made of the top one hundred and fifty companies (based on market capitalisation) listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange. Of these companies, three were ""foreign"" companies which do not pay franked dividends. Eighty-three percent (83%) of the remaining companies paid a dividend. (b) Unfranked dividends were paid by twenty-nine percent (29%) of the companies. (c) Partially franked dividends were paid by twenty-four percent (24%) of the companies. (d) Thirty percent (30%) of the companies paid fully franked dividends. (2) The average percentage of the dividend that was franked was sixty-five percent (65%). (3), (4), (5) It is not possible at this early stage to ascertain the nature of shareholders utilising franked dividends. This information will be disclosed in income tax returns for the financial year ended 30 June 1988. Nursing Home Accommodation (Question No. 941) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, upon notice, on 21 April 1988: (I) Has he or his Department received complaints from the community about waiting lists and delays in getting access to nursing home accommodation for the frail aged; if so, what has been the response to these complaints. (2) What is his Department's estimate of the number of additional nursing home beds, hostel places and expanded home nursing or domiciliary care facilities required in each State. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, complaints about the length of nursing home waiting lists in some regions of some States have been received. Services are being developed which meet the needs of many frail aged people more appropriately than do nursing homes. These include hostels for older people, where the Government is committed to gradually increasing the provision from 37 places per 1,000 persons aged 70 + years to 60 per 1,000 persons 70+ years, and the Home and Community Care Program, where some $218 million of Commonwealth money will be spent this year on providing support services for frail and disabled people living in their own homes. Regionally based multidisciplinary assessment services are being developed across Australia to ensure that the frail aged needing help are referred to the services that best meet their needs. Assessment services have, in most cases, been able to achieve drastic reductions in nursing home waiting lists, sometimes by as much as 70 percent. At the same time, assessment services have enabled many people who otherwise would have been admitted to a nursing home to have access to a range of alternative care services. (2) The Government is committed to maintaining the current national average provision of 100 residential places per 1,000 people aged 70 and over. A maximum 10 percent of new approvals in anyone year will be for nursing home approvals, in order to effect a gradual change in the current mix of 63 nursing home places to 37 hostel places nationally to a ratio of 40 nursing home places to 60 hostel places. In line with this commitment the Department of Community Services and Health has estimated that in the three years from 1988-91 the number of new places required to provide nursing home and hostel care for those who are assessed as needing it, is 1409 nursing home places and 12,296 hostel places nationally. I announced on 15 July 1988 that the Government is prepared to approve and support the establishment of these 13,705 new residential care places, and that the distribution of places to each State and Territory would be as follows: State home places places N.S.W. 436 3713 Vic. 544 4814 Qld 199 1809 S.A. 64 WA. 83 Nursing Hostel State home places places Combined Tas. 56 502 558 A.C.T. 25 249 274 N.T. 2 12 14 Aust. 1409 12296 13705 The Government's approach to planning of residential care services is consistent with the findings of the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review which concluded that there are a number of indications that present provision in Australia is sufficient for current needs, particularly given the relatively high level of provision when compared with other countries. A key element of the Government's planning strategy is to increase the range of both residential and community-based care services for the care of the aged. On this basis a complementary serviceplanning model for the new Home and Community Care Program is currently being developed in conjunction with the States and Territories. This work will eventually facilitate regional needs-based planning profiles across both the Residential and Home Care Programs for all regions within Australia. Until this work is completed, there are no specific planning targets for home nursing or domiciliary care facilities, nor for the balance to be struck between residential and community based care. Telecom Australia Facility at St Leonards, New South Wales (Question No. 961) Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 10 May 1988: (I) Does Telecom have an installation facility at 4A Herbert Street, St Leonards, NSW; if so, what is this facility and for what purpose is it used. (2) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to  if so, will the Minister respond to these accusations. (3) Does this facility have a generator to provide power; if so, what is the (a) nature and capacity and (b) purpose of this generator. (4) Do security arrangements apply for entry to this building; if so, what are they and why do they apply. (5) What is the nature of the building's construction, including its floor area.  Nursing Hostel Transport and Communications has provided Combined the following answer to the honourable 4149 member's question, based on advice from 5358 Telecom Australia: 2008 (I) Telecom is having a computer centre con559 623 structed at 4A Herbert Street, St Leonards. This 638 721 computer centre will be used by Telecom for Commercial data processing in support of its business activities. (2) Yes; Telecom has advised that the facility is part of its ongoing program of operations support, and that Mr Sawyer's accusations are unfounded. (3) Primary electrical power is supplied to the site by the local supply authority. Four diesel powered emergency generator sets, each of 4/MVA capacity, are to be installed to provide a back-up power facility to the site in the event of failures. (4) Normal security arrangements relating to access to a building site during construction and afterhours securing of the building site are in place. (S) There will be four separate buildings, the approximate gross building areas of which are 321Sm', 6120m', 6120m' and 3S40m'. The buildings will be linked by overhead personnel and service corridors. (Question No. 1042) Mr Scott asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 25 May 1988: (I) Has he directed that a review be made of pathology legislation regarding personal supervision by medical practitioners. (2) When, and to whom, did he give that direction. (3) Was a time limit set for responding. (4) Which sections of the Health Insurance Act are subject to the review. (S) When were those sections inserted into the Act. (6) Have the sections been implemented in practice; if not, why not. (7) Why is it necessary to review the Act. (8) What consultative processes have the review team been directed to enter into. (9) What consultative processes have been entered into. (10) Have the views of consumer organisations been sought in the review; if not, why not. (II) Have the views of organisations representing medical scientists been sought in the review; if not, why not. (12) Is any other legislation or regulation relating to pathology services under review if so, which sections of which Acts are involved. (13) Is he able to say whether a US Supreme Court found that the practice of pathology is one of science and not medicine; if so, is the situation no different in Australia. (14) Why does the Health Insurance Act limit approved pathology practitioner status to medically qualified persons. (\S) Are most pathology services provided by nonmedically qualified scientists. (16) Have accreditation standards been established by the National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council in order to ensure the quality of pathology services. (17) Do those standards recognise the desirability of scientist control and supervision of pathology services. (18) Why is there a conflict between the requirements of the Health Insurance Act and the standards set by the National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council. (19) Will he introduce amendments to the Act to rectify this situation; if so, when. (20) If he will not introduce amendments to the Act, why not. (21) Has he had representations on these matters from organisations representing medical scientists; if Pathology so, (a) over what period have those representations been made, (b) has he responded to those representations and (c) what has been his response. (22) What requests have been put to him by organisations representing medical scientists. (23) Has he complied with requests made by groups representing medical scientists; if not, why not.",134
125,Dr BLEWETT,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) & (2) Interim arrangements applied from I August 1987 following passage of legislation in 1986 which addressed known difficulties in the pathology areas. Further policy consideration was necessary to address problems arising from legislative requirements that approved pathology practitioners must personally supervise pathology services. My Department has been considering these issues since then. (3) There had been an expectation that mechanisms to address these problems would have been in place for application by the end of the interim arrangements on 31 July 1988. However, that has not been possible. (4) Section 3AAA (not yet proclaimed) of the Health Insurance Act 1973. (S) As part of the Health Legislation Amendment Act 1986 which received Royal Assent on 24 June 1986. (6) & (7) Section 3AAA is not yet proclaimed, because of the concern that certain laboratories which are not yet able to comply with the requirements of the Act would be forced to close resulting in dislocation of services particularly in country areas and loss of jobs for laboratory staff; and because of the need to negotiate alternative funding mechanisms to ensure that the objectives of the legislation could be met without reducing patient access to necessary and prompt services. (8) & (9) Officers of my Department have had preliminary discussions with State and Northern Territory health authorities, members of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia in all States and union and professional bodies representing medical and scientific groups. (10) No. It is desirable to further develop the issues to identify options, before further consultation. (II) Yes. (12) A number of matters dealing with the administration of the pathology benefit arrangements are under review. This is part of the normal, ongoing policy and administrative review processes. (13) While I am not aware of any such American Supreme Court decisions, I am aware of a 1983 ruling by the US District Court of the District of Columbia. I understand that the Court's decision in that case, which was brought by the College of American Pathologists against the Department of Health and Human Services, supported the view that the practice of clinical laboratory science is not the practice of pathology and that clinical laboratory tests do not constitute the practice of medicine. I am not in a position to assess the scope of the Court's decision or whether the United States experience is directly translatable to all situations in Australia. However, as the question involves matters of constitutional law and the applicability of United States Court decisions as precedents in the Australian Court System, I have asked that clarification be sought from the Attorney-General's Department. (14) The Health Insurance Act provides for payment of Medicare benefits for services for which the costs are incurred for medical treatment provided by or on behalf of a medical practitioner. (15) The provision of a pathology service involves the undertaking of laboratory tests, which is mostly done by a scientist or technical officer, and the interpretation of the results and reports, as necessary, which may involve medical input. (16) Yes (17) Accreditation standards recognise control by pathologists, general practitioners, senior scientists scientists, depending upon the category of laboratory. (18) The Health Insurance Act is aimed at providing Medicare benefits for pathology services provided by or on behalf of approved pathology practitioners who must be medical practitioners; with clinical responsibility for the patient. Accreditation relates to acceptable standards for pathology testing and not to clinical responsibility. (19) & (20) Amendments to the Act may not be the only course of action. Other measures such as development of alternative means of funding to Medicare benefits for services provided by certain laboratories may be considered. The interim arrangements have been extended from I August 1988. (21) Yes. (a) Representations have been received over a number of years. (b) & (c) Responses have referred to the Second Report of the Medicare Benefits Review Committee 1986 which concluded that: ""The current cost of pathology is so vexed that there is no way in which we could recommend fee-for-service for medical scientists on the same basis as pathologists with the same fees and with the same risk of possible abuse and overservicing. Medical scientists have, we believe, the potential capacity to put forward proposals which would result in current pathology services being provided for less cost, but no such proposals were forthcoming. In addition, to provide fee-for-service for medical scientists would only be remunerating medical scientists by way of public funding in lieu of the present remuneration of pathologists by way of public funding, at the same rate. This would mean merely a shift in the recipients of the funding. Furthermore, in the area of medical scientists in hospitals, we could see that the equity argument, that they should be remunerated on fee-for-service simply because pathologists were, would similarly apply to technicians in the laboratory or, indeed any other employees in the public hospital system."" have also advised that the changes arose out of the concerns of the loint Committee of Public Accounts in its Report 236 ""Medical Fraud and Overservicing-Pathology"". That report clearly identified the need to increase the accountability of pathology providers under Medicare. In introducing the new legislation, the Government had not departed from the long-standing policy of benefits for medical services only being payable where they are provided by or on behalf of medical practitioners. (22) Medical scientists have sought an end to the apparent discrimination against them because of Commonwealth insistence that medical supervision is an essential requirement for the payment of Medical benefits. There is particular concern that the requireor ments will lessen the career prospects of senior scientists in the public hospital sector in that to retain revenue from Medicare benefits for services provided on a fee-for-service basis, hospitals will recruit pathologists over scientists. (23) I have not been willing to comply with requests by some medical scientists to extend Medicare benefits to services provided by them without any medical professional involvement. However, other financing mechanisms which do not require medical professional supervision or participation are being considered. National Sports Facilities Program (Question No. 1050)  ing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 26 May 1988: Why is the sum appropriated for the National Sports Facilities Program expected to fall short of the 1987-88 estimate by over $5m, as revealed by the Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations released by the Department  Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: As part of the streamlining of the Commonwealth administration in the area of sport, the National Sports Facilities Program was transferred from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to the Australian Sports Commission. This necessitated a transfer of $5.067m between the two organisations. The original total allocation of $5.2m for expenditure under the program in 1987-88 is unchanged. Department of Transport and Communications: Staff Conferences (Question No. 1064)  the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 3 June 1988: (I) What weekend conferences, including management meetings and team building exercises, and involving overnight accommodation have been conducted out of Canberra for Staff of the Minister's Department for the year ending (2) When and where were the meetings held.

(2) Does the paper state that the Government's version of privati sat ion to date has been to contract out some government functions; if so, does the paper outline how that approach may result in higher costs and lower quality services and corruption. (3) Was the document printed by a private printer in Queanbeyan, N.S.W.: if so, does any contradiction exist between what is stated in the report and government practice.",136
126,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) A discussion paper with this title has been prepared by the Council. (2) The paper observes that in Australia many Commonwealth services are already contracted out. It states that the efficiency of contracting out has not yet been carefully evaluated in Australia, and refers to evidence from the United States and Britain which suggests that in some instances there may be higher costs, poorer services, lack of flexibility and corruption associated with contracting out. The paper also states that Australia is already one of the half dozen most highly privatised economies in the Western world and gives specific examples of industries which are nationalised in Europe and North America, and are privately owned in Australia. (3) The paper was published by the Australian Government Publishing Service, which chose to use a private printer in Queanbeyan, N.S.W. I understand that AGPS first offers printing work to the Government printer. If the Government printer is unable to handle the work, AGPS then chooses a private printer. (Question No. 783) Mr Moore asked the Attorney-General, Upon notice, on 15 March 1988: (I) Has the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council published a report entitled ""PrivatizationThe Consumer Perspective"". (2) Does the report include quotes highly critical of any move towards privatisation by (a) Professor E. Wheelwright, (b) Mr F. Walker and (c) Mr J. Langmore. (3) Does the report conclude that if a public $23,049.90 enterprise urgently requires some form of capital $5,920.00 injection, a maximum of 25% of shares should be sold to the public; if so, does this accord with Government policy. allowance for $1,192.00 (4) Will the Government act on the report's conclusions; if so, when. Privatisation",139
127,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) A discussion paper with this title has been prepared by the Council. (2) The paper does include some views critical of, or qualifying, moves towards privatisation made by Professor E. Wheelwright, Mr F. Walker and Mr J. Langmore, M.P. (3) One conclusion of the paper is that if public enterprise urgently requires some form of capital injection, a maximum of 25% of shares should be sold to the public but with board representation on a pro-rata basis and with the Commonwealth Government retaining ultimate control. (4) The Council is an advisory body only and its views are not necessarily shared by the Government. The discussion paper is, however, a useful contribution to the privatisation debate and will be taken into account in the context of the Government's consideration of this matter. AFP Investment Corporation Ltd (Question No. 950) Mr Martin asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 26 April 1988: (I) Has his attention been drawn to recent media reports concerning the AFP Investment Corp. Ltd, in particular, reports relating to relief afforded the company following its losses, proposals to move the company off-shore to Monte Carlo and the emerging asset base for the privatisation of Elders-IXL. (2) Has Elders-IXL gained value as a result of these transactions. (3) As stock exchange transactions are zero sum gains, have Elder's shareholders who do not have a proportionate holding in AFP lost equity. (4) Are transactions of this nature in the public interest.",139
128,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NUMBERS IN CLASSIFICATION,"The answer to the Privatisation honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) to (4) To the extent that questions of compliance with companies and securities legislation may be involved, the matters raised by the honourable member come within the responsibility of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). The NCSC has indicated that it has monitored the situation but it is not currently aware of any circumstances that might constitute a breach of the companies and securities legislation. For this reason the NCSC does not propose to take any further action other than to continue to monitor developments to ensure compliance with the legislation. It is not appropriate for me to comment on the commercial soundness of the transactions involved as this is a matter for the companies and shareholders of the parties involved. (Question No. 972) Mr Scott asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 17 May 1988: (I) What are the isotope rations of (a) uranium, (b) other radioactive elements and (c) lead in uranium ore from (i) Australia, (ii) Canada, (iii) South Africa, (iv) the USA, (v) the USSR and (vi) Gabon. (2) What are the uranium isotope rations for yellowcake produced in (a) Australia, (b) Canada, (c) South Africa, (d) the USA, (e) the USSR and (f) Gabon. (3) What are the uranium and plutonium isotope ratios in (a) fuel grade and (b) weapons grade uranium. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Uranium, as it occurs in nature, consists of three isotopes; uranium 238 (U-238), uranium 235 (U-235) and uranium 234 (U-234). The isotope ratios in uranium ore deposits are constant. For example the present day isotopic ratio of U238/ U235 is 137.88:1.00. The only time this ratio varies is if the ore deposit has been affected by a natural chain reaction. The only uranium ore deposit in which this phenomenon is known to have occurred is the Oklo uranium ore deposit in Gabon, West Africa. The chain reaction took place some 1800 million years ago and much of the ore from the fossil reactors at Oklo now contains anomalously low concentrations of U-235 relative to U-238. The isotope ratios of other radioactive elements and lead in uranium ore deposits are not constant. These ratios will vary considerably throughout the one ore deposit and from one ore deposit to another depending upon the particular geochemistry and age of the deposit. (2) The uranium isotope ratios for yellowcake are the same as for the original ore. see (1) above. (3) There is no plutonium in uranium used as nuclear fuel or in nuclear weapons. Plutonium is produced in a nuclear reactor from the capture of neutrons by uranium-238. In the reprocessing of irradiated uranium, plutonium is recovered separately from the uranium. (a) The average isotopic composition of fuel grade uranium is 3 percent uranium-235; the balance being uranium-238. (b) Weapons grade uranium is over 90 percent U-235; the balance being U-238. Global Food Security (Question No. 1000) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for PriIsotopes mary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 19 May 1988: What conclusions did the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's Committee on World Food Security reach at its April 1988 meeting about the global food security situation. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The final report of the April meeting of the F AO Committee on World Food Security is yet to be circulated but the following information has been taken from the draft of the report. The Committee expressed its deep concern and regret that the world food security situation continued to be characterised by the contrast of ample supplies at the world level and of millions of people remaining undernourished in the developing countries. It noted that staple food production had declined by 4 per cent in 1987, mainly due to weather conditions but also to policy measures. As a result, production had fallen below consumption for the first time in four years and closing stocks of cereals in 1987/88 were expected to decline to about 22 percent of forecast consumption. The Committee expressed concern at the anticipated large decline in stocks held by developing countries. It noted that international prices of cereals, particularly of rice, had risen but were still low compared with the levels prevailing in the early eighties. It also noted that FAO's first preliminary forecasts of world grain production in 1988 suggested that, while output was expected to increase, it would probably again be less than consumption so that stocks would be further drawn down in 1988/89, possibly to a level not much more than the minimum level that is considered necessary by FAO to safeguard world food security. The Committee deeply regretted that the food security situation had deteriorated seriously in many low-income food-deficit countries in 1987/88 and the per capita food consumption in many countries was at or below the level of 15 years earlier. The Committee expressed concern at the serious threat of desert locust damage in North and North West Africa, and urged immediate and extensive international assistance to combat this plague. The Committee expressed its appreciation for FAO's role in co-ordinating the campaign against locusts. The Committee expressed its concern that, because of a widespread decline in domestic staple food production and inadequate foreign exchange resources to finance sufficient imports, aggregate food aid needs of the low income food deficit countries in 1987/88 were substantially higher than in the previous year. The Committee also expressed its serious concern at the declining trends in per capita food production in a large number of developing countries. The Committee underlined the necessity to reverse these unfavourable trends and to achieve food security, and urged that the highest priority be accorded to the development of the food and agricultural sector of the low-income food-deficit countries and to the formulation of a suitable policy framework to achieve it. In this connection, the committee stressed, inter alia, the need to apply technological improvements to raise productivity; to provide price incentives, extension and training; to strengthen cooperative and credit facilities; to support women farmers; to improve marketing institutions as well as physical infrastructures such as transport systems. While it was emphasising that the primary responsibility for achieving national food security rested with the countries themselves, the Committee urged the international community to support the efforts of developing countries with adequate technical and financial assistance. It was also pointed out, in this regard, that the financing of development, and stable conditions for a growing and liberalized trade, are indispensable conditions for sustained economic growth and are also preconditions for food security. The Committee also recognized the important role of regional and sub-regional cooperation in increasing food production and achieving food security. The Committee agreed that the food security situation in developing countries was seriously affected by adverse external economic factors, particularly restrictions on access to markets, the heavy burden of external debt servicing, low prices for export products, deteriorating terms of trade, as well as the development of products based on substitutes, particularly artificial substitutes. As a result, oping countries were not able to finance the food imports they needed nor to provide adequate support to domestic food production. The Committee urged that appropriate action be taken to ensure that the debt service payments of developing countries did not hamper the development of the food and agricultural sectors and the performance of the overall economies of these countries. Most delegates were concerned that protectionist policies adopted by a number of developed countries continued to be detrimental to global economics growth and food security. The Committee considered that major issues relating to agricultural trade adjustment remained unresolved. It urged concerted action (a) to bring the cereals market into a better balance in the long-term interests of both producing and consuming countries and (b) to enhance export market access in order to improve the foreign exchange earning ability of developing countries. The Committee hoped that Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations would be successful in leading to increased discipline and greater liberalization of agricultural trade. Nauru (Question No. 562) Mr Macphee asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 9 December 1987: (I) Is it his practice to answer questions within 2 weeks of them appearing on the Notice Paper. (2) Why has he not answered my question No. 363, placed on notice on 2 November 1987 regarding Nauru. (3) Did he raise with Soviet leaders reports of their interest in Nauru's deep water anchorages; if so, what did he ascertain. (4) If he did not raise this issue with the Soviet leaders, why not.",139

(2) Question No. 363 has been answered. (3) No. (4) We do not see a need to raise with the Soviet leadership each particular aspect of Soviet interest in the South Pacific. Both the Prime Minister and I have on a number of occasions informed the highest levels of the Soviet leadership of our general views on Soviet activity in the region. The Soviet Union can, as a consequence, be in no doubt about the extent of Australian concern should it undertake any activity going beyond normal diplomatic, commercial and other relations, and which might adversely affect the peace and security of this region. To this point, we have no evidence that Soviet undertakings in this many devel- regard have not been met.
