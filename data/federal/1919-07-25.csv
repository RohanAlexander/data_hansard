8,Mr GROOM,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,"The Government has received and accepted the resignation of the Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Griffith, which is to date from 31st August next. No steps have yet been taken for the appointment of a successor, but I am sure the House will permit me to say that it will be learned with regret that His Honour is retiring from the high and dignified office whioh he has filled with such conspicuous advantage to the public and the Commonwealth since, the creation of the Court. Before accepting that office, he had a distinguished career both as a statesman and as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland, and had earned a wide reputation. On his appointment to the High Court .bench, he, with his colleagues of the Judiciary had cast upon him highly important duties associated with the interpretation of the Constitution, and the growth and development of the Commonwealth has been so rapid, that his work of recent years has been enormously increased. In the exercise of his functions, the Chief Justice has undoubtedly brought to bear upon - every case heard by him the strictest impartiality, deep research, and profound learning, and a ripeness of judgment begot of great experience in many offices. As Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Samuel Griffith has upheld the highest traditions of the British Judiciary, and has preserved the noblest ideals of the administration of justice so well recognised throughout the British realm. His resignation will be received with deep regret everywhere in Australia, and the wish will go out from the people generally that the remainder of his life may be passed in peace and comfort.",21
9,Mr HIGGS,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,"Will the Acting Attorney-General state whether the Government propose to follow the old practice of appointing as successor to the present Chief Justice a member of the Bar, or do they propose to give due consideration to the claims of present members of the High Court'bench?",21

11,Mr MAHONY,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,"Is the Minister in charge of the House aware of the extreme danger to which peaceful citizens who have to traverse the streets of Melbourne after dark are subject, and inview of that fact will the Government arrange for day sittings of Parliament so that honourable members may reach their homes before dark, and avoid the riskof being molested in the streets ? Failmg that will the Government take the necessary steps to provide honourable members with a suitable escort to insure their safety ?",21
12,Mr GROOM,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,I am not aware that the conditions of the streets of Melbourne are as bad as the honourable member suggests. The only conclusion I can come to is that the honourable gentleman's beauty constitutes a source of risk to himself. RESTRICTION SONALIENS .,21
13,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,"Will the M in ister-for Home and Territories state whether it is a fact that foreigners other than coloured persons are allowed to enter Australia without having to produce a passport, or any restriction being imposed ?",21
14,Mr GLYNN,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,"Subjec t to a few exceptions, no person is allowed to land in Australia without a passport.

15,Mr SAMPSON,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,"Will the Acting Leader of the House request the Central Wheat Board to make an early announcement as to the final prices that wheat in the various Pools is expected to realise so that growers who are holders of scrip may not place such scrip on the open market, and for want of knowledge on the subject sell it at reduced prices?",21
16,Mr GROOM,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,"I shall bring the matter immediately before the responsible Minister,' and see what can be done.",22
17,Mr LECKIE,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,"Is it a fact, as seems to have been disclosed by evidence given in Sydney, that members of the Australian Wheat Board have been granting themselves commissions for carrying out their functions as managers of the Wheat Pool?",22
18,Mr GROOM,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,"I think the honourable member is rather anticipating that certain statements which have been made are facts. I have not seen the statement to which he refers, but as the matter is the subject of a special inquiry by an impartial tribunal , I think it would be better to await the decision of that tribunal.",22
19,Mr LECKIE,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,I was not referring that.,22
20,Mr GROOM,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,Perhaps the honourable member will be goad enough to repeat his question.,22
21,Mr LECKIE,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,The statement has appeared that the evidence given before the Wheat Board in Sydney has disclosed that members of the Advisory Board managing the Australian Wheat Pool have been granting themselves commissions on the sale of wheat. Does the Minister think that is advisable in the interests of Australia?,22
22,Mr GROOM,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,"I apologize to the honourable member for having misunderstood his question when first stated. I thought he was referring to certain State agents. Obviously, I am not in a position to express an opinion! upon statements which apparently have only been reported in a condensed way in the press. If the honourable member will give notice, of his question, I will make inquiries.",22
23,Mr RILEY,RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF,"Is the Acting Treasurer prepared to make a statement as to the amount of money which the Treasury has supplied for the construction of silos?

25,Mr GROOM,INFLUENZ A OUTBREAK AT,This is entirely a matter of State administration.,22
26,Mr FENTON,INFLUENZ A OUTBREAK AT,But the Government could make representations to the State authorities.,22
27,Mr GROOM,INFLUENZ A OUTBREAK AT,"I have not heard of an outbreak of influenza at Pentridge, but I presume the honourable member bases his question on definite information in his to possession.",22

Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Will the M in ister for Trade and Customs inform the House what action has been, or will be, taken in the near future by the Government to procure an adequate supply of wire netting for rabbit-proof fencing purposes, and to insure its supply at a reasonable price.",22
34,Mr MASSYGREENE,INFLUENZ A OUTBREAK AT,"No action has been taken by the Government up to the present to secure wire netting, for the reason that we could only buy in the open market exactly as any importer might do. The reason why supplies of netting are so scarce at the present time is that there is a falling market. one desires to operate in a large way on a falling market, since those who did so would find themselves landed eventually with stock bought at high prices which they would have to seli in competition with wire netting bought at low prices. The Government would be in exactly the same position if it purchased wire netting at the present time. I am glad, to be able to eay, however, that within the next six weeks or so a very large plant will . be in operation in Australia which will be able in a very short time to draw sufficient wire to meet the whole of Australia's requirements in wire netting. Once the wire is drawn, the actual weaving of at into mesh is a comparatively easy matter. - NORTHERN TERRITORY . INTRODUCTION OF HARES : PROSPECTING.",23
35,Mr FINLAYSON,INFLUENZ A OUTBREAK AT,"In view of a statement appearing in the press that it is proposed to introduce hares into the Northern Territory, I ask the Minister for Home and Territories whether this is for the purpose of increasing the food supply, or is it being done at the request of the pastoralists of the Territory?",23
36,Mr GLYNN,INFLUENZ A OUTBREAK AT,"I have not heard of the intention to introduce hares into the Northern Territory recently. I shall make inquiries, and let the honourable member know the result next Wednesday. . Mr LYNCH - Will the Minister say whether there is at the present time any special organization in existence to assist prospecting for minerals in the Northern Territory ?",23
37,Mr GLYNN,INFLUENZ A OUTBREAK AT,"W it h in the limits of a vote, the total of which is, I think, Â£5,000, some prospecting is being done. Arrangements were made for three parties, but two have been sent up to the Northern Territory, and I believe arrived there about a fortnight ago, and have now gone out prospecting in certain districts. I saw, some of the members of these parties, and they were all returned soldiers. SHIPPING. NA AUSTRALIA. No Mr FOWLER - I ask the Acting Minister for the Navy, in view of the hardship and expense caused by merchandise in oversea ships, intended for Western Australia, being overcarried to the Eastern ports, will he give instructions that the practice shall cease, and goods be delivered at the ports to which they are consigned?  member will put his question oni the notice-paper,- I shall see what can be done in the matter. THE MINISTRY. MT . HIGGS - I ask the Minister in charge of the House if there is any truth in the statement' that Senator Millen is about to resign from the Ministry, and that - the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . Watt ) is also about to resign? Is the Ministry breaking up?",23
38,Mr GROOM,OVERCARRIAGE OF GOODS FROM WESTE RN,"The honourable gentleman, in the last part of his question, discloses the reason for the first part of it . I am afraid that his question is indicative of his hopes, aspirations, and ambitions. I have not heard of the intention to resign of the members of the M i nistry to whom he has referred. There is plenty of v i r i l it y in the Ministry, and they are prepared to battle on, and. do their duty to Australia. AVIATION. NA TO AUSTRALIA .",23
39,Mr FINLAYSON,PRIZE FOR FLIGHT FROM GREAT BRITAI N,"An announcement was made some time ago that the Commonwealth Government were prepared to offer a prize of Â£10,000 for a flight from Great B rita into Australia.

41,Mr GLYNN,PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION FOR,"In answer to the honourable gentleman I may say that the particular Bill which will be introduced' will come on. at the most favourable opportunity , which will depend largely upon the extent to which we subordinate discussion i u this House to the public in terests.

42,Mr LECKIE,EXTENSIO N OF FACILITI ES TO COUNTRY,"In view of the substan- irregular debates. tial profit disclosed by the-operations of his Department, brought about by his .careful management, will the Postmaster General now consider the desirability of .altering the policy of restricting the facilities provided for small country districts?",24
43,Mr WEBSTER,EXTENSIO N OF FACILITI ES TO COUNTRY,"In reply to the honourable member, I should like to say, in re-gard to the last part of his question, that ithere is no'legitimate foundation for his ^statement, as the Department has not restricted services that were obtainable before my advent to the office of Postmaster General. Further,-I wish to say that the credit balance shown is the balance for 1918, and the Treasurer has that money. Honourable members are aware that the Treasurer is as accessible to their appeals in this House as I am. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) has promised that he will consult with me general proposition of the .treatment of the people in the back country, and people generally in the matter of post and telegraph facilities. I do not know that there is any necessity to do so. because my sympathies have always been with the people of the back districts.

45,Mr SPEAKER,EXTENSIO N OF FACILITI ES TO COUNTRY," I take this opportunity to again remind honourable members that irregular debates on questions are quite out of order. I have several times called attention to the prevalence of the practice which, if it continues, will place me i u the very unpleasant position of having to curtail the questions put MENT. without notice.

It is not in accordance with parliamentary pracDISTRICT S. tice for questions to involve the House in Questions are designed to ask for information on administrative affairs from the Ministers in charge of the various Departments.

USE OF PARLIAMENT HOU SE STEPS.",24
46,Mr BOYD,EXTENSIO N OF FACILITI ES TO COUNTRY,"I desire, sir, to ask you a question without notice. On Friday last a notice appeared in the evening paper, published in Melbourne, stating that at the function that was to be held on Parliament House steps on the Saturday, the gold passes issued to members of this Parliament would not be recogon the nised. I should like .to know what authority the military people had to usurp your powers, and. prevent honourable members of this House entering this building ?",24
47,Mr SPEAKER,EXTENSIO N OF FACILITI ES TO COUNTRY," I may in for m the honourable member that I did not see the notice in the newspaper to which he has referred, but the matter was mentioned to me. It was also reported to me that some honourable members had been interfered with by military omcers on duty at the time, under the instruction, apparently, of officers placed specially in charge of the function on Saturday. An attempt was made to prevent certain honourable members entering the building, even, in some cases, where they' showed their gold passes. I may point out that permission to use the steps of Parliament House for functions outside of those associated with Parliament itself, is given, always subject to the reservation that the rights of honourable members to free ingress to and egress from the building should be strictly respected. When complaint was made to me that members had been refused access to the building by military officials, I informed the officer in charge that such interference could not be permitted. Since honourable members informed me that interference with them had taken place I have written to the State Commandant, Brigadier-General Brand, bringing the matter under his notice, and expressing the hope that my intimation would be sufficient to prevent a recurrence of anything of the kind in the future. I may add that both the President of the Senate, and myself, have insisted on the observance of the condition regarding the rights and privileges of members in connection with previous functions for which we gave permission for the use of the parliamentary buildings.

What is there to object to in such a proposal? During the four years and a half the Government have, unfortunately, adopted .the course of keeping everything secret, and this very questionable policy has obtained a hold over the Government, and the Departments, that there is strong disinclination to depart from it. In the reconstruction period,- which will be upon us very shortly, and may continue for five or six years, revolutionary or ideas with regard to the whole of the trading concerns of the country, must, if the we are to pull through, be introduced. One of the main factors to be considered that of publicity, and the right of the wool, people to know, not only how Government concerns, including Pools and similar institutions, but also trading companies - financial institutions generally, are In the present instance we have the extraordinary spectacle of an auditor, who has nothing to do with the the Government, in such a position that he shall is able to defy the people of Australia, the and refuse to make any documents or information available. Under the companies law today the Government have not that full power which is necessary in this connection; but the time is 'not far distant when the people will demand to and be fully informed on all such matters. The present occasion offers an opportunity to the Government to, at least, do on the lines I am suggesting, apand provide proper supervision, not only of Government affairs, but of the administration of private capital. The auditor in the case immediately before us has, as I say, practically defied the Commonwealth, and, apparently, the Government do not desire to apply any remedy. If all is honest and above board, there is no need for secrecy; but, unfortunately, our commercial life is not honest, and it is only by trickery and frau d and the manipulation of figures that many companies hide their true position. The Government are practically approving of the practice of allowing private accountants, rather than the Auditor-General, to deal with what is essentially a national matter. The A u ditor-General should have full and. complete power to audit all the Pools affected by this Bill , and that power will have to be given sooner or later, whether or not the Government are agreeable.",28
67,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Y a r r a ) [11.47] - I agree with the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) and the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), that the proposed amendment is too narrow; it should be made to apply to all firms. W it h the approval of the mover (Mr . Higgs) I move That the following words be added to the proposed new sub-clause:"" The Auditor-General of the Commonwealth or his officers shall inspect, audit, and examine the books, vouchers, and documents of a ll persons, firms, or companies having contracts with the Central Wool Committee."" Any person who has read the last report of the Auditor-General will admit that that officer should have the power which the amendment seeks to give him. Last night the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) said that the proposal for an audit by the Auditor-General would be all right if it applied to all firms having business with the Central Wool Committee. But the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company and.Whiddon Brothers occupy a different position from that of any other firm, in as much as the Government have practically taken a partnership with them in the sale of wool tops. The honourable member was not correct in saying that the action of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) was preventing wool tops being made in Australia, and forcing the trade to Japan. The responsibility must be placed upon the Central Wool Committee and upon the Government, because of the action they have taken. Ab the present time the Government are suing the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, which is the successor of F . W . Hughes Limited , for the recovery of about Â£280,000. I have no quarrel with any manufacturers. A few years ago I visited the factory of F. W . Hughes Limited, and I agree that it would be to the advantage of the Commonwealth if we could convert all our wool into tops before exporting it . I had the privilege of supporting the first Bill to give a bounty for the manufacture of wool tops, and thus afford F . W . Hughes Limited and Whiddon Brothers a chance to establish their industries.",29
68,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,I introduced the Bill .,29
69,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"And later I introduced amending Bills to extend the bounty and fix the labour conditions in the industry. But the question we are now dealing with is as to whether it is right that the Auditor-General should audit the accounts of these two firms which have made contracts with the Central Wool Committee. The Auditor-General and the then Treasurer (Lord Forrest) sought to get that power, but the Central Wool Committee insisted upon appointing their own auditor. When Lord Forrest said he was not satisfied and desired a further audit, the Chairman of the Central Wool Committee said that the report of their own auditor was final, and if the Treasurer desired further information he must apply to the companies. That is a humiliating position in which to place this Parliament. As partners in the business of wool top manufacture we are directly interested in all the transactions. I am informed that Mr Allard, the auditor appointed by the Central Committee, is paid by the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company and not by the Commonwealth. We should have an independent auditor, and nobody oould be more suitable than the Auditor General, in whom honourable members have complete confidence. Many people are saying that the various Pools have fallen into their present unsatisfactory state solely because insufficient care has been exercised in the past management of them. I believe that Mr Grahame admitted before the Royal Commission in Sydney that 3,000,-000 bushels of wheat .have been lost from the Pool in that State. It is said that a mistake was made in not having an audit sooner - Parliament has now the opportunity of insisting upon a proper audit of all the Pools, and if we fail in our duty we must take the responsibility.",29
70,Mr LAIKD SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,Why confine this proposal to the Wool Pool ?,30
71,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is the only Pool we can deal with under the clause now before the Committee. But if the honourable member will move a similar amendment in regard to other Pools,' I shall support him. No honourable member will say that the protest of Lord Forrest was made for a party purpose. The Commonwealth is placed in an unfair position when the auditor appointed by the Central Wool Committee ie paid by the company; he is the servant of the company, and not of the Commonwealth. Why have an audit at all unless it is' an independent one ?",30
72,Mr LECKIE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Was the auditor chosen by the oompany? .,30
73,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,No ; he is an independent auditor.,30
74,Mr LECKIE,PUBLIC SERVICE,That makes a difference.,30
75,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I ask honourable members to deal with the amendment on its merits, and not to be influenced by the fact that it emanated from a member on the Opposition side of the House. My only purpose is to have the auditing done by the Auditor-General, or an officer appointed by him, and hot by a private auditor.",30
76,Mr LAIHD SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Auditor General is not an official of the Government.,30
77,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"He is an official of the Commonwealth, and is independent of even the Government. Parliament deliberately made him so.",30
78,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Why does not the honourable, member let his amendment stand by itself?",30
79,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am not empowered to withdraw another honourable member's amendment. My proposal, which is to add something to the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), will merely give effect to the request of the Auditor-Gene- - cal and the ,late Lord Forrest. . I hope that honourable members will vote for it. Mr .GEOOM - The Government cannot .accept it.",30
80,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"All the brains of this Parliament are not covered up when Ministers put on their hats. A Bill can be amended in minor details without inflicting injury on the Ministry. It has often been my experience, as a Minister, to find members of our party voting solidly against clauses of a Government Bill. It is the duty of the Committee to .make measures the best possible. My amendmentwill improve this Bill.",30
81,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways and Acting Attorney-General) [12.5] - I hope honourable members really .understand - what would be the effect of the acceptance of the proposed addition to the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). His proposal - was that the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth should have power to inspect, audit, and examine all' books, papers, documents, and vouchers of the Colonial. Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited, and Whiddon Brothers Limited, relating to the purchase, manufacture, and sale of the sheep skins, wool, and wool tops referred to in any agreement made or to be made by the Commonwealth Government with these companies. The proposal of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) is to accept the principle that the Commonwealth Auditor General shall have power to examine not only the books, vouchers, and documents of the' two firms with whom particular contracts have been made, but also those of all persons, firms, or companies having contracts of any kind or description with the Central Wool Committee. If a municipal council leases to the Central Wool Committee a piece of land, the Auditor-General is to be authorized to inspect the accounts of the municipality. If. a firm of carriers enters into a contract with the Central Wool Committee to carry wool, power is to be given to the Auditor-General to inspect all the books of that firm.",30
82,Dr MALONEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes ; to find out if they are "" going straight.""",31
83,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"This power is to be given, not for any specific purpose, .but, as the honourable member has just said, in order to see if anything may be found in the books of these firms affecting the Commonwealth; just out of idle curiosity, to ascertain if they are "" going straight."" It is a hopeless amendment, and is only put forward because, as certain suggestions have been made by individual members on this side of the chamber, the honourable member hopes to catch their votes, with a view to getting them to go the whole way with him. The Wool Committee made contracts with Whiddo n BrothersLimited and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited . These contracts contained the provision : That all books, papers, and documents in the possession or under the control of the company and relating to the purchase, manufacture, or sale of the sheepskins or wool tops referred to shall be produced to an auditor nominated' by the Commonwealth Government for that purpose. It was also provided that it should, be the duty of the auditor to decide what amounts should be credited and debited, in order to ascertain the net earnings of the company, and his decision should be final and binding on both parties. auditor had power to disallow items. An independent audit was thus provided for. Agreement has been made with the Commonwealth with these two firms, and also with the Yarra Falls Company, and in each case there is provision for this in dependent audit.",31
84,Mr BUBOHELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Will the Minister cept the amendment of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), as suggested to be amended by the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Tudor) ?",31
85,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No ; because to do so would mean a violation of the contract made with these firms. An agreement has been entered into whereby a certain person has been appointed as auditor. The gentleman appointed as auditor in connection with the agreement with the Y a r r a Falls Companv is already an oflicer of the Commonwealth Audi t parties have agreed to accept him as their auditor. As a matter of fact, he is the accountant' of the Central Wool Committee, ' and that body has agreed to allow him to undertake the work. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) now asks us to set aside the agreement we have made with firms who have, on the strength of those agreements, accepted certain persons as their auditors. I am prepared, on behalf of the Wool Committee, to give the assurance that all f u t u re agreements will stipulate for the appointment of an officer of the Commonwealth A u d it Office.",31
86,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Why exclude the Auditor-General, who asks to be brought in? . Mr GROOM - I am not excluding him ; but what sort of a proposition is it to bring him in in breach of an agreement ? '",31
87,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,What odds if we do commit a breach of an.agreement in order to secure the Commonwealth!,31
88,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Is that the idea? That is a nice ""scrap of paper"" argument. Under the agreement with the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited, Mr G. M - Allard was appointed as independent auditor, and because of his commercial knowledge and capacity to enter into the intricacies of commercial life, and audit and investigate The them, a more suitable officer could not have been chosen.",31
89,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No one will object to him. MT . GROOM - This is a letter sent from the Treasury, and signed by Mr . Cerutty, the Assistant Secretary to the acTreasury:25th April, 1918. On the 6th November last, the late Treasurer addressed to the Prime Minister a letter dealing with the audit of accounts of the firms who are manufacturing wool tops. A letter has now been received from the Auditor-General in which he stated he is prepared to formally appoint Mr George Mason Allard to act on his behalf in making audits. Mr Allard would also be required to certify to statements and prepare reports for the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General considers that the alternative course, namely, for one of the Audit Office staff to make inspections from time to Office. Both time,' would be inadvisable. The Treasurer concurs in the appointment of Mr Allard as suggested, if no objection is raised by the Central Wool Committee or by your .Department. Later on, the Prime Minister confirmed the appointment. I point out these matters in order to show that no impression ean he formed that anything sinister has taken place, and to show that everything done was right and proper, and an inder pendent audit made. The honourable member for Yarra has not told the Committee the real inner meaning of his proposal.",31
90,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Will the Minister state in what way the agreement would be varied by authorizing the Auditor-General to make the same investigation into these accounts as he does into Government accounts generally?,32
91,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,It is not necessary in this case.,32
92,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,How will it affect the agreement ?,32
93,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"-The operations of all the activities mentioned ih this Bill-the ButteT Pool, the Central Wheat Board, the Central Wool Committee, and the Elax Committee-'ar e subject to audit by the Auditor-General, but this particular transaction is oulside the ordinary course of the Auditor-General's work.",32
94,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Why ? - Mr GROOM - It . is an agreement under which the Commonwealth and the other parties to the contract shaTe the profits, and the' parties agree that a certain person shall be the auditor to audit and certify the accounts ibetween them. For some reason or other, certain honourable members want to tear up this agreement and put something in its place. I have givem honourable members the assurance that, in future agreements, it can be stipulated that the Auditor-General, or some person appointed by him, shall conduct the audit.",32
95,Mr WEST,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Government will be out of office then.,32
96,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Then , if the honourable member is in my place, he can do it, so no harm cam arise.",32
97,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If you did that, the probabilities are that exactly the same men would be doing the work.",32
98,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is quite possible. I would impress upon honourable members that this Wool Committee was constituted for the management of an enormous task. Every . one admits that it3 members have brought to bear very fine judgment, and have produced excellent results for the Commonwealth. All , or most of them, are business men who know their wprk, and the agreement is a proper business agreement that any one would be justified in making, and in providing for an independent audit in this way. I , therefore, ask honourable members to stand by the Bill as it is now, because it gives sufficient protection, and, above all things, to reject a comprehensive amendment which is evidently tabled in the ' hope of' catching somebody from this side; Mr WEST [East Sydney] (12.19) - I cannot understand why the Acting Leader of the Government has put so much vim into the endeavour to get the Committee to reject the amendment. His suggestion, that these gentlemen have shown their ability by electing their own auditors, reminds me of the Yankee who said he did not care what the electoral laws were so long as he was appointed presiding officer. 1 always understood ^ that the duties of the Auditor-General included the supervision of all transactions in which the Government were interested. If it is not so, previous Parliaments and Governments have made a great error. We all know that the gentleman who has been named is an estimable, citizen, and I have nothing to say against him as an individual. He is a keen business fellow, but he is also an earnest worker on behalf of the Liberal party, and never loses an opportunity to support those who are opposed to us in. politics. How can an outside auditor, appointed by these public companies to act for them, serve two masters? How can he serve the Government and the companies with whom he is in daily connection ? The Committee ought to be pleased with the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) for moving the amendment. If we had ordinary government, where vested interests did not so predominate, the Ministry would welcome the action of the Opposition in this matter, because it would give them the opportunity to see that the accounts were supervised in the interests of the general public. On a cursory view, the ordinary citizen would be apt to conclude that there must be something behind the anxiety that has been shown to retain the present system of audit. Why is the Minister so concerned ? He spoke longer on this clause than I have known any other Minister to take on any clause of a Bill going through Committee. He has employed all his legal talent and all the ability he possesses, if he has any, to prove to the Committee that the supervision of these accounts should not be handed over to the Auditor-General, who is the representative of the people of Australia, and, so far aa the accounts of the Public Departments are concerned, stands actually above Ministers. If the Auditor-General is not called in . what safeguard has Parliament got? I remember the time when the State Parliament had no Auditor General, but when the first Commonwealth Government was formed, one of 'its first acts was to appoint an Auditor General. That officer is necessary to watch the operations of these friendlv gentlemen who, the Minister says, are such keen business fellows. If I had transactions with the Government, I should like always to appoint my own auditor. I guarantee that he would be more favourable to me than to the other side. If he did not do the business just as I wanted it done, I would not keep him. This auditor is the paid servant of these people, and the man in your papy performs the duties'you want him tx> perform. I am euro that when the time comes to go through the accounts of the various Boards that the Government have appointed, and that have been operating during the war period, two or three auditors-general will be required. So long as I am a member of this House, I shall always insist that no accounts involving any charge upon the Treasury of the Commonwealth be allowed to pass unless the Auditor-General is satisfied that they are correct. Otherwise, what is the good of having an Auditor-General ? should supervise the accounts, not only of all Government Departments, but also of all public utilities in which the Government is interested. If the allegation is that the Auditor-General is incapable, and that these outside business gentlemen have greater abilities, why does not the Minister tell us so? Why should the in terests of outside people be conserved in stead of the interests of the people generally ? There must be something hidden, or why the anxiety displayed by the Government here this morning? To my mind there is something being covered up. It may be because the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has been persistent in asking a number of ugly questions of the Government regarding a particular company. If that is the reason, why did not the Minister say so, and ask some other member to move for the appointment of the Auditor-General to supervise these accounts? The Minister should have the courage to tell U6 if that is the reason of his objection to the amendment. I do not believe the honourable member for Capricornia has any other motive than to conserve the in terests of the people of Australia. He is actuated by the best motives and intentions to secure the proper supervision of all accounts or expenditure in which the Government and the Commonwealth are concerned. There is a feeling in the public mind that we have not received a sufficient return for a great deal of the money that has been poured out during the war. It is our duty to satisfy the public that that is not the case, and we cannot do it better than by arranging for the supervision of all accounts by the Auditor-General. The Acting Leader of the Government (Mr Groom) has put some supposititious cases. I did not think that any Minister leading this National Parliament would sink to such a depth as the honourable gentleman sank to in making the comparisons he made this morning and suggesting the possibilities that would arise through the - Auditor General going through these accounts. I am. only a humble representative of the people, and have never had the' experience of being a Minister of the Crown ; He but I would never allow such a petty thought as the excuse put forward by the Minister to run through my mind. If the public generally could only learn of the struggle being waged in this House to persuade the Government to give the Auditor-General a free hand, we would have overwhelming sympathy behind our efforts. If the Government cannot be forced to accept the amendment, then honourable members on this side should - not be blamed if the people look upon the Federal Parliament as a decayed institution. The Auditor-General is one of the most important officers in the Public Service. In the matter of finance; and generally having to do with the expenditure of national money, there is no one in the land above that oflicial. Not one penny of the public's money should be expended until and unless the Auditor-General is satisfied that the people will get full value for the outlay. It is a mystery to me why the Government should not accept the amendment. The question whether Mr Allard may or may not have done his duty satisfactorily is altogether beside the mark. That individual, no doubt, is a friend of the vested interests; and I am bound to say that if I have a friend I make it my duty to try and keep him out of difficulties. But it is the Auditor-General who should be doing the work in his capacity as the f r i e nd of the people. Before the appointment of an Auditor-General in New South Wales, they used to buy wooden spoons out of loan funds. When an oflicial was appointed to the Auditor-Generalship, he was able to bring to light quite a lot of those little dealings. Human nature has not altered since those days im Sydney, and the greatest safeguard which the public could possibly establish is that of proper supervision. The only way to keep our national accounts correct is to eliminate every opportunity for them to become incorrect. We have an Auditor General who is above reproach, and I plead with the Government to accept the proposal to give him the desired supervision.",32
99,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Robertson) [12.40] The honourable member who has just addressed the Committee. (Mr West) holds that the amendment should be accepted because otherwise the Government would be accused of endeavouring to cover up some transactions which should be open to the light. The suggestion is that there is crooked work going on under the cover of these Pools. At first sight one might be inclined to support the amendment, but I draw attention to two statements of the Auditor-General himself concerning this matter. The Auditor-General, having considered the business of the wool tops, made the following memorandum:From many points of view this business is in a most indefinite and unsatisfactory position. Under the agreement between the Wool Tops Companies and the Government, the audit of the business of the Wool Tops Companies is to be conducted by an auditor nominated by the Commonwealth Government. Mr Allard, of Sydney, was appointed by the C r a l Wool ent - Committee as the auditor, the nomination by the Chairman of the Central Wool Committee being made on behalf of the Commonwealth Government (see clause 16 of the agreement). Correspondence has taken place between the Auditor-General and the Treasury in regard to the business of the companies concerned. The Auditor-General states that an outside auditor, not acting under his authority in oases where Commonwealth moneys are in-' volved, is not approved by him. Under the agreements large sums will be payable to the Commonwealth, and the Treasurer expresses the opinion that it is the duty of the Auditor-General to make the audits. The Treasurer also suggested that Mr Allard might be appointed by the Auditor-General to act as his deputy There the Auditor-General complains that the authority to audit those accounts is being taken away from him'; and if that had been so I would have been prepared to vote against the Government upon the amendment. But let us examine another statement, as presented by Mr C. J . Cerutty, Assistant Secretary to the Department of the Treasury, on the manufacture of wool topsOn the 6th November last the late Treasurer addressed to the Prime Minister a letter dealing with the audit of accounts of the firms who are manufacturing wool tops. A letter has now been received from the Auditor-General, in which he states he is prepared to formally appoint Mr George Mason Allard to act on his behalf in making .audits. The Auditor-General himself. has approved of the very man to whom he objected earlier. He asks that that party shall be appointed. The auditor concerned is appointed, and then the A u d itor-General complains, and states that he is not being given a fair deal. The statement from which I have just quoted proceedsMr Allard would also be required to certify to statements, and prepare reports for the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General considers that the alternative course, namely, for one of the Audit Office staff to make .inspections from time to time, would be inadvisable. The Treasurer concurs in the appointment of Mr Allard as suggested, if no objection is raised by the Central Wool Committee or by your Department. The Auditor-General, whether wittingly or not, has placed the Government and its supporters in an. absolutely false position; and members of the Opposition are trying to take advantage of it .",34
100,Mr EILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,What have we to gain by .it?,35
101,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I do not know. I do not say that the Opposition are proposing anything which might be deemed at all doubtful; but the course adopted by honourable members opposite, if it be based upon the second report of the A u d itor-General, becomes a false one, for the simple reason that the procedure taken is that which the Auditor-General himself laid down as proper. adopted by members of the Opposition is uot honest, because one of its members, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), stated a few minutes ago that he would break any agreement. One would think that we were back again in pre-war days. If an agreement is made by the Commonwealth, whether it be to the benefit or the detriment of the Commonwealth, surely Parliament is honest live up to such an I cannot understand how any man with morals of that sort is able to retain a seat in this House. Are we not. to be men of our word? Are we to calmly advocate the breaking of a contract or agreement solemnly entered into by the Government merely because it is believed to be operating in some way against them ? To advance such an argument is to reduce ourselves to the level of the H u n . men went overseas to fight the Germans .because of an agreement which tliey broke, and which they spoke of as "" a scrap of paper."" [4H ]",35
102,Mr BILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,C u t it out. What has' that to do with the Wool Committee?,35
103,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"What is to be pur position if the violation of agreements in this way is to be advocated. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has deliberately recommended that the Commonwealth should break an agreement into which it has entered. The whole position put here this morning is absolutely false. I rose simply to place these two statements by the Auditor-General in juxtaposition, so that the people mightbe able to see for themselves what methods are being adopted by the Opposition to destroy the Government.",35
104,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Dalley) [12.47] - I fail to understand why the Government should object to power being given to the Auditor-General to investigate all these matters. If , as the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom) has said, everything is clear and above-board, why should there be any objection to this amendment? Everything, probably, is quite all right. I do not for one moment cast any doubt upon the Acting Attorney-General's statement that the position in this connection is quite satisThe attitude factory, but the A u d it Act provides that the Auditor-General shall investigate andv report upon all transactions and account* of the Commonwealth Government. Herewe have an agreement entered into by the Central Wool Committee with certain* firms to carry on the manufacture of* wool tops. That Committee is merely exercising one of the functions of the Commonwealth Government under the the Federal jurisdiction of this Parliament, yet itsenough, to operations are not to be investigated by. agreement. the Auditor-General. Such a position cannot stand. The Acting Attorney General has attempted tb justify his opposition to our proposal by pointing, out that Mr Allar d has been selected by the parties concerned to audit the accounts. I do not think that the honourable gentleman informed the Committee that Mr . Allard's fees are being paid by the particular companies interested in this contract, Our and ""that the Government have no control over him. While everything connected .with this agreement may be quite above-board, if we allow the principle to creep in that the Auditor-General is not to - examine the accounts relating to such transactions, we may say good-bye to the confidenceof the people in the administration of the affairs of the country. The Auditor-General himself desires to make this audit, and the very fact that he has expressed a desire to do so should be sufficient to induce the Government to give him. the necessary authority. The late Lord Forrest, when Treasurer of the Commonwealth, also desired that these accounts should be examined by the Auditor-General, but the only answer we receive to our request is that the parties concerned have agreed upon the employment of an outside auditor. investigation is not a sufficient security for the Commonwealth. We should demand that our own Auditor-General, who is above suspicion, reliable, and independent, and who is beyond the power of any private company, should carry out this work. He has not to depend upon any private company for his means ol livelihood.",35
105,Mr HIGGS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Who ever heard of a Government fighting its own Auditor General ?,36

110,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That scandal might have been avoided if the Auditor-General had possessed the power which we desire to give him in this case. The wool agreement may be quite all right, but attitude now taken up ' by the Governtion ment is calculated to leave a doubt in the minds of the people.

111,Mr HIGGS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Does the honourable member know that Mr Allar d himself does not audit these accounts, but employs a clerk to do so ?",36
112,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In all probability that is so. Mr Allar d stands very high, in his profession, but we must remember that he has to depend for his livin g upon the work given him by private firms. The whole of the accounts of the Committees appointed by the Government to deal with shipping, wool, sugar, and navy matters should be subject to the scrutiny of the Auditor-General.",36

The Central Wool Commitbe tee is composed of is number of gentleto men of great .business knowledge and exhonorable perience, who have made their mark in the commercial life of Australia, and are reputed to be men of honour. I wish to know whether these honourable men apfor Capricornia (Mr Higgs). prove of the action of their Chairman setting at defiance, first of all, the pressed wish, of an ex-Treasurer of Comanonwealth, the late Lord Forrest, and, secondly, the expressed desire Auditor-General that he should have right to thoroughly investigate all these niatters? Surely these gentlemen could not have known that the late Lord Forwealth, rest made a direct request - that the Audiauditor? tor-General should have this right, and that the Auditor-General had directly asked for the authority to examine these agreements. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) is a member the Central Wool Committee. He is man of great business experience, and reputed to be a millionaire, as the result of the honourable conduct of his business. Was he consulted on this matter as a member of the Central Wool Committee? Did he agree that the direct request of the Auditor-General should be refused, and that a private auditor, beyond the control of the Government of this countral try, should have the auditing of these agreements intrusted to him? I am sure Allard ? that the honourable member for Grampians did not build up his successful business on such lines. He would scout the idea of having any one over whom he had no control dealing with his private financial affairs. The honoraible member for Hume (Mr. Falkiner) is also a member of the. Central Wool Committee, and a man of great business experience. He is also reputed to be a millionaire. He has been engaged in. commercial pursuits, and is a director of the Bank of New South Wales. Does lie agree that a private auditor should supersede the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth ? If I asked him whether the authorities of the bank of which he a director would allow some one over whom they had no control to audit their bat. of affairs, I am sure that his answer would that they would not think of agreeing any such thing. I am sure that the member, if present, would vote against the Government in this matter, and would be found supporting the amendment submitted by the honourable member, Other in members of the Central Wool Committee exare Mr Walter James Young, Mr Anthe drew Howard Moore, Mr W. S. Frazer, Mr Burdett Laycock, and Mr Robert of the Bond MCComas. Did Sir John Higgins the consult these gentlemen, and ask them whether they were prepared to set aside the Auditor-General of the Commonand put in his place a private I feel sure that if they had been consulted they would not have agreed to the adoption of such a course, and if they were members of this House they would be ranged behind the honourable of member for Capricornia. Perhaps the a honourable member for Grampians will is say whether he agrees to the appointment of Mr Allard in this matter, and whether the Auditor-General should be superseded.",36
122,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,Most certainly I do agree to the appointment of Mr Allard.,37
123,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,I ask the honourable member whether the chairman of the CenWool Oommittee consulted him in reference to the appointment of Mr.,37
124,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,The honourable member will not answer that question.,37
125,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"'That only bears out my statement concerning the honourable member. He refuses to tell an untruth. It is quite obvious, from the honourable member's attitude, that it was Sir John Higgins, and not the Central Wool Committee, who made this appointment, and that the members of the Central Wool Committee were never consulted about it.",37
126,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,Do not say that.,37
127,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"i l asked the question plainly, and the honourable member, being a truthful man, and loyal to aÂ« comrade, refuses to say anything against the Chairman of the Wool Committee. It must be is quite clear to honourable members that Sir John Higgins did this thing off his own Have the affairs of this country come to such a pass that Sir John H i g gins, no matter how honourable a man he may be personally, may override the laws of this country and set himself beyond this Parliament. No matter what this gentleman may be as a private citizen, no matter how honourable, it is time he was plainly told that Parliament, and not he,"" is the supreme authority in Australia. It would be just as well, perhaps, to glance at the Audit Act, which sets outthat it isAn Act to make provision for the Collection and Payment of the Public Moneys, the Audit of the Public Accounts, and the Protection and Recovery of Publio Property, and for other purposes. Thus the intentions of the Act are set out clearly; and why should those intentions be put on one side ? As to the position of the Auditor-General, section 5 of the Act says(1) The Auditor-General shall not, during his continuance in such office, be capable of being a member of the Executive Council of the Commonwealth, or of any State thereof, or of either House of the Parliament of the' Commonwealth, or of any State thereof. (2) The Auditor-General shall be deemed to have vacated his office(a) if he directly or indirectly engages in any paid employment outside the duties of his office, or in any trade or business except as a member of any registered company; . . . Why were these provisions passed? To every insure the free and untrammelled services of a competent Auditor-General, beyond any outside or private influences; in short, a man in whose reports the public could have perfect confidence.",37
128,The CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,The honourable member has exhausted his time.,38
129,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Illawarra [ 2 . 3 8 ] - I should like the guidance Chair on a matter of procedure.

130,The CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE," When we reach the schedule it will be competent for the honourable member to move an amendment, and if the schedule is altered, then the Committee may alter the clause in conformity therewith.",38
131,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Dampier) [2.40] I do not know whether the object of the Opposition is to "" stone-wall"" the Bill . I myself support the amendment, but I cannot follow the arguments of some honourable members opposite who also support it . Never for a moment could I identify myself with the statements made this morning to the effect that a private auditor can hardly be expected to bring in a report against a company, because, if he does so, he may lose other business. Those in the profession, as a rule, are gentlemen qf high integrity, and there should be no reflection on that profession generally, or on Mr Allard in particular, who, moreover, is approved by the Auditor-General. In my opinion, a -' red herring "" is being drawn across the trail. There is no objection in any shape or form to Mr All a r d ; the question isand here, I think, I speak for the mover of the amendment-whethe r the auditor shall be under the control of Sir John Higgins or under the control of the Auditor-General.",38
132,Mr HIGGS,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is the whole point.,38
133,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The question is, whether Mr All a r d , as to whose integrity one is satisfied, shall receive his in structions from the Auditor-General or from Sir John Higgins, and it is for the House to determine.",38

135,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The contracts provide that there shall be an auditor approved by the Commonwealth, and here ) we haye the Prime Minister and Sir of the John Higgins acting contrary to the wishes of an ex-Treasurer (the late Lord Forrest) and the Auditor-General. As I pointed out last night, the Commonare partners in this agreementI dewith the Colonial Combing, Spinning, clause be and Weaving Company.",38
136,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Would an auditor of any status accept instructions from anybody in the conduct of an audit?,38
137,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Most decidedly. This is one of the most extraordinary agreements that I ever saw, bristling as it does with impertinences so far as this House is ooncerned. We find Sir John Higgins putting himself above and beyond this Parliament. War-time Profits Act providing that firms shall pay to the iCrown 50 per cent, and 75 per cent, of excess profits. We might have made the proportion 9'0 per cent., or even 100 per cent.; but according to the AgreementIf the earnings of the company in any accounting period during the continuance of the agreement shall become taxable under any special taxation imposed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth on profits earned in war - time, then the Commonwealth Government shall refund to the company an amount equal to one-half of the war-time profits tax which shall be payable. In any case, under this agreement, we become partners, and it is only right that in every matter pertaining to it the supervision should be under the control of the Auditor-General.",38
138,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVICE,What is the objection to the Auditor-General?,39
139,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I cannot understand, except that the Prime Minister approved of this auditor, who was nominated, I assume, by Sir John Higgins, thus nullifying the wishes of the Auditor General.",39
140,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,There never was a request that the Auditor-General so. should do the auditing. He was not prepared to do the work himself; he only wants to boss some one else in the doing of it .,39

142,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The trouble is that liament has lost control of itself, and unequal to the job.",39
143,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Quite so; and I feel quite sure that the public will show us in the near f u t u r e that they appreing ciate the fact.,39
144,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,Then why does honourable member support the Governsire ment? Why does he hang on to us like a barnacle?,39
145,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,The member need not be afraid of my hangshould ing on to him or his politics.,39
146,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I shifted across here of my own free will. If I thought like you, I would not remain here. We passed a",39
147,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member, perhaps, is in the habit of "" s h if t in g across,"" but I sit here to advocate a fixed policy, and I shall follow it . The honourable member knows how extreme are the views of 6ome honourable members opposite, and I know he would go far for the purpose of placating them. I have no desire myself to placate those who sit in opposition, and I am here to fight for Parliament. having control of the public finances. Only this morning we read in the newspapers of an enormous purchase of shipping. This purchase may, or may not, be in the best interests of the country, but there is no reason, particularly when Parliament is sitting, why such a transaction should not first be approved by us. We ought to see that we do not forfeit our rights in connection with matters of that sort, and, in the case immediately under discussion , we should insist on the supremacy of the Auditor-General. The Minister in charge of the Bill has told us that the Auditor-General does audit the accounts generally, and if we look at the Butter Pool regulations we see that he is specially instructed to do",39
148,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"And in the case of the Wool Committee exactly the same thing is done. If the honourable member has any qualms, I am quite ready to have is regulations prepared in the same terms",39

It should have been in sisted in the first instance that the audit must be under the Auditor-General, and, the while I am sure none of us has any deto reflect on the auditor who has been appointed, it is undeniable that his instructions should come direct from the honourable Auditor-General, . and the Committee insist' on t h it nrocedure being adopted.",39
150,Dr MALONEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Melbourne) [2.53] - rThis clause' opens up a question which, has often been' before the House, mainly, at the instance of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). with the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) in his reference to Mr . All a r d ; but if I had to appoint an in my own interests, I should see that no one but myself paid him for his services. The speech of the Minister in charge of the Bill (Mr Groom) was a hide-it, coverit-up, camouflage speech; and I use those terms in their strongest sense. When I asked the honourable gentleman who paid the auditor, he was conveniently deaf; but I say that he would not dare face an election, either here or in Sydney, on the question of who should.be trusted in such a matter-a n outside auditor paid by an outside body, or. our Auditor-General, Mr Israel. If the Auditor-General is not to be more depended on than an outside man, any member who thinks so should take steps to have him removed - from his position; but I do not think any one in the House would dare to impugn Mr Israel or his Department. The Acting Attorney-General would not dare to fight an election in Melbourne or Sydney when advocating that a private accountant and h o t the Auditor-General should have the supervision of transactions in which Commonwealth money was involved. The people know that there is so much bribery, corruption, and f r a u d existing at the present time that the M in ister, even with the aid of a powerful press, would be in a hopeless position. Every person who has experienced that the purchasing power of the sovereign has decreased during the last few years to 12s. 6d., knows the truth of what I have stated. Why will not the Government allow these transactions to be controlled by our duly appointed officer, who is independent of the Government; and, while he is in the right, independent of even this Parliament. No one knows better than the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell) that the criminal records of Victoria, following the bursting of the land boom, are full of fraudulent balance sheets that had not been properly audited. Most magnificent balance-sheets were produced, but they represented nothing but frau d and flam. One man failed for the sum of Â£1,500,000, and offered a composition of ^d. in the Â£ 1 , Which was never I agree paid. A member of the Victorian Parliament at that time, when speaking of a particular balance-sheet, said, "" Everyauditor thing looks lovely. There is a splendid credit balance and fine dividends on paper, but where is the money?"" Paragraph 10 of the agreement made between the Commonwealth Government and Whiddon Brothers Limited, of Sydney, readsAll books, vouchers, and 'documents in the possession or under the control of the company, and relating to the purchase, manufacture, and/or sale of the sheepskins, wool and wool tops referred to in these presents shall be produced to an auditor nominated by the Commonwealth Government for that purpose",40
151,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,That was Mr Allard.,40
152,Dr MALONEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I presume soSuch auditor shall be a properly qualified public accountant, and the cost of the audit shall be borne by the company, and shall be included in the expenses referred to in clause 6 hereof. The man who pays the piper has the righ t to call the tune, and if there is anything to hide it is well tp be the person who is paying the piper. That was proved in contestibly in the terrible land boom crash. Honourable members cannot gainsay that there is a widespread feeling among the people that they are being wronged. Let honourable members opposite go upon the platform and say that there is no profiteering.",40
153,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,We have not said that.,40
154,Dr MALONEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I admit that honourable members on the Government side have not said so, but some have asked, ""Where are the profiteers?"" If the Government recognise that there is profiteering, why are they not fighting the evil as it is being fought in other countries? Do they wish to force the people into revolt? We are nearer to that sort"" of trouble than some honourable members think. The one thing that is holding the people in check is that they are determined not to be confronted by machine guns. The Government or whoever says there is no profiteering may have to face that fate. Before the Royal Commission, in Sydney, Mr Darling said that the Georgeson agreement was made either hy a rogue or a fool. Afterwards, under cross-examination, he withdrew the word "" rogue "" ; but the fact remains that 6,000,000 bushels of wheat is said to have been lost, and much of it has been stolen. I cannot understand why any honourable member should vote in favour of having a public accountant to audit transactions in which Commonwealth funds are involved in preference to an audit by the Commonwealth Auditor-General. The Government have a great opportunity to do what is right. We have"" not yet touched the first penny of the last shilling that was promised by a former Government to win the war, but SO per cent, of the eligible fighting men were sent out of the country. What are we doing to safeguard the people's money ? Will any honourable member say that in respect of wheat, wool, or sugar all that should have been done has been done? Both parties in this House are to blame; but I shall never forget the breach of the pledge made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), that the civil law would always be superior to the military law. Por one pin-pose only I would like to continue the War Precautions Act, namely, to control the prices of the people's food. our duty to safeguard the finances, and see that the .people are not robbed as they have been robbed too freely in the past.",40
155,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darling) [2.59] We have increasing evidence of - the necessity for a close scrutiny of all tracts in which the Commonwealth or States are interested. The CommonHarbor, wealth is directly involved in the transacloaded, tions of the Central Wool Committee, this Parliament must accept responsiing bility for anything done by that mittee under the powers conferred by Bill. We know that, owing to lax methods Company. of audit and faulty surveillance of the operations of the Wheat Pool, especially General. in New South Wales, there is such utter chaos that for two and a half years of accountants has been trying to trace the 1915-16 crop, and if they were there for two years and a half more they would not have the slightest hope of tracing that crop, simply because of the lax methods employed in dealing with the matter from the commencement. After the muddle had been properly established the authorities hurriedly got together an army of accountants to get them out of it. I am yet to be convinced that the Central Wool Committee will not get into the same kind of muddle that has characterized the Wheat Board, particularly in New South Wales. I shall quote two instances proving how necessary it is to utilize the services of the Auditor-General to* enable this Parliament to know how the Central Wool Committee and the State Wool Committees are operating. Every honourable member has received from John Bridge and Company a pamphlet referring to ,an arrangement which was entered into between that firm and the Central Wool Committee, by which the firm was to put up a dumping plant for double-dumping wool bales. They were to be paid 3s. per bale by the ship-owners. However, because certain high officials on the Wool Committee and the Shipping Administration had shares in a _ lightering and wool-dumping proposition It is Mr JOWETT - They were not officials of the Central Wool Committee.",41
156,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"They were on the Shipping Administration. At any rate, (one high official on the Shipping Administration held 1,600 shares in a lightering great and wool-dumping proposition, and the conpeople with whom he was associated were the able to hang up seven ships in Sydney and prevent theni from being simply because his friends and his and firm were not allowed to do the dumpowing to the ar.rani.gement which Comwas entered into between the Central this Wool Committee and John Bridge and That shows the urgent necessity for investigation by the Auditor",41
157,Mr EODGERS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Not those facts. They a staff show just the opposite;,41
158,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,My honourable friend probably does not understand the position.,42
159,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,Yes ; he understands it thoroughly.,42
160,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Agreement s were entered into by the Central Wool Committee with this particular firm.,42
161,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,Has the honourable member seen those agreements?,42
162,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,-No . I am relying on a most interesting circular which was sent to every honourable member of the House by John Bridge and Company. Does the honourable member say that no agreement exists?,42
163,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,I think that is the position. There is no agreement between John Bridge and Company and the Central Wool Committee.,42
164,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Si r John Higgins said that there was an agreement, and he adhered to it, even at the risk of making enemies in New South Wales. If tliere was no agreement, why did he go out of his way to carry out something that was not in existence, and give that particular firm the wool which he had promised to < provide for it? Surely the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) is not in earnest when he says there was no agreement ?",42
165,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,I do not think that there was any agreement. Mr BLAKELEY.'- The honourable member knows nothing about the inatter. 'Evidently he does not know what the Central Wool Committee are doing.,42

168,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is only the honourable member's ex parte statement.,42
169,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,I challenge the honourable member to tell the truth about the matter. I am quite convinced as to the facts. The honourable member evidently knew nothing about them until John Bridge and Company's pamphlet reached him.,42
170,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,"At any rate, all this haa nothing to do with the amendment before the Committee.",42
171,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is one way for the honourable member to evade his responsibility.,42
172,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am not' evading any . responsibility. The honourable ""member is making statements which are absolutely unwarranted.",42
173,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Has the Central Wool Committee taken any step with regard to this pamphlet? The statements in it are true or untrue. If they are true they are'a reflection on the administration of the Central Wool Committee, of which the honourable member is a member.",42
174,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,They do not reflect in the slightest degree on the Central Wool Committee. t,42
175,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"They do, because they show that the Committee cannot control the New South Wales portion of its operations, and that it has allowed members of the State Committee to become merely the creatures of the woolbrokers of that State. - Mr JOWETT - That is another absolutely unfounded statement.",42

178,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Can we imagine a more deplorable position ? Seven ships laid up because of the machinations of certain people! ,42

'This matter of the dumping arrangements alone could have occupied the attention of the Attorneybefore it could continue operations.

This is necessary, in order to prevent profit being made out of the increase the weight of the wool by the accuCommittee, mulation of moisture. formed that wool has been known to increase in weight owing to the there absorption of moisture by anything 2 lbs. to 11 lbs. per bale. that a firm was fined for not weighing wool withi n the required period. In fact, [412] some of the wool had been lying in store for two months, and, naturally, it in creased in weight by 6 lbs. or 7 lbs. per bale, according to whether it was in the interior or on the exterior of the stack. I am further informed that a member of the firm which was fined Â£ 5 0 for the first offence was a member of the .State Wool Committee. Evidently the offence was repeated, because it anpears that the firm was subsequently fined Â£2,500.",43

No honourable member can say, even by the greatest stretch of imagination, that any principle is at stakeThe amendment is bond fide. It asks that the proper authorities, who are the servants of the Commonwealth, shall have access to the books and report to this Parliament everything which, in their opinion, is not correct. Who should receive reports' diB inot this Parliament?. Surely the matter concerns this Parliament and the people. I hope the Minister will be reasonable, and not regard the amendment as hostile.

202,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Maribyrnong) [3.18] I am surprised that when such an - important discussion is taking place those who know quite a number of the facts in connection with the operations of the Central W o o l Committee are - absolutely dumb. I do not suggest that there is any sinister or ulterior motive in their silence, but it is remarkable that on previous occasions, on the slightest, provocation, the honoraible member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has sprung to his feet to defend the Wool Committee from A to Z . During this protracted discussion of some of the most important aspects of the get operations of the Committee he has remained absolutely silent, but for a few exceptionally irrelevant interjections, made with a view to throwing off the track those who are trying to elicit the facts. I regret that the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) is not here. He worked himself into a beaut if u l frenzy this morning over a mere nothing. When I saw him doing the "" bashi-bazouk "" dance that he usually does at the end of the table, and which always makes me think that the mace is are in danger, dt struck me that he often allows himself to be carried away by operations flights of imagination. Because I interjected when the Acting Attorney-General Ap- was speaking that any agreement detrimental to the people of the Commonwealth should be terminated, the honourable member became very excited. I repeat now, without equivocation or qualification, that if any agreement is made, either by Ministers or by those operating under Ministers, which is detrimental to the interests of the people of the Commonwealth, I shall take the first opportunity to smash it into smithereens. The idea of a man working himself into a fine frenzy, and talking about the German Kaiser tearing up a treaty as a scrap of paper, and asking, "" What did we go to the other side of the world to fight for ? "" My experience of returned men, both those connected with my own family and others, has been that those who have done Several most on the other side have the least to say about what happened there. We do not want this continual humbugging and boasting from the other side whenever a man on this side makes a reasonable proposal. There are honourable agreements honourably entered into, and no sane man would think of abrogating them, but I want to place it on record that I will do my best to abrogate any agreement which is detrimental to the people of Ihe Commonwealth. We have in this Parliament repealed without compunction whole Statutes because we considered them in imical to the interests of the people. One of the first acts of the Fisher Government in the session of 1910 was to wipe out of existence a Naval Loan Bill , and substitute for it a policy with which the people of Australia were in accord then, and have been in accord ever since. The Acting Attorney-General gave the whole - show away this morning in his reply. He spoke his usual persuasive way, and I believe that when the whip is cracked over there honourable members do somehow come to heel. The honourable member for Robert-, son (Mr Fleming) came to heel, although previously he was almost bursting with indignation and trying to get to his feet to advocate an amendment which was bn all-fours with what the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has proposed.",44
203,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,Who brought him to heel ?,45
204,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Acting Attorney .General, and he brought a few more heel also. There have been number of whips at work tryin g to conanother State. vert some bf the irreconcilables on that side lest they should vote with the position on this item. The Minister gave his case away by saying that could assure members on the Government side that in any future arrangements Auditor-General would have full access to all the papers and documents. W h an admission for him to make! Honorover able members can bet their bottom dolbelieve lar, in view of the discussion which has taken place about many of the irregucompany larities in connection with these operathe tions, that the Ministry and the Wool Committee will be muchi more careful i any f u t u r e arrangements they enter than they have been in some cases in past. Under the A u d it Act we thought the Auditor-General had unWales Companies Act. limited power. He has power superior to the Government of the day, and insijst upon doing certain things against the unanimous expression of times in Victoria. opinion of the Cabinet itself. supreme over Parliament and Ministers, and over everybody who has the handnow ling of the finances of the Commonwealth. He has power to call for papers and to send officers even as far as London. He has officers in London now, and can go outside the Commonwealth in order to examine every possible item minutely. We are conducting pools which involve millions of money. It is true, as the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) said recently, that the House is losing the control of the finances to a very large extent. Great in schemes are indulged in involving the* expenditure of millions of the taxpayers' money, and we are often involved in that expenditure without Parliament being consulted. In some cases I quite agree with what has been done, as, for instance, the first purchase of steamers by the Prime Minister. But if the Wool Committee is to be allowed to do what its own sweet will dictates, and .this Parliament is to have no say, and if the same thing is to happen in connection with the wheat, flax, and butter pools, a loophole is opened for practices which the House cannot afford to sanc- tion. Matters have taken place in conto nexion with a branch of the Wheat Pool quite a that are now before a tribunal in Enough evidence has been taken to show that in a so-called Opwell-conducted Poo] there may be a leakage of millions of bushels of wheat. he Where has that missing wheat gone? The Ministry should be the first to say the that, to insure the protection of the people, it is absolutely essential to allow at the Auditor-General to have oversight all these operations. I am led to on very good authority that New South Wales is. far behind Victoria in its law. I understand that under New South Wales Companies Act many practices can be indulged in that n - are not allowed in Victoria. The cominto panies referred to by the honourable memthe ber for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) have always been formed under the New South There may be a possibility under that A ct of can things being done similar to what even' took place in the disastrous boom Because of the colH e is lapse after the boom' we tightened up our company law - The Victorian Act sets out in fair and square legal terms exactly what a company director and a company auditor must and must not do. It is a difficult matter under the Victorian companies law for even an erring officer, where he is so inclined, to err. Many things are possible if a company is being carried on under a loose company law. Speeches from both sides of this chamber show that there is an air of suspicion abroad. We cannot dissipate it better than by providing that in all future contracts the Auditor-General shall have supervision over those conducting these concerns, and we should go further and apply the same principle to existing contracts and operations.' The Auditor General has to take an oath to the following effect, upon his assumption of office: I do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that according to the best of my skill and ability I will faithfully impartially and truly execute the office and perform the duties of Auditor-General (or as the case may be) according to law. In section 71 of the A u d it Act it is enacted thatThe Governor General may make regulations (not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act) for carrying out the provisions of this Act, and in particular for(a) the collection, receipt, custody, expenditure due, accounting for, and management of all public moneys, and the guidance of all persons concerned therein; (6) the more effectual record, examination, inspection, and audit of all receipts and expenditure, and the keeping of all necessary books and accounts. The A u d it Act itself proclaims to the Government what are their duties in connection with the Wool Pool. The Auditor General is a greater custodian of the finances of the country bhan the Eederal Treasurer. He is the policeman, or the . detective, who must scrutinize all expenditure, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. He has the power to arraign the highest in the land if anything of a crooked nature in connection with the finances of the country should be disclosed. But here we are dealing with millions, and yet that official is not to be permitted supervision over the accounts. I know that there will be a spirit of amazement among the people when it is learned that such a reasonable and righteous reMr jFenton. quest as is contained in the amendment has been declined by the Government and their supporters. The Government themselves, for self-protection, should see that operations are conducted in an absolutely honest and straightforward manner. They should give to the Auditor-General power to scrutinize all such matters. Honourable members have just received a return having to do with the approximate receipts and expenditure of the Commonwealth for the financial year just closed. Why is the item of sugar included in a public balance-sheet such as that? Are the receipts from the Wool Pool, and the other pools, lost in those big amounts which total, for the year 1917-18, more than a million of money, under the head of Miscellaneous, and, for the' past year, a sum of Â£863,000? There is an amount in relation to the two companies which was to come to the Commonwealth Government totalling Â£250,000 sterling. I know that litigation is in progress with respect to some of the items comprised within that total. I shall not proceed further in that direction, therefore. Surely the Auditor-General should have something to say as to how that money has been made. At any rate, he should issue, be permitted to scrutinize the books and cave' accounts, and to ascertain whether the Commonwealth has been getting a fair deal. If it were only the matter of a lOs - note, the Auditor ' should have power to discover whether the money was going rightly or wrongly into the public or int o a private purse - If he were to discover anything wrong, even in relation to such a small amount as that, there would be ample justification for his inspection of the interests involved. Looking at the matter from a political point of view, a decidedly retrograde step has been made by the refusal of the. Government to accept the amendment. Honourable members on this side are championing public financial morality. I do not intend to lay charges, but honourable members may go into wool houses in Melbourne and hear what business men have to say regarding the operations of the Wool Committee and its unjust methods and dealings. They will be told sufficient for them to demand the appointment of a Royal Commission in order to show exactly what the true position is. During the week I have heen in the company of men who know as much as, if not more thanj either the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner), or the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), 'about the wool business, and those men are emphatic in condemnation of' some of the operations of the Pool. That being so, is it not as well to try and allay such suspicions, and to allow the Auditor General to get at the books of the companies involved ? The Minister cannot deny that if a Royal Commission were sitting today, and the Auditor-General were asked whether he sbould have access to those books, he would respond in an emphatic affirmative. If our request that the supervision of the Auditor General be granted means the breaking of an agreement-as has been allegedthen that agreement must be a very rotten affair.",45
205,Mr HIGGS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Why are they fighting their own Auditor-General?,47
206,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is the question. Honourable members opposite stated yesterday that the Auditor-General was one of the finest public servants ' in the Commonwealth. Y e t there is Ministerial opposition to giving an officer of such superlative qualities his proper rights of supervision. . It is quite likely that, at some later stage, Parliament will be asked, not only to amend the present Bill , but to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the operations of all the Pools. I realise today, however, that the Ministerial whip has been cracked. Honourable members opposite must pooket their own views, and. their principles too-if they have themand must vote in a direction contrary to their beliefs. They have come to heel upon' a question which should be free from party bias or politics.",47
207,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Perth) [3.43] - The statement of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) does not satisfy me-no t because it goes too .far, but for the reason that it does not go far enough. It is not sufficiently comprehensive to meet the position indicated by several honourable members opposite. While two specific firms have been singled out, there [413] are, no doubt, many other activities in which the Government are interested to a greater or less degree as a partner, and which should be subject to inspection and investigation. There is no question that the Government is committed to these agreements. If an amendment of the nature put forward by the honourable member for Capricornia were carried, it would undoubtedly be equivalent to a vote of no-confidence in the Government. I am not prepared to see the Government resign upon a minor issue. I want to see something larger before Parliament expresses an opinion of so serious a nature. If the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) will' introduce a comprehensive proposal intimating that this House desires 'an investigation of all concerns in which the Government and Parliament are interested, I will' give it my hearty support.",47
208,Mr HIGGS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I believe the Auditor General has power over all the other transactions and operations of companies, except in regard to these two companies.",47
209,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am not sure whether his power goes as far as that suggested by the honourable member's amendment. , It certainly would be advisable to put the position beyond question by definitely indicating the duty of the Auditor General in regard to all these concerns. It is not sufficient to leave to his discretion the extent to which his investigations shall go. He should receive from this Parliament a precise direction, and I would certainly be glad to support a provision to that effect.",47
210,Mr HIGGS,PUBLIC SERVICE,I am afraid the Government would put such a proposal at the bottom of the business-paper.,47
211,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Othe r methods of obtaining the opinion of the House are open to the honourable member, and I , again pledge myself to support him if he adopts any of those methods. There is no question as to the necessity for a careful supervision and investigation of many of these business interests into which the Government have entered. A more comprehensive method is desirable, and I believe that both the Parliament and the people desire something of the kind. There is, I regret to say, an atmosphere of suspicion surrounding a good many of the operations of these governmental activities, and it is our duty to dissipate that atmosphere at the earliest moment. I shall, however, support the Government in regard to this amendment, not because I wish to spare their feelings, but for the reason that I wish to see an issue of the kind raised by the honourable member put before us in a more general and comprehensive way.

212,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways and Acting Attorney-General) [ 4 . 0 ] - I move That the House do now adjourn. In view of the long debate that has taken place on the Commercial Activities Bill , I ask honourable members to assist me - to get the Bill passed early next week. I think that they will agree that it has had ample discussion.",48
213,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yarra) [4.1] - I take advantage of ihe motion to direct the attention, of the Minister leading the House to a matter of urgent public importance. I raise the question now with a view to obtaining information from the honourable gentleman on the subject when the House meets on Wednesday next. It is known to every one that, owing to the present industrial dispute, a great number of people are out of employment, particularly in the metropolitan area of this State. Several deputations have waited upon the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) in connection with the matter. I was present with more than one of those deputations, and as a result of their representations the honourable gentleman granted the sum of Â£1,000 for the relief of distress in Melbourne. The Victorian Government granted a similar amount. When the matter was referred to, a fortnight or three weeks ago, the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond), I think, . asked similar assistance would be given in the other States. I ask the Government to see that the assistance given for the relief of distress in the metropolitan area of this State shall be the same as that given in New South Wales. I can assure honourable members that the distress here is acute, because I happen to live in a district in which there are a great number of unemployed at the present time, and have come directly in contact with some of the relief work. Whilst a grant of Â£1,000 was made by the Federal Government, and a grant of a similar amount by the State Government in Victoria, in New South Wales Â£5,000 was granted by the Federal Government and Â£5,000 by the New South Wales Gwernment, although I am glad to say that the distress has not been so great in New South Wales as, unfortunately, it is in this State. The factories in New Sonth Wales are nearer to the coal supplies, and therefore can be kept, going more easily than can the factories here. I ask the Minister leading the House to see - whether it is not possible for additional assistance to be given tb the Trades Hall Belief Committee in Melbourne, who have' been distributing relief granted here. There is one thing noticeable in connection with the distribution of relief by benevolent societies, [413]- 2 and it is that people wbo go to such societies for relief make a habit of going to them - Robert Hunter has made-that statement in his book Poverty, and I am able to confirm it by personal experience, as my wife has been associated with the Ladies' Benevolent Society of the eity of Richmond for the past twelve or fifteen years, and it is the experience of that society that, once people come to them for assistance, they continue to do so, and are very reluctant to cease. It is possible that if the local distribution of grants for relief by the Commonwealth and State Governments is adopted it may have the effect of sapping the independence of people who go to the relief committees for assistance, inasmuch as they may be led to believe that they will be entitled to such charitable relief at all times. It will be admitted that if that were the effect it would not be to the advantage of the community. Perhaps the Minister will see if it is correct that the Federal whether' Government has granted Â£5,000 for the relief of distress in Sydney, where,, apparently, the distress is not so great as in Melbourne, and only Â£1,000 for the relief of distress here. I believe that there has not been a single word in criticism of the fairness of the distribution of the grant for relief by the Melbourne Trades Hall Relief Committee. Any one .who has had anything to do with relief work must be aware that, no matter by whom relief is distributed, there will be found people who will try to impose upon those in charge of it ; but I do not think that there will be a greater percentage of such cases coming before the Trades Hall Relief Committee than before the local committees. I hope that the Government will look into the matter with a view of seeing whether the relief of persons in distress may not be more fairly adjusted than it appears to be at the present time.",49
214,Mr BURCHELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Fremantle) [4.4] After listening to the appeal mode by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), one is tempted to ask the Minister now leading the Government in. this House what they are doing to provide for the relief of distress in each of the States of the Commonwealth. We can all appreciate the difficulties under which working men and women are labouring at the piesent time. In Western Australia people are suffering very severely, indeed, as a result of the shipping strike, and representatives of that State are constantly being bombarded with requests for some amelioration of the .position. Ordinary merchandise, for example, has been overcarried to the eastern States, and efforts are now being made to have it returned; in the meantime the community generally are suffering quite as much as the residents in manufacturing centres. When the Acting Leader of the House is replying to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor), I hope we shall have some comprehensive statement as to what is being done by the Government in each State.",49
215,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darling Downs-Actin g Attorney-General) ' [4.6].i- I shall have both the matters referred to looked into, and see that an answer is supplied later on. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.7 p.m.",50
