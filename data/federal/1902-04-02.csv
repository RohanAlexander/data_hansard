1,Mr ISAACS,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,"I rise for the purpose of asking the Prime Minister a question with reference to a matter which is agitating the minds of the people of this country in an almost unprecedented degree. I wish to know if he has received any information from the Home Government or the South African authorities with regard to the execution of two Australian officers, Lieutenant Morant and Lieutenant Hancock, and the imprisonment of a third, Lieutenant Witton . I think it needs no words of mine to assure the right honourable and learned gentleman that a complete elucidation of this matter is awaited with very intense interest in Australia.",14
2,Mr BARTON,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,"I am endeavouring to obtain information. I need not say that it would be most unwise for any of us to come to a conclusion or form any judgment on the subject in view of the conflicting accounts that have appeared. Much of the information I have received has been derived entirely from private conversations, and under circumstances which forbid the repeti tion of the conversations to the House. Such information as I - have been able to afford has been stated by me as it has been presented in the press. It appears that on the wounding of Captain H u n t and the retirement of the Carbineers, who were outnumbered on that occasion, they were reinforced and came back to the scene. They there found Captain Hunt who had been shot, I believe, through the lungs-dead , and seriously battered about, with his neck broken-whethe r before or after death I cannot say-and with his eyes protruding. On the capture of a Boer laager there was found a Boer who, unlike his comrades, was not able to escape, being wounded in the foot. He was in khaki and had some article of the clothing of Captain Hunt in hispossession. Hewas tried hydrumhead court-martial by the three lieutenants, and on his being convicted he was shot. Further information, so far as I am able to disclose it , goes to this effect:-That the same party of the corps captured two parties of Boers, one numbering eight and another numbering three. On their capture of these two parties no court-martial apparently - was held. There does not seem to be any clear evidence that the Boers were caught wearing the uniform of the British army, so that that point is still in doubt. These men were shot, and I am not in any way credibly informed that they were submitted to court-martial. It remains to be seen whether they were identifiable with those who had maltreated Captain H u n t before or after death. There is no satisfactory information on that point. If they could not be identified, of course honourable members will form their conclusions as to whether they should have been shot. The other officer who has been mentioned, Major Lenehan, was at a distance of 70 miles from these occurrences. On their return to or towards Pietersburg the three lieutenants were placed under arrest, and they were tried some four months afterwards. Lieutenant Morant, who had gone out from Australia in one of the contingents, and was the son of an English admiral; Lieutenant Hancock, who came from Australia, and was an Australian ; and Lieutenant Witton, were all convicted of ordering, or being accomplices in - I do not know exactly how it standsthe murder of these Boers. The two first mentioned were shot; the sentence of the third was commuted, - I believe, by the Commander-in-Chief in South Africa, to - imprisonment for life. Major Lenehan, against whom several charges were brought, was eventually convicted on only one-that of having failed to send in any report. His defence was that he had been exempted from sending in a report. Whether that is correct or not, evidently the court-martial overruled it. He was convicted, and received the sentence of a slight reprimand, and was afterwards escorted to Capetown, where he re-embarked for Australia.",14
3,Mr MCDONALD,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,That is his own statement.,15
4,Mr BARTON,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,"Thes e are the only direct facts '1I have, and as to some of them the information does not leave my mind in any state of certainty.",15
5,Mr FOWLER,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,Will the Prime Minister say whether this is official information 1,15
6,Mr BARTON,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,"This is so much as I am able to disclose of the facts as they have come to my ears, and I am not now making any breach of confidence. I am discharging my duty to the House as far as I can.",15
7,Mr FISHER,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,The information is not official ?,15
8,Mr BARTON,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,"There can be no official information in this matter so far as I can see, and for this reason*-: All these men were serving in an Imperial corps under the regulations of the British army, and as soldiers of that army. They were not in any sense employed by Australia, nor were they in a corps that was raised in Australia, or was distinctly Australian. They were liable to be treated according to the King's regulations and the legislation governing these matters ; and it is clear, whatever opinion anybody may hold as to the justice of the case, that they were duly tried in the manner in which any other alleged offenders are tried. There is one remaining fact to mention. Between their arrest and the passing of sentence the men were called on to serve, and did serve, in the defence of Pietersburg against Commandant Meyer. Those comprise all the facts which I can state with any pretence to authenticity, and of course I do not vouch for some of them, because they are still left in doubt. I am endeavouring to obtain information, but it rests entirely with the military authorities in South Africa as to the extent of the information which they will give, that being a matter for them exclusively to determine, having regard to the maintenance of discipline in the Army. POST ANDTELEGRAPH ACT.",15
9,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,"As a, matter of urgency I desire to ask the Prime Minister if he will be so good as to lay upon the table of the House during the afternoon, if possible, all the correspondence which has passed between himself and the Premier of Tasmania in regard to the enforcement of the Post and Telegraph Act against "" Tattersall.""",15
10,Mr BARTON,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,"I shall endeavour to have the papers prepared for laying upon the table of the House today. If they cannot be prepared in time, I shall promise my right honourable friend to lay them upon the table tomorrow.",15

12,Mr BARTON,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,"I shall try to have the copies ready and sent to my right honourable friend's address in the course of the morning, before laying them on the table. CONSERVATI ON OF ""WATER.",15
13,Mr GLYNN,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the increasing public interest which has been displayed in the locking and conservation of the waters of guishing rivers, he will give me a special opportunity, the Tariff? on some early date, to moot the question in the House. I have a notice of motion on the business-paper, but I have not had an l o w :opportunity to reach it , and I cannot see one unless I am helped by the Ministrv.",16
14,Mr BARTON,SENTENCES OP AUSTRALIA N,"I would rather ""that my honourable and learned friend renewed the inquiry after the conference at Corowa prior hits been held. One cannot make a predicaccordance tion whether the results of the conference No. 1 above. will justify the giving up of time for the discussion of the question when public business is so urgent as it is now. NA ADJOURNMENT.  Prime Minister whether there is any truth &c, in the statement in both the Melbourne Patent morning newspapers that it is intended that this House shall adjourn tomorrow night until Tuesday next.",16

16,Mr GLYNN,REPORTED SPECIA L,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether he will allow asphalt in shapes, at present charged for by the Customs department Jit 15 per cent., ad valorem, as if asphalt tiles, to he admitted free as being the raw material asphalt ?",16
17,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The answer honourable member's question is as follows :Yes; if simply the raw material: asphalt in compounds, shapes, aud not asphalt tiles. I may add that if asphalt is really the manufactured article we shall charge duty upon it , but if it is merely raw material shapes convenientfor importation no duty will be levied. DRAWBACK ALLOWANCES. Mr S. SMITH (for Mr THOMSON) asked the Minister for Trade and Customs-upo n notice I. Is drawback bcin"" refused on the export goods on which the duties first levied by the Tariff have been paid, ifsuch duties have been reduced or abolished ? 2. If so, what reason is there for thus handicapping the export trade of the Commonwealth ? 3. What greater difficulty is there in distinguishing the duty paid in such cases, and in identifying the goods, than there is in distinand identifying in the case of goods duty paid before and exported after, the imposition of",16
18,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as fol- . 1. Drawback is not allowed at a greater rate than the duty in force at the time of export, as provided for in the Customs regulations. 2. The risk of loss to the revenue. 3. In the case of goods on which duty was paid to the new Tariff, drawback is only given in with the rule mentioned in answer PATENTS ANDTRADEMARKS . Sir LANGDON BONYTHON (South Australia) - I move That iv return be laid on the tnhle of this House showing the number of applications for Letters Provisional Protection, smd Trade Marks, up to the eud of 1001, in the following form': - Nam e of State; No. of applications for Letters or Provisional Protection ; No. of applications for Trade Marks : expenses of department: revenue of rlejxirtment: profit of department. The return will cost little and will furnish is like valuable information.",16
19,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,What period will it cover ?,16
20,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"From the beginning. Question resolved in the affirmative. TARIFF. In Committee of Ways and Means -(Recommittal.) Consideration resumed from 26th March, to the 1902 (vide page 11250). Item 2 - Spirits, "" viz - Spirits , and spirituous n.e.i., when not exceeding the strength of proof, per gallon, 14s.",16
21,Mr VL SOLOMON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"South Australia). - I desire to add words pioviding for an in allowance on under-proof/ spirit down to 10 5 under proof. When this item was before the committee in the first instance I endeavoured to secure an alteration of the rate of duty on under-proof spirits. In two of the States at least it has been the rule to levy duty on under-proof spirits according to their strength down to 16 5 under-proof, and an examination of the statistics of shows how very largely the character of the since importations has been influenced by this practice. In South Australia, where the allowance for under-proof spirits was made, a very large proportion of the imports were in the form of case spirits, bottled, label capsuled under well-known brands which afforded a sufficient guarantee of their purity and regularity of qualit) . 7 where no allowance was made for underproof spirits, the imports were mostly in bulk, the spirits being "" broken down "" in the States, and in many instances mixed with an inferior colonial made article, very much to the detriment of public health. No advantage to the revenue is derived from insisting upon the payment of the full duty on under-proof spirits, because it leads to the spirit being imported at proof and ""broken down"" after its arrival in the Commonwealth. Therefore the revenue does not profit from the exclusion of good brands of under-proof spirits. The statistical returns show that in 1900 South Australia imported 20,444 gallons of brandy in case as against 9,800 gallons in bulk, and 12S,963 gallons of whisky in case as compared with 37,000 gallons in bulk. Thus nearly three-fourths of the whisky imported was bottled at the distilleries under the guarantee of people whose very living depends upon the maintenance of the standard of the spirit they are purveying. In the same year Victoria imported 39,551 gallons of case brandy,und 65,000 gallons of bulk brandy, and the importations of case whisky amounted to 179,750 gallons against 393,592 gallons of whisky in bulk. In Victoria and New South Wales the great proportion of the spirits was introduced in bulk, and was "" broken down "" within the States by being mixed with water or something else. If only water were used, it would be comparatively harmless.",16
22,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The spirit which is introduced here in .bottle is ""broken down"" with water also.",17
23,Mr VL SOLOMON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Yes ; but we know the brands under which it is imported, and we have some guarantee as to its purity. We know that these spirits are examined before they leave home by the leading Government analysts.",17
24,Mr MCCAY,REPORTED SPECIA L,"No , they are not.",17
25,Mr VL SOLOMON,REPORTED SPECIA L,I say they are. The spirits are - examined and their purity is vouched for by the Government analysts Mr AVATSON:-No .,17
26,Mr VL SOLOMON,REPORTED SPECIA L,I can show the honourable member the certificates. 32 E,17
27,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The honourable member might show a certificate which would a,pply led and to one sample out of a million cases.",17
28,Mr VL SOLOMON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"But how are these samples taken ? In Victoria, Mr WATSON - Sometime s in a very peif unctory way.",17
29,Mr VL SOLOMON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Does the honourable member mean to say that the spirit imported in bulk into Victoria and New South Wales and ."" broken down "" in the States is of anything like the same quality as that imported in case under well-known brands ?",17
30,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,In a great many cases it is better.,17
31,Mr VL SOLOMON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"If the honourable member thinks that, he cannot know very much about the spirit trade and the quality of the spirits imported here. It is welli known that the moment that one of the-leading brands of whisky goes off in quality its trade is lost, so that a certain amount. of protection is afforded to consumers by the importation, of whisky in the bottle under the labels of known reputable firms. To argue to the contrary is absurd, and it . is equally nonsensical to say that in the bulk of the hotels in Melbourne consumers can obtain as good whisky - is is provided for them in the great. majority of the Adelaide hotels. I put it to the right honourable gentlemen,, who have had the benefit of the advice of their oflicers, whether there will be one penny piece of advantage to the revenue by adhering to the bad example set by the old Victorian Tariff, of having a straight-out duty of so much, whether the spirits be 16 per cent, under proof or whether they be absolutely proof spirits? Thefigures show distinctly and clearly that, there can be no possible advantage in it . . On the other hand, from the point of view of the. interest of the consumers, it is best that the rule which has been in vogue in two States, of making an allowance for under-proof spirit, should beadopted throughout the Commonwealth. If that rule is not adopted, there will be a bad look out indeed for the consumers. In nine cases out of ten the stuff that is purveyed as whisky in thehotels of Melbourne and Sydney is not as. good whisky as is sold under the labels of reputable firms. A good deal of it is rank - poison. Any man who has sampled whisky in the hotels of Melbourne and Sydney will say the same thing. The very fact shown by the statistics, as to the extreme excess of bulk spirits imported into Victoria and New South Wales under the old laws, is sufficient to prove that a very great advan' tage was being obtained by the traders as against the consumers.",17
32,Mr FISHER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"That does not apply to nine out of ten hotels, I should hope.",18
33,Mr VL SOLOMON,REPORTED SPECIA L,I should like the honourable member to devote a few evenings to tasting the whisky sold in the various hotels of Melbourne. Let him test the quality of it by the state of Ins headwhich is a very fair test-and see how long it is before a place has to' be found for him in that magnificent institution established by the Victorian Government at Kew. I say without the slightest hesitation that the result of the importation of bulk whisky into Sydney and Melbourne is that a grossly inferior class of spirit is served to the consumer. The imported whisky is broken down and mixed with inferior spirit. That is the danger to the public health.,18
34,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,Does the honourable member mean since the introduction of this Tariff?,18
35,Mr VL SOLOMON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I mean under the old Tariffs. For these reasons I - move That the words "" with an allowance for proof up to 16""5"" be udded to the duty "" Spirits, per gallon, 14s."" ' Mr KINGST ON (South A u s t r a l i Minister for Trade and Customs) - The - Government ask the forbearance of honourable members generally with regard to the recommitted items-eithe r not to proceed ' with proposals where there is no chance of - carrying them, or, if there is such a chance, ""to curtail their remarks as much as possible. We have discussed this matter previously for two days, and arrived at a conclusion against the proposal of the honourable member for South Australia, ' Mr V . L . Solomon, by 34 votes to 16. I have heard no reason given why the committee should reverse its previous decision. There was practically a consensus of opinion that we should be doing all that was necessary if in this connection we adopted the practice of four of the States rather than that of two, even though one of the two should be my own State. Provision has, however, been made for an allowance to be made on under-proof spirits which had been shipped prior to the introduction of the Tariff, or which were in bond. A very important reason that was given against the honourable member's proposal was that, it was a desirable thing that we should have the important industry of bottling spirits conducted within the Commonwealth. .I am credibly informed, on the best authority, that the two great firms of Burke and Walker are at the present moment making arrangements for the bottling of their spirits in Australia. Why should they not do so ? Let us have 1 the benefit of this trade. Our contention in favour of retaining the provision of the Tariff as it stands is supported by what has happened since, and I do not think the committee is in the humour to effect the change proposed.",18
36,Mr CONROY,REPORTED SPECIA L," Possibly there may be a reason in favour of the amendment which has escaped the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs. If honourable members will turn to section 40 of the Distillation Act they will find that it provides as follows :No entry authorizing the removal of spirits shall be passed in respect of spirits of a lower strength than 25 per centum under proof, nor in respect of a smaller quantity than 10 gallons."" On turning to the .part of the Tariff dealing with excise, it will be found that under- the excise on spirits distilled wholly from barley malt, molasses, or maize is 12s. 6d. Supposing that the spirit a - bottled from the colonial distilleries is sent out-as it generally is-at about 16'5 under prool, this means that we are giving the local distillers a protection of 4s. 8d. per dozen. This is rather an important point, as it gives an undue preference to the local distillers which I do not think it was intended to give. We have already given - a preference of Is. 6d. per gallon of proof spirit, and in cases where the spirit is made from wine the preference to the local distiller is 3s. per gallon. But it was certainly never intended, so far .as I am aware, from reading and hearing the discussion, that on every dozen bottles of spirit sent out we should give an additional advantage to the local distiller of 4s. Sd. per dozen, or 2s. 4d. a gallon. Is the Minister aware of that ? If not, it is a very good reason for making an alteration. It is evident that a large amount' of revenue may be sacrificed in this ""way, and in view of the fact that the Treasurer has complained of the way the committee has cut down his revenue, I urge that, as we allow spirit 25 per cent, under proof to go out of the local distilleries, there is no good reason why we should not make the same allowance in regard to imported spirit.",18
37,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L," The amendment of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr V. L . Solomon, would have the effect of slightly diminishing the revenue. There are a certain number of brands of spirits that would be imported in bottle in any case, and would pay the higher duty. I happen to know that that is so from friends of my own in the wine and spirit trade. I also know that in Sydney two firms bave been taking premises with a view of bottling reputable and well - known brands locally. That is in course of arrangement, and I think that the revenue aspect will not be materially altered one way or the other: although the revenue will be slightly greater under the proposal in the Tariff. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Solomon, has made one of those extravagant statements which simply defeat their object. He spoke about the inferior class of spirit which he alleges comes into New South Wales and other States in bulk. It must, however, be apparent to the meanest - comprehension that where there are publicans of reputable character it pays them, as an absolute matter of business, to buy bulk whisky of greater maturity than that to which ordinary bottled whisky can pretend, and to give it to the customers at the same price as the latter. By taking bulk whisky, which is bought on bond certificates, the publicans save the cost of capsules, labels, corks, bottles, straws, and cases, the last of which can only realise a small amount as second-hand goods in the city, and, possibly nothing at all in the country districts. All this money is saved in addition to the cost of advertising, which is so largely resorted to in the case of bottled whisky, For that reason a very large portion, if not the greatest portion of the bulk whisky sold in New South Wales, at any rate for years past, has been equal to, if not superior, to thecase whisky. I am excluding a very superior case whisky which is guaranteed to be ten or twelve years old. Taking the ordinary bottled spirit sold in a vast majority of hotels, and even in the best of hotels, it is not so . good as the bulk whisky, as may be gathered from the fact that when a publican wants to treat his friends he always 32 E 2 advises the latter. I do - not think the committee have been given any reason for reversing their previous decision. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa slightly misconstrued the position so far as concerns the comparison between the 25 per cent, under proof allowed in respect of spirits going out of any Commonwealth distillery, and the charge which is made on imported proof spirit. There is no protection at all so far as that aspect is concerned. Spirit winch is brought in in bulk can be broken down to any degree.",19
38,Mr VL SOLOMON,REPORTED SPECIA L,Then there will be no advantage in importing proof spirit if the duty be the same on under proof as on proof.,19
39,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I admit that; and I understand that the only reason 25 per cent, is allowed in the case of local distilleries is to provide for gin, which is sold at a strength much below that of brandy and whisky.

40,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I m o v e That the words "" per gallon, 14s."" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words ;- "" For each 1 per cent, of proof over 35 per cent., up to and including 38 per cent., additional, per gallon, 6d. ; containing more than 38 per cent, of proof spirit, per gallon, 14s,"" Honourable members will recollect that when we were considering this item before, we promised to make further inquiry as to whether we were not making the transmission stage from wine to spirit too low when we fixed 35 per cent, of proof spirit in connection with the change from 16s. to 14s. It was pointed out, in regard to port and sherry, that unless we were careful we should be practically providing a prohibitory rate on these particular wines. That I do not think we intend to do. We have found from our inquiries that 35 per cent, is rather low as compared with the law which had obtained hitherto in the States, where the rate has approximated to 40 per cent., where it has not actually reached that degree. Under the circumstances we took some trouble, particularly in regard to port and sherrywhich are particularly affected by these duties as being of a higher strength, when they reached the Commonwealth at any rate-to obtain statistics from Melbourne, which we have no reason to believe is different in this respect from other places, as to„what was the strength of the wines admitted. We found that out of 53 samples of port wine which were tested, 49 were over 35 per cent, of proof spirit, whilst only four were under that percentage.",20
41,Mr ISAACS,REPORTED SPECIA L,What was the percentage of the 49 samples ?,20
42,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,I have all the figures here. For the purpose' of pointing out PAIRS. where the line of distinction seems to be drawn-w e drew it at 38 per cent - I may say that out of the 53 samples only four were over 38 per cent.,20
43,Mr BATCHELOR,REPORTED SPECIA L,Were these imported wines ?,20
44,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Ye s ; these were ports and sherries, which it is suggested, as I have said, are of a higher strength, and will be particularly affected. It seems to me that the argument may be sustained that if we make the duty 14s. at 35 per cent, of proof we shall be practically excluding these wines.",20
45,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,REPORTED SPECIA L,What was the strength of the four samples above 38 per cent !1,20
46,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Tw o were 38-7, and spirit two were 39. These figures, all relate to port wines. Coming to sherries, I may say that out of 46 samples that were examined, twelve contained over 35 per cent, of proof spirit, while 34 contained under 35 per cent. Of eight other samples of wine which were tested, one contained over 35 per cent, of proof spirit, while the remaining seven contained less than that, percentage. Out of the total of 103 samples, only four contained over 38 per cent, of proof spirit, and I do not think we should legislate specially to meet their particular case.",20
47,Mr HENRY WILLIS,REPORTED SPECIA L,The best kinds go very high.,20
48,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Then they can afford to pay a little higher duty. We make ample provision for a fair strength of wine. All we are proposing is that for each additional degree between 35 per cent, and 38 per cent., there shall be an additional 6d. per gallon duty imposed. That I do not think is excessive. It would simply amount to about 7s. 6d. per gallon on wine containing 38 per cent, of proof spirit.",20
49,Mr ISAACS,REPORTED SPECIA L,Ha d the wines which were sampled on behalf of the Government been fortified S,20
50,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I believe they were fortified. I do not profess to be an expert, but when these wines are of a greater natural strength than are the majority, we propose that they should pay a little extra duty. It may be said that we have rather a strict provision in the Distillation Act in relation to the fortifying of wines.",20
51,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The provision referred to will have to be put on a par with this, proposal.",20
52,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The question is how that can be done. I think we may as well make a provision of the character that we now suggest, and when we have obtained a little further knowledge on the subject we may if necessary permit Australian wines to be further fortified. That is a task which does not commend itself very much to me. I should be sorry to find it necessary, for the chief charm of our wines is often held to be their purity and their freedom from fortification. Of course it would be possible to provide that this provision shall come into force when our Distillation Act has been so relaxed. That, however, would be a cumbrous procedure. Whatever is for the real good of the wine industry is bound to be placed on the statute book before long ; and although I hope we shall be very careful in regard to relaxing the provisions of the Distillation Act in reference to the fortifying of Australian wines, we shall have power to do so if necessary. I propose that we may, on payment of the extra duty, relax, as regards the strong wines, the practical prohibition which was previously imposed, keeping in our own hands, power to alter, as we may think fit, our legislation with reference to distillation. Sir EDWARD BRADDON The Government proposal does not seem to meet the requirements of the case. The Minister states that of the samples of imported wines which were examined by his direction none contained 40 degrees of proof spirit. I have it on the authority of those who ought to be aware of the facts that these wines generally have a strength of 40 per cent, of alcohol, and run up to 42 per - cent.",21
53,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I had a statement of that character before me, and that was why I checked it .",21
54,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Of course these figures relate to one class of port wine, but it would be curious if they disagreed with those of others. In common justice to the consumers we ought to see that they are not penalized by being made liable to pay the duty which is imposed on spirits. If Ministers would agreethat the still wines in bulk should be liable to the duty as proposed with an increase of 3d., instead of 6d. per gallon for every degree above the limit of 35 per cent., and up to 40 or 42 per cent., the exigencies of the case would be met.",21
55,Mr ISAACS,REPORTED SPECIA L,Why commence at 35 ?,21
56,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I would have commenced at 40 or 42 per cent., but the Government have started with 35 per cent, in the Tariff. I think they have commenced here in the wrong place, as possibly they have done in other cases. If the Minister adopts my suggestion, there will be no great divergence from his own intended line of action, while I think the result will be more satisfactory to himself, and, I am sure, to the.great bulk of the consumers.",21
57,Mr ISAACS,REPORTED SPECIA L," I think that with the best of intentions the Government have proposed something which, if adopted, would be very unsatisfactory. The question that I put to the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon- "" Why commence at 35 degrees ?"" is answered by the fact that 35 per cent, of proof spirit is the limit to which colonial wines may be fortified under the Distillation Act. Section 59 of that Act absolutely prohibits Australian wine being fortified under any circumstances so as to contain more than 35 per cent, of proof spirit. When the Tariff was introduced this very item recognised that fact, and whilst it placed a duty of 6s. per gallon on imported wines in bulk, it provided that if they contained more than 35 degrees of proof spirit they should pay a duty of 14s. per gallon. That was proposed with the object of placing imported wines on the same footing as Australian wines so far as (the mercantile world was concerned.",21
58,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,REPORTED SPECIA L,Importe d wines are not fortified to that extent.,21
59,Mr ISAACS,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The Minister, in reply to an interjection by me, said that the wines to which he referred were fortified. I m ported fortified wines, therefore, are to be allowed to come in at an advance of 6d. per gallon duty per degree when containing over 35 degrees of proof spirit. It is not a question of free-trade or protection so much as it is a question of placing this prohibition on Australian wines, and giving the advantage to the imported wine. That is not fair. It seems to me that so long as the Distillation Act remains in its present form, we cannot consistently adopt this provision. I cannot understand why the very point of fortification at which ' Australian vignerons are compelled to stop should be that at which imported wine should commence, so to speak, to pay the nominal additional duty of 6d. per gallon per degree, and be allowed to come into Australia on that basis.",21
60,Mr CONROY,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Supposin g that an Australian wine is exported, can it be fortified up to 35 per cent. ?",22
61,Mr ISAACS,REPORTED SPECIA L,No . If the Act is valid-and we must presume that it is-it governs Australian vignerons at the present time. Any Australian vigneron who dares to contravene this provision exposes himself to a penalty of £ 2 0 . It is not for us to say that an A ct of this Parliament is invalid. J,22
62,Mr GLYNN,REPORTED SPECIA L,The general opinion was that the Act was invalid.,22
63,Mr ISAACS,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The honourable member has no right to say that. We passed the Act as a valid Act. While the provision stands, we ought not to do something which is distinctly differentiating in favour of the imported wine. We ought to be consistent, and if we are inconsistent at all it ought not to be on the side that injures our own people.",22
64,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L," It may be remembered thatlraisedthisquestion at an earlier stage, and that for the reasons given by the last speaker the Government saw fit to stand by their proposals in the Tariff. I am glad that the Government have seen some reason to recede from the position which they then assumed. Some Australian wine-makers have already asked that they shall have permission to exceed the limits in the Distillation Act, because i absolutely essential that a larger quantity of spirits should be used to preserve certain wines in crossing the tropics. As regards imported wines, it is said that there are brands of well-known repute that will not carry across the tropics except with a higher margin even than the 38 per cent, allowed. It is said that really good port wines require to contain up to 42 per cent, spirit to carry across the tropics to Australia. If that is so, it does seem rather hard to destroy a legitimate trade without any sufficient reason. As regards the Distillation Act prohibiting the use of more than 35 per cent, proof spirit in Australian wine, I would point out to the honourable and learned member for Indi that the section which deals with the matter says "" fortified under this Act."" What do these words refer to 1 I hold that there is a concession of duty given on spirits used for the fortification of Australian wine, that it has to be given under the supervision of an officer, and that it will only be given up to proof spirit of 35 per cent. The wines pass, after that concession, from the supervision of federal officers into the free stores of the owner, and they can be fortified if it is desired up to 80 per cent., with this proviso : that no concession will be given on the spirit used for the fortification. That is the position of the Australian wines, and unless the State authorities choose to follow up the action of the Commonwealth the degree of fortification cannot be interfered with. We have representations from winegrowers who export certain varieties of port wines that a higher percentage of spirit is actually necessary for the preservation of wines in crossing the tropics, and we have the importers saying the same thing. The only question now is what percentage of spiritshould be allowed over 35 per cent. ? I aminformed by several good authorities that it should be allowed up to 42 per cent. Sixpence on one per cent, increase is considerably higher than the duty on proof spirit. Therefore these wines, while they are allowed, in, have to pay a certain penalty. The wines are penalized sixpence for every per cent, above 35 per cent., therefore I think that 42 per cent, might be placed as the limit. It may be that there is only a small proportion over 38 per cent.; but these maybe the very wines that require the additional percentage of spirit. Competent aut is thorities say that really good wines require an additional percentage of spirit. It will not interfere with Australian wines, - because they can have 80 per cent, of spirit in them and not come under federal control. I suggest to the Minister for Trade and Customs that he will be perfectly safe in making 42 per cent, the limit, and that thenhe will be penalizing some of the wines.",22
65,Mr CONROY,REPORTED SPECIA L," I thoroughly agree with the honourable member for NorthSydney's interpretation of the provision in the Distillation Act. The question is whether wines containing over 35 per cent, of proof spirit shall be imported. We are charging 2s. per gallon more on 35 per cent, port wines than on champagnes, consequently the revenue may be seriously interfered with. Wine-growers at Wahgunyah, Corowa, and. two or three other places have expressed the opinion that to cross the tropics wine needs to contain 40 per cent, of proof spirit. The natural strength of some South Australian wines runs up to 31 and 32 per cent. tasted a Murray River wine called claret winch ran 32'7 per cent, of natural spirit. ultra vires. _ A port wine without any fortification, I. am told, would run up to 35, and on some ocour own Act. casions to 3G per cent. The vigneron mus't add from 3 to 4 per cent, of alcohol to keep that wine. Members are losing sight of revenue when they fix the limit at as low 35 .per cent. I think it should be raised 42 per cent. South Australia is the only proved invalid. State which formerly fixed a limit at as low as 35 per cent. It was never proposed give local port wine a protection of 14s. per gallon if there was over 35 per cent, of spirit in it. Possibly the time is not very distant when an excise duty on local wines will have to be imposed, because otherwise revenue from imported wines would cease. provision",22
66,Mr BATCHELOR,REPORTED SPECIA L,"South Australia) I should like to hear from the Minister Trade and Customs whether the position taken up by the honourable member for North Sydney is correct, namely, that section the Distillation Act, which limits the fortifipowers. cation of Australian wine to 35 per cent, proof spirit, refers to the concession made the Tariff. As far as the Tariff is concerned, it provides that spirit used for the fortificertain cation of Australian wine shall pay excise duty at the rate of only Is. per gallon, no liimtation is placed upon the strength which the wines are to be fortified. I seems that there is nothing to prevent one from obtaining spirit at the low rate duty for the fortification of Australian up to any degree of proof strength.",23
67,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,They would have to satisfy the Customs officers that the spirit was to be used in accordance with the Distillation Act.,23
68,Mr BATCHELOR,REPORTED SPECIA L,"But no limit is placed in the Tariff upon the use of spirit sion required for fortifying purposes, seems necessary to make some such proEven vision.",23
69,Mr GLYNN,REPORTED SPECIA L," I agree that if the limit of proof strength of wines is raised under the Tariff, it also ought to be raised under the Distillation Act. Several honourable members took the view when the Distillation Act was under consideration-and I think the honourable and learned member for Indi agreed-that, so far as we attempted,, apart from the question of excise or import duties, to scribe a strength of 35 degrees of proof spirit for wines,- we should be acting ultra I vires, and I believe that the limitation for any purpose other than that of the Tariff is",23
70,Mr ISAACS,REPORTED SPECIA L,Do not let us throw mud at,23
71,Mr GLYNN,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I have no desire to do that, but surely if it is proposed to legislate the beyond the limits of the Constitution, as honourable members should be cautioned not to .to pass provisions that may afterwards be",23
72,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,Once an Act is passed weto assume that it is valid.,23
73,Mr GLYNN,REPORTED SPECIA L,"But those who hold the opinion that such an Act ought not to have far been passed should not be debarred from expressing that view. Personally I should the have no hesitation in challenging any such in a court of justice, and it is only the etiquette, of Parliament that prevents' for our here impugning our own enactments.. Still, it is the dirty of those who think so to point out that the legislation passed 59 in is, in their opinion, ultra vires of our I think the opinion expressed by -' of the honourable member for North Sydney in is the right one, and that as far as we attempt to do anything more than impose restrictions for the purpose of rebate,, our acts will be ultra vires. The South but Australian Vine-growers' Association have to requested that the limit should be fixed at t 42 per cent., and a very good case has been anyadvanced for adopting a similar standard of with regard to imported wines. In twenty wine countries, including the United States, I cannot find any limit as low as 35 per cent., except in South Australia, and in New Zealand with regard to Australian wines-the limit in New Zealand for other wines is 42 per cent. I therefore move That the amendment be amended by the omisof the figures "" 38,"" with a view to insert in. and it lieu thereof the figures ""42."" then, the rate of 6d. will be too high, the rate recommended by the wine-growers quite being 3d.",23
74,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L," I trust the Minister for Trade and Customs will be in a position to declare the attitude of the Government in respect to the section of the Distillation Act that has been referred to. - I shall not vote for any alteration such as that now proposed, unless there is a probability of a similar alteration being made prein the Distillation Act. It would be most unfair to allow highly fortified sweet wines to be imported from abroad, and at the . same time prevent our local growers from fortifying their wines up to a similar strength. I am inclined to think that the contention of the honourable member for North Sydney is correct, and it may be, as stated by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, that the provisions of the Distillation Act ing to the limit of strength are ultra vires. On the other hand, neither of these contentions may be correct, and our local producers may be placed at a disadvantage of 3 per cent, as compared with the importers of wines. If the Distillation Act is valid, as we have to assume for the time being, we shall, by imposing a lower import duty, encourage the introduction of wines containing more than 35 per cent, of proof spirit. When the Distillation Act was under discussion, I was under the impression that a strength of 35 per cent, of alcohol was provided for, instead of 35 per cent, of proof spirit, which would be roughly about half the strength of absolute alcohol. A vast area of country is now devoted to the production of dry wines whioh could be more suitably used for the production of sweet wines. The incomes of wine-growers would be doubled if they were able to produce sweet wines, but unless they are permitted to fortify their wines up to at least 38 per cent, of proof spirit they cannot with safety send them away to the markets of the world. In isolated cases they may be able to do so, but not generally. Having been convinced of the necessity of raising the limit in the interests of those who export wine to the Commonwealth, I hope Ministers will be prepared to amend the Distillation Act and place our local producers upon the same flevel as wine-growers abroad. If this is not done I think it would be improper to make any alteration.",23
75,Mr ISAACS,REPORTED SPECIA L," Some honourable members have referred to some expression of opinion on my part as to the constitutionality of section 59 of the Distillation Act. My recollection is that when I moved the amendment which now finds a place in the section, prohibiting the fortification of tralian wines with any other than wine spirit up to a strength of 35 per cent, of proof spirit, I proposed it as an addendum to the section, because if any question were raised as to the constitutionality of my amendment the same objection would arise as to the validity of the section to which I proposed to add it . I did not express an opinion as to the constitutionality of the section. I do not think that at this stage we should raise any doubt as to the validity of the provision. It is one thing to raise a question of that sort when a matter is being discussed, but when an A ct relathas once been passed we should never cast any doubt upon the efficacy of our own enactment. The suggestion that the Minister for Trade and Customs should give a distinct assurance that steps will be taken to increase the limit of fortification, under the Distillation Act, from 35 per cent, to 38 per cent, is, of course, a matter for the Minister to consider. I am not prepared, however, to support this proposal, even though such an assurance is given, because we do not know whether it will be carried out. The proper course would be to defer the present suggestion until both matters can be dealt with at the same time. We ought not to place this burden upon the Australian producer, on the off chance of our being able to bring him up to the same level hereafter.",24

77,Mr ISAACS,REPORTED SPECIA L,That would be worse still.,24
78,Mr VL SOLOMON,REPORTED SPECIA L,It would be better still according to the opinions of those who have been importing the better classes of port wine. They hold that it is absolutely necessary that the limit of strength should be increased to 40 per cent.,24

New South Wales has, roughly speaking, a little over three times the population of South Australia. Yet New South Wales, with a limit of 40 per cent, in strength, had a revenue of £15,900 from imported wines; whilst South Australia, with a limit of 35 per cent., which was virtually prohibitive, had a revenue of only £1,501. So that, although having a third of the population of New South Wales, South Australia only derived about one-tenth of the revenue from this source.",24

In four States of the group they had a limit of 40 pei' cent., in another 43 per cent. In the four States there has never been any complaint on the part of the wine-growers as to that limit of strength. But in framing this new Tariff we have it constantly impressed upon us that it is necessary to lower the strength at which we will permit the importation of port wine and sherry to be introduced to 35 per cent.",25
83,Mr ISAACS,REPORTED SPECIA L,That is because we have prohibited our own vignerons from going higher.,25
84,Mr VL SOLOMON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Because we made a blunder-that was pointed out at the time by experts in the wine trade-w e - are, ergo, to repeat it by making another ! Australia is now producing very good port wine, and the local wiue is fairly well protected. The strength that has obtained in the past in the various States, and - about which there has been no complaint whatever, is a fair standard upon which to act now. If it is necessary to alter the Distillation A ct in this respect it will be easy enough to do so. The Government, with an absolute majority behind ""them, could pass a Bill through all its stages within a very short time for that purpose. But because an error of judgment has been made in that respect we should not attempt to rectify it by putting an embargo upon the import trade. The importers claim that the better classes of sherry and port cannot be imported under the strength of from 37 to 39 per cent. Those are figures given by the leading experts in Victoria and South Australia.",25

104,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"There are various concessions in the shape of licenses for distilling spirits and using these spirits for fortifying wine, and we have a perfect right to attach to those concessions certain limits and regulations, whatever the wisdom of the latter may be. At the same time. I would not be dealing fairly if I did not call attention to a section which to some extent seems to have been forgotten even by the honourable member for North Sydney, namely, section 76, which provides that no person shall sell any Australian wine containing more than of 35 per cent, of proof spirit. I bein lieve that section is of general appli35 cation, and is not confined in express terms to the exercise of power under the Act. Whilst we are relaxing the condition which we imposed previously, in charging the spirit duty on wine which contained more . than 35 degrees of proof spirit, I do think we ought to place our local wines a disadvantage. It would be altogether foreign to the desire of the Government countenance such a proceeding. In that connection, a very strong case has been out for relaxing the conditions in regard the strength up to which Australian wines may be fortified. On the other hand, may be said that it would be a pity to the sale of Australian wine which was fortiwe fied to a higher degree - than that provided in the Act, as it would tend to destroy reputation we have already acquired pure wines. ' I think it would be a pity do so, but still it seems to me that if relax this condition so that imported wines containing more than 35 per cent, of proof spirit can be sold here, we should not refuse the same privilege, to the local vignerons.",27

I think it would be almost the corollary of what we are proposing now. The more I think that we can interfere wisely for the sake of the reputation of one of our great staples, the more I think that in a matter of this kind there is a good deal to be said in favour of allowing the wine-grower to do what he thinks well, knowing that the profit will be his. If my mind remains as it is today, and the simple, object of an amendment of the Distillation Act is to deal fairly with the local producer as compared with the foreign importer, we shall do what is suggested, subject, of course, to the possibilities of riper experience.",27

Those who require wine containing 40 per cent, of proof spirit will be prepared to pay the additional duty.",27
107,Mr A MCLEAN,REPORTED SPECIA L," I think not the Minister should give us more than the at qualified promise made by him to amend the Distillation Act, provided that we agree to to this amendment in the Tariff. It must be seen that unless the Distillation. Act is made amended, this propusal will be extremely to unfair to the local producer of wine. Under the Act we prohibit him from producing, it under any circumstances, wine containing allow more than 35 degrees of proof spirit; but are now proposing to allow an importer to bring in wine containing up to 40 per the cent, of proof spirit on payment of a small for additional, duty. There may be a very to large demand for wine of that class, and I we fail to see why we should shut out the local producer from supplying that demand when we concede the privilege to the importer.

118,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,We should provide by legislation for an amendment of the Distillation Act. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - The insertion of such a provision as that t cannot suggested by the honourable and learned member for Indi would be unique.,28
119,Mr ISAACS,REPORTED SPECIA L,We have a similar provision in Division VIA . of the Tariff.,28
120,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I should be very glad if the Minister would go one step further, and allow this matter to be settled at once. Although it would possibly involve some slight loss of revenue, that loss would be amply compensated for by the simplicity of administration which would result if we provided for one rate of duty on all wines containing up to 40 per cent, of proof spirit. I make the suggestion in a perfectly friendly spirit, and I hope that the Minister will consider it . Mr V. L. SOLOMON (South Australia). - I understand that the Government are prepared to extend - the strength of wiuo which may be imported up to 40 per cent 1",28
121,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Yes ; to make the limit 40 per cent, instead of 38 per Mr ' V . L . SOLOMON - But the Government will not give way on the question of whether the one duty should not be imp6sed in respect of all wines containing up to 38 per cent, instead of 35 per cent, of proof spirit. The extra 6d. per gallon for every additional degree above 35 per cent, is a very heavy impost, and altogether out of be proper proportion to the duty imposed on proof spirits. To make it proportionate, the additional duty per gallon should be an something like H d . per degree instead of t is 6d. I would suggest to the Minister that a be compromise might be arrived at by providing that the increased duty per gallon should be 3d., instead of 6d., for every additional degree between 35 and 40 per cent. by I shall endeavour to test the opinion of the d i committee on this point at a later stage.

122,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L," Pre that the Government proposal of a 40 per cent, limit is accepted, and that we have to accept the decision that they will not allow the one duty to apply up to 40 per cent, what is the best way to accomplish a distinction ? I would suggest that instead of going up 6d. every point, the Minister should make wine up to 38 per cent, subject to an extra Is. duty, and wine from 38 per cent, up to 40 per cent, subject to another Is. There would be only two points in dispute there, that is as to 38 per cent. and. 40 per cent. wine. But as it is there are five points of dispute with the importer, and very fine points too --as to whether the 1 per cent, has been reached or not. Every degree is a point of dispute. Limit that either by making the five degrees subject to one rate, or by making two rates for the five degrees. If that course is adopted, there will be only one or two points of dispute between the importers and the department. The officers will be saved a great deal of trouble, and greater satisfaction will be given in the administration of the Act.",28
123,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The honourable member for North Sydney is suggesting that for 36 per cent., 37 per cent., and 3S per cent, wine, we should charge an extra Is., and for 39 per cent, and 40 per cent., an extra 2s.",29

125,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,There is something to be said in favour of that. There might be something to be said in favour of making a medium rate for the whole lot. There is not very much difficulty in determining the strength of the wine. I have various instances worked out in decimals. Although I acknowledge that there is something to be said in favour of the honourable member's suggestion on the score of convenience of administration at the same time. I prefer to have the amendment as it stands. Amendment agreed to.,29

Threepence would be double the proportionate rate upon spirits. According to the duty on spirits it would be about l^d. for each point above 35 to 40 per cent. At 6d. per gallon it is three or four times the proportionate rate of duty. Even at 3d. per gallon ordinary imported port wines and sherries which come in at from 39 to 40 per cent, would pay at the rate of 7s. 6d. per gallon.

Cigars, including the weight ot bands and other attachments, per lb., Os. 3d. and 15 per cent, ad valorem.",29
127,Mr GLYNN,REPORTED SPECIA L," On behalf of the honourable member for Wentwurth I move That the words ""and on and after 3rd April, .1902, 6s. Gd."" be added. This will have the effect of increasing the present fixed duty from 6s. 3dto 6s. 6d., and of abolishing the ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. Taking the average of the cigars imported into Victoria in 1S97-98 aud 1899 the price was 7s. 7d. per lb. A ID per cent, ad valorem duty upon this would represent Is. 3d. per lb., and a fixed duty of 6s. 3d. added would bring the total duty to 7s. 6d. per lb. The excise duty is Is. (id. per lb., and the duty upon imported leaf is Is. 6d. per lb., or a total of 3s. fore, the protection under a duty of 7s. 6d. per lb. amounts to 4s. 6d. per lb., which, I need scarcely say, is a very high figure. The weight of ordinary cigars is about 12 lbs. per 1000, whilst heavy-weights run to 15 lbs. per 1000. A protection of 4s'. 6d. per lb. averages on ordinary cigars £ 2 14s. per 1000, and on heavy-weights £ 3 7s. 6d. per 1000. As the Treasurer has already conceded a reduction of this duty, I think he might go to the further reasonable length now suggested. According to the information contained in the report of the chief inspector of factories in Victoria for 1900 as to wages in the cigar trade, the protection now afforded amounts to 143 per cent, on the wages paid.",30
128,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I trust that the committee will not make any alteration i u the duty. We fought this matter out very fully when it was first before us. It was then proposed that a duty of Ss. 6d. should be imposed upon Havanna cigars, and -6s. 6d. upon other cigars, it being admitted that the better class of goods should contribute more to the revenue. Now we are asked to consent to a duty of 6s. 6d. per lb. all round, but as the committee, by 35 to 22 votes, refused to adopt the other proposal, I feel certain that they will not agree to make the duty uniform at tis. Gd. per lb. As this matter has been very fully debated we might come to a division at once.",30
129,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L," I would remind the Treasurer that the circumstances are entirely different from those obtaining when we were dealing with this matter before. We then had a whole series of composite duties still to deal with, but these have since one by one disappeared. The Treasurer has time and again recognised that the feeling of the committee was against these composite duties, and has abandoned them.",30
130,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"A number of honourable members favour a composite duty as applied to cigars, but would not adopt the same principle in regard to other articles.",30
131,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"There was just as good reason for the adoption of composite duties in regard to other items as in the case of cigars. As a matter of fact, the composite duty is more objectionable as applied to cigars than to any other line in the Tariff. No drawback is allowed upon There- cigars, which are usually sold in bond, as importers ""will not hold large, duty-paid stocks if they cannot get drawback upon re-export. When a man buys in bond, hemust, under the composite duty, obtain from the vendor before he purchases particulars as to the duty that will have to be paid. He cannot know the cost of what he is buying unless he ascertains this from the vendor before purchasing - Consequently, the cost of the cigars has to be disclosed. It is not right to expect traders in cigars to declare the cost before a sale is made. Business would be impossible under these conditions. The Minister gave as a reason for composite duties that, whilst protecting the local maker of low-grade articles, they would make the users of the higher-grade goods pay something more to the revenue. If the ad valorem principle is a good one to apply in order to make the consumer pay something more to the revenue, that something should be entirely in proportion to the value, but under the system of composite duties only a portion of the duty is being collected on the tic? valorem principle. Cigars which cost Is. pay only 15 per cent, upon that shilling. Surely if there were ever a reason for applying this principle it was to be found in the case of boots, and yet in that instance Ministers abandoned the composite duties. If the Treasurer desires to make a distinction between the .high-grade and the low-grade goods, he can do so by imposing a higher rate of duty upon the better class of cigars. The protection now - afforded to the.local manufacturer is 4s. 6d. per lb., as against 2s. 6d. per lb. previously in New South Wales, 4s. 3d. in Victoria, 2s. 6d. in Queensland, 4s. 7^d. in South Australia, 2s. in Tasmania, and 4s. l i d . in - Western - Australia. The proposal of the honourable and learned member for South Australia gets over any difficulty with regard to labour, because it is shown that the duty represents nearly double the whole cost of the labour involved in the manufacture of Australian-made cigars. ' What is now proposed as import duty is more than the duty charged in any State previously, except Tasmania, where the duty was 6d. ' more. I quite anticipated that the Treasurer or the Minister for Trade and Customs would accept the previous decision of the - committee in connection with composite duties. I urge them to do so. This is the last duty of that sort, and it is the most deleterious in its effects. If they abandon it they complete the symmetry of the Tariff, inasmuch as all of these duties which they looked upon with favour-and for which I am willing to admit there was on the surface something to be saidhave been abandoned with this exception. As to the 6s. 6d. duty proposed by the honorablo member for South Australia, it is the same duty as has been put on cigarettes. A lesser margin has been allowed on cigarettes, but this is the same import duty, so that we unify the Tariff in this respect by adopting the amendment. further proposition can be made, which personally I should agree to, that an extra 2s. be put upon Havanna cigars, which are of a higher grade.

L . coffee and coffee only, but, as a matter of fact, duty is being demanded on coffee in thecherry and coffee in the parchment-no t only on the coffee, but on the cherry and the parchTellers. ment. The serious effect is to absolutely shut certain coffees out of the market. From actual cleaning operations of different shipments we learn that from a given quantity of coffee in cherry the yield of cleaned raw coffee is 50 per cent, to 65 per cent.; that is to say thai; nearlyone-half of the material on which duty is demanded is not coffee at all. From coffee in parchment, 74 to 82 per cent, of cleaned raw coffee is obtained. The present administration of the Tariff in regard to this item has a far wider effect than would at first sight be supposed. Most of the coffee in theseforms comes from the South Sea Islands, and some of it from the New Hebrides. Owing to the small quantity grown in the scattered positions on the islands, it does not pay to erect machinery for the purpose of cleaning the' coffee ; and hitherto coffee in parchment and in cherry has been imported and cleaned under Customs supervision, duty being charged on the result only. The effect of the present administration is to drive most of the trade, in connection with the New Hebrides and adjacent islands into the hands of the French. Surely that is absurd, seeing that the duty charged on the husks affords no protection.",31
134,Mr FISHER,REPORTED SPECIA L,Coffe e is grown in Queensland.,32
135,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"But the Queensland industry is protected by the duty on the coffee. Coffee can be brought from Ceylon, Java, and elsewhere already cleaned.",32
136,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,But it is not imported from the islands in that form.,32
137,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The coffee cannot be cleaned on the islands for the reasons I have already given. There is cleaning machinery on one or two of the islands, where a considerable quantity is grown, but most of the coffee is. produced in small patches in many different islands which may be separated not by 10 or 20 miles, but by 100 or 1,000 miles.",32
138,Mr EWING,REPORTED SPECIA L,How much coffee comes from the South Sea Islands 1,32
139,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"A large and increasing quantity, and surely the trade is of advantage to Australia. The question is whether we shall deliberately cast aside trade which is not from Central America or Java, but from islands inhabited by our own people. Ought we not to encourage the connection which we desire to maintain under the British flag ? The steamers which run to these islands have the greatest difficulty in conducting their trade in competition with the German and French subsidized shipping companies, and to continue the present administration of the Tariff in this connection will deprive the vessels of valuable freight and necessitate the payment of larger postal subsidies by the Federal Government. It is absurd to deliberately reject trade when the difficulty at the Customs can be surmounted in the way in which it has hitherto been surmounted; namely, by having the coffee cleaned in the presence of a Customs officer. This is done in the case of rice and other commodities, but in regard to coffee importers are made to pay on the husk.",32
140,Mr HAHPER,REPORTED SPECIA L,Whic h is valueless.,32
141,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I have no interest whatever in this matter, except that I desire to see our connection with the South Sea Islands kept up and British influence maintained. I cannot conceive a single genuine reason against the practice which has hitherto' prevailed. The importer pays for the services of the Customs-house officer, and cleaning under customs supervision to a certain extent gives labour within the Commonwealth.",32
142,Mr MAHON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"An extra duty is imposed on tea imported in packets. Mr THOMSON.^-If a piece of paper has to be cut into two parts, efforts have been made, to have that cutting done within the Commonwealth, but there seems an objection to that principle being applied in the present case. If the Minister for Trade and Customs says that he has no power to carry out my suggestion without having express words in the Tariff-althoug h that is a power which has been exercised by other Ministers of Customs from time immemorial-the n I must move the insertion of such words.",32
143,Mr BAMFORD,REPORTED SPECIA L," I hope the Minister for Trade and Customs will not allow himself to be influenced by the arguments of the honourable member for North Sydney. Coffee-growing is a large industry in Northern Queensland, and, in fact, all along the coast of that State.",32
144,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,My suggestion does not interfere with the duty on coffee.,32
145,Mr BAMFORD,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The honourable member has really made out a good case for retaining the duty as it appears in the Tariff, seeing that he himself says that no material difference is made one way or the other, whether the husk be taken off .or left on.",32
146,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,It makes no difference to the Queensland grower.,33
147,Mr BAMFORD,REPORTED SPECIA L,"It makes a great deal of difference,* because as administered at present the protection is a little higher than it otherwise would be. Husking the coffee is easily done; it merely means conveying the coffee from the different small plantations to one centre. I am credibly informed that the real object of importing the bean in the husk is to prevent it from getting worm eaten. I am told that a little worm immediately attacks cleaned coffee and seriously damages it during transport.",33
148,Mr HARPER,REPORTED SPECIA L,That is absurd !,33
149,Mr BAMFORD,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I do not pose as an expert, but I am told that there is the same risk in regard to coffee beans as to grain, cigars, and other goods if they come in an uncovered state. I hope the Minister will not be influenced by the pleading of the honourable member for North Sydney.",33
150,Mr HARPER,REPORTED SPECIA L," I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs will adopt the suggestion thrown out by the honourable member for North Sydney. The practice of cleaning under supervision in the Customs has been in existence for the last 25 years; in fact, ever since coffee was produced in the islands. If better authority he required for the statement. I have made honourable members may refer to the I m perial Tariff, 1902, paragraph 167 of which providesCoffee in the husk, which has been delivered out of warehouse under bond for the removal of the husks, will be charged with duty ou all loss exceeding that due to the removal of the husks only. The estimate for the proportion of the husks is to be made on the results of actual experiments by the officers, or samples taken by the in tor the purpose.",33
151,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,That would include the parchment.,33
152,Mr HARPER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Yes ; there are two kinds of husks. The coffee berry is like a cherry, and that is why it is called "" cherry."" There is an outer skin which contains two berries, which are encased in the silver skin. The one is the cherry, and the other is the parchment, but both are husks or refuse, which are equally valueless. They have to be removed before the article becomes the coffee of commerce. If duty is charged on the husks, then it will be levied on something which is not coffee. If the Minister refers to page 401 of the Imperial 32 P Tariff, 1902, he will see that paragraph 475 statesCoffee imported in the husk may be delivered from the warehouse for the purpose of having the husk removed, upon bond being entered into, in the penalty of double the duty pajable on the goods, for the return of the coffee to the warehouse after the operation has been completed. That is when it is done out of bond. Security is given that the coffee will be returned in due course. The paragraph continuesPrior to the removal of the goods such samples are to be taken as may euable the officers in the warehouse to estimate the proportion of husks, and on the return of the goods duty is to be paid on any loss in excess of such proportion. That fairly lays down the practice in Great Britain, and the honourable member for Herbert has been misled if he has been told that the coffee is sent in the form referred to by him in order to prevent it from becoming wormy. I understand that most of the coffee goes from the Islands to Sydney, and it will be seen at once that, if the husk is taken off at the Islands, the coffee comes in at 3d. per lb. Therefore it is evidently a mistake to charge anything on the husks, which are not coffee in any shape or form.",33
153,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,REPORTED SPECIA L," I hope that the Minister will agree-to the suggestion made by the honourable member for North Sydney. Most of the coffee grown in the Islands is imported into New South Wales; very little comes into Victoria. In this State they have always paid the duty on coffee itself, and not on coffee in the husks. If the coffee had been brought into Victoria in the same condition as that in which it is introduced in New South Wales, I am sure that those concerned in the industry would have brought the matter under the notice of the Government.",33
154,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,They are charged here not only on the coffee.,33
155,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,REPORTED SPECIA L,That is so. In no case has the duty been levied in the way now adopted by the Commonwealth Government.,33
156,Mr EWING,REPORTED SPECIA L," I desire to ascertain what it costs to clean a pound of coffee. We are told that the Island coffee is imported into New South Wales in cherries. It is not sold in that form, and I wish to ascertain what it costs to place it in the condition in which it is retailed.",33
157,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,About £ 1 or £ 2 per ton.,33
158,Mr HARPER,REPORTED SPECIA L," I wish to call the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to the fact that the words "" kiln dried"" which appear in this item should be transferred from the third to the second line, so that it would readCoffee and chicory, viz. :-Ra w and kiln dried, per lb., 3d.",33
159,The CHAIRMAN,REPORTED SPECIA L,Such an alteration cannot be made without a further reference to the committee.,34
160,Mr HARPER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"A complaint has been made to me from another State that ordinary raw coffee is being stopped, on the ground that the importer must prove that it has not been "" kiln dried."" I think that the origin of what I conceive to be a mistake in the item is that the Government, in drawing up the Tariff, have had.recourse to the Imperial Customs Tariff, and have adopted the term "" k i l n dried"" which is used there without regard to the fact that in the Imperial Tariff coffee is treated separately from chicory. They have lumped the two together, with the result that a duty of 5d. per lb. is being charged on ordinary raw coffee, on the ground that it is "" k i l n dried."" The intention of the committee was that the duty on ordinary raw coffee should be 3d. per lb., and I - consider that when we are reviewing the coffee duty, I am within my rights in calling attention to what I conceive-to be a mistake in the item. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs will accede to the request made by the honourable member for North Sydney At the present time a duty of 3d. per lb. is being collected, not only on coffee, but on the absolutely useless husks. sample cherry here which contains no coffee. The whole cherry would be an absolute waste, and yet it would be liable to duty. We do not wish to obtain revenue unfairly by collecting it on coffee husks, under the plea that we are collecting it on coffee. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Mernda should be adopted.",34
161,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Coffee is "" kiln dried;"" that term applies to chicory.",34
162,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Some honourable members whose duty it is to be astonished say that it is an extraordinary thing that +.he same rate should be charged for coffee taken out of the shell as for coffee that remains in the parchment, or in the cherry, as it is called. The sample which was produced just now was cherry coffee, but surely it might be referred to as coffee 1 Do honourable members think that an allowance is claimed or allowed in respect of the shells or husks of almonds and nuts of various descriptions ? Nothing of the sort. Are almonds almonds 1 Is an orange an orange ? Would honourable members claim that an. allowance should be made in respect of the skin if oranges were subject to a duty 1",34
163,Mr BROWN,REPORTED SPECIA L,But what have the Government done in the case of rice ?,34
164,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,We have made an express provision.,34
165,Mr BROWN,REPORTED SPECIA L,Then why not do the same in this case 1,34
166,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I am speaking of the form in which the Tariff has been passed so far. The practice as regards almonds and nuts is to charge by weight. No difference is made between the hulledand theunhulled. It is not as if we had not adopted the same principlein the case of coffee. What we say to the-importers is- "" Bring your coffee unhulled if you like. We are not making an exception to your detriment, if you choose to bring it in in that shape."" It may not be in accord with our .'policy generally as regards the encouragement of industry, but I desire a clear appreciation of, the position on both sides. The Government are prepared to give effect to the evident wish of the-committee. Coffee-making is a. considerable Australian industry. It is an industry in which Queensland is very greatly interested: - Mr HARPER --And which bas> a protection of 3d. per lb.",34
167,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The people of I have a Queensland do not consider that a very considerable protection. At this time it is not necessary to reopen a settled question. We have our doubts whether the duty is sufficient. And we doubt whether it should be relaxed in favour of those whose industry we have not endeavoured specially to encourage during this session on account of the nature of the competition to not which it subjects our white workers. But under Jill the circumstances I am willing to give an assurance to the honourable member for North Sydney, that we shall prepare a regulation which will have, the effect of enabling coffee to be dealt with in the parchment or cherry under Customs super vision. I think it must be done in bond, and duty paid on the net result. As regards the question of "" kiln dried,"" I understood the Chairman to say he was not prepared to allow that question to be dealt with, but I am obliged to the honourable member, for Mernda for his remarks on the subject. It is evident that the words "" kiln dried "" are intended to apply more particularly to-chicory. And we shall do what we can to give an intelligent construction to them.",34
168,Mr HARPER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"- I did not understand the Chairman, to rule as now suggested. The term "" kiln-dried "" distinctly affects coffee, and it ought to be made clear.. I do not wish to strike it out. We. could transpose the words.",35
169,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"That line is not recommitted. It is only "" coffee raw"" which is recommitted.",35
170,Mr HARPER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"On the Minister's assurance, I shall leave the matter alone.",35
171,Mr BAMEORD,REPORTED SPECIA L," I have been informed by Mr Newport, coffee expert to the Queensland Government, that coffee is kiln dried, and that the- .most inferior kind imported is that which is kiln dried. That information was given to me by Mr Newport in the precincts of this chamber. I should like the Minister to give particularattentionto the matter before being influenced by the arguments of the honourable member for Mernda^",35
172,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L," I object to whjit I must describe if it really represents the feeling, of Queensland as the insatiable greed of that State. I do not believe it does, because I do not think for a moment that Queensland is a greedy State. Here is an honourable member who has a protection of 3d. per lb -5 0 per cent urging the Ministry to secure some better results by round-about methods of administration. Surely it is a round-about method to apply the words "" kiln dried"" to coffee. Coffee is not kiln dried-excep t in some case where the sun may not be sufficiently strong and artificial heat may be applied simply for drying it to - the ordinary condition at which it is dutiable at 3d. per lb., and is called raw coffee. I am very glad that the Minister is going to make the regulation he has promised. He said that it was giving an' assistance to that black labour which we did not desire to encourage. It is doing nothing of the sort, because the cleaned coffee grown by black labor in Java and other places is allowed to come in at a duty of 3d. per lb. ' - Mr KINGSTON - The South Sea coffee comes in under the same condition. , Mr THOMSON - It does not when the Minister tries to charge duty on.the husks. £2 F 2 He states that the Government should not be asked to make an exception, but this system has been carried on for years, and should not be departed from unless good reason can be shown. No good reason has yet been shown for this departure. The Minister pleaded that Queensland might need more than the protection she will get. That State cannot get one penny more protection if husks are charged duty. She gets a protection on the raw coffee, and if this coffee in the husk is shut out, it does not pro1 hibit competition with Central American and Javan coffee, which pays duty on the clean weight. I do not think it should have been, necessary to bring this matter before the committee. The Minister could have done what is necessary by administration. I wasrequested to bring it before the committee, because he would not administer the law as he now agrees to do.",35
173,Mr CONROY,REPORTED SPECIA L," As one who does not believe in discouraging the use of temperance drinks, I think that a duty of 3d. per lb. on coffee is extremely high. Considering that tea is placed on the free list, weought to lower the rate of duty on coffee. I should like to move that the duty be lowered, but as the whole item is notrecommitted I cando no more than record my protest. Item agreed to.",35
174,Mr R EDWARDS,REPORTED SPECIA L," I m o v e That the following new item be inserted:20. ""Fish, fresh, viz., oysters, on and after 3rd April, 1902, per cwt. 2s."" This will restore the item practically in its original form. When it first came under the notice of the committee the honourable member for Wentworth raised some slight objection to a duty upon oysters, and the Prime Minister who happened to be in a particularly generous frame of mind withdrew the proposal, which was dropped without further discussion. For some years past oyster beds have been cultivated in Queensland, and considerable expense has been incurred in carrying on the industry. This has been essential to the maintenance of an abundant supply of oysters, because the natural beds are being rapidly depleted. The report of the inspector of fisheries inQueensland to the 30th June, 1901, shows that during the twelve months then ending the exports of oysters from Queensland amounted to 11,747 bags valued at £15,2S8. This quantity represents about four-fifths of the total output of that State. The revenue received the department for the same period amounted to £5,703. It follows, therefore, that 7s. 7d. was paid to the Fisheries partment upon each bag of oysters. The New Zealand Government does not tax the oystermen in that colony, beyond charging them a small working licence of 2s. man, whereas in Queensland £ is charged upon every bank; £ 1 for each boat, and 10s. for each man's ing licence. Therefore, New Zealand oysters can be placed upon our markets in this instance. "" more cheaply than can those locally grown. Our oystermen are, I think, moderate protection, and I hope that the committee will accede to the prayer of the originally. large number of petitions which have been presented to this House from the oyster cultivators of Queensland.",35
175,Mr FISHER,REPORTED SPECIA L," I think this duty would have remained on the Tariff but for an accident which occurred ..during one of our all-night sittings. ..duty will not injure any interest or indiarticle vidual, but on the other hand will assist important industry in Queensland. I that the committee will agree to the posal, and thus do justice to a large number - of persons in Queensland who minister the needs of the people of all the States.",36
176,Mr CONROY,REPORTED SPECIA L," I am surhour, prised that any honourable member ask for this duty. The only oysters imported into the Commonwealth come from New Zealand, and it seems absurd to this matter forward as one of national vportanee. It is reducing our legislative nroceedings to a farce. Practically revenue is expected from this duty. - »over I do not think that any private iber should be permitted to make a proposal for the imposition of a duty. I know . a ruling contrary to that view has been given, but honourable members should take advantage of it because it is opposed the practice of the House of Commons, - will certainly not be endorsed when standing orders are finally adopted. T hope the proposal will not be seriously entertained.",36
177,Mr WINTER COOKE,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Wannon) Here is an item which, before introduced, was free all over Australia, ex..cept in Western Australia. Now, because the States are united, we are asked - tect the great State of Queensland, not - the cheap labour of other countries, - from people who live under like conditions by to ourselves. Surely there is no need for Victoria and New South Wales to protect themselves from oysters! Victoria before defederation was not afraid of oysters, but apparently federated Australia is supposed to be afraid of the little oysters that are sent over by our fellow countrymen in 6d. per New Zealand! The amendment ought to 5 per'annum be rejected on the voices. or more . Sir EDWARD BRADDON work- - I had hoped that Ministers would defend a position which is uncomfortable for them. I should have thought that they would not submit to an alteration entitled to in their own proposals.",36
178,Mr MAUGEK,REPORTED SPECIA L,They proposed this duty,36
179,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"But they abandoned it without any pressure from any quarter. The appeal of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat ought to settle the question. We are asked for the first time in any State except The Western Australia to impose a tax upon an which enters very little into coman petition with anything produced in the trust Commonwealth, and to which no one can protake any exception. It is absolutely unreasonable and unfair that the Government, to because one of their supporters has suggested this duty, should, at the eleventh go back upon themselves, and calm!}' should submit to this alteration.",36
180,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Macquarie) This matter was discussed on a previous put occasion when the Prime Minister agreed to imto abandon the proposed duty. It was then pointed out by the honourable member no for Wentworth that the total amount of Moreduty which the Government expected to memreceive from oysters was about £270, and that previously there had been no duty in that Tasmania, Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia,,, and Victoria. The Gonot vernment are playing fast and loose with to the committee. We desire to facilitate the and despatch of business, but that object will outnot be attained if the Government, at the instance of one of their supporters, seek to impose .a tax upon an article which the Prime Minister had previously agreed should the Tariff was be free of duty.",36
181,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,REPORTED SPECIA L," The honourable member for Macto proquarie has referred to the fact that in from several States in the past there was no but duty on oysters. There was no need for a I duty in Queensland, because she is well supplier] with oysters, as also is New South Wales. But one of the first principles of federation was that there should he Inter-State free-trade with protection against the world. Tens of thousands of people voted for federation on that account. New Zealand is not part of Australia. Only the other day a gentleman who is a native of New South Wales told me that there are thousands of acres of oyster beds in that State which only require a little cultivation to enable them to feed the whole Commonwealth, with oysters. I find that oysters are now four times the price that they were some years ago, and that monopolies have entered into the trade because of the absence of facilities for the encouragement of oyster culture. The protection asked for is not for Queensland alone. On the broad principle of enabling oyster culture to be encouraged and to be successful in all parts of our coast we should have a moderate duty. The oyster has been such a trivial article in the eyes of State Treasurers that they have never thought of a duty upon it , but so many duties have been knocked off in the Commonwealth that we have to be careful. If it is necessary to impose a tax upon New Zealand timber, we should also tax New Zealand oysters. In that country they have a better climate for oyster production. The New Zealand oyster is larger than the Australian, but not more wholesome. It is a very coarse article of diet. The Prime Minister agreed to strike oysters off the Tariff without consulting other honourable members or the Minister in charge, and it was understood that the question would be revived at a later stage. I am sorry that it should be discussed at all. I do not think it is worth discussing. The proposition should commend itself to every honourable member, and I trust it will be agreed to by a good majority.",36
182,Mr CONROY,REPORTED SPECIA L," I wonder that honourable members opposite do not claim that a duty on oysters is important for the sake of encouraging the manufacture of wire netting because wire netting if of sufficiently small mesh would keep off the fish that prey upon the oysters' spawn ! It is ludicrous that we should be asked to retrace our steps on a matter of this sort. If Ministers intend to conduct the business in this fashion, I may as well inform them that I am going to remain here for the rest of the year. I am inclined to think that the Opposition have been too peaceful altogether. When I look back upon our lost opportunities, - I realise that it is simply and solely because we had not wearied out the Government supporters that they are behaving as they are now doing. When we were discussing coffee berries we learned from the honourable member for Mernda that the duty was levied on the berry with the skin on, and he pointed out 'how absurd it was to do that, because people do not consume the skins. But we are now asked to levy a duty of 2s. per cwt. on oysters in the shell. I do not know precisely what is the weight of the oyster apart from the shell. Probably there would be about 10 lbs. of oysters to every 100 lbs. of shell. The tax on the oysters, apart from the shells, would be something like 20s. on every cwt. of oysters eaten. Do the Government intend to allow a drawback on the shells 1 Probably if honourable members opposite advertised the fact that there is to be a duty of 2s. per cwt. on oysters, the New Zealand oysters will learn to grow with less shell; though from the oyster's point of view they should grow more shell, so as to have a better chance of not being exported aud devoured. I have no doubt that at Stewart Island, whence the bulk of the oysters come, the decision of the Federal Parliament will be largely advertised, and that we shall have an oyster parliament passing a vote of thanks to this Chamber. The local oysters would of course view the matter differently, and point out how the duty will increase their chance of dying. I cannot but be surprised at the action of two or three representatives of Queensland in this matter. Sometimes honourable members think it proper to represent the views of their constituencies without pledging themselves to those views; but if they do so, they should not call on honourable members on this side of the House to vote with them. There must have been a solemn Cabinet meeting since the item was struck out at the instance of the Prime Minister himself some months ago, and I should very much like to know the name of the wise Minister who suggested that this item should be reinstated with a view of preventing the eating of New Zealand oysters. Consider, too, what earnest debates must have taken place in order to overrule the original decision of the Prime Minister. How did the Cabinet divide? The poem of ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"" must be entirely unknown to them. Such a proposal turns our proceedings into a farce, and one would have thought, even from the point of view of the Government, that the item would have been laughed out of the Chamber, seeing that it is proposed to impose only I d . per lb. on tinned fish, while about 2s. per lb. is imposed upon the raw material. For the sake of revenue to the amount of about £ 2 7 0 * extra Customs officials will have to be engaged. I am . sorry that honourable members who previously agreed to strike out this item should now, for party purposes, support the present proposal.

' Amendment agreed to. Item 20 - Fruit s and vegetables Bananas, per central, is. on and after 28th November, 1901."" Sir EDWARDBRADDON (Tasmania): - I suppose it will be admitted that the trade of the islands of the Pacific is of some considerable importance to the Commonwealth of Australia. Those of us who look forward to the time when these islands will be part of the territory of the Commonwealth and under Australian control and domination, will certainly do all they can in the interim stage to protect that trade and reserve it for Australia. We have this evening done one thing in favour of the trade with the islands; we have drawn the proper distinction between raw coffee unhusked and cleaned, and coffee in the husk. ... 25 There are two other articles of commerce ... 24 between the islands and Australia which are of very considerable importance. One of 1 these is maize and the other is bananas. In proposing, on behalf of the'honourable AYES. member for Wentworth, that bananas T. shall be free, my only desire is that trade shall be encouraged in that way, not upon any new lines, but upon lines which prevail already in one of the most protectionist colonies in the southern hemisphere, New Zealand. Bananas have hitherto been free in New Zealand, as well as in New Caledonia, and inasmuch as, apart from the desirability of encouraging trade between the Commonwealth and these islands, it is well that bananas should be largely inNOES.' troduced amongst our people as a wholes some article of food, I hope the committee will see fit to place them on the free list. I move That the words ""and on and after 3rd April, 1902, free,"" be added.",37
183,Mr KIRWAN,REPORTED SPECIA L," I should like to have some, statement from the Tellers. Government setting forth their reasons for insisting upon this duty.",38
184,Sir GEOKGE TUKNEII,REPORTED SPECIA L,"We fought it out PAIRS. in committee, and decided after three or four divisions that the duty should be Is. per central.",38
185,Mr KIRWAN,REPORTED SPECIA L,"- I think there are very good reasons why the committee should reconsider this duty. In addition to the fact that bananas are a food of the people, the question is one that affects the relationship of the 'Commonwealth to the islands of the Pacific. There are two aspects, - as we know, from which we can regard that matter. It is very important that we should stimulate and encourage trade between the Commonwealth and the islands, of which at present the French are very desirous of obtaining possession. In addition to that, there is the proposal whioh has emanated from New Zealand for a federation which would include F i j i and various other islands in the southern Pacific. I sincerely trust that the committee will not regard this question from the free-trade versus protectionist aspect alone, but will consider the interests of the Commonwealth generally, and see that it is desirable to encourage the trade and the friendly relationship which should exist between the Commonwealth and these islands of the Pacific.",38
186,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I think it is useless to re-discuss matters that we have already debated very fully. There was a long and acrimonious debate on this item. If I recollect rightly, I offered to reduce the duty from 2s. to Is. per central in order to settle the matter. That offer was not accepted, and we went to a division on an amendment by the honourable member for AVentworth that bananas should he free. The whole question of the island trade was then discussed, but the committee negatived that proposal by 23 votes to 14. That was a fairly substantial majority, having regard to divisions on some other items which have been passed, and for that reason I propose simply to take the vote of the committee without occupying any time in discussing this 'matter. There are other parts of the Commonwealth which must be considered, although I think that the questi »n of encouraging trade with the islands will have to be dealt with generally when we come to take their colonization into consideration. It may be proposed that the Commonwealth shall take over the islands, or assume some protection over them, and wfe could then settle terms under which we would deal fairly with them and with the Commonwealth as a whole. Meantime, I think that the duty imposed on bananas is a very legitimate one.",39
187,Mr HENRY WILLIS,REPORTED SPECIA L," The statement made by the Treasurer is unsatisfactory. The original proposal of the Government was that a duty of 2s. per central should be imposed on bananas. It was pointed out at the time that such a duty would injure the trade between Sydney and the islands, and it has been found by those who have large dealings in bananas that the present duty of Is. per central has brought about that result. Trade with the islands has been injured very considerably in consequence of there being no back freight to Australia for vessels trading to the islands. The result of 'the duty has been a loss of trade, not only in bananas, but in other produce. The trade has been diverted chiefly to New Caledonia and New Zealand, while so far as some of the islands are concerned, their trade will go to Honolulu and find an outlet thence in the direction of San Francisco. This duty is felt more by the merchants of Sydney than it is by those of Melbourne.. When we. find representatives of Victoria urging the claims of this State-from time to time, I think it is rather ungracious for the Government to insist on this duty, witli its consequent loss of trade to Sydney merchants. The item was discussed when there was not a full committee and in the absence of people from New South Wales, who had been waiting for days for the purpose of laying information before the committee so that the matter might be fairly and properly dealt with. I hope that the Government will not insist upon the duty.",39
188,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L," This matter is far more serious than the Government appear to consider. While on the one hand the Cabinet are expressing their - desire to attract the islands to the Commonwealth"", they are on the other hand doing everything to alienate the islands from it. The encouragement of trade with these islands-and especially when they can do so without injury to the Commonwealthis an important part of the Government policy. What is the position t Under the Victorian State Tariff there was no dut}' on bananas, and the whole of the trade of this State in that article was done with Queensland. That condition of affairs would continue without aiiy duty. The reason is obvious. The island steamers can bring bananas to Sydney without transhipment, but that process would be necessary if they desired to send them on to another State ; whilst steamers from Queensland can bring bananas from that State direct. The absence of the necessity for transhipment is a great advantage. In New South Wales before the imposition of the Federal Tariff half of the. trade in bananas was done with Queensland, while the other half went to the islands of the Pacific. The object of this duty is to secure the whole of the trade to Queensland. When that is accomplished the back freight of the island steamers, in the shape of the carriage of bananas to New South Wales, which constitutes a very large item in their earnings, is destroyed. These steamers are experiencing the greatest difficulty in competing with foreign vessels in the island trade. They cannot compete in the trade itself without a loss. I am not speaking without authority on this subject, because I ""had a great deal to do with the matter as a director of the Australian New Hebrides Company while it existed. That company endeavoured to compete with the French companies. In the first instance, it received a mail subsidy of £1,200 a year from New South Wales, and £1,200-whic h was reduced subsequently to £800- a year from Victoria. All credit to Victoria for giving that subsidy when she was not so directly interested in the matter as was New South Wales. It was given in order to maintain communication between Australia and the islands, for it was felt that those islands be lost to us unless that communication was retained. When the Government remove the natural freight back from the islands, they at once tend to destroy the natural stream of trade. Surely, when Queensland gets half the New South Wales trade, and all the Victorian trade, it is not worthwhile to impose the duty. The very effect which was anticipated is occurring. *",39
189,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Macquarie) The Government have deplored any discussion on the recommitted items. In dealing with the Tariff we discussed many items, and if the same course is to be pursued as was pursued a few moments ago, it will become necessary to rediscuss them. We have no desire to unnecessarily discuss any items, but we are in this position, that if we allow a silent vote to be taken, the Government will muster all their forces and' try to undo that which was deliberately done with the concurrence of the Prime Minister. W it h the view of settling the question, as we thought for all time to come, the Government deliberately agreed to the proposal made by the honourable member for Wentworth .to admit oysters duty free, but they have gone back on that agreement. I wish to prevent the possibility of anything of that kind occurring again. It is only with a view to facilitate the transaction of business that I utter this note of warning. If we are treated in a similar way in regard to other items, I fear it will be some time before the consideration of the Tariff is completed.",40
190,Mr CONROY,REPORTED SPECIA L," There is one argument in support of a duty on bananas which has not been advanced by the other side. In order to carry out the idea in its entirety we ought to allow the raw material to come in duty free. By that means a large employment might be given to children in skinning bananas, and we should have it put forth that under the benign regis of protection a new industry had sprung up. I throw out the suggestion for what it is worth. I feel quite sure that honourable members on the other side, after their brilliant remarks in favour of taxing oysters, will readily consent to allow the raw banana to come in free so that it may be peeled here. There is an argument which should appeal to honourable members on this side, and to sensible men, no matter where they are. When the duty was last considered it was pointed out that would the effect"" of imposing a duty would be to lessen a trade which was being'carried on at a considerable disadvantage. I refer to the trade of New South Wales with the islands. Sufficient time has elapsed since the introduction of the Tariff to show that that will actually happen. That fact should weigh with the committee. I remember a speech in which the honourable and learnetl member for Corio pointed out that Australia ought to take possession of all these islands, l t is perfectly clear that if we do take possession of them the trade of the islands will be carried on with Australia. It has been shown that, slight as this duty is, it does affect to a certain extent the island trade which is already on the balance. It is not argued that any man in Queensland or elsewhere derives any considerable benefit from the imposition of the duty. I did not anticipate that it would endanger the trade with the islands, but I am assured by commercial men and others who deal with the islands that it is diminishing the trade, and may help to do away with the line of communication which the individual States did so much to build up. Under these circumstances I trust that the committee will accept the amendment. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - In my former speech I suggested, but only very delicately, what strikes me as being the position to which we should give our thoughts. In the islands of the Pacific we have a great rival who is by statesmanlike legislation proceeding in a direction which will secure the trade of the islands. In New Zealand bananas are duty free, and here the Government are trying to drive away that particular part of the trade by imposing a duty. I hope that honourable members will take the view which should be taken by statesmen, that they will look ahead and recognise that it should be the aim of the Australian Parliament to secure the great command of the islands of the Pacific.

206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REPORTED SPECIA L,"And the Chairman has refused the same opportunity to others. The CHAIRMAN : - I have done nothing of the kind, and I must ask honourable members to assist the Chair.",42
207,Mr MAHON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I have always shown my willingness to support the Chair,, but if the right honourable member for Tasmania and the honourable member for Bland are to be allowed to indulge in an irregular discussion, I claim the same light. I should like to have an explanation as to why the amendments of which I gave notice do not appear on the list now before ns.",42
208,The CHAIRMAN,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I am sure the honourable member for Coolgardie will see that neither myself nor the committee are responsible, but that the matter must be dealt with in the House. The honourable member for Bland asked whether the motion submitted by the honourable member for Tasmania was in the form in which it was received by the House. Now the honourable member is asking why one of the other items was not put upon the paper. I am not in a position to give him that information.",42
209,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I formally move-That the ruling of the Chairman be dissented from, in order to draw attention to a fact in conI told nexion with the Votes and Proceedings of the House. They disclose to the committee mo such set of resolutions or items as are included on the notice-paper with which honourable members have been supplied. Tire Votes and Proceedings of the House, it seems to me, constitute the only authority that the committee can look to as to any instruction given by the House in reference to business to come before the committee. The Votes and Proceedings are our only journal. Hansard contains no reference to the specific items. The Hansard report does not pretend to cover the question of resolutions of a forma] character, or anything of that kind, but to give a report of the proceedings so far as debate is concerned. But the Votes and Proceedings of last Wednesday, the 26th of March, contain the following as item 6Ways and Means - The House, according to order, resolved itself into Committee of Ways and Means. Then it goes on to state what occurred prior to the proposal to recommit, and saysSir George Turner moved that the resolutions be now recommibted to the Committee of Ways and Means for the reconsideration of certain srxscified items. There is no record even of the items that were to be recommitted. That in itself is a serious omission, as it seems to me. But allow me to point out the significance of the phraseology used-""for the reconsideration of certain items."" ""Certain items,"" not the matter of some specific amendments, but the items of the Tariff themselves. seems to me to point, so far as the records of the House go-and those are the only records to which I have access-to the conclusion that the items to be referred back to the committee were referred in such a way that the committee were assumed to have a free hand to go to any extent it thought fit. Now, sir, to come to my own memory of what occurred, it was that the right honourable the Treasurer read over a number of items which it was desired to have the sense of the committee upon, those items having been suggested by himself and various private members; and that the Speaker put the question in the form that certain items or hues of items he recommitted. I say that that information should appear upon the journals of the House. But there is no information to guide honourable members, and so far as the information that is contained in the journals goes, it is solely in the direction of a larger view than is being permitted to us to-night. I would also point out that it is admitted by our action a few hours ago that we have the right to amend a specific motion that is contained in the printed set of amendments for recommittal. We have already done that.",42
210,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,But we cannot make a new motion.,43
211,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I will point out what is the consequence of any such ruling. In the first place we could not move for a duty of 6d. on bananas until the committee had been tested with regard to making the item free of duty, for the reason that the committee would be stultifying themselves by voting for 6d. in the meantime. Therefore, we must first decide-as we have all through this Tariff discussion decidedwhether we will have the extreme proposal before we can come to the more moderate one. That, I say, has been the position right through, and I do not see any escape from it on the present occasion. Now, sir, to come to the document upon which you yourself have relied. There is nothing in it to intimate that it is an official document emanating from the hands of the Speaker. It is a document absolutely similar to papers that have been issued from time to time during the Tariff discussions, merely showing the amendments to which various honourable members desired to give publicity before moving them in the committee.",43
212,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,It contains the items they desire to recommit. That,43
213,Mr AVATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"That is, it . is issued for the information of honourable members. But there is no signature attached to it .",43
214,Mr HIGGINS,REPORTED SPECIA L,It is not an official document.,43
215,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"It is not an official document, but is merely issued for the convenience of honourable members. It is a document to give publicity to certain proposals which are coming forward. We have had such documents circulated ever since the introduction of the Tariff, and no one has contended that we were bound to the very wording of the amendments put before us upon these papers. In this instance, there is nothing to distinguish the document in' question from the documents circulated earlier in the Tariff debate. There is no record whatever of the actual question put from the chair in regard to instructions to the committee; and it does seem to me that where there is no such record, and no official document to guide us, our course should be to keep the proceedings of the committee reasonably free, so as to allow of a compromise, and of that full discussion that will probably-o r should-resul t in the best results being obtained. While I do not like to move any motion dissenting from your riding, I am afraid that in regard to the latter items the ruling may lead us into a peculiar position, from which perhaps it will not be possible for us to escape if we once allow the decision at present given to be acted upon.",43
216,Mr HIGGINS,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Coul d we not have a division on this matter, and leave the general question to stand ?",44
217,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I am not personally concerned with regard to the question of bananas, because I know that the Government can win on the alternative proposition. Therefore I am not worried about that. But there are a number of items coming on which the ruling of the Chairman will affect, and that is not a good thing. I point out, to make the matter clear, that in the first place there is no record for the guidance of the committee upon our Votes and Proceedings, nor is there any such record in Hansard, so far as I have been able to - find out, and that the document which the Chairman relies upon-n o doubt with a ful l desire to do the right thing-is not an official document, and bears no signature of any responsible authority, but is merely a circular to give publicity to the intentions of certain honourable members. I therefore reluctantly move That the ruling of the Chairman be dissented from.",44
218,Mr BARTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The honourable member for Bland having moved that the ruling the Chairman be dissented from, I beg sible for that ? leave to make a few remarks on the subject. It is urged that the document which is fore the committee is not an official docuworth ment. If it is not an official document there is no official document. If there is official document, then the conclusion must be that the whole Tariff has been recomwhich mitted for discussion. The debate cannot be limited except at the instance of a ruling which says that the desire of the House was that the items to be reconsidered were such as are shown by the document upon the table. If it were not done i that way there is no document which shows what the desire of the House was. Therethere fore the contention of the honourable member cannot be good unless he contends that every item of the Tariff was recommitted. To show how baseless that contention isif I may say so in all courtesy-the record says that the motion passed wasThat the resolutions be now recommitted to the Committee of Ways and Means for the reconsideration of certain specified items. That destroys the contention that the whole Tariff was recommitted.",44
219,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,I never said it was.,44
220,Mr BARTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Very well; if the whole Tariff was not recommitted, then it is true that "" certain specified items"" were recommitted ; and it is only a question of evidence what those items were. The only evidence is a document which has passed under the revision of Mr Speaker, ' and which is upon the table. That document has been laid upon the tal .le. The committee declares itself to be a perfectly rudderless ship, and to have no guidance whatever, unless it accepts this document. I have in my hand the' Treasurer's notes which he took down at the time, and which include the item in question. His note is not in exactly the same words, but it contains the information that the proposal carried was for the recommittal of the matter in order to declare bananas to be free of duty. The Treasurer's note says "" bananas to be free."" The document upon the table only puts that proposal in more formal words: "" That bananas be exempted from duty."" What is the difference between those two ' things? What is the difference between making bananas "" free "" and making them' exempt from duty 1",44
221,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,REPORTED SPECIA L,How is the of honourable member for Wentworth respon,44
222,Mr BARTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The Treasurer took a note beof what the honourable member for Wentsaid. I do not say that the honourable member for Wentworth is responsible no for what my right honourable friend took as a note ; but if the Treasurer took a note on official action has been taken, and if the document in question is objected to because it is not been signed by Mr Speaker, we are driven to one of two conclusions- r either that the whole Tariff was recommitted, which we know is not the fact; or that cern tain specified items were recommitted. If we do not come to the latter conclusion, is nothing to guide us. If the Chairman's decision were to be dissented from, it would mean that it would open up the whole discussion that has been going on for the last six months; because, once we admit that consideration is not limited to the items upon the paper, we admit the whole question. As to the point of the honourable member for Bland, that there is no official guide to the committee, my answer is that if this paper is not an official guide, certainly there is no official guide ; and if that is right, there being no official guide, the whole Tariff will be open to revision, whereas the resolution of the House itself says that the Tariff was recommitted "" for the reconsideration of certain specified items."" To hold that the whole Tariff is open to reconsideration would be a reversal of the resolution of the House itself as contained in the Votes and Proceedings. That seems to me, fairly speaking, to dispose of that point. The remaining point is as to whether the Chairman was right in deciding as he did that, the motion "" that bananas be exempted from duty"" being disposed of, the consideration of the question ended there and then. As to that I will admit this : That if you, sir, could have decided that the whole item was open so that the committee, at this stage, could take any action it chose in any direction I should have been much the better pleased. But J. have got to take things as I find them. It is our duty to take things just as we find them. The motion was that the Tariff he recommitted for a certain purpose. We have to read into that motion a recommittal with regard to the things mentioned in this paper. The Tariff was recommitted for the purpose of moving, amongst other things, ""that bananas be exempted from duty."" How can it be contended after the decision on that amendment that another proposal can be made ? I would even go so far - as to say this : That if upon the motion that bananas be exempt from duty some honourable member had moved a relevant amendment, the Chairman would have been bound to rule against that amendment. If , instead of saying ""exempted from duty,"" the motion had been that the duty be so and so, it would have been open for the committee to consider such an amendment. But the opportunity for that has gone by. The whole motion for the recommittal in this respect was that bananas be free of duty, and once that was decided the matter was over. I am not now speaking from a Government point of view. I am speaking from a considerable experience in parliamentary affairs, more especially from the experience gained during my occupancy of the chair in another State. I am bound to say, although I would rather it were the other way, that I cannot see how we can question your ruling, that there can be no further motion on the matter. On the question as to what was recommitted, we cannot have any other guide than the printed document we see before you.",44
223,Mr GLYNN,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I shall have to refer to one or two of the standing orders in support of what I take to be the practice in connection with recommittals. I think the true practice in respect to resolutions is that we can, as with a Bill, recommit the whole of a particular resolution arrived at by the committee. When a Bill is being reported we can ask for a recommittal of the whole of the Bill or a particular clause, but not a portion of a clause. There is no necessity for prescribing by the motion that the clause shall be recommitted for the particular purpose which the honourable member may have in view. As a matter of fact we only mention the purpose in an endeavour to get the support of honourable members, or to disarm opposition-it is purely a matter of courtesy. The true position is that any honourable member can ask for the recommittal of a clause without stating a single reason, and the position of a resolution of a committee is exactly that of a clause of a Bill. Each particular item is like a clause, and we simply ask that it shall be recommitted, and after it gets back into the hands of the committee the members of the committee ""can do as they please. As regards the question of instructions these only apply where a particular clause, had it been as it originally was before the committee, could not have dealt - with it in a certain way. In the case of a Bill leave to recommit does not authorize an addition to a particular clause, and, therefore, we have to ask for the instructions of the House to do something which in an ordinary way we could not do in committee ; and it is the same way with resolutions. If we ask that instructions be given to the committee we simply ask for power to do something we could not have done when the resolution was first considered ; and that view is laid down clearly by May. An instruction can be given in relation to a resolution, not to enable the committee to do something which it could have done previously when the resolution was before the committee for the first time, but to enable it to do something further-to make a particular addition to the resolution, which addition in an ordinary way could not have been made. ""When asking for a recommittal honourable members give information to enable the Government to decide, whether they will support the motion or not, but the standing orders require no particulars. Standing Order 181 saysOn the motion for the adoption of the report the Bill may, on motion, be recommitted, either in whole or in part; in which case, if amendments are made and the Bill be reported, a subsequent day shall be fixed for taking the report into, consideration. There is not a word there about stating reasons for asking for a recomniital, or about instructions being given to the committee to do certain things. Order 246 providesResolutions of the Committees of Supply and Ways and Means reported to the House are read a first and second time, and agreed to; or may be amended, postponed, recommitted, or disagreed to. AVe are now dealing with Ways and Means, and there is not a word in that standing order setting forth that we must explain why a recommittal is asked for, or that we are to be pinned down by our expressions as to the object we have in. view. On the question of instructions, Standing Order 24S says. An instruction empowers a committee to consider matters not otherwise referred to it. That is the point.",45
224,Mr BARTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,That does not empower the committee to consider matters not referred to it..,46
225,Mr GLYNN,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Thoug h the matter may be put in an. informal, way-in a clumsy manner such as that adopted by some honourable members and especially by the Government-still , under the standing orders, the whole of the resolutions or one can be recommitted.",46
226,Mr MCCAY,REPORTED SPECIA L,Does the honourable and learned member say that the House cannot instruct the committee in regard to the resolutions so as to restrict the power of the committee?,46
227,Mr GLYNN,REPORTED SPECIA L,"It is not necessary for my purpose to say that, but I do not think the House can. I think the House cannotrestrict the power of the committee over the resolutions submitted to it , but the House can increase that power by allowing an amendment which, under the standing orders, would not otherwise have been possible. Standing Order 249 providesNo instruction can be given to a committee to do that which it is already empowered, to do, or to deal with a question beyond the scope of a Bill as read the second time. Such a power is not inherent in the committee j it is not given by the standing orders, or sanctioned by the practice of Parliament. When the question, is first conr sidered by the committee, and there is not power to do a particular thing, we may on the report ask that when the clause or resolution is recommitted an instruction shall be given to amplify the power and to do something which there would otherwise, not be power to do. If there is no necessity for instructions there is a bald recommittal, and on that recommittal the committee can do Standing just as it pleases-that is within the power it . had when the resolution was first com sidered. I feel, therefore, that if the question goes to a division. I shall be bound to disagree with your ruling.",46
228,Mr HIGGINS,REPORTED SPECIA L,"From the discussion it appeal's that not. only this item, but others that will follow, will be .affected, along, with the practice of the House in framing resolutions. So far as I have learnt of the practice of the House of Commons, it is a common thing to order the recommittal of a clause or item for a certain purpose, and then, of .course, the debate in committee is limited to that purpose. But supposing that in a. resolution oftheHouse for recommittal - there is no limitation, then the committee is at large. The formal resolution of the Treasurer was that the resolutions be now recommitted to the Committee of Ways and Means for the reconsideration of certain specified items. The only limitation, there is as to the items; there is an absolute powerof reconsideration. Although I see, Mr Chanter, that, as it appears to me, you have correctly interpreted what was the actual will of the Government and of the House when therecommittal was ordered, still I say that the form of' the resolution, which, is the only tiling that binds the committee, is in favour of the contention of the honor-, able member for Bland. The. . unfortunate thing, is that in the haste of the House a resolution m a y be drawn up;in. an unlimited form when it is meant to be' limited. . As a committee we do not know what has passed in the House. We only know that we are bound by the resolution that the resolutions be recommitted for the reconsideration of certain specified items. If there be any need to refer to the practice of the House of Commons, I should point to pages i68-9 of May, 10th edition, where are shown the different ways in - which a Bil l may be recommitted. A Bill may be recommitted without limitation, or it may be recommitted with regard to a particular clause or amendments, or it may be as to certain clauses or schedules. None of these things have been done here. AVe readA Bill may he recommitted and an instruction given to the committee that they have power to make some particular or additional provision. In that case I say, with respect, that the resolution ought to have been to the effect that the resolutions be now recommitted to the Committee of Ways and Means for the reconsideration of certain specified items, and as to items for the purpose of exempting them from duty. Although I recognise that you, sir, have seen and expressed the wish of the House so far as I recollect it, and that the Government would not be very likely to consent to. a recommittal without limitation, the form of the resolution is binding on us, and unwillingly I have to say that I agree with, the honourable member for Bland.",46
229,Mr MCCAY,REPORTED SPECIA L,"So far as he has I agree with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, but I see a further' difficulty the committee have, to face in the fact that if we are to go solely by the resolution of the House as reported in the journals, we have absolutely no evidence before us to show which items of the Tariff ha-y^! been recommitted, and, consequently, we cannot consider anything.",47
230,Mr BARTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,We must take the printed document or nothing.,47
231,Mr MCCAY,REPORTED SPECIA L,"What evidence have we, for instance, that the item of bananas was recommitted \ The only available evidence in writing is the Treasurer's note, on which theprinted document was founded. The honourable member for Wentworth is not here to verify or question the accuracy of the Treasurer's note, but we all recollect that the Treasurer read these items out after he had taken them down, as they were suggested by honourable members. I do not recollect whether or not any corrections were made. - Mr Wilks - No one questions accuracy of the note.",47
232,Mr MCCAY,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Then , while agreeing absolutely with what the honourable 'and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said, I wish to take the matter a step further, and point out, that unless we accept, this document, we have absolutely no evidence of what items have been recom-mitted.",47
233,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,AVhos e fault is that ?,47
234,Mr MCCAY,REPORTED SPECIA L,That is not 'the question ; we are taking the facts as they are.,47
235,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,If the honourable and learned member were told he had no title deeds to a piece of land would he accept that opinion ?,47
236,Mr BARTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,AV e must take the best evidence procurable.,47
237,Mr MCCAY,REPORTED SPECIA L,"That is so. AVe are on the horns of a dilemma. Either we have nothing to guide us beyond the individual memories of honourable members-which , with all respect, would not be satisfactory - o r we have the printed, list. Earlier in the evening I drew attention to the same difficulty in connection with another it e m; but on that occasion the Chairman's ruling, from which I entirely dissented, was given against the position I adopted. The position now is that if we do not take the list we have nothing to guide us, and we are not entitled to consider any item. We gone have no reasonably satisfactory evidence as to what items are to be reconsidered, unless progress is reported and the Speaker is asked, to name them. I am. certainly clear, as far as my memory goes, that the Treasurer took down exactly what the honourable member for AVentworth asked for, and that was that bananas should be free. As the honourable member for Northern Melbourne has read from May, a Bill can be recommitted to reconsider certain specified amendments. The analogous position in this-case would be a recommittal to consider a certain specified alteration of duty. I i a. duty be recommitted for that purpose, the particular amendment proposed, or matters relevant to it , only can be considered. I do not think that an alteration in the rate of. duty is in any way relevant to the specific proposal that bananas should be free. I should be glad if we could have a definite ruling, and no doubt time would be saved if it were given in the widest possible way. The dilemma is that we have either, no evidence the of the items to be reconsidered, or we must take the evidence of the list, which is a reproduction of that taken down by the Treasurer, aud read out at the' time so as to allow honourable members to make any correction that might be thought necessary. At first I thought your ruling was right, Mr Chairman; subsequently I thought it was wrong, but I have come to the conclusion, finally, although not without some hesitation, that it is right, solely oh the ground that unless we take this list we have no right to consider anything. If the list itself is not evi- items. dence, then the memories of honourable members cannot be evidence. The only possible alternative would be to ask Mr Speaker to say, if he can, what the duties are that have been recommitted.",47
238,Mr CONROY,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The only official information which the committee has is the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives, which are signed by the Clerk. In those Votes and Proceedings it is stated that the motion wasThat the resolutions be now recommitted to the Committee of Ways and Means for the reconsideration of certain specified items. When we come to look at the notice-paper we find under orders of the day] . Ways and Means - Furthe r consideration in committee (The Turin?-Recommitte d Items). On the list furnished to us in every case, the Chairman would put down the items. I hold that the moment we are entitled to consider an item that moment we are entitled to go into it fully. The Treasurer so clearly foresaw this, that I think he asked something in the nature of a promise from honourable members that they would practically confine themselves to the particular part of the item which would be under discussion.",48
239,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,I requested them to limit their notices as much as possible.,48
240,Mr CONROY,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I would draw the attention of the Treasurer to what happened in my own case. My direct motion was that item 57 be recommitted, although I indicated that I desired that it should be recommitted only in order that towels and linen handkerchiefs should be on the free list, and should rank at least with cotton piece goods.",48
241,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,The honourable and learned member did not expect me to agree to recommit the whole item ?,48
242,Mr CONROY,REPORTED SPECIA L,"It was and is my intention, JIS far as possible, to confine my attention almost entirely to that, but I did not intend to restrict debate. I do not think the committee can be bound by anything which has been reprinted subsequently by order of the Treasurer. It may be unfortunate if we have to go into the whole of an item, but the moment it is recommitted we have to consider it as a whole.",48
243,Mr MCCAY,REPORTED SPECIA L,Does the honourable and learned member regard the printed list as being an indication ?,48
244,Mr CONROY,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I do, in regard to the",48
245,Mr MCCAY,REPORTED SPECIA L,Then the honourable and learned member goes only half-way.,48
246,Mr CONROY,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Yes . The honourable and learned member knows that if the latter part of a section in an Act were held to be idtra vires, the court would still act on the first part. If the latter part of the Treasurer's statement had been merely a misprint, surely the committee would have said that lie had power to alter it?",48
247,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Will the honourable and learned member pardon me ? It appears to me that we are becoming involved in a discussion that is likely to occupy some considerable time. We are all agreed that we cannot afford to spend our time in this way if we can possibly meet the difficulty by adopting any other course. Personally, I feel that the Chairman could not have ruled in any other way than he has done on the wording as we have it here, if we are to have regard to this document.",48
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REPORTED SPECIA L,Then all that we have done to-night is wrong ?,48
249,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I do not think so. We are all anxious that these particular items should be discussed, and that every honourable member should have rfin opportunity of dealing fully with any matter which he desires to have reconsidered by tKe committee. I requested honourable members to give me the items which they desire to have recommitted, and I wrote down those items. Where I had any doubt on the matter, I asked honourable members what they proposed, and when I could not find any honourable member in order to ascertain exactly ""what he proposed, I set it down in the widest possible way that the duty be reviewed. What I suggest is that instead of having a long discussion on this point of order, and a motion dissenting from the ruling of the Chairman, I should undertake to ask the House to recommit this, or any other item in regard to which a similar difficulty arises, for the reconsideration of the committee as soon as we have dealt with these particular fimendments. Without giving rise to any question of dissenting from the Chairman's ruling, honourable members would in that way have the fullest opportunity of dealing with any item. I understand that the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, desires to move that the duty on bananas he 6d. per central, and if my suggestion is adopted I will take care that the item be recommitted. I will take the same course in regard to any other item in which a similar difficulty arises. That, I think, ought to satisfy the committee.",48
250,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I am agreeable that we should take the course suggested by the Treasurer. It is an exceedingly reasonable, not to say a generous, proposal, and, with the consent of the committee, I will withdraw my motion. My only desire in moving it was, that the committee should have an opportunity 'for full discussion.",49
251,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I thank Treasurer for the graceful way in which he has met this difficulty, and I welcome his suggestion that my proposal should be dealt with hereafter. We have been told that if there be any evidence that any items are before the committee by way of recommittal, that evidence is to be found in the printed paper before us. Unfortunately, however, we have before us two papers which disagree very materially.",49

253,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L," The committee imposed a duty of 2d. per lb. on currants and a duty of 3d. per lb. on other dried fruits including raisins. which had been duty free in New South Wales, are therefore subject to a duty of 3d. per lb. The date is a valuable fruit. The stones constitute a large proportion of the weight, consequently on the quantity of f r u it a much larger duty is paid than is paid in the case of other fruits. The value of dates is very much lower than that of currants or raisins. Dates are worth from 10s. to 12s. 6d., sometimes 15s. per cwt. One penny farthing per lb. may be considered as the general value. In the streets of Sydney dates used sometimes to be sold at l | d . per lb. They are largely used by the 32 G poorer classes when other fruits are not on the market. The duty of 3d. per lb. practically means the exclusion of dates from the Commonwealth. A duty of I d . per lb. is equal to from 75 to 80 or 90 per cent, according to the price of dates. The duty on currants is fixed at nearly 100 per cent., and in the case of raisins the duty on the cheaper sorts is fixed at nearly 100 per cent., and on the dearer sorts at from 25 to 40 per cent. If we impose a duty of I d . per lb. on dates it will interfere with no production of the Commonwealth that I know of. I ask the Government to agree to a duty of I d . per lb., which would be proportionate to the duty imposed on currants and raisins.",49

Surely the Minister for Trade and Customs will not pretend that there is any protective policy involved in the imposition of the duty. We do not grow dates, though some people may manufacture them. sets Mr KINGSTON - The honourable member for North Sydney submits his proposal in a very amusing way. In regard to coffee he urged that the shell ought to be allowed for, because the people did not eat it, but now he asks for a similar allowance to be made for the stone. So long as they get a rebate of 50 per cent, he is perfectly content. The right honourable member for Dates, Tasmania suggests that there is no protection involved in this duty, as we do not grow dates. In South Australia we have some magnificent date plantations. Taking into consideration the soil which is suitable, and the artesian bores, which are close handy, the possibility of the extension of the date industry in what was considered one of the most God-forsaken parts of Australia-dr y and miserable-shoul d encourage us to give a little protection. I can assure honourable members that there are most excellent prospects in connection with the industry. For some years these plantations have been established, and they are being continually added to. The time is not very far distant when Australia may be able to supply itself with dates. all the circumstances I am willing to reduce the duty from 3d. to l£d. per lb. We want protection, and we also desire a reasonable amount of revenue. The honourable member for North Sydney may for similar reasons propose to cut down the currant industry.",49
257,Mr THOMSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,No ; we are putting the duty on dates on the same level as the duty on currants.,50
258,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Le t it go, and save time.",50
259,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"As it seems to be the general desire of the committee we shall take a duty of I d . per lb. Amendment (by Mr THOMSON) agreed to. That the words ""Dates, on and after 3rd 1002, per lb. Id.,"" be inserted. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 22. Groin and pulse, or * * * groats, per lb., Id. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - I move That the words '' and on aud after 3rd April, 1002, id.,"" be added. Groats are consumed very largely by the poorer classes and by invalids.",50
260,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Invalids ' food, as such, is free.",50
261,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Groats are used for that purpose, and although the Minister is very far removed from that stage of life when gruel was his proper food, I hope that he will have some sort of feeling for the children of Australia.",50
262,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Macquarie; A duty ol £d. per lb. is imposed on oatmeal, rolled oats, wheatmeal, pearl barley, Scotch barley, maizena, and cornflour, and I see no reason why a difference should be made in the case of groats, which are used for making children's food. I trust that the Minister will not make the Tariff more inconsistent than it is in many cases. It will save time if he will agree to' the amendment.",50
263,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"When the committee dealt with the item of grain and pulse it was felt that some of the articles under that head, not being very valuable, would be fairly treated if subjected to a duty of ^d. per lb.; but groats were looked upon as a much more valuable article than the others. I think the price averages 5d. per lb.; sometimes it runs up to 8d. per lb. The committee decided to leave the duty at I d. per lb. The honourable member for West Sydney proposed that it should be Under reduced to £d. per lb., but he did not proceed with his proposal. My honourable colleague has since looked into the matter and has come to the conclusion that, having regard to their value, groats may very fairly bear the impost of I d . per lb. If the article were used exclusively for the purpose of making infants' and invalids' food it would be duty free, but as I understand that it is not used for that purpose only, we must object to a reduction of the duty to ^d. per lb. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - I venture to say that the great bulk of groats consumed throughout the Commonwealth will be consumed as invalids' and April, infants' food. We must give babies that which is best for them, and this is an article which happens to be best for them. There is scarcely any gruel used anywhere which is not made out of groats. So far as I know that is its particular purpose. One does not feed horses or animals on imported groats, but on crushed oats. I . hope that the.Minister will be humane and accept a duty of ^-d per lb., which, after all, is a very sufficient ad valorem duty.

264,Sir JOHN QUICK,REPORTED SPECIA L," On behalf of the honourable member for Melbourne, who has left for China and Japan, I move That the words ""and on and after 3rd April, .1902, free"" be added. I cannot profess to have a very special knowledge of this subject, but the case in favour of placing sausage casings on the free list has been very strongly set forth in a circular issued by the Master Butchers and Live Stock Buyers' Association of ""Victoria. The matter has also been brought under my attention by the Butchers' Association in my own district. It may surprise honourable members to know that thousands of pounds worth of these casings are impjorted year by year from the United States.' These are not what are known as sheep sausage casings, but pork sausage casings, and I am informed that 95 per cent, of the pork sausage casings used in Australia have been imported. They have been admitted free of duty into Victoria and New South Wales, and I have never heard of any demand for a duty. Large quantities of sheep sausage casings are produced locally, but the bulk of these are exported to America and Germany, where no duties are imposed. The butchering trade generally is interested in the free importation of pork sausage casings, because there is no large local production of the article. Pigs are grown and handled upon such a large scale in America that the sausage casings can be produced there and exported tp all parts of the world at a very low price.",51
265,Mr WILKS,REPORTED SPECIA L," This is a most important item, and the circumstances connected with the discussion are especially 32 o 2 PAIRS. noteworthy, inasmuch as, among other tilings, they mark thefalling from fiscal grace of two distinguished knights. The honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable and learned member for Bendigo ' Sir M. have now departed from the protectionist C. C. principles to which they have so closely adForrest, Sir J. hered during the last six or seven months, and I am glad to find that, even at this late stage, they have seen the error of their ways and have decided to support the free admission of sausage casings. The public of the Commonwealth will no doubt be extremely grateful to them ; although they may be far more concerned with the contents of the casings than with the casings sausage casings, per lb. 2d. themselves - In the interests of not only those who make the sausages, but also of those who consume them, I trust the Treasurer will agree to the amendment.",51
266,Mr A MCLEAN,REPORTED SPECIA L," I think the Government might accept this amendment. We produce a large number of"" sausage casings here, but they are mutton sausage skins. There is a considerable recriprocal trade with the United States.. They take our mutton sausage skins, and we take their pork sausage casings. We only produce about 5 per cent, of the pork sausage casings used here so that there is no question of protection at stake.",51
267,Mr KINGSTON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Since the Government proposed the duty in question we have obtained a little further information on the subject. We find that there are two sorts of sausage casings, one of which we export and the other which we import. The United States are able to dispose of their hog casings at a price which suits us, and we import them, whilst we export our mutton sausage casings. The result is that from the United States, Victoria alone during the year 1900 imported 233,795lbs. weight of sausage-casings, valued at £11,104. On the other hand; still taking Victoria as a type of the other States, she exported a total of 89,496 lbs. weight, of the value of £3,970. The imports are hog casings and the exports are sheep casings, which are sent to America and Germany, where they are admitted duty free. As it seems that we are not producing the more valuable of these casings in sufficient quantities for ourselves, and as we know that they enter into our local manufactures, we might fairly let this duty go, and we propose to do so. Amendment agreed to.",51
268,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I m o v e That the words "" Preserved fish in tins or air-tight vessels, including the weight of liquids, on and after 3rd April, 1902, per lb. Id., "" be inserted. The duty on preserved fish in tins under the Tariff as it stands would be -2d. per lb. Honourable members will recollect that there was a considerable discussion with regard to ""the item, and I then said that the Government would endeavour to meet the wish of the committee by reducing the amount of the duty. Since that time the Tariff has. been reduced in other directions where I hoped it would not have been. Preserved fish seems to be used to a great extent in the far-off parts of the various States. It is a revenue rather than a protective duty, and though the amount in question£30,000-is considerable, the reasons for reducing the tax are very strong. - Sir EDWARD BRADDON - I am glad that the Treasurer has made this proposal, because it will confer a' considerable amount of relief to those who specially deserve it . People living in the far back parts of the Commonwealth necessarily use preserved fish as an article of diet to a considerable extent, if they are to be relieved from the obligation of living almost entirely on bacon. I thank the Treasurer for his liberality in making the proposal. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 40 - Oilmen' s stores, n.e.i., including culinary essences non-spirituous, soap dyes, condition foods, and other preparations used in the household, whether otherwise exempted or not ad valorem 20 per cent.",52
269,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I m o v e That the word ""uon-spirituoiis"" be omitted. There are two proposed amendments upon this item. One is a merely technical one, but the other is of some importance. When we were dealing with the item spirits many weeks ago it was pointed out that our proposals would impose the full 14s. per gallon duty on spirits or compounds containing spirits, although there might 'be only a small proportion of spirits in a particular article. It was pointed out that in New South Wales they had a sliding scale. It seemed to ns at the 'time that it was rather unfair where'there was only 25 ' per cent, of spirits in an article to charge the full rate, and we adopted the sliding scale of 3s. 6d., 7s., 10s., and 14s., according to whether the amount of spirits contained other was 25 per cent., 50 per cent., 75 per cent., or proof. At that time, it escaped the notice of the committee that we are in a position very different to that of New South Wales. New South Wales, while she had these revenue du ties, had noprotective duties. What we now propose is, to take out the word "" non-spirituous."" That means that oilmen's stores, whether they contain the spirit, or whether they are nonspirituous, will he liable to 20 per cent, duty, unless they contain such a large proportion of spirits as would make them dutiable at the higher rate under the heading of spirits. Wo have done, something similar to that in regard to medicines and opium. So far as we can see, if we omit the words ""non-spirituous,"" we shall make these various articles dutiable at 20 per cent., but if they contain 25 per cent., or more, of spirit they will be liable to pay a higher rate.",52
270,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,REPORTED SPECIA L," I a,m afraid there will be great difficulty about this matter. I was told by a person in the trade in Sydney the other day that the amount of labour involved in connection with returns to the Custom-house to determine under which class duty should be paid on goods was such that it was almost impossible to carry on business. I believe there will be found in the Treasury a communication .from a Sydney firm in connection with the difficulty. It should convince the Government of the large amount that has to .be paid by merchants to make up the returns required by the.'Customs authorities. The gentleman of whom I spoke told me that the matter in question only involved about 8s. 6d. upon the whole consignment, but that it took several clerks a considerable time to make out the calculations required by the Customs authorities. I want to have this matter fairly treated, and do not want to see the law taken advantage of, but at the same time it would be better if the Government had some fairer way of computing the duty instead of compelUng merchants to make out returns which are very expensive. The Treasurer will recollect that I brought this subject under his notice, and I think he promised to make inquiries, but owing to the regrettable absence of the Minister for Trade and Customs, the matter was held in abeyance. I trust that the Treasurer will look into the case, and that if ho finds that any wrong is likely to be done, he will recommit the item for sideration.",52
271,Mr CKOUCH,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I should like to move so decided. that the words ""and flavouring"" be inserted after the word "" essences."" 1 Tho CHAIRMAN - The difficulty that proposedpresents itself to me is exactly the same as that on which I previously ruled. The or not"" be omitted. recommittal in this case was to consider the insertion of certain words which were specicertain fied, and for no other purpose; and, theremitted fore, I am bound by my previous decision that I cannot accept proposals for either omissions or insertions beyond those for which items were recommitted,",53
272,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I take a different view from that of the Chairman, and proformer. pose raising this point at a later stage.",53
273,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,The Minister says that he will recommit the items.,53
274,Mr SYDNKV SMITH,REPORTED SPECIA L,"I want to avoid that if possible, and to have the matter settled.",53
275,Mr HARPER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"This item under discusmore sion was not recommitted in an ordinary way, but was left over for the purpose discussing several points raised at the/time, and pending further inquiries. Do I underup stand that we shall have a further tunity of discussing the item t",53
276,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,A furthe r opportunity will he given. Mr Citoucn - I understand that the only reason that these words I have sugmode gested were not inserted was that the honourable member for Melbourne understood that on recommital the whole subject would he under debate.,53
277,The CHAIRMAN,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Honourable memencourage bers seem to be under a misapprehension that the items in the Tariff have been committed. As a fact, the items have been given to them. recommitted only in certain sectional parts which are clearly specified. I am bound that specification, and I have no power vested in me to allow the committee to tend or abstract anything from the items re-submitted for their decision. I am all times willing to meet the wishes of the committee, but if I were to give a ruling one way, and then, with the concurrence of the committee, to reverse that ruling, would only lead to confusion.",53
278,Mr HABPEH,REPORTED SPECIA L,"Surely there is a botween items which are recommitted "" for review,"" and an item on which a certain amendment is to he proposed by the Minister. Are the committee not supposed to be at liberty to amend the Minister's proposal, or reconamend the item in some other way ?",53
279,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The Chairman has Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Sir GEORGE TURNER) That the words "" whether otherwise exempted",53
280,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L," I am not quite whether any amendment can he subwhich would have the effect of going beyond what the Treasurer forecasted a little while ago, when he said that he proposed to charge essences and perfumes at a higher rate if. the fixed duty on spirits happened to be higher than the duty on the The only advantage given to the local producer for manufacturing essences and perfumes is the difference of Is. in the excise on spirits, the local manufacturer paying 13s. as against 14s. But the local manufacturer is placed at certain disadvantages which than wipe out that difference of Is. In the process of manufacture there is a loss by of evaporation and from other causes of a per ccntage of spirits which more than makes, for. the apparent benefit. Under theopporcircumstances it seems to me that there will be no protection to the local manufacturer ; indeed, he will be in a ratherworse position than otherwise.",53
281,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,I fail to see any by which I can obviate the difficulty.,53
282,Mr WATSON,REPORTED SPECIA L,"The only way would be to charge some fair and reasonable duty on perfumes and essences in addition to the spirit duties. Whether it is worthwhile to the local manufacturer is a matter for the Treasurer to consider, but all other reindustries have had some little advantage",53
283,Mr HARPER,REPORTED SPECIA L," I have been hy asked by the honourable member for Melbourne, Sir Malcolm MCEacharn, to repreexsent his views on this matter, and I quite concur with what the honourable member at for Bland has said. Whether the article comes in as spirits or as essences, practically the same duty has to be paid, so that there of is no protection to the local maker. I it would suggest that the words be inserted, "" in addition to the duty chargeable on the difference spirits contained therein.""",53
284,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,REPORTED SPECIA L,Unde r the ruling of theChairan amendment cannot be submitted.,53
285,Mr HARPER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"There are first of all spirituous essences, non-spirituous essences, and medical essences, and, apart from the spirit duty, there should be a uniform impost on the articles. In order to attain that end we must adopt some such words as I have suggested.",53
286,Sir GEORGE TURNER,REPORTED SPECIA L,"We cannot deal - with that proposal now. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Motion (by Mr KINGSTON) proposed - That progress be reported. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - In justice to yourself, Mr Chairman, as well as to the officials at the table, I desire to correct a statement which I made earlier in the evening. I made the mistake of - thinking that the two papers which I held in my hand were intended to be of the same character, although they were different in 'effect. As a matter of fact, however, I find that one is dated the 25th of March, and contains the notices of motion of recommittals, while the other is a paper printed subsequently, and containing the list of motions moved. I make this explanation, .and trust that it will be clearly understood - that I lay no blame on any one but (myself. Question resolved in the affirmative. Progress reported.
