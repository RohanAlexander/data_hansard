1,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. AT SIC AMENDMENT (INDIGENOUS NA FUND) BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 August, on motion reconciliation. by Mr Keating: That the bill be now read a second time.",11
2,Mr NEHL,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"In Islander speaking to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigento ous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, I say at the outset that I am one member of this House who is absolutely dedicated to concept of justice and equality for all Australdo ians. It is absolutely vital in every approach we make to the business of the parliament of Australia. Because of that belief in the equality of and the need for people to be treated the same before the law, any special funding or activity provided should be on the basis of need. I standing. totally reject the need for special funding on the basis of race, creed or any other distincnot tion of that kind. Having said that, it is totally obvious that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia are in need. Therefore, I do not quibble with the provision of special funding to assist them to live lives to the full and to achieve justice and equality in Australia. As I have said before in this place-I will not go on at length about it, but it needs to said again-I reject the guilt industry and proclaim again that I personally feel no guilt for what has happened in the past. I regret that those things have happened. I acknowissues ledge that the history of Australia in its welfare. treatment of its indigenous people has not been all that any of us would require. should not live in the past; we should learn from the past. Our great need today is to forward in a spirit of reconciliation and provide for the future well-being of all Austo tralians, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I am, quite frankly, not opposed to the provisions of this bill. A number of areas in the bill need amendment. The various offers made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), in their contributions yesterday are genuine offers. We are attempting to take a bipartisan approach to this issue. We, as a coalition, are committed to the process of I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Affairs (Mr Tickner), in his reaction what was being said yesterday, more often than not merely interjected 'trickery'. I am disappointed that he would take that approach the without having even seen the amendments. I not think that is up to his usual standard. Mr Hicks-A very sensitive issue.",11
3,Mr NEHL,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"It is a very sensitive issue, as my colleague says. I fully and totally believe all that we in this place should be approaching consideration of the land fund in a genuine spirit of cooperation, tolerance and underThe problems of our Aboriginal people will be solved just by buying more land. I sense that the contributions being made by government members. I acknowledge their sincerity in seeking to do something for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peopletheir have a sort of cargo cult mentality. They think that, if they buy land for Aboriginal people, that will solve all of their problems. That is not the case. The reality is that the be Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people I are beset by the most appalling conditions and standards of health, education, housing and lack of employment. We cannot divorce these from the general question of Aboriginal I think some members of the government We have misunderstood what we are seeking to do in mentioning issues such as health, go education, housing and employment in the to same breath as the land fund. We are trying illustrate and make clear beyond doubt that buying land alone will not solve the problems of Aboriginal people. Other speakers have illustrated quite clearly that where Aboriginal people have land and have had it for very long times there has been no real improvement in health. In fact, the worse health problems are in areas of the Northern Territory, such as Arnhem Land, where Aboriginal people have owned their own land for a very long time. I make that point because I believe all of Australia should be aware that the provision of land will not solve the problem. It is an important thing. As has been said time and time again by members on both sides of the House, we appreciate that Aboriginal people have a special spiritual and even mystical association with the land. I think it is fair to say that a great many ordinary white Australians feel the same relationship. Even though most European origin or non-Aboriginal Australians do not manifest it in the same way, I think they can understand that relationship. This is why there is no great quibble over the provision of the land fund. However, I think one very important misconception has been fostered. I imagine some government members might be inclined to say that we on this side are being scaremongers. If that were the case, that would be wrong of us. I can recall that last year the then Special Minister of State, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker), made a statement about billions of dollars being spent on land. The reality is that technically $1.5 billion will be provided over something like 10 years. The rest of Australia and the Aboriginal people should be aware that this is a bit of a con. There will not actually be $1 1/2 billion spent on buying land. That is not the case at all. The money will be put into the trust fundthat is very clearly illustrated on the back page of the bill's explanatory memorandumand will be invested. Ultimately, the interest from that money will be provided to purchase some land. Quite clearly, what we are looking at is approximately $45 million a year being provided for the next nine or 10 years. Already $21 million of that is being provided to ATSIC, so in reality we are talking about $24 million a year being provided. All I can say to our Aboriginal brethren is, 'Don't get too excited because not a great deal will come from it.' I also say to nonAboriginal Australians, 'Don't get too concerned about burgeoning expenditure because it will not happen.' Mr Braithwaite-The biggest problem is the raising of expectations.",11
4,Mr NEHL,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have suffered a great disservice because their expectations have been raised. For instance, not all of that extra $24 million a year will be available to buy land, because the Indigenous Land Corporation, which will be undertaking land acquisition activities, will still have to provide land management activities and running costs. I have difficulty in dissociating land from houses, because most of us want to live on land. Okay, you might say that people in high rises are up in the winds, but whether you are an Aboriginal or a non-Aboriginal Australian you have a house of some kind on land. I find it difficult to dissociate the concept of housing from the land fund-there is no point in buying land just for the sake of buying land. There has to be some benefit for Aboriginal people. There is no point in using taxpayers' money to buy land, letting it sit there and continuing to let people live in Third World conditions. It is not good enough. That is not what Australia is about. I will put that $24 million of new money into some sort of context. At home, in Coffs Harbour, the average house costs about $120,000, so the $24 million would buy 200 new houses a year. I could use those 200 new houses just in one part of my electorate, the Macleay Valley, to provide a decent standard of accommodation for my Aboriginal constituents. This is why I say to Aboriginal people, 'Don't get too excited,' and I say to nonAboriginal people, 'Don't get too worried about an enormous flow of money because the $1.5 billion that is mentioned doesn't actually get spent.' By the way, I should tell our Aboriginal brethren too that they do not control the money; it is not theirs. It is still in the Commonwealth's funds. I feel that everybody in Australia should be aware of the real context in which those funds have been allocated. The bill does not really give any indication of the benefits that are going to flow to Aboriginal communities, which is an important omission. There should be some indication in the bill of what the benefit to Aboriginal men, women and children is going to be. To my mind, it is all still a little too vague. After all, the bill is very general. It does not give any direction of the key purposes for buying land or how purchases will assist either outback or urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. How are the people who live in Redfern going to benefit from this bill? Does anybody know? Certainly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has not told us, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has not told us. I mentioned the Macleay Valley in my electorate. How are the Aboriginal people who live in Kempsey going to benefit? In the next 10 days I am spending most of one day at Old Burnt Bridge to once again meet with people to see how we can perhaps get some of them out of the humpies. They are not out in the Pitjantjatjara lands. They are on the north coast of New South Wales living without a decent water supply and without sewerage. This is totally unacceptable. That is why I cannot go along with this concept of buying land and saying, 'There you are fellas. There's your land.' Mr Hicks-That will not help them at all.",12
5,Mr NEHL,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"That in itself is not going to help them at all. We are proposing that this bill should be sent to a committee of the Senate for fuller examination. It is too important to all Australians just to let it go through. I again make the point that we are seriously and deliberately trying to adopt a bipartisan approach to this matter. We ask the government to try to see that. I ask the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs not to just keep calling out, 'Trickery, trickery, trickery.' We are not in the trickery business at all. It is significant that the bill calls for five the seven members of the board to be Aboriginal people. I have no objection to that. As far as I am concerned, the whole seven members of the board could be, or perhaps even should be, Aboriginal people. There is one particular point that I reject in terms of the qualifications of the board of directors. The explanatory memorandum states: ... all of the Directors must have experience in land or environmental management, business or financial management, or in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community life. Quite frankly, that is no qualification at all. It is totally paternalistic. The government can say that if board members have experience in Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community life-in other words, if they are an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and have lived in a community-that is all the qualification they need. There is an in-built assumption that Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people are not going to qualify on the basis of the experience needed in land or environmental management or business and financial management. I have news for anybody who thinks that. Undoubtedly, while our education system has widely failed Aboriginal people-the level of literacy and numeracy is totally unacceptable-there are a great many bright Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people out there and there are a great many who are qualified. They are qualified not just by their having lived in an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community but because of their ability and intelligence to compete with anyone. It is wrong for us to say, 'Yes, you can be on the board as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. All you have to do is be one.' That is a cop-out; it is not good enough. I do not think Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people would see it that way either. They need to be treated the same as other Australians. Quite a number of amendments will be proposed to this bill and more will come through in the Senate. We believe that priority in purchasing land must go to those areas where Aboriginal people cannot claim native title. The whole purpose of the land fund is of to provide money to assist Aboriginal people who are unable to claim under native title to get some land. It should be made quite clear that priority has to go that way. Where there is a need for the upgrading of Aboriginal and pastoral properties, Aboriginals should be given priority. If Aboriginals already have a substantial land holding, it is important that they should be assisted in maintaining them as an economic and viable activity. As part of this, there has to be absolute accountability to the taxpayers of Australia. It is in the best interests of alI Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that they be above suspicion and there should be full and proper accountability provisions. Otherwise, it may lead to a bit of a backlash. Most importantly, the money has to go where it is supposed to go. I speak from a wide range of experience of contact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and individuals. I am the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and, in the course of the last 18 months, I have visited many Aboriginal communities and spoken with an enormous number of Aboriginal people.",13
6,Mr KERR,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,And have shown genuine commitment for many years. I recognise that.,14
7,Mr NEHL,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I thank the minister. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are genuinely concerned that the money gets to where it is supposed to go; that it is not siphoned off in some form of bureaucracy. Many criticisms have been levelled at ATSIC because of this. Every one of us in this place must share the genuine concern of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that the money gets to where it is supposed to go. I sincerely hope that this will be the case with the land fund money. I acknowledge that some money will have to be spent on running costs and land management activities, but the basic point of this is that the money should be used to buy land for Aborigines. There needs to be some expansion on what is happening and where the money is going to go. Again I ask: what about the Aboriginal people in Redfern? What about the Aboriginal people in my electorate and in many other communities? How are they going to be helped by this? In fairness to all Aboriginal people, we need to ask just how this will assist them. In the minute that is left I want to come back to what I believe is the basic and the crucial point. It is not good enough just to provide land and let people continue to live in unhealthy Third World conditions. That is what we have in Australia in far too many areas. Let us by all means provide money to buy land for Aboriginal people, but we cannot neglect the need of Aboriginal people for health, education and housing and, above all, their need for a job, with the dignity and selfrespect that comes from having a job. If you speak to Aboriginal people you will find that they want that self-respect; they want that dignity. They want to get on with the job of being Australian, like other Australians. They want to participate fully in Australian society. This parliament should do everything it can to assist that. (TIme expired)",14
8,Mr LEO MCLEAY,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Watson) (9.51 a.m.)In six years time we come to the tum of the century. As we approach the year 2000 it concentrates people's minds on where we are going and what is the future of our country. Six years time is more than a major milestone; it is an important time for us to set a peg on where we are as Australians. When we get to that time we should be able to say that we have done something to ensure that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people of Australia are participating in the wealth and opportunities of this country. Governments and people of goodwill have tried over the years to improve their participation but, to be fair, in many instances we have failed. Throughout those debates in the last 20 years the Aboriginal people have said to us that a central tenet of their participation is the question of land. Governments have shied away from that. They have done some things, but they have not done much. In the last year the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the government have said, 'We should take up this issue of land and see if this parliament and this country can adopt an attitude that allows the people to take a view that if land is the issue which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait island people see as the vehicle that will help them to participate better in Australia we should do something about that.' The native title legislation and this legislation are central to the government's attempts to do that. So it is rather depressing when you listen to the debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill to see how disheartening the approach of the opposition is. The other day my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) remarked that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) was like a snake. In some ways he probably hit the nail on the head. It is only too apparent when it comes to the Opposition's policy on this issue that its leader has no policy legs. The opposition is desperately trying to buy time as it searches for a response to this legislation-any response. Suddenly we hear a lot of talk about how the opposition wants to support the bill but, as my colleague the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) said a few minutes ago, with amendmentsalways with amendments. The truth is that if the opposition were serious about amending the legislation it would show us the amendments. We are two-thirds of the way through the debate on this bill in this House and there is nothing on the table. We get told by the opposition that the amendments are on their way. We also get told that they might be made in the Senate. I think we ought to hear a little bit more from the opposition than their chant and mantra about accountability. If the opposition wants to talk about how this bill needs amending, at least it could tell us what amendments it wants to make. Throughout the debate so far-and there have been over a dozen speakers-we have not heard anything other than the bill is flawed. The bill is not flawed. This is a good bill. It gives Aboriginal people who do not have the right to make a land claim some access to land, and they say that is important to them. I think it was a reasonable response on the government's part to say that it will attempt to do something about that. If the opposition were serious about wanting to support the bill, why did it not take part in the consultation process and make some suggestions to the government at that stage? The opposition is not even sure why it is opposed to this legislation. It is apparent from hearing the mishmash of interventions from the other side that there is a great deal of angst in the opposition. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and the honourable. member for Cowper had some nice things to say, but their problem is that they have been outgunned by the deep conservatives in their party and they are going to vote for amendments that they know will try to destroy parts of this bill. The accountability that the rednecks in the opposition want will mean that we cannot spend most of the money. The opposition does not want accountability; it wants to tie the money up in such a fashion that it will never be able to be spent. That is disgraceful. It is disgraceful that the member for Bradfield and others stand up in here and piously say that they think this is a good thing but that they are not going to vote for it. There are some pieces of legislation that come into this chamber that are of high national importance. There is also a lot of legislation that comes through this place that is important where we take party lines. On a bill such as this, people of goodwill on both sides should try to reach some accommodation. The Prime Minister tried to reach some accommodation. He had a very wide-ranging discussion with state Premiers, indigenous people, business people and farmer organisations to see whether we could get a bill that had widespread support. The only group that did not want to be involved in that was the opposition. It just wants to say that the bill needs to be amended. What is driving the opposition is a view that takes us back 20 years to a time when we could get away with being patronising and saying that we know right. That is despite the recommendations of the coalition's backbench policy committee on immigration, ethnic affairs and Aboriginal affairs. It has urged the Leader of the Opposition to support the legislation in to to. To hear the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) talk about how vital it is to have consensus and bipartisanship on an important social justice issue like this is just astounding when we know that the opposition intends to move amendments which will gut this bill. Those opposite will piously stand up and say, 'If only the government had accepted the amendments we would have voted for the bill,' knowing that those amendments they will put forward will make the bill useless. If the amendments were not of that fashion we would have them to look at in this debate. The opposition knows that the amendments it is going to put forward will not be of assistance to this bill. The amendments will mean that Aboriginal people will not have any say in the way the money is spent. The amendments will ensure that the basic thrust of the bill, which is to give some empowerment to Aboriginal people, is taken away. The opposition is just wasting the time of the parliament by talking about these amendments at this stage. As I said, we heard some fine sentiments expressed by the member for Bradfield and the member for Chisholm. I agree with them that there should be bipartisanship on this important piece of legislation, but they and their moderate colleagues in the Liberal Party should have the strength of character to do something about this piece of legislation by supporting it and voting for it. All we hear from the opposition is that there is some mysterious inadequacy of financial accountability. We would all like to know exactly what should be done to strengthen the accountability. The government has done its best to ensure that the legislation contains some very tight guidelines. As members would know, the land fund is to be established as part of the Commonwealth public account. As such, it is governed by some provisions of the Audit Act which protect Commonwealth funding. The decision by the government to place the land fund in the public account was taken to reduce its impact on the budget. A range of investments are permitted under section 62B of the Audit Act which limit those investments so that they are as secure as possible-far more secure than most investments that could be made by other instrumentalities. The bill establishes the land fund to receive moneys which will make allocations to the Indigenous Land Corporation for land acquisition and management. The government will provide $200 million to the fund in this year's bUdget. The bill provides continuing allocations of $121 million, indexed in terms of 1994 dollars, for a further nine years. So the fund will become a revolving, self-sustaining investment and management fund. This fund, as the other leg of the Mabo legislation, will achieve some measure of independence and self-sustainable investment for Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people. The new land corporation will be independent and commercially oriented, with a dedicated focus on land matters and specialised expertise in land environmental management. The member for Cowper said earlier that it was terrible that the government had said that the members of the board of the fund should have some knowledge of financial management or land management or should be experienced in Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community living. He says that it is tokenistic for the government to say that someone can be a member of the board simply because he or she is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. But I think the member for Cowper has missed the real thrust of this legislation. This bill accepts that what the Aboriginal people have said to the government over the years about their desire to have land is correct: they should have the right to have control over land or, if they are not able to make the land claim, they should have the right to be able to purchase land. It is that spiritual view which Aboriginal people have about land that is one reason for the qualification that you can be a member of the board because you are an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander who understands the feelings of those people. If those people wish to invest in some of the land, they might need certain input from someone who is an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander. It is important to not just have people on the board who are experts in particular technical areas. You should also have some members on the board who can add that philosophical input that comes from living in an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community. I think that sort of input is important in this body's deliberations. It would be like saying that the trustees of the Catholic Church or the Church of England should have only lawyers and accountants on its board and should not have priests or bishops. The trustees of religious organisations have priests and bishops on their boards because, of course, they add another dimension to the considerations of those boards. For the same reason, for the board of this corporation to have people whose only qualification is that they are an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander adds another dimension to the deliberations of the fund. I think that is a very important reason for putting that qualification in there. For sure, it would be nice to have Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as the land managers and accountants, but I think it would be very useful to have the input of an elder in the community into the deliberations. The thrust of this piece of legislation and the native title legislation is to add that dimension to the government's involvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves have said to us it has a spiritual dimension. The muddied thinking of some members of the opposition who see this as tokenistic is quite wrong. The injection of those other thoughts into the operation of the board, I think, will be very important. We heard yesterday the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) claiming to be concerned for the welfare of indigenous people. Of course, he, like some of the other hardliners in the opposition, had it absolutely wrong. He suggested that the ownership of land had nothing to do with the welfare, health, housing or education of Aboriginal people. He said that the word 'assimilation' was politically incorrect to use and that indigenous people did not want to be treated as different or separate. On that point, he is probably a little bit right. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do not want to be considered as separate and they do not want to be made second-class citizens in the way they have been. They have said to us that they think they can overcome that by having access to land. Six years before the tum of the century and the tum of the millennium, we ought to be saying, 'If that is what they say will allow them to participate fully as Australians in the Australian community, then that is what we will try.' People who hold the same view as the member for Barker have put forward their proposals in the past and they have failed. The member for Cowper is right. Many Aboriginal people in Australia live in Third World country conditions. It is disgraceful and we as Australians should be ashamed of the situation. As I said earlier, many people of goodwill have tried to find ways to assist the participation of indigenous people. In some ways we have been successful, but in many we have been failures. This legislation and the native title legislation give us a chance to take a new approach. This approach will be successful because it is the approach that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been saying to us for a generation they believe will help them to become part of the future of this country. I think we need to give them that chance. We need to adopt an approach to this legislation that is not negative and nasty. We do not need the approach, 'We are going to be clever little politicians here today, we are going to support the bill if the government guts it with our amendments. ' The government is not going to gut it. I have not seen an issue that has united the Labor Party as much as the thrust of this legislation and the whole of the Mabo package. There is no-one in the government who really disagrees with the thrust of it. What the opposition ought to consider between now and when this bill comes to a vote is the outpouring of support for that beautiful young girl Cathy Freeman when she showed to the world that she was an Aboriginal Australian. A couple of people on the other side tried to say, 'Isn't this disgraceful; she didn't carry the Australian flag-terrible, terrible, terrible.' What did the people of Australia say? They said that what she did was terrific. The opposition has to understand that a sea change has occurred in the Australian community about the way we ought to be approaching these issues. The sea change will want us to support this legislation. People such as the honourable member for Bradfield ought to ensure that their party does the right thing on this matter. If they do not, they will not only be found to be floundering in the way they are on other policy issues; they will be found to be failing Australia. (TIme expired)",14
9,Mr WILLIAMS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Tangney) (1O.11 a.m.)In speaking to this ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994, I seek to make a contribution which is both positive in tone and positive in content. However, I will not ignore the comments of some government members critical of the attitude of the coalition to the bill. Regrettably, I have some serious criticisms of the proposals in the bill. It is beyond dispute that the coalition has played a significant and pioneering role in Aboriginal affairs generally and in Aboriginal land in particular. The coalition has long recognised the importance of land to indigenous people. The Aboriginal affairs policy adopted by the coalition in November 1975, nearly 20 years ago, provided: . . . we recognise that fundamental to the Aborigines' sense of Aboriginality-of affinity one another-is their affinity with the land. The significance of that policy is that it guided successive coalition governments and successive ministers for Aboriginal affairs in coalition governments from 1975 until 1983. It was also the basis of the first enactment of Aboriginal land rights legislation. Until the decision of the High Court in Mabo v. Queensland No.2, land rights for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people took a variety of forms. There were inalienable titles in the Northern Territory and in South Australia, the South Australian legislation being based on the Commonwealth legislation for the Northern Territory. There were deeds of grant in trust in Queensland, and there were reserves and trust lands in Western Australia. There were other forms in Victoria, New South Wales, the ACT and Tasmania. New South Wales, interestingly, has had a land acquisition fund for Aboriginal people for quite some time. The Mabo decision in 1992 provided the first recognition by the common law of distinctive native title rights. Against that background, I think it must be recognised that this bill contemplates yet another form of indigenous interest in land. Prior to Mabo, there had also been a variety of legislative schemes for the purchase of land for Aborigines. For example, in the 1972 Commonwealth budget the coalition government provided as much as $5 million for the purchase of properties for Aboriginal communities which were off reserves. Through the coalition's 1975 policy, the Fraser government supported the Aboriginal Land Commission, which was a body established to purchase land for Aboriginal people where Aboriginal land had been alienated and was not otherwise available. The policy contained an express recognition of 'the problems flowing from past dispossession and dispersal of the Aboriginal people and the community's resulting responsibility'. One point which the coalition, in its past administration of Aboriginal affairs, has not overlooked is the important role of state and territory governments. The need to continue to recognise that role was one of the matters with which guided the coalition in debate on the bill which became the Native Title Act 1993. There is a continuing need to ensure that the functions of the Commonwealth government and its agencies in the affairs of indigenous people are not to the detriment of the performance by state and territory governments of their responsibilities. As explained by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the coalition offers conditional support for this bill. The basic objectives are strongly supported, but the manner in which they are sought to be achieved is given qualified support only. In my comments, I want to address principally the scheme of the bill, focusing on the managerial design and the accountability mechanisms. The conclusion I offer is that the design is seriously deficient. In fact, it is so seriously flawed that I believe indigenous people should regard themselves as being sold short yet again. One looks in vain to the text of the bill for a statement of its objectives. There is, however, set out in part A of the explanatory memorandum a statement of specific objectives in the establishment of the land fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation: ... to enable indigenous people to acquire land to manage it in a sustainable way to provide economic, social and cultural benefits. The bill is supported by the coalition because it recognises the importance of land to indigenous people, that only a small proportion will benefit from the recognition of native title rights and that many indigenous people have been dispossessed of their traditional lands. These reasons for supporting it, which are given by the government as well, strongly suggest that the control of the fund and the corporation should, to the extent practicable, be in the hands of indigenous people. It need hardly be said at the same time that there must be some means of enabling those who administer the fund and those who administer the corporation to be accountable to the people of Australia for the substantial public funds they administer. There should also be some means whereby the particular interests of indigenous people in the distribution and use of those funds should be accounted for. The functions of the corporation are described in the act as being to acquire land for grant to indigenous people or to enable them to acquire land and to carry on the management of land for indigenous people and activities related to that management. Indigenous people live across the continent and in surrounding islands. Therefore, the potential geographical scope of the corporation's activities is huge. The' range of activities potentially before the corporation is also huge. Let me take some examples. The corporation could be asked by the Mowanjum community, which lives near Derby in the north-west of Western Australia, to acquire its traditional lands to enable the community to move back to them. As a member of the coalition shadow ministry task force, I heard from the community in the middle of last year the desire to be able to live on its traditional lands. But those lands are extensive, they are remote from Derby and there is no road to them. If the community moved back, it would find that there is no regular water supply there and there are no houses, schools, hospitals or community facilities. To fulfil their desire and would involve constmction, in effect, of a township. That would cost millions of dollars. The question would then have to be asked: how would the community sustain itself if it did go back? Many members of the community are unfamiliar with the traditional Aboriginal way of life and many of them have no desire to live that way. Most of them have had little to do with the traditional lands; only the older members of the community remember the traditional way of life on those lands. To take another example, by way of contrast, there are many cattle stations across the north of Australia which are owned and mn by Aboriginal people. In some cases these stations are occupied not by one or two families who could expect to get a return from the station sufficient to sustain them but by whole communities. The stations do not and probably, despite the best management effort, could never provide sufficient income to sustain more than one or two families. A station could never provide sufficient income to sustain a whole community. What funds should be provided for upgrading and for management assistance of the operators of a station in those circumstances? We are looking in that situation at something in the nature of permanent income support rather than mere land management assistance. Another type of candidate for assistance from the corporation by way of land acquisition, or even in this case land management, is the indigenous person who lives in an urban area, a country town or a big city. In most cases, his or her need is simply for a roof, a flat or a house. When we take those three simple examples, which are not untypical, we can see that the potential for claims on the fund are enormous and that the funding of $45 million per annum will not go far. It is doubtful that it would go as far as the $5 million per annum given in 1972. Those three cases reveal that the range of competing claims is likely to be large, that claims are likely to be incomparable and that many of the claims will present intractable problems. In defining a strategy, it has to be taken into account and recognised that the making of decisions pursuant to the strategy to be implemented involves decisions which are essentially political. The management structure should recognise that the decisions to be taken will be political. The management structure in its design should recognise a number of factors that I have already mentioned, such as the desire for self-management by the indigenous people, accountability to the public for the use of public funds and accountability to indigenous people for the distribution of the funds. It should also recognise that the range of competing claims and the intractable problems they present will be huge. In my view, the response of the government does not recognise those factors. The corporation is to be run by a board of seven members. Except for the chairperson of ATSIC, who sits ex officio, all are appointed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. One of the six appointed members must be an ATSIC commissioner and five of the seven members must be persons of indigenous extraction. The principal functions of the board defined under the bill are to develop a national indigenous land strategy, a threeto five-year plan covering matters of the acquisition of land, land management issues and environmental issues relating to indigenous-held land. The board is also required to prepare regional indigenous land strategies dealing with similar issues on a regional basis. In its land acquisition and management activities the board is required to act in accordance with the strategies. One might ask: what selfmanagement is involved? Under the bill, no direct role is envisaged for indigenous people generally in the management and accountability model. The closest involvement of indigenous people generally is in the election of the ATSIC commissioners, who happen to become directors. I do not overlook the fact that the chairperson and four members of the board must be of Aboriginal or Torres Strait the Islander extraction, but we are looking here at management and accountability models. ATSIC is an elected body representing indigenous people across the continent. It has some role to play. It has not-as might have been expected had self-management been a true objective-been given the responsibility of administering the fund and the corporation. ATSIC does not elect the board; it does not approve the national strategy or any regional strategy; and it does not receive an annual report from the board. In fact, its functions are rather limited. They seem to be limited to some aspects of consultation. In the preparation of the national strategy, the corporation must have regard to the desirability of consulting ATSIC about such matters as it considers appropriate-which is a very weak consultation requirement. Before appointing a director of the corporation, the minister must consult ATSIC, but he does not have to follow any recommendation from ATSIC. The minister has the power to sack a corporation director, but only after first consulting ATSIC. The power to sack is limited to a finding of either misbehaviour, physical incapacity or mental incapacity. At the administrative level ATSIC staff may perform duties on behalf of the corporation by arrangement, and ATSIC's Office of Evaluation and Audit has some audit functions. Therefore, it can be seen that the role of ATSIC is peripheral, not direct. Having rejected the managerial model under which accountability is to representatives of indigenous people, it might then be expected that the corporation and its board would be accountable to the people of Australia generally. After all, public funds are involved. That would involve the minister being responsible and accountable to parliament. But that has not happened either. The minister does appoint the board, to the extent that the board comprises the six persons who are not the chairperson of ATSIC; but the board is not under the control of the minister. The minister does not approve the national strategy; the minister does not approve the regional strategies. Again, the extent of the minister's powers is rather limited. The minister may seek information about the corporation's activities, and the board must give it. On the minister's request, the board must give the minister a copy of the national strategy and the regional strategy. ATSIC keeps accounts and prepares financial statements. The minister's role is limited to determining the form. In this case, it is not the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs; it is the Minister for Finance. The minister must convene annual meetings to discuss the investment policy of the land fund, and the minister may attend such meetings. This minister's role is rather limited also. The accountability of the minister to parliament being limited, it might be thought that parliament would have a more direct role. In fact, parliament has very little role. The minister is required to prepare an annual report about the administration of the land fund, including: receipts, payments out, details of investments, and returns on investment. The report must be laid before parliament within 15 sitting days of the completion of the report. I perceive that that is essentially only a financial report. In my view the result of this little review is that the design of the managerial model is quite deficient; in fact, it is a muddle. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do not have control. Instead, there is a board which has an incredibly difficult task but little responsibility to account to anyone. ATSIC is not given any significant responsibility. The minister has limited powers, and parliament has no powers of supervision of any sort. Without being able to deal in detail with the matter, another deficiency that is quite significant in my view is that the administration of the fund and the activities of the corporation do not take account of the responsibilities of state governments. This is the case in relation to the registration of interests in land, particularly the non-recognition of interests of potentially innocent third parties dealing without knowledge in interests in land held by indigenous people or those subject to responsibilities under the act. This bill is an important bill. It has very significant objectives, which I strongly support. However, the design is deficient. There is no discernible managerial model. There is no provision for accountability on the part of the board of the corporation to anybody in any significant way. The managerial and accountability model should go back to the drawing board.",18
10,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"CalwellParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (10.31 a.m.)-I have great pleasure in speaking on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. I must say that I am again concerned by the attitude taken by the opposition in relation to this matter. Honourable members will probably recall the marathon debate on the Mabo legislation that took place here and in the Senate at the end of last year. I had thought, after that debate and after the clear acceptance by the Australian people as a whole of the fact that the Aboriginal people were deserving of major new initiatives in relation to land, that we would have very little controversy over a bill such as this. Instead, again we have had a lot of controversy, especially about the position of the opposition. I want to emphasise two things in my speech today. Many members on our side have emphasised the importance of land, but I want to emphasise the relationship between the land and the culture of the Aboriginal people. It has been asserted on a number of occasions-indeed, by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) yesterday-that we should be concerned about other aspects of social justice for Aboriginal people, such as housing, education, health and so forth. Indeed we should be concerned. The government has certainly been concerned about those issues over the last few years and has done a lot of work in relation to them. I think what we fail to perceive is just how tragic the situation of the Aboriginal people was before we started doing something about it and how difficult the task is even now. Imagine a proud collection of societies, because that is essentially what the Aboriginal societies were, with their distinct cultural forms, rich traditions, a host of philosophical beliefs, the complexity of which we still do not fully understand, the whole concept of the Dreamtime, a philosophical approach which in its nature was very spiritual. For the Aboriginal people the very notion of identity was tied up with the land. Their culture and identity were tied up with the concept of the sacredness of the lands on which they lived. Every place had a meaning in the system of things, not merely a meaning in a functional sense but in a broader sense-almost a religious sense. That is where the concept of sacred sites comes from, which some people have tried to ridicule. Those people do not understand that the Aboriginal culture was based on this general concept of the land and the importance of specific sites. When the white men arrived and decided that they were going to colonise this place, they simply proceeded on a path of cultural destructionsometimes even blunt physical destruction. We are still finding out about massacres that occurred and about terrible deeds that were done to Aboriginal people, but essentially the reality is that they were being destroyed both physically and culturally. The cultural destrucin tion was very successful. Many of these cultures were totally destroyed and little remains. Others, fortunately, have remained in some parts of Australia. We are now, as I said earlier, trying to understand the complexity of these cultures. We used direct physical intervention to kill Aboriginal people; we introduced diseases and various forms of cultural destruction. We felt that the best thing to do was to teach them our ways and our belief system, and to totally ignore what they believed in, especially their relationship to the land. Is it a wonder that they have been put in this position? With the exception of the indigenous people of America, I do not think that any people in recent history have been subjected to the same situation. This form of cultural destruction is an historical shame. It is in that context that we have to agree to do whatever we can to restore the position of the Aboriginal people. I am amazed at the goings-on of the opposition. About three weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition said that the opposition would consider the repeal of the Mabo bill. I say to him that a lot of people in this country have worked to achieve the Mabo bill, and it will never be repealed. The opposition may attempt to repeal it, but it will never get the numbers in the upper house and, even if it did, there would be so much public protest against the repeal of that bill that it would never succeed. That was a shameful statement by the Leader of the Opposition. It disappointed many of us because when he became the Leader of the Opposition we were told that the opposition would change its perspective on social justice issues; that it would move from the previous crazy right wing positions adopted over the years by the Liberal Party which led it into the political wilderness; and that it would look at issues concerning human rights. So what do we find? When the first test came up, he went and saw Richard Court in Western Australia-a reactionary, a man who is not concerned with human rights. I say this openly about him and his positions in relation to Aboriginal people. He ought to look at implementing human rights at the state level Western Australia with respect to Aboriginal people rather than lecturing the federal government, and he should look at the behaviour of his police forces and other people who are supposed to deliver services to the Aboriginal people. For the Leader of the Opposition to come in here and talk about health and other such issues, which are generally delivered through the state governments-and when all he could do when he went to Western Australia was to agree with Richard Court about the probability of repealing the Mabo bill-is shameful. The reality is that we were hoping the Liberal Party would adopt positions that were more moderate, more in line with the consensus of the Australian nation. The Australian nation has now come to understand the importance of reconciliation with the Aboriginal people. When I say 'the Australian nation' I do not mean everyone of course; I mean the vast majority of the Australian people. We saw this recognition just the other day when some diehards attempted to criticise Cathy Freeman-whose performance at the Commonwealth Games was excellent, as was the performance of our other sports peoplefor making a statement about her Aboriginality. What did we have? We had some reactionaries criticising her. The most important thing, as she said on television, was that she was inundated with hundreds and hundreds of messages from well-wishers from all over Australia. All of the major media and major organisations in this country supported her position. That shows that we as a people have shifted in relation to this matter; that we now understand the importance of reconciliation and understand the importance of rights for the Aboriginal people. We come to the situation where the members of the opposition have another opportunity to outline their views. What are they doing this time? After having said two or three weeks ago that they might repeal the Mabo bill-and because of the goings-on within the Liberal Party and the fact that they have been represented throughout the nation, especially in the media, as moving further to the right following the dismissal of the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson)-they have decided to tell us that they do actually want to support the land fund to a certain degree, but they have added many clauses and conditions. By the way, we have not seen the full measure of them yet, but we know that they will be clauses and conditions which the government would find difficult to accept or meet and, which the opposition can use as an excuse for rejecting the land fund. What a disgraceful tactic. The basic situation is that the bill is here as part of the social justice package. There will be further measures announced in due course, but for members of the opposition to say, 'Unless you announce some measures that we want, we are going to oppose this bill,' when previously they did not give a damn about any measures is nonsense. This is a very ad hoc and superficial way of trying to unite a disunited party which is divided on this question. We have known about the divisions on this question, but we are saying that the party leaders should stand up and say clearly and unequivocally, 'We are supporting this bill because the nation wants it, because the Australian people want it, because the Aboriginal people need it.' Instead of doing that, they are trying to say that other things are more important than land. Other things are not more important than land. Land is not just a question of property in the eyes of the Aboriginal people, in terms of their culture. Land has a much deeper significance, a significance which we are only now starting to understand. We must respect that significance. It has been asked why, with the passage of the Mabo bill, we need to have these additional measures. The answer is pretty straightforward. It is a very important issue. The answer is that only a small proportion of the Aboriginal people will be able to gain access to land as a result of the Mabo decision and legislation because we have so destroyed the connection between a large number of the Aboriginal people and their earlier ownership of land. We have so undermined it that they will find it difficult to prove their relationship to the land within the meaning of the act. Many of them have been shifted to different places. This situation provides an opportunity for what? For a corporation to purchase land on behalf of the Aboriginal people to ensure that that land is used so they can re-establish their link to the land, re-establish a basis for their culture and for their tradition. Surely, as the people who destroyed their culture and their link to the land, we have an obligation to enable this to occur. That is a very solemn obligation this government is determined to ensure is met. That is not just because of the historical situation; it is also a question of fundamental human rights. It is no good our talking about being a society that believes in social justice and a fair go and then saying, 'But, of course, we exempt the Aborigines.' That was the position in this country until there was a referendum to recognise the Aboriginal people. It was not until that referendum in the mid-l97Os that we actually recognised them as part of the nation, that we actually recognised them as human beings having rights. Prior to that time, only a handful of Aborigines were actually given citizenship in Australia. One of them was the great artist Albert Namatjira-one of the great Aboriginals. When he was given citizenship, some people wanted to take it away. Back then we selected a very small number of Aboriginal people and said, 'You're special, we'll give you citizenship, but we don't recognise the rest of you.' In 1958, after Albert Namatjira was given that citizenship, the Northern Territory News-a paper that unfortunately still remains hostile to Aboriginal peoplereported: It is important now not only for Namatjira that there be some acceptance of the lessons glaring from the shamble of the artist's rise and fall that there be a little public understanding of the problem besetting the authorities in the full rights program. It must be clear that it was a mistake to give Namatjira his citizenship passport despite the fact that he proved he could walk with kings, earn more than most white people and had dignity and ability. Can honourable members believe that? That is what the newspaper said in 1958. The explanation it gave was: Surely an essential measure of whether a native should get full rights must be his proven ability to bring up his family to the acceptable white standards. This was not the case with Namatjira and this very fact probably contributed more to his downfall than anything else. We have a lot to answer for in the treatment of Aboriginal people in the last 200 years or more. In the last few years, especially last year with the Mabo legislation, we have carried out dramatic measures for achieving reconciliation. There is no doubt that the Australian people want those measures followed up. This land fund is a very important step. Essentially, there are three steps: the Mabo legislation, the land fund and the social justice package, all of which are going to be very important in achieving our goals. Some speakers on the other side have taken the opportunity to criticise Aboriginal organisations such as ATSIC in this debate. Rather than these criticisms, from a perspective of a white man's accounting of-(Time expired)",21
11,Mr CLEARY,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I hope the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) stays around until the end of my speech because I would like to ask him a few questions that he might be able to answer in the backrooms. I have seen any number of academy performances in this House over the last couple of years. I have heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) cynically evoke the name of Chifley to defend reactionary policies so many times that I am starting to confuse Chifley with Menzies. I cringe every time. I hear the Prime Minister describe himself or one of his market driven initiatives as 'Labor to the bootstraps'. But watching the true deceivers tell one porky after another and jump through the hoops to massive the Prime Minister's tune hardly compares with the performance of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) yesterday. Fair dinkum, the bloke could not sell a ticket in a chook raffle. If he were a cricketer, he would never get beyond 12th man and, if he did manage to crack it for a game, there is a fair bet that he would spend the day at third man, or third person. If he were a footballer, he would be cutting the oranges. I do not mean to be disrespectful in any way to the many great orange boys and girls I have known at the Coburg Football Club. Today we discover, courtesy of that beacon of progressive thought the Herald-Sun, that the Leader of the Opposition once spoke at a gathering of the League of Rights-funny about that. When the Leader of the Opposition was catapulted into the leadership alongside the other 'dream teamer', the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), we were all told that he came from a great Adelaide conservative tradition. 'Conservative' was taken to mean disciple of the teachings of Edmund Burke and gentle patriarchy. It was not supposed to mean captive of the extreme Right. The League of Rights does not believe in Aboriginal rights, Mabo or an Aboriginal land fund. The League of Rights believes in the old constitution and that Australia should be a white Anglo colony. The League of Rights was happy that I was ruled ineligible by the High Court. It should come as no surprise that Ian Sykes, who challenged me in the High Court, and a couple of his mates on the Coburg Council had very close connections with the League of Rights. One member of the council, former mayor Geraldine Rawson, described Jeremy Lee, a leading light in the League of Rights, as an inspirational speaker. Given the Leader of the Opposition's speech on the Aboriginal land fund yesterday, it is no wonder the ALP can produce policies that have nothing to do with the true believers yet continue to win elections. The Leader of the Opposition's speech reflects, yet again, the control the extremists have over the party. It also reflects a lack of vision and a lack of policy. When it came to Mabo, a piece of legislation symbolically as important as anything we have done for who knows how long, the rednecks won the day. As a consequence, the coalition was marginalised and the death knell was sounded for the former leader, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). I remember watching the member for Wentworth deliver his Mabo speech and turning to my learned colleague the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) and saying that was the end of Hewson. It was to be true. During the budget debates, the opposition pounced on the criticism of the President of the ACTU of the regressive tax measures in the budget. 'I will not defend the indefensible' became a common jibe in the House. Yet when it came to Mabo, the coalition was the epitome of a team without a coach and the leader was there attempting to defend the indefensible. Of course, the Aboriginal land fund will rectify the problems of 200 years of dispersion, displacement and dispossession. Discussions with the Victorian Aboriginal community suggests that the bill is supported by Aboriginal groups in Victoria. It is pointed out, however, that Victorian Aboriginal people have special needs and that the corporation should have the resources to research these needs and apply the land acquisition funds according to these needs. They wish to ensure that every Victorian clan, tribe or nation has a base which can support the cultural, social and economic aspirations of that clan, tribe or nation. They say these bases should conform, as much as possible, to clan areas prior to colonisation. This is in contrast to the coalition response. The Victorian Aboriginal community's approach springs from notions of self-determination and cultural identity. The coalition has, in effect, challenged the thrust of the land fund. What the coalition seeks to do is innict yet another round of paternalism on Aboriginal people. The coalition refuses to grasp the fact that land is central to the aspirations of Aboriginal people. Member after member has documented the health, housing and education problems which afflict Aboriginal communities throughout Australia. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), despite his flowery approach to the issue, is at least partially right when he says that constructing a new, or adding to an existing, bureaucracy is not the way to go. The problem with the member for Kalgoorlie is that he always knows a bloke who knows a bloke who reckons there is something wrong with whatever policy on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander matters comes out of Canberra. At the end of the member for Kalgoorlie's speech I am still not sure what ought to be done. I do not think he is sure about what ought to be done. At one point it sounded as though 4,000 head of breeders were going to solve 200 years of dispossession. The member for Kalgoorlie wants it both ways. If 36 Aboriginals are appointed to the Prime Minister's office, they serve nothing not but self-interest and the Aboriginal industry, whatever that Aboriginal industry happens to mean. If Aboriginals are not appointed or do not get to have their say, it is because we do not want to listen. The member for Kalgoorlie says that he is the only person who does listen. He says Aboriginal people tell him that they want to be part of the mainstream, that they want to be part of Australia and that they do not want anything other Australians do not get. Just who the person is or who the people are who tell him this, we are never quite sure. Neither are we sure about what the moral of the story is. For example, if we accept the premise that Aboriginal people want to be part of the mainstream, then we would obviously have to rectify the great inequities that exist between black and white Australians. If we accept the premise that Aboriginal people do not want anything other Australians do not get, does that preclude rectifying dispossession? What is it that Aboriginal people get as a handout? Is massive unemployment a handout? Is ill health a handout? When I was in Papunya some time ago, the Aboriginal representatives that I met there were far from happy about the Northern Territory government and the appalling conditions they were living under. They did not want handouts; they wanted power and justice. The question of resolving the problems that 200 years of dispossession created is obviously complex. It is true that they will not be overcome by the kind of paternalism that characterised the cultural imperialism of the missionary days. What is just as true is that they will not be overcome by the kinds of attitudes that dominate coalition thinking. For example, how do we determine in advance with any certainty how land purchases will advance the health, housing or educational needs of Aboriginal communities? Just as importantly, why should we? Does not making such demands smack of the very paternalism that members of the coalition have criticised in one speech after another? The only time. I have heard the coalitionwith a couple of notable exceptions-talk about Aboriginal health, housing and education has been when it has seen the opportunity to score a political point. It does not seem to me that it is an issue around which the coalition is galvanised in a positive way. Again, there are some exceptions. Unfortunately, the rednecks are not favourably disposed towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, no matter what they say. A spade is a spade. This is the problem with the proposed amendments. Commonsense tells us that we have to question the bona fides of the Leader of the Opposition. Some of the lines in his speech are pearlers. This one, quoted by Mark Baker in the Age this morning, deserves a mention: To accept failure is to accept the premature death. imprisonment and impoverishment of a proud and ancient people. It sounded like he was talking about the noble savage. What a line from the party which would have nothing do with and nothing to say about the Mabo legislation, that sat back and refused to even engage in a discussion about the legitimacy of that bill. This from an opposition which had its nose out of joint because Cathy Freeman carried the Aboriginal flag at the Commonwealth Games. 'What an insult to the Queen and the great Commonwealth that we are a part of,' they cried. The coalition usually has two escape routes. 'It is very important that money does not end up in the hands of white bureaucrats or get lost in the bureaucracy,' they say. 'It must be accountable to the Australian people,' they say. They never, however, adopt the same principles in relation to support for business in the form of tax concessions and the like. We did not hear them squealing in the 1980s when those tycoons were throwing money away like it was going out of style. The second escape route is via their opposition to the so-called guilt industry. 'I am not guilty. I do not see any point in feeling guilty about what has happened,' they say. It is just another smokescreen. Aboriginal reconciliation has nothing to do with guilt. It is not derived from a feeling of guilt. Rather, it has everything to do with rectifying past wrongs and acknowledging that indigenous people, 'those proud and ancient people', as described by the Leader of the Opposition, have suffered some major injustices. This brings me to a specific problem of Aboriginal rights in Victoria and one that members of this House might like to think about in the context of Mabo and the Aboriginal land fund. It relates to a school which stands on a plot of land in Preston. Given the coalition's concern for the role of education in the land fund bill, honourable members might like to focus on what has happened at that school. The Kennett government, as some members would be aware, closed the school. It is a school with a significant Aboriginal population and an Aboriginal program that was praised by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Kennett marched in and closed the school, but the people fought on. The equal opportunity tribunal found that the closure was an act of racial discrimination. The government appealed the decision in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court found in favour of the rebel school. In essence, the closure of the school was an act of racial discrimination. I would like the honourable member for Calwell to take this on board. The closure of Northland secondary school was an act of racial discrimination. That is what the equal opportunity tribunal said and that is what the Supreme Court of Victoria said. The member for Calwell has admonished the opposition for its failure to accept new initiatives such as the ATSIC land bill. But if we are going to admonish the opposition, if we are going to criticise the rednecks in the opposition, then we need to focus squarely on what has happened at the Northland secondary college and what has happened at the federal level. I am sure the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) would agree with me that something should be done at that school. We need to ask why an act of dispossession in Preston, in the seat of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), has been able to proceed without a single word mentioned in this House. I asked a question of the Prime Minister some time ago, and all he could say was, 'We do not have the money.' I ask the member for Calwell, who speaks out on social justice, why nothing has been done. This week, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) asked the coalition if she could see the colour of its money when she was questioned over funds allocated to an Aboriginal health service in Central Australia. I ask the Minister for Human Services and Health if we can see the colour of the government's money on this question of dispossession in Preston at Northland secondary college. Gary Foley put it this way: The federal government had abandoned its responsibility to protect the interests of the significant portion of the Aboriginal community adversely affected by the state decision to close Northland. Under constitutional powers gained after the 1967 referendum the federal government had the power to intervene to resolve the Northland dispute. Instead, for two years the Labor government in Canberra had not only run away from their clear obligations on the Northland issue but they had also acted on numerous occasions to undermine and sabotage the Northland community struggle to save their school. You can disagree with Gary Foley's sentiments and some of the facts if you like, but a significant number of facts are verifiable. He went on to say this: The experience of past and present Northland students (who are in the category defined by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody as being those most in danger of dying abnormally in custody) will demonstrate the vast difference between the PR hype of federal and state governments and the reality on the streets for koori youth. The Minster for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) says, in response to Gary Foley: I have not hesitated to give my sustained public and private support to Northland. As you know damn well, however, I have no authority to provide funding. Aboriginal education issues are totally outside my ministerial control. Someone has to stand up and say, 'Yes, I have the responsibility to do something about an act of dispossession that occurred in Preston two years ago-not 200 years ago, two years ago. It does not have anything to do with the Dreamtime. It has something to do with land. It has something to do with education. It has something to do with health. The land bill is a step forward, and a good step forward. The opposition from the coalition is silly opposition because it comes from an opposition that has no grasp of the big picture, as the Prime Minister puts it. But, on the other hand, the federal government cannot just trot out the cliches and the platitudes about reconciliation and dispossession unless when it is faced with a specific act of dispossession it acts to do something about it. This is an act of dispossession. I call on the federal government to do something and do something quickly.",24
12,Mr MELHAM,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"On 12 May this year the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) issued a statement. He had this to say in part: . .. the Government has always recognised that despite its historic significance, the Mabo decision gives little more than a sense of justice to those Aboriginal communities whose native title has been extinguished or lost without consultation, negotiation or compensation. Their dispossession has been total, their loss has been complete. He also went on to say: While these communities remain dispossessed land, their economic marginalisation and their of injury continue. This dispossession has led social and economic marginalisation which the government is intending to address through a package of social justice measures, of which the Land Fund will be the major financial component. The Government remains committed to working with ATSIC and other indigenous representatives to remedy indigenous dispossession. The ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill is another step along that path. It is a great tragedy that the opposition has again sought to play politics with this issue. It is very interesting that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downpolicies er) could go to the Northern Territory in recent times and get it so wrong. He has condemned himself from his own mouth and of by his own actions, which were there for community to see. Reconciliation has been the agenda since the High Court decision in June 1992. These matters have been in the public domain since that time, yet a leader of a major political party went to the Northern Territory and, frankly, did not know which way was up when it came to his own party's policy, his own views and where he was taking the opposition. The same can be said of the opposition's attitude to this bill before the parliament. minute the opposition opposes the bill and the next minute, to appease the moderate of the party, we have the situation where it will have some amendments but we do know what those amendments are and it says to us, 'We are not going to show them to you now, but you will see them. If you do not accept the amendments we are going to oppose the bill We have only to look at the way the Leader of the Opposition selected his shadow ministry to see how he punished the moderates in his party who had actually privately supported the government's initial Mabo legislation. The previous shadow Attorneypeople. General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), was dumped from the shadow ministry. The previous shadow Aboriginal affairs minister, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), was also dumped from the ministry. The honourable member for of Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) was demoted sense within the ministry, and the current shadow to the spokesperson for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), was transferred from the environment portfolio to the Aboriginal affairs portfolio and that was not seen as a promotion. We have only to look at that situation to see where the Leader of the Opposition rates Aboriginal affairs on the opposition's agenda. He does not rate it very highly. I think the electorate, intelligent as it is, has seen the Leader of the Opposition for what he is. He is an absolute lightweight, without and without substance-a policy free zone. This perception results from his actions. The remarkable thing about the performance the opposition is that criticism of it has not the come about because of things said by memon bers of the government. The opposition's performance in relation to the land fund will be further testimony to how shallow it is. Previous conservative leaders have had a reasonable approach to this issue. The 1967 referendum was conducted by a conservative government. Malcolm Fraser, to his credit, carried through in this area and his government had a distinguished record in this area. I see that the honourable member for Koo chamber. He also played a significant role in sections that government. It is daylight second from the periods of the previous conservative leaders to that of the current leader when it comes to taking courageous decisions. I acknowledge that there are people within the conservative parties who are genuine, compassionate and trying to do the right thing in this area. But, quite frankly, I think the opposition needs to look at itself. Reconciliation is important at this time. I was fortunate in the July adjournment to be able to go to Geneva and sit in on a conference of a working group on indigenous It is formulating a statement in relation to indigenous people around the world. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) was there. I listened to what was happening in America, Canada and New Zealand and it became obvious that, as far as the world is concerned, Australia is at the forefront. It is at the forefront in formulating the declaration of rights. It is at the forefront with regard to cajoling, and talking to, other countries to come to terms with the problem. The Leader of the Opposition came into this parliament yesterday and gave what I could only describe as the most hypocritical speech I have heard in my short time in this place. One would think, having listened to him, that the opposition is the repository of all wisdom and that its recent record outshone our record. What is the opposition's recent record? The former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), described the day the Mabo legislation passed this parliament as a day of shame. Frankly, the current Leader of the Opposition's conduct is no better. Indeed, it is worse. It is worse because he is perpetrating a deception. At least the honourable member for Wentworth had the decency to tell it as he saw it. The problem with the current Leader of the Opposition is that it depends who he is talking to. He tells people what they want to hear. I noticed that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) talked about the revelation that the Leader of the Opposition when a backbencher addressed the League of Rights. The Leader of the Opposition needs to be judged on that. People can judge him on whether or not he addressed the League of Rights. On the Sunday program on 7 August, he said: You will never, never find me tolerating in any shape or form any type of racism at all, ever, ever. If I've been on a platform, if I've been on platforms ... I'm sure I've been on platforms where there have been people from the League of Rights around, but I never given any support to the League of Rights. I think that is in direct contrast to what he is currently saying and contradicts the evidence coming to the fore. It is one thing to say, 'I have been on a platform where there might have been people from the League of Rights. ' Did he or did he not address a League of Rights meeting? He needs to come clean on that. That is why this legislation is significant. Even if the opposition's amendments are rejected by the government, or if some of them are picked up, opposition members need to support the legislation. If they do not, they will be seen as the hypocrites I think they are. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson, stated the position eloquently when he said: For us land has a spiritual, cultural, political and economic value. It supports our identity, our spirit, our social relations, our integrity and our survival. Land is the source of our physical and spiritual sustenance. Removed from our land we are removed from ourselves. That is why this legislation is important. Part A of the explanatory memorandum at page 1 basically sets out the objectives of this legislation which I think are worth restating: This legislation is part of the Commonwealth's overall response to the High Court's historic Mabo decision and complements the Native Title Act /993. As most indigenous Australians have been dispossessed of their lands, they have been prevented from meeting the criteria laid down in Mabo which requires a continuing connection with land or waters. This legislation represents a further significant step in reversing the process of dispossession which has been ongoing for over 200 years. The Commonwealth's specific objectives in establishing the Land Fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation are to enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage it in a sustainable way to provide economic, social and cultural benefits. The focus on land management extends to other indigenous-owned land, as well as that acquired by the Indigenous Land Corporation. The establishment of a self-sustaining capital fund will provide a secure and ongoing source of funds to the Indigenous Land Corporation for expenditure on land acquisition and management. It is intended that the Corporation operate on the basis of regionally based strategies and involve regional representative interests. It will have the ability to operate on a commercial basis. That is the import of the bill before the House today. What the Prime Minister said in his second reading speech encapsulates what we as a government are all about, and it is worth repeating. He said: There is enormous symbolic value in the Mabo decision and the subsequent legislation. For the first time in our history, the inherent rights of indigenous Australians have been recognised and given statutory protection. These developments indicate that as a nation we have had the collective courage and wisdom to acknowledge the violence and destruction done to indigenous Australians and their culture since European occupation. They signal that as a nation we are willing to accept our responsibility to work towards a new relationship. Much has been achieved, but justice has not yet been done. Justice has not been done because the majority of Australia's indigenous people live on the margins of economic, social and cultural life in this country. We may ask how this can be so in a country with one of the highest standards of living in the world, a country which prides itself on giving everyone a fair go. It is so, Mr Acting Speaker, because the vast majority of indigenous Australians have been dispossessed, either in whole or part, of that which is most precious to their sense of history and spirituality, that most component of their heritage-their land. Contemporary western culture tends to view land as something of a commodity, something which may enrich us, but not something which goes to the essence of our culture. It is difficult for nonindigenous Australians to understand what Australia's indigenous people feel about the loss of their land. It is difficult, therefore, to comprehend the extent of their dispossession. Yet it should not be too difficult for us to comprehend. It should surely not be difficult for Australians who have always placed such a value on owning a bit of Australia, the people who have taken much of their literary and artistic inspiration from the bush and who still find their greatest comfort in the natural landscape of Australia in the great outdoors. The land has a cultural and spiritual significance Australians and we all can surely come to an understanding of what total and uncompensated dispossession meant. We must try to comprehend it. Unless we understand the importance of land to indigenous peoples, we cannot come to terms with the extent of the loss. That is why this is substantial legislation; it is historic legislation; it is legislation that deserves bipartisan support. I could understand if the Leader of the Opposition and members of the opposition parties were to stand up in the parliament and say, 'Look, you don't go far enough as a government. We believe that we have amendments that can enhance and enrich the bill which you've placed before the parliament.' In those instances, the opposition could put the amendments and, in the end, if the amendments were defeated, it could support the legislation. That would be the most reasonable course of action for the opposition to take if it were at all serious, but the reverse is happening. It is a cop-out; it is a two bob each way approach to hide the real approach of the leadership of the opposition. The leadership of the opposition has no time for Aboriginal and indigenous Australians and it wants to give them nothing. It has a paternalistic approach. The opposition should say, 'We have these amendments that we think can improve the bill. If you don't accept them, we'll still vote for the bill.' But, no, the opposite is occurring. The opposition is saying, 'If you don't accept these amendments, we'll vote against the bill.' Its real intention-and its performance since the High essential Court brought down its Mabo decision is indicative of this-is to give indigenous Australians nothing and to fight them every inch of the way. The High Court brought down its Mabo decision in June 1992. What would have happened if it were BHP or another large corporation which supports the conservative parties that had a victory in the High Court? The Liberal and National parties would not have said, 'Let's take away those rights that the High Court has given them. Let's wind them back.' They would have said, 'We've got to support the High Court on this. The rule of law needs to be preserved and the for all High Court needs to be supported.' But that is not the opposition's position with respect to Mabo, and one needs to ask why. The great tragedy is that the leadership of the opposition does not understand. I am not saying that there are not members of the conservative parties who are genuinely interested. When the honourable member for Chisholm was the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, he made an enormous contribution to our society and he assisted in the process of reconciliation. He was a constructive shadow minister who had a genuine commitment to indigenous Australians. But where is he in the pecking order now? What does that tell you about the conservative parties? I do not have a problem with the opposition having a particular policy if it can be nailed down to it. That is the problem with the current Leader of the Opposition. It is significant that his visit to the Northern Territory exposed him to the electorate at large for what he was. Since then, the talkback programs and the opinion polls have confirmed that the electorate will not cop him and these sorts of policies. I urge members of the opposition to further consider their attitude to this bill and to put pressure on the Leader of the Opposition and his executive to support the bill, which goes a long way to assisting the dispossession of indigenous Australians, if the opposition's amendments are not accepted. The bill goes some way to embodying important concepts into legislation. As I said earlier, whilst the High Court judgment afforded recognition of native title as applying uniquely to Australia's indigenous people, it also recognised that only indigenous people possessed the particular relationship with land called native title and its attendant rights. I understand that there has been consultation and negotiation on this bill. The right to control decisions over how resources are utilised for the well-being of indigenous Australians is enshrined in this legislation. It is in line with principles of self-determination. This bill provides that decisions on expenditure of funds for the benefit of indigenous people should be based on strategies developed and negotiated by them. Negotiation with indigenous interests has been the trademark of this government ever since the Mabo decision was handed down, and it was evident in our response to the Mabo decision. The complexities of the native title legislation were also thrashed out over many long and arduous months of negotiation with Aboriginal representatives. Many of the provisions of this bill to establish the Indigenous Land Corporation and land fund are the result of similar negotiations. This is why the opposition needs to support this bill. The government has consistently recognised the importance of the right of indigenous people to negotiate on matters that directly affect them. It is a bit paternalistic of the opposition at the moment-(Ttme expired)",27
13,Mr TRUSS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I believe it is impossible for any decent and caring Australian to look at the lifestyle and standard of living of Australia's Aborigines without feeling deeply depressed. The fact that so many Aboriginal Australians live in such abysmal circumstances is to our national shame. How can a country with such bountiful resources and boundless opportunity have allowed such a significant sector of our society to have degenerated into such a state? Despite the good intentions of governments over the years, Aborigines seem to be falling even further behind. The past 10 years of Labor has produced more promises and more cash, but fewer results than ever in our history. The government's own report Australia s health found that Aboriginal men and women lived on average 17 years less than the nonAboriginal population. Infant mortality is four times higher than among non-Aborigines. Aborigines are admitted to hospital three times more frequently than other Australians. But only 23 per cent of 15to 24-year olds attend an educational institution. Aborigines smoke more, drink more and have much greater rates of malnutrition and a wide range of diseases. They are also more likely to be killed or injured in car accidents and to be the victims of domestic violence and violent crime-almost always innicted by members of their own race. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was called because it seemed so many Aborigines were committing suicide in custody. The commission made some important recommendations, but perhaps its most telling finding was that so many Aborigines died in custody because they were heavily overrepresented in the prison population. In fact, Aborigines are 18 times more likely to be in gaol than non-Aborigines. They are in gaol more often because they commit more crime, especially more serious and violent crime. It is an unforgettable and depressing experience to visit an Aboriginal community and see buildings with every window smashed, every panel destroyed and steel doors and bars barricading every business. The Courier Mail made a big impression on Queenslanders recently when it published a number of photographs of almost empty school classrooms taken the day after supporting parents benefits payments arrived in the community. The children's parents were in the wet canteen and the children were out eating chocolates and drinking coke. The school would only return to normal after there was no more money left to buy alcohol. For far too many communities, daily life revolves around alcohol and hopeless despair. This is simply unacceptable to me and should not be tolerated by any Australian. The government has responded to the crisis in Aboriginal welfare by establishing and funding a massive Aboriginal welfare industry. This industry has attracted a cast of thousands-some Aborigines, some claiming to be so but with very doubtful credentials, and a mass of white advisers. Some of these advisers are well motivated and genuinely trying to help, while for others it is little than a generous income source and an opportunity to exercise power and massage their egos. This massive Aboriginal industry almost entirely funded by federal and state governments has sought to distort the real situation confronting Australian Aborigines and to rewrite history to their own advantage. Anyone who dares question their actions and their ruthless exercise of power is immediately branded a racist or a redneck. This Aboriginal industry displays no tolerance to alternative views in the community or even to minority groups of Aborigines. Real power in the Aboriginal industry is exercised by a few tribal groups to the exclusion of others, and nepotism is rife. There is an extraordinary concentration of grants and funding to relations of those who are in power. It is these same groups that dominate ATSIC, advise ministers and occupy positions in the Aboriginal bureaucracy. Most full-blood Aborigines, particular those living closest to their old ways, are shy and ill equipped to have their views heard, let alone be heeded by the Aboriginal industry. There have, therefore, been numerous cases where land rights have been granted to the group with the political power and not to those Aborigines with the most genuine claims on the area. Those with the political power fund their own supporters, often dispossessing their fellow Aborigines who have the strongest claim. Even now the industry is funding claims under the Mabo legislation for some groups while specifically denying financial support for others often with more legitimate claims for the same land. I find it amazing and deplorable that the government and the community at large have not been more questioning of the administration of Aboriginal affairs in this country. It seems that even the most extraordinary tales peddled by the Aboriginal industry are allowed to go unquestioned until eventually they become a part of the politically correct position. When the same person claims to be a tribal more leader and makes land claims in more than one state, surely some questions should be asked about his legitimacy. In my own electorate Mr John Lee Jones, who has appeared on the scene since the Fitzgerald inquiry into the Great Sandy Region, has suggested that there should be a role for Aboriginals in the management of the region. This same Mr Jones claims to be an elder of three different tribes and is laying claim to much of southeast Queensland. Now this same man is claiming $40 million in rewards from the Victorian government, allegedly for the role his forefathers played in the capture of the Kelly Gang. People like Mr Jones are generously endowed with Aboriginal industry funds and organisations with which he is associated have received tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars. It is the Aboriginal industry which is seeking to foster the guilt syndrome as a basis for Aboriginal assistance. It is this massive government funded bureaucracy which is promoting the rewriting of our national history to describe European settlement of this country as an invasion. These are the people who want treaties between black and white, and United Nations declarations to grant them self-government and to establish an independent nation within a nation on our continent. Support for all these sorts of causes is being gently massaged into community attitudes, the education curriculum and, of course, the politically correct agenda. The clear facts are, however, that none of these issues will do anything to address the real disadvantage of the Aboriginal people. Blaming others for the problems will not help them go away. A treaty or international declaration will not cure alcoholism nor stem the spread of AIDS. Creating a separate country within Australia will not extend life expectancy nor improve literacy. These issues are being given undue prominence over the matters which really count because some people in the Aboriginal industry are there just for the exercise of raw political power. This seems to especially be the case for the white lawyers and so-called expert advisers who swarm around every Aboriginal issue. Unfortunately, the federal Labor government has become very much a part of, and has indeed fostered, this distorted view of what. will provide real benefits to Aboriginal people. The government seems to devote little time or effort into positive programs to improve Aboriginal health, housing, education and social needs. There is often touching rhetoric but little action. In the dying days before his departure from the government, former Minister for Health Graham Richardson went to the Northern Territory and committed the government to an extra $800 million for Aboriginal health care. That was an impressive sounding number and I, like many others, welcomed this professed new found commitment by the government to address Aboriginal health issues. Of course, by the time it came to the budget the $800 million had been whittled down to $500 million spread over five years. But worse was yet to come: $414 million of that money was already committed in continuing projects. In reality, in spite of all the grandiose and hearthad warming promises, the government was providing just $17 million a year in new money, and only a paltry $5.25 million of that is to go to primary health care. As usual, the Aboriginal industry was largely silent on this double-cross by the government on the allocation of resources and what I would have thought should be the crucial area of concern for all those people who have the welfare of Aborigines truly at heart. A similar story could be told about the government's efforts in education and training, or housing and community services. The real levels of government achievement have indeed been paltry. The government's entire Aboriginal affairs policy seems to be built around the myth that the granting of large areas of land to Aboriginal groups will provide a magic and instant solution to the social and economic problems of Australian Aborigines. The importance of land rights has been grossly overstated as a solution to the issues of Aboriginal degradation. The case has been exaggerated so often that even some community leaders and members of this House seem to be accepting the magic pudding qualities of the granting of land. Over recent years very large areas of land have been made available to the Aboriginal people in various forms of title. Aborigines, who comprise less than two per cent of the Australian population, already have ownership of more than 16 per cent of the national land mass, including 48 per cent of the Northern Territory. Some of this land has been held by Aborigines for several generations, so it is possible to test the academic theory that land ownership will resolve Aboriginal health, education and social problems. Even the most superficial visit to areas where Aboriginals have title to the land will provide ample evidence that there has been little, if any, improvement in the living conditions of the landowners. In most instances their circumstances have become even worse. A study into health issues in the Northern Territory demonstrated quite conclusively that those Aborigines living on land where they the title had poorer health standards than other Aborigines and, indeed, the majority of Australians. The study showed that the people of east Arnhem Land had a mortality rate for respiratory diseases which was 12 times that of other Australians and that for infectious diseases it was 100 times. These figures are worse than those in areas where the Aborigines do not have title to their land and far worse than the averages applying in Australia. Some of the Aboriginal communities where social degradation and disgraceful living standards are at their worse are those which have been owned by Aboriginal people for extended periods. Buildings, housing and facilities have often been destroyed; education and other services have been hampered or stalled. Alcoholism and violence are the norm. Family relationships and tribal discipline are in tatters. There is little employment and, for most, no hope or optimism for the future. No matter how much extra land is acquired for Aborigines, the problem will not be resolved, because title to land is not the cure-all key that warm-hearted academics may wish to think it is. Having made that critical-and, I believe, indisputable-point, let me hasten to add that I do not dispute the view that land ownership is important to Aborigines. Most Aborigines do love the land and have a strong attachment to it. But so do other people. It is soul destroying and utterly devastating to a family farm when drought and other circumstances force the family to leave the land that they have tended and cared for over three or four generations. For that farmer, too, the land is his life; if he must leave the property, a part of him dies. Try persuading an ageing mother to leave her home and garden to go to a nursing home in her latter years or resuming a row of houses for a new road. These people, too, have a healthy and justifiable affinity with their properties. It is simply a nonsense to suggest that Aborigines living hundreds of miles away have a greater affinity for a parcel of land they have never seen than the family members who have lived there all their lives and perhaps inherited from their forefathers. I do not know whether any Aborigine has ever crossed the farm which has been my home all my life, but I do not accept that there would be anyone with a closer affinity to that land than my family and me. And that is true for others. I heard the previous speaker quote the eloquent words of an Aborigine describing the meaning of land to him. I will not repeat those words, but I am more than happy to ascribe to those words as an adequate description of the way I feel about the land on which I and my family have lived for four generations. I emphasise that I am not against the ownership of land by Aborigines. Ownership should be encouraged. I would even support the availability of public funding to assist in land purchases on a fair and equitable basis. Instead of the sort of land fund that is being developed in the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, perhaps it would have been better to establish some kind of financial facility like the old agricultural banks which would enable Aborigines to acquire land on commercial terms in the same way that farmers were assisted in bygone eras. Unfortunately, most of the land theoretically owned by Aborigines in Australia is in fact held by trusts and corporations. There is not the same feeling of personal association and ownership which would apply if the title to the land was in the name of individual Aborigines. I have no doubt that individual ownership rather than corporate title would provide real benefits to Aborigines and a real incentive to achieve things for themselves. If an individual Aborigine and his family thought that they as distinct from anyone else in the world had ownership and responsibility for a particular parcel of land, I have no doubt that they would soon acquire the motivation and management skills to successfully manage it for their own benefit and for the benefit of the nation. In reality, very few Aborigines are actually choosing to live on the areas of land that have already been that provided. Very few have chosen to abandon the comforts of a modern lifestyle to return to the old ways of the bush. Like others who have been exposed to a Western lifestyle, they want a choice of television channels, the opportunity to see their football team in action, and access to the facilities and services of an urban lifestyle. Only rarely is the land which has been acquired put to productive use. Occasionally, public attention is focused on a new venture-a cattle station, a crocodile farm, a tourist development or some other proposalbut, sadly, the majority of these projects last for only a short time. Because they are held in corporate ownership, there is the view that they will be funded with an inexhaustible supply of taxpayers' money, and there is no responsibility felt to ensure that the projects succeed. Individual ownership would guarantee responsibility and a greater prospect of success. Greater land holdings, therefore, are not the key to an improved lifestyle and to better understanding and goodwill between black and white. I do not support the type of land fund being proposed by Labor in this legislation. This land fund perpetuates the dangerous myth that the more land provided to Aborigines the smaller their problems. The land is provided to corporations and to associations rather than to individuals. If it were provided to individuproblem as, there could be that genuine feeling of association and commitment to develop the land. I am also alarmed at the suggestion that this land should be purchased in country areas alone. This seems to me very much like a case of city people saying, 'Not in my backyard, please. It's quite okay to buy land in country electorates, but keep out of my street.' I suggest that those urban consciences that are eased by giving away land in faraway country areas are very superficial indeed. I will be impressed when these people volunteer their streets to be sold to one of these groups",31
14,Mr LLOYD,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Or a claim on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.,35
15,Mr TRUSS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Or when they are prepared to give up the Melbourne Cricket Ground or some other urban areas rather than try to give away the country areas in electorates such as my own. It is not good enough for the government and others just to cheer for Cathy Freeman. It is not good enough just to take pride in isolated achievements. Those people are to be commended on what they have done, but the government must make a real commitment to address the issues that are of real significance to Aborigines and to secure their future. Meaningful employment opportunities are the key. They need reasons for hope for the future and reasons to believe that there will be something better in the years ahead. Australia has a clear responsibility to its Aboriginal people to ensure that their standard of living is improved and that they enjoy equal opportunities with their fellow Australians. This obligation means that special programs and special opportunities funded by other Australians may be necessary to address their disadvantage. However, a land fund is not a magic pudding solution. The government is doing Aborigines and the Australian people a disservice by promoting this fund in that context.",35
16,Ms HENZELL,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND," Mr Deputy Speaker, I crave your indulgence. My sore throat may give me some problems, but I certainly will not have a in dealing with the opposition. On 1 September 1993, in the intense time leading up to the Mabo native title legislation, I asked the House this series of questions: How will history judge us? Will history conclude that we were tried and found wanting? Will we be diminished in the eyes of our children and their children because we placed petty, immediate self interest ahead of a higher moral imperative? Will our standing in the international world be irretrievably damaged? I am glad to say that history will prove that this government was able to grasp the nettle and deal with this issue. But I fear that history will judge the Liberal Party and the National Party, including my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), very severely indeed. While it may be helpful to him to pander to racism and a redneck attitude in his electorate, I believe it is very concerning that the National Party and the Liberal Party are failing to look a little higher than immediate and parochial self-interest. The honourable member for Wide Bay commented on the rewriting of history. I quote some comments I made in my speech on native title on 24 November 1993 regarding the history of issues surrounding native title: In 1837 a select committee of the House of Commons foundthis is 1837, not 1994. I continue: In the fonnation of these settlements it does not appear that the territorial rights of the natives were considered . . . the land has been taken from them without the assertion of any other title than that of superior force. In the Aboriginal Law Bulletin, No. 29 of 1987, Henry Reynolds quotes Governor Gawler, who wrote: From time immemorial theythe Aborigineshad distinct, defined and absolute rights of proprietary and hereditary possession. This is not something that the Labor government dreamed up. We looked at the history of this country. Indeed, we now have some members of the opposition admitting that dispossession did occur. So we have dragged opposition members to the point where they have finally admitted that the dispossession was real and that the invasion did occur. But now, having seen the debacle over the native title legislation, we are really seeing this whole process revisited. The opposition's response to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 really appears to me to be a re-run of that whole debate. We have effectively seen the opposition cobbling together a response based on the leadership crisis inside the party. Until very recently, there was total opposition to the land fund bill. I will quote some press comments from the current shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. On 16 June, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) said this in answer to a question about the coalition's official position: The Coalition's official position is to oppose the Land Fund."" ""We were not opposed to Mabo, we supported . . . The interviewer said: ... you certainly appeared that way. The honourable member then said: ""No, hold on. Look, we totally supported the High Court decision . . . As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said the other day, we have had the virus of the leadership divisions visiting the new leadership in the Liberal Party. We have had the debacle of the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). Wherever he is, he says what he thinks people want to hear. When he was in Western Australia, faced with the Court government and the conservative elements in that state, he said, 'Well, we'll repeal the Native Title Act if necessary'. When he was in the Northern Territory, he discovered that he was tired and emotional. By the end of that week, not only had he plummeted in the opinion polls but whatever policy he had was in tatters. Indeed, only last Friday, by the time it took me to fly from Melbourne to Sydney following a hearing of the parliamentary committee that is looking at the implementation of the recommendations of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, I discovered that the Leader of the Opposition had sacked one of his front-bench members, the former Leader of the Opposition, for challenging his authority in Tasmania. Guess where he was? He was in Tasmania-that progressive place that values human rights but apparently only those of some people. Unfortunately, when he got back to CanberraMr Thckey-Have you heard the National Civic Council on your exercise there?",35
17,Ms HENZELL,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"On this occasion, the honourable member for O'Connor is following me. This is a tum-up for the books. It is usually the other way around. The Leader of the Opposition found himself back in Canberra with half his backbench in insurrection. So, to attempt to pull together the moderates and deal with the conservative hardliners, he came up with a response to this bill. I quote the Prime Minister's comments at a doorstop interview yesterday which I think were incredibly apt: ... He is putting up a set of sham amendments, weasel words . .. Because fundamental to his objection is the same fundamental objection the Liberal Party has had all along ... they don't want Aboriginal and Islander people to have access to land. They'll talk about anything but land and in the speech he implied that land was an issue, but not a fundamental one. What did the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) say? She said what I thought when I was listening to the speech of the opposition leader. She referred to it as a Clayton's land fund-that is, the sort of land fund you have when you are not having a land fund. The Leader of the Australian Democrats said: The Coalition seem to want a ""Clayton's"" Land Fund-a land fund you have as long as it's not spent on land. This is incredibly disappointing and confinns the dominance of the conservatives over the moderates within the Liberal Party. More particularly, she said: Their position amounts to gutting the Fund. It is very concerning that the Liberal Party cannot seem to get its act together. We have asked for a bipartisan approach. It is saying, 'We'll have one, but only if you tum the bill on its head and do not make it a land fund. Make it anything but a land fund.' It is very unfortunate to hear the honourable member for Wide Bay talk about his commitment to the land. I appreciate that comment. I understand that non-indigenous Australians have commitments to the country, to their own backyard and their own piece of property, but it has to be understood that the sort of connection that Aboriginal people have to their land is very much a different matter. It has a significance that is more than 200 years old; it is thousands of years old. It is not broken simply because we dispossessed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, drove them away, committed genocide and marginalised them into the present predicament which many of them are experiencing. It is absolutely crucial to the reconciliation process that we deal with this issue. I refer once again to the Prime Minister's speech yesterday. I believe that the Labor government has a right to be proud of its achievement in this area. The Prime Minister said: For the first time in our history, the inherent rights of indigenous Australians have been recognised and given statutory protection. These developme-ts indicate that as a nation we have had the collective courage and wisdom to acknowledge the violence and destruction done to indigenous Australians and their culture since European occupation. They signal that as a nation we are willing to accept our responsibility to work towards a new relationship. But this will require that we also deal with those issues that will not be dealt with under native title. This land acquisition fund bill relates to the majority of Aboriginal people who will not be able to seek redress under the native title legislation. I have spoken to many individuals and groups in the community. I am afraid that even some members of my own family have never met an Aboriginal person. They have never sat down and talked to an Aboriginal person, but they have picked up on the myths and bigoted views that are sometimes referred to in the press, accounts of which were given by the honourable member for Wide Bay. But there is a broader view, and I think it is very important to remind ourselves that what caused the new opposition leader to end his honeymoon with a thud was the issue of Aboriginal land rights. If it were true that the majority of Australians were absolutely and irrevocably opposed to social justice for Aboriginal people, I do not think this would have been the issue which caused this incredible drop in the opinion polls. Both this and the Cathy Freeman incident at the Commonwealth Games indicate that the majority of decent Australians are becoming increasingly aware that these issues must be responded to and must be addressed. I take this opportunity to congratulate Cathy on her performance, behaviour and commitment to the Aboriginal flag and what it has meant symbolically, not only to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but to all Australians. I refer to correspondence from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, dated 30 August. Point 5 of the letter states: It is expected that the Bill will pass Parliament by the end of 1994 to set up the National Land Fund and allow commencement of the new Indigenous Land Corporation on the 1st January 1995. The ACTU supports the passing of the Bill, and the establishment of both the National Land Fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation. Point 9 states: The ACTU recognises the Implementation of the Native Title Act, the National Land Fund, and the social justice package in response to the Mabo decision as an important contribution to the process of Reconciliation between indigenous and nonindigenous Australians. Best wishes for today and congratulations to the Labor Party for its Land Fund initiative. Yours sincerely, NA President I want to place on record my acknowledgment of the hard work, support and commitment of trade unions across this country to issues of social justice for Aboriginal people. I will return to the issue of the meaning of land to Aboriginal people. I want to quote from a submission, dated 5 April 1994, to the Shoalwater Bay commission of inquiry-I am delighted that, as we speak, it is being processed through cabinet-from the DarumbalMoolar Murree Aboriginal Corporation for Land and Culture: Our relationship with this area goes back a long way, for possibly many thousands of years, through many generations of our families, we value this area for the long traditional association we've had with it. We see that for a short term, a couple of generations, our relationship with this area has been interrupted, but it's now time to get back and re-establish our relationship with this area. It's been said more than once that Aboriginal culture in this area has been decimated almost to the point of extinction, we don't believe this to be true, we agree that much has been lost but still we've retained knowledge and understanding of language, spirituality, kinship relationships, totems and so on, that which we value greatly. We seek to regenerate and revitalise our culture, we want our people to again value, respect and practise it, also to fulfil their obligations to teach it on to their children. Of course it can be said that we've lost too much, and that what is lost is lost forever. We believe that at the basis of any social or cultural group is the Family and basic family values, we feel that we have sustained our family and kinship relationships, as well as our appreciation for our family values. While we have this we have the very basis of our culture. We also have a basic understanding and appreciation of our spirituality, an understanding and appreciation that will strengthen and improve if we're given the opportunity to get back into our country To us, ""Wilderness"" is a concept that has been created by white people for their own benefit, to us there's no such thing. These are our traditional Darumbal Homelands, our identities are here, we're part of this country, we belong here. This country will improve and prosper under our care and guidance. We have more of an appreciation of the conservation and preservation of this area than anyone, we also understand our obligation to our forefathers, ourselves, and our children to manage and maintain this area. This is our home and we respect it. As has been stated during this Inquiry, Aboriginal people have many social problems to deal with, we believe that many of these problems are a direct result of cultural and social breakdown, brought about by loss of identity, in tum brought about by loss of land. Granting us access to land will afford us the opportunity to reassert our identity, our spirituality, and our culture. The result, we hope, will be an improvement in self-esteem, which unfortunately at times is lacking. We don't expect it will solve all our problems immediately, but it will certainly improve our present situation. These are not my words, the words of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), university lecturers or researchers; these are the words of the Hatfield family of Rockhampton. Doug Hatfield has been a paraplegic since a diving accident many years ago. The opportunity that was afforded to these descendants and elders of the Darumbal people in the Rockhampton region by the Shoal water Bay inquiry has been of unique importance to this group. It has meant an enormous amount to these people that their submission was accepted, that they were acknowledged and that the Prime Minister met them during his recent and pass visit to Rockhampton. I believe it is very important that the inquiry's recommendations included a very positive response to the Darumbal people's call to have access to the Shoal water Bay area so that they can have the opportunity to maintain their links to the past. Yesterday, while the opposition leader was giving his response during the second reading debate, I was privileged to host, with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the Kimberly Aboriginal Medical Service Corporation in a performance of its play No Prejudice in the Great Hall. The corporation has developed this play with assistance from the Department of Human Services and Health. The performance in the parliament was with the support of the ATSIC Regional Council. No Prejudice is a play about HIV-AIDS and community education in Aboriginal communities. This play has been performed all around the country. At its conclusion, Sol Bellear supported the government's position on the land fund and said that the Aboriginal medical services, while accepting the great needs in health and related issues, are determined that land be the bottom line. Land is the priority and prerequisite to deal with social justice issues for Aboriginal people. I hope that, before the second reading debate comes to an end, opposition members will review their opposition on this matter, will come on board and give wholehearted support to this bill.",36
18,Mr TUCKEY,MARTIN FERGUSON,"In making what I think from her point of view was quite a committed speech, the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) ruined it by wanting to play a bit of inter-party politics and talk about leadership. If she had a genuine commitment to this issue, she would not have done that. If she had a genuine commitment to the welfare of the Aboriginal people in her electorate who might be the beneficiaries of this-in my speech I will develop the fact that they probably will not be-she could have ignored the opportunity to have that sly little dig. In that regard, I refer to the speech of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who wanted to attack in particular certain state premiers, including Richard Court. When it comes to credentials of commitment to assistance to Aboriginal people, in a very positive way, no politician in Australia stands higher than Richard Court. As a young man, in his early married life-having had absolutely nothing to do with politics-he adopted an Aboriginal child. When his first marriage broke down, as a single parent he personally sustained that child. What is more, he has never exposed that girl to the political process. Regardless of what mud of racism those on the opposition benches have thrown at him, he has never stood up and said, 'I can defend myself from those remarks; I adopted an Aboriginal girl and she is still my daughter to this day.' He has never used her for politiPrior cal purposes; I am sure that others would. When the member for the Northern Territory and other members of the front-bench want to question Richard Court's motives, they should come forward with their own credentials in this regard. I will stand corrected but, to the best of my knowledge, the member for the Northern Territory was a bludger on the Aboriginal system because he took their money. He worked in one of the Aboriginal organisations and used that as a means of getting a politicalMr Lindsay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask the member for O'Connor to withdraw that rather derogatory and defamatory statement about the member for the Northern Territory. Mr Reith-It wasn't offensive, though. Mr TUCKEy-it is not offensive to him. If the honourable member opposite wants to correct me, I will stand corrected. My understanding is that he worked in the land council for two reasons: firstly, to get money and, secondly, to promote his political aspirations.",39
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MARTIN FERGUSON,"It is in order to say that he worked for the land council but it is inappropriate to suggest that he was a bludger, and I ask you to withdraw that statement.",39
20,Mr TUCKEY,MARTIN FERGUSON,"I withdraw it. But I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I have not changed my opinion. The member for the Northern Territory has a long way to go to catch up to the commitment of Richard Court. So do the rest of those opposite. Ms Henzell-Is that an unreserved withdrawal?",39
21,Mr TUCKEY,MARTIN FERGUSON,"If the honourable member opposite wants to tell me the history of her commitment in that category and how she has personally assisted in this issue long before she had political aspirations, I would like to vote in favour of giving her time to tell us about it. The opposition in this debate has taken account of certain facts. The fact is that this government has been in office for 11 years. to its arrival, substantial funding was provided by the previous government. After years and years of expenditure and after years and years of speeches in this place, it is an unarguable fact that, in general, Aboriginal people are still severely disadvantaged. For instance, they have access to all the social security benefits that other people in the community are obliged to survive on. That has not helped. I am not blaming them for that. I am stating a fact. We have seen the creation of specialist Aboriginal health services, we have seen the creation of ATSIC, and we have seen the purchase of substantial areas of land. The situation is basically unchanged. We have seen the growth of a very outspoken Aboriginal bureaucracy; that seems to  himself on the radio this morning. He claims to be the chief executive officer of the Cape York Land Council, but he apparently resides in Sydney. He is doing pretty well from the system. This is the opposition's view: it is time to create programs that actually do something for Aboriginal people, that ensure that the people on the bottom of the pile get something out of this. In the context of the amendments that we propose is the simple proposition that maybe it is time to let some of these Aboriginal people actually own the land themselves, not have it administered by the Pearsons and the one-time Snowdons of this world. Why not have that happen? I put this question straight to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table: why not support our amendment which provides with this money some priority so that ordinary Aboriginal people, acting in their own right, not only could obtain some land, but might be able to do something with the land they have got already? We have given to them, in our paternalistic fashion, inalienable freehold title-meaning, of course, that if an Aboriginal person wants to be an entrepreneur and wants to do something for Aboriginal people, that person will go out and borrow some money, as any other entrepreneurial person would do. But the Aboriginals cannot mortgage their land. They are not allowed to. Speaker after speaker in this place has been talking about the indigenous people's association with land, their commitment to their land and their need for land. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) will give us a similar lecture about that. But in the legislation we say, 'We do not trust you with your own land. We will create mechanisms that give you no right to deal in that land.' Australia is a land of many opportunities. We are saying to the Aboriginal people, 'You are not entitled to a second chance.' Amongst the great skills which Aboriginal people possess is fishing. If a group of indigenous people who have obtained land under this scheme or one of the other schemes wishes to sell that land-as other Australians regularly do-and wants to buy a fishing boat and a fishing licence, why should we prevent it from doing so? The government is sneering at the amendment which has that effect. I was pleased to hear Senator Chamarette say this morning that she would like to pursue that issue a little further. But I bet you that when those who profit most from all these arrangements-the wealthy Aboriginal bureaucracy-get a smell of the idea we will test them out. The member for Melbourne Ports is shaking his head. We will see whether they will come forward and support the opposition in arguing that these funds should, in the main, be taken away from the socialist concept of a land council, or from the structure proposed in this legislation, and be given to the members of an Aboriginal family, for instance, who have got some claims. Let them decide their future by the use of that land. We say in our amendments that it might not be a bad idea for the government to use a bit of money to make their existing properties viable. That is sneered at. Let me make a point and give an example. For many years, the people of the tribes-controlled or supported by Don MCLeod, a white man-had Strelley and a couple of adjoining stations. They walked off those stations. It was not their choice to be pastoralists-that is our paternalistic view. Why not give them a chance? They cannot sell that land. They let the cattle seeking a drink fall down the wells. Do we blame them for that? Or do we blame the people who have got this European view that only pastoral properties would suit the welfare of Aboriginal people? Of course not. We hear a lot about the government's land biIl. The High Court decided that Aboriginal people have rights to land. It made it incumbent on state governments, as the constitutional minders of land, to do something about it. The state governments were obliged to do something. They would have acted-they had to act-within the parameters set down by the High Court. But, no, we had to jump into it.  Sydney and all these other people who are apparently representing the Aboriginal people. They are not representing the Aboriginal people in my electorate. The Aboriginal people never see them; they do not know who they are. They object to visits by these people-men with heavy gold bracelets and other signs of their wealth-while they remain in poverty. They would rather see some of the wages that are paid to these people help their kids get through school. But that does not happen. Of course, we are told that this miracle Mabo legislation is being so well received out there and that this is the next step. In relation to that issue, Mr Arnold Franks, a confirmed Aboriginal elder, at 8.44 a.m. on 3 August on ABC regional radio's Statewide, said: It's happening ... I think it's just about happening all over Australia but as far as I know for certain it's happened in the Pilbara. We've got an elder by the name of Billy Dunn; he went down and seen the Government about it in Perth. He's taken a map of his country and where his mother was born, and shows the different languages and the different people. Now the Western Desert Aborigine Land Council and these other land councils have jumped over these blokes' head. He said they ... all they say they're a mighty bunch of old people, we don't live in that way, we do it the white fellas way. And went ahead and done these things. So what Mr Keating has started in this state, I don't think he should be a prime minister. For a prime minister to start a war, and the war's on now. Blacks are fighting blacks now. That is what Arnold Franks said on the radio. He was interviewed because he and another group of elders were having a meeting of Aborigines at Turner River to discuss their objections to the Aboriginal bureaucracy muscling in on their traditional rights. I asked the parliamentary secretary whether a table could be included in Hansard. One would think that the government would be interested in how $614,640 of taxpayers' money was spent, how that money might have been spent on the welfare of Aboriginal people, yet the parliamentary secretary declined to have the table included in Hansard. What does he have to hide? If he genuinely believes that what he is doing is achieving something, why not investigate this matter? A two-year $614,000 project to create an Aboriginal home building trust was established by the then Premier of Western Australia, the current Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). That was an admirable pursuit. Housing is one of the great problems for disadvantaged people, Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal. The budget for the project was approved under the signature of then Premier Lawrence. The salary of the part-time chairman for the first year was $35,000. Vehicle and other expenses for the part-time chairman were $8,750. Those amounts are repeated in the second year. Project manager expenses total $7,900. The salary of the project manager was $89,000. Honourable members would probably think that this project manager would be Aboriginal, but he is not. He is a white man. This is an example of jobs for the boys. His name happened to be Easton. He was the husband of Penny Easton, who subsequently suicided in Western Australia due to attacks made upon her integrity by members of the Labor Party, one upper house member, John HeIden, in particular. Do not question that! What was this payment made to Easton for? Of course, the payment was duplicated? A total of $194,000 went to Easton and $83,000 to the part-time chairman-$277,ooo out of $614,000 was spent and not even a stump has been put in the ground to build a house. Honourable members would think that we needed all these people to learn how to build houses! There is another story running around Perth about how Easton got the first house for his girlfriend. Mr Lindsay-Get back to the bill!",39
22,Mr TUCKEY,MARTIN FERGUSON,"This is about the bill. This is about how taxpayers' money is being spent. Our amendments address the key issues of accountability. That $200,000 that Easton received was also raised in the Family Court. He claimed to his wife at the time that it was a payback from some other jobs that he had done. So good money, deservedly applied to the Aboriginal community, was being used by then Premier Lawrence as a payback for other little jobs, mainly for sacking public servants. Honourable members can check the record on that. We have every right to raise our concerns in this area. We are not opposing the government's attempts to give assistance to Aboriginal people. We just want to see them get the help. If government members want to say that that is a wrong motive, get up and say it. We want every attempt made to focus this land issue on health, housing, education and economic issues. Do not get up and say you have done that. Do not get up and say, 'That should be the focus of other money.' You have spent that-over $1 billion a year. You have paid them the normal social security benefits they are rightly entitled to, and they are still in desperate circumstances. Too often budgets such as this one are the way you spend Aboriginal money. We would like to think that on this occasion the money actually got to the people that Arnold Fran ks talks about-the genuine Aboriginal people that are being overrun by your bureaucracy. I tum to the matter of accountability. There is a legion of evidence which suggests that money has been wasted. This happens time and time again. The other day I was told of one group that sat for a week arguing over whether or not it would shift the community toilets at a cost of $100 and then voted to buy two aeroplanes. That is silly. It is not helping those people with their health and education, which surely should come first. If anyone questions me on that, I can get the evidence. Another group of Aborigines complained that their budget allocation from ATSIC came so late that they could only waste it. I have had two phone calls from people in my electorate who have purchased farms. I think that is great. They are good people who will do something with those farms. They just have a little problem: the government did not have any money left to buy them any tractors or farm machinery or to provide carry-on finance to fertilise the ground. I have corresponded with ATSIC, and the situation has not changed. Is this legislation simply tokenism? If it is, it is no good for Aboriginal people. I hope that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who will speak on this bill next, will state his views. Are you prepared to stop this process of giving the Noel Pearsons and a few others total control of all Aboriginal assets, or are you prepared to make a commitment and give priority to ordinary Aboriginal people-the people I referred to with those farms? Let them have the farms. If you cannot buy them the tractors, they can mortgage the farms and go and buy some machinery themselves. They are a good group. It is amazing what they have done. They diversified and brought in white sharefarmers. They are using the money saved from that measure to buy sheep and to graze the stubble. Our amendments are not trickery. They are a request that you do something for Aboriginal people at the bottom of the pile-to give the Arnold Franks, the genuine elders, rights to some of their land; to ensure that those people who have become urban Aboriginals can get some of this money. We were told that those who had their native title rights extinguished would be the ones looked after. That is no longer the case, and we are back to arguing how we will deal with pastoral property. There are so many examples where pastoral property already provided has not been the panacea; it has not worked. People have walked away from such properties. They did not want them. They wanted to be urban Aboriginals. (Time expired)",41
23,Mr HOLDING,MARTIN FERGUSON,"Probably the oldest, continuing social problem in Australian society is the inequitable treatment of our indigenous people. Over the last two decades, following the Woodward commission and the introduction of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act by the Fraser government, the findings of that commission have largely been acted upon and provide the basis upon which a great deal of land has gone back to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. However, with the defeat of the Fraser government, the coalition position on the rights of our indigenous people has been subject to continuous pressure from state leaders who have made no secret of the fact that they are fundamentally opposed to any concept of land rights. The most obvious example of that opposition was in Western Australia when the Burke government introduced a very moderate form of land rights which, at the time. I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I believed did not go far enough. It was defeated by a Liberal-National Party coalition in the upper house. The then state Leader of the Liberal Party, Bill Hassell, made his position absolutely clear-he was opposed to the concept of land rights per se. In my own state of Victoria, when a Labor government endeavoured to hand back a reserve at Framlingham, which Aboriginal people had lived on for many years, legislation was passed through the Legislative Assembly and again was defeated in the Legislative Council despite the fact that the precedent had been set by the former Bolte government when it returned Lake TyerS to the Aboriginal people. Again, it was necessary to pick up that legislation, bring it into this parliament and put it through-with the opposition voting against it because of so called states rights. Part of the problem with the coalition-and it is evident in the way it has drafted the amendments here-is that it has great difficulty reconciling some of the things it says in this House when opposing the propositions which emerge quite clearly from its state leaders and its state bodies. It does not make any secret of the fact that it is opposed fundamentally to the whole question of Aboriginal people having a right to acquire land under any form of land rights legislation be it state or Commonwealth. It was therefore not surprising that when Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) visited Western Australia he did not find it difficult to adopt some of the attitudes of Premier Court, and he made continuous and hysterical outbursts directed at the High Court, the highest judicial body in this land. At the state Liberal conference, and given the heady pressures that permeated the atmosphere, the new leader undoubtedly felt the need to be strong, true and brave. He had no difficulties when he threatened, to the applause of the assembled rednecks, that if he won the next election they could rely on him to tear up the Native Title Act. The less said about the Leader of the Opposition's sojourn to the Northern Territory the better. I do not understand how any member of this House since 1984 could not comprehend the position of his political cohorts in the Northern Territory on the issue of Aboriginal people's right to veto under the land rights act. The Leader of the Opposition indicated, and everybody knows it, his lack of capacity to address the range of political assertions and attitudes of his own coalition members. He retreated into silence. I do not want to stand here today and say that every member of the coalition is without sympathy, without understanding or without compassion for Aboriginal people, because I do not believe that is true. Mr Halverson-It isn't.",42
24,Mr HOLDING,MARTIN FERGUSON,"I am just saying it is not. This legislation, which is quite specific and part of a package of legislation that deals with a whole range of issues going to the betterment of Aboriginal people, flows out of the principles of reconciliation, flows out of the thrust of the Mabo decision, flows out of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The big difference between the government and the opposition is that before this legislation was introduced into the parliament we had long and meaningful consultation with Aboriginal people about their perspective of the legislation. It is all very well for this schoolboy Leader of the Opposition to get up and say to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), 'Why don't you the go there?' The fact is, the Prime Minister has spent more hours in consultation with Aboriginal people on these issues than the Leader of the Opposition has spent in the Northern Territory. That is the reality. The Prime Minister, as former Treasurer, showed an enonnous sympathy for the arguments in cabinet of his ministers for Aboriginal affairs, and all his ministers have spent much of their lives visiting Aboriginal communities throughout Australia. I find it interesting that the Leader of the Opposition did not choose to seek the advice of former ministers like Viner and Chaney, who were two out on the question of the native title legislation, before he went to Western Australian conference. I do not agree with the position of the Northern Territory government on vet os, but there has been very real change both within the attitudes of Aboriginal people and within sections of the mining industry towards how mining Aboriginal land is developed. The Northern Territory government is aware of that. It obvious that the Leader of the Opposition was not concerned to seek the advice. He thorproposing oughly misunderstood the provisions of the act and after he came back was told by Mr Perron that he would be only too happy to give him a few lessons. How did we get to the situation we are now in? We are not told by the Leader of the Opposition-who walks into this House with a record of not even comprehending the issues- 'We would like a bit of time to down and confer with Aboriginal people.' How much discussion was had between the relevant coalition policy committee and the Aboriginal people in order to seek their views in respect of this legislation? That is the difference. This legislation, and no-one says any piece of legislation in this area is perfect, involved hours of discussion and negotiation with elected Aboriginal leaders to seek their perception of what they believe their people need and want-and what we get from the opposition is a series of amendments. 'Oh, yes,' says the Leader of the Opposition, 'we'll vote for this legislation if you accept our amendments in to to dealing with health, housing and education.' 'What is wrong with that?' he says. I will tell you what is wrong with it. There is enonnous diversity in the quality of housing, the quality of education and the quality of health for Aboriginal people both within states and between states. The reality is that the administration of those areas is essentially the responsibility of state governments. When dealing with housing, as it is a state matter, they insist that Commonwealth funds flow and then they will organise Aboriginal housing. There are some exceptions to that. Aboriginal people have, in many parts of Australia, their own health services. Why did they want the them set up? Because the level of service they were getting through state administrations was totally inadequate for their needs. Time does a not permit me to go into the history of that. This is a land bill and the purpose of the fund is to acquire land for Aboriginal people on who cannot succeed under the concepts enunciated by the High Court because they was have been severely dispossessed. The funds are not all that extensive. The opposition is that we dilute those funds. Those opposite say, 'We don't want to know about other funds or other legislation which might be relevant in these areas of education, housing and health. We insist that when you look at the question of land, you look at the question of health, housing and education.' That sounds all right if we applied those standards to everybody in Western Australia sit or the Northern Territory who was a land developer. Do we say to a land developer who is using private funds, 'Before you even acquire the land, let alone develop it, we have to be satisfied that the land is in close proximity to a school, which will deal with the problems of children, and that there is a level of medical service clearly and demonstrably has available'? Of course we do not. All of a sudden we have these confected amendments. I do not have any problem with the opposition saying that it wants proper accountability of these funds. No Aboriginal person will object to that; ATSIC will not object to that; the government will not object to that. Public moneys have to be accounted for. I do not even object to the opposition saying that it is concerned about the issues of education, housing and health. We all ought to be concerned about them. But if opposition members were being honest they would say that they are concerned about these factors; they would not make them a condition of their support for this legislation. No member of the opposition will get up in this parliament and say, 'We took a lot of time off. We spoke to Aboriginal people. We are a coalition that does not have any problem at all' - as is its right and its duty- 'with talking to farming or mining groups about legislation which affects them or with talking to any group in Australian society which feels it can be adversely affected or positively assisted by legislation.' The opposition should get up in this House and tell us how it communicated with Aboriginal people and what sort of support and response it got from Aboriginal people for these amendments. It cannot do so. The reason it cannot is that, at the end of the day, these amendments were not designed to represent genuine concerns. The amendments were designed to resolve the internal problems that this coalition is faced with. Liberal Party has prominent state leaders saying that they will not have a bar of land going to Aboriginal pe6ple. When a former leader, who once said he was the conscience of the party, was being sacked, the party should have confected a series of amendments and said, 'These amendments represent our genuine concern, and you have to pick up all of them. If you don't adopt all of them, we are going to vote against the legislation.' way it would have been safe. The moderates in the party could have said, 'Yes, our heart bleeds on these issues.' Those from the Right could have said, 'We know what is going to happen. We will vote against it.' They would have voted against it because the government would not pick up these amendments. The government's position, having consulted with Aboriginal people, has produced legislation that they see as relevant to their needs. Unfortunately, what we have here is a political exercise on an issue that goes to the whole question of social equality and justice in our community. The Leader of the Opposition, who wants to be strong, true and brave-an overgrown boy scout who has enough innate decency to wear long trousers-comes into this parliament and says, 'We have these great amendments which solve our political problems. It may do something for Aboriginal people but, if you do not accept them, we are going to vote against the legislation.' It is a gutless and dishonest political performance. He knows, if we were to accept them, that the fund being created for land purchase could be corrupted to a point where it conferred no real benefit on Aboriginal people. The challenge that this parliament has to face up to sooner or later is whether we are going to stand committed to the rights of Aboriginal people-not merely to own their land but to take their place in Australian society. There are people throughout the length and breadth of Australia who are committed to seeing progress being made in this area. I would like to think those political leaders The in Western Australia-with the hassles in the courts-who do not make any apology for their position, represent a minority of the political leadership of the coalition. The only way in which they will become a minority is if this coalition is prepared to take some principled stand, to do some work, and to not come into this House, on a piece of legislation which is of major importance to Aboriginal people, with confected amendments which That are designed essentially to solve the coalition's own internal problems, which gravely distort the purpose of the legislation and which involve a gross breach of trust, which all members of this Commonwealth parliament should have for the rights of our indigenous people.",43
25,Mr MCGAURAN,MARTIN FERGUSON,"So that is it? Four and a half years as a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and all the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) can offer this parliament and the nation is 20 minutes of vitriolic political point scoring and rhetoric. That has been a measure of his stewardship of that portfolio and that of his successors. There were no special insights and no new suggestions as to how we might materially benefit our disadvantaged indigenous people. Instead, he just engaged in personality politics.",45
26,Mr HOLDING,MARTIN FERGUSON,Tell us who you conferred with.,46
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MARTIN FERGUSON,Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member for Melbourne Ports will cease interjecting.,46
28,Mr MCGAURAN,MARTIN FERGUSON,"He completely ignored the real issues that concern our Aboriginal people. All he did was try. t? brush over .hi.s involvement as a former MinIster for Abonglnal Affairs and that of those who followed him. Who could ever forget what happened a few weeks ago when Gerry Hand, the honourable member's successor as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, was asked on the Sunday program why the poverty and the despair continue unabated? He choked on his words, put up his hands and said, 'I don't know the answers.' After 11 years, the government cannot do anything except attack the opposition and engage in cynical political debate. We have put up amendments which the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) rejected out of hand before even seeing them; yet they called for a bipartisan approach. The bipartisan approach the government wants is for us to agree with the legislation without qualification and unquestioningly. The Prime Minister's idea of bipartisanship is total agreement-not in any way a constructive dialogue where agreements can be reached, but instead just total agreement with what the government puts up. The former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs does not want to talk about housing, health, education or employment for Aboriginal people. In fact, he made the extraordinary statement, which the Hansard will preserve for posterity-that housing, health and education were the responsibility of the state governments. So why do we have a federal minister for housing? Why do we have a federal minister for health? Why do we have a federal minister for education? Why in that case do we even have a minister for Aboriginal affairs? The government knows very well that a large amount of Commonwealth funding, ATSIC funding, is directed exactly towards these areas of concern. Indeed, many of the grants to the state governments are tied. That the government would wash its hands, saying, 'All we need to talk about is land, not housing, health or education because they are state government responsibilities,' is remarkable, particularly as the government attacks us for believing that land management is the responsibility of the state governments. No, the government does not want to discuss these hard issues because its record after 11 years is shameful. It thinks that the granting of land is the panacea. It is not. The member for Melbourne Ports also accuses the opposition of not talking to Aboriginal representatives. That is demonstrably wrong. But, even more importantly, the majority of Aboriginal people are within electorates represented by the National and Liberal parties. We live and speak with these people in our own communities. For me it is East Gippsland. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and others speak constantly with their Aboriginal constituents. It is not enough-whatever field of government administration is involved-to talk to the lobbyists or those with set political agendas; you have to talk to local communities. Consequently, our views and policies are formed more directly by the people concerned than by those who are feeding off the Aboriginal affairs industry. And make no mistake: there is a whole level of self-interested individuals and bureaucrats who are manipulating Aboriginal affairs for their own purposes, whether they be purely individual or collectively political. If I take advice just from the representative of the land councils or ATSIC I will not be properly representing the views of Aboriginal people. You have to travel to the Kimberley, Cape York and the Northern Territory, western New South Wales, western Queensland and South Australia to properly understand what concerns Aboriginal communities on a day-today basis. Land is important. The opposition knows that to be so. The Leader ?f the Opposition (Mr Downer) reiterated that In his address yesterday. For that reason, coalition governments at a state level have previously been involved with the establishment and administration of land funds. The coalition welcomes the legislation before the House. We simply want to make more accountable and more focused. The amendments we propose will refocus the the legislation to address the health, housing, education and economic opportunities of Aboriginal people. We could have a sensible, rational debate but, instead, the government, knowing that its 11 years in office has not alleviated the poverty and problems in so overcome. many Aboriginal communities throughout different parts of Australia, just wants to appease the many white consciences who do not want to be troubled or bothered facing up to the real issues. The real issues are the health, housing, education, employment and economic opportunities for our indigenous people. We have to address these key issues. You can do that in conjunction with the buying of land and the establishment of the land fund. The Liberal and National parties recognised are. the High Court decision on Mabo from the outset and accepted it. We supported the retention of the Racial Discrimination Act. But we believe that under the constitution land management is a state responsibility. have continued to stand for Aboriginal rights to land, but not in isolation of the issues affect the living conditions and future hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal people. We have to recognise that states have the constitutional responsibility for land management. There a need for this to be maintained because Commonwealth takeover is simply impractities cal, leaving aside the questions of constitueven tional law. The states together grant more than 50,000 titles a year. The Commonwealth is in position to do that. There must be, in regard to the native title legislation, a cooperative arrangement with the states, which the Minister sought briefly but then abandoned when it meant that he had to acknowledge the simple point that the states have responsibility for land management. Returning to the ATSIC Amendment (Inhave digenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, it has been said by many, not least of and most recently by the President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Brendan Nelson, that land is tied to the health of it Aboriginal communities. I wish it were that simple. The evidence accumulated shows that worse infant mortality rates, the highest rates of disease and the highest mortality rates are centred on the more remote Aboriginal communities. Land is not the only determinant of the health of Aboriginal people. If it were that easy, the problem would be easily This question of remoteness is one that we have to face up to. The problem with discussing all the different and sometimes related issues of Aboriginal affairs is that there is no objectivity. There are just too many people with a vested interest in preserving their own position or their own prejudices. Consequently we cannot discuss things like remoteness. The further Aborigines are removed from basic infrastructure such as schooling, water, sewerage or health clinics, the more vulnerable they I worry as I travel throughout northern parts of Australia that small communities, often of no more than a dozen or two dozen people, are living in appalling conditions because We local authorities or ATSIC simply cannot provide the infrastructure. You cannot provide that the roads and the power and the water to every community which wants to live in its own remote location. We have to face up to issues like remoteness but we cannot, because is otherwise we are accused of mainstreaminga 'You want to integrate Aboriginal communiwith larger Aboriginal communities or with white communities.' That is not the case at all. I am very pessimistic about whether we can no improve health and education for many Aboriginal communities, because they live in places so distant from where those facilities Prime are provided. One cannot, for example, prescribe that a community of 12 has to live within 100 kilometres of Alice Springs: that is not my suggestion at all. I have tried in the past to discuss this issue of remoteness and been shouted down. That is just one small example of how hard it is to discuss all such issues on a rational basis. It seems all too often that, if you mouth the cliches and make the promises, you win the support of the Aboriginal affairs industry-and, sadly, of most of the media. When it all boils down, the fact is that urban white consciences do not want to be bothered with Aboriginal problems. Why else would white Australia, particularly along the eastern coast, have allowed the scandal of the waste of money on a massive scale to continue for so long, unchecked? There is simply not enough accountability across the board. I am afraid that I have come to the conclusion that one can very easily play this game to win electoral support, because of an obliging media and an uninterested white Australia which does not want to be told of the depth of the problems. 'Throw money at the problem and do not bother us. Throw land at the problem and do not bother us.' The problem is, firstly, that this is not materially benefiting our indigenous people; and, secondly, it is dividing those parts of Australia that are directly concerned. Let us not beat about the bush: if one travels the Kimberley or northern Queensland, or some of the towns of western New South Wales, one will see the mutual hatreds and the divisions. I do not want to paint too dismal a picture of Aboriginal affairs, because of course there have been tremendous improvements, and individual as well as community successes. I know that fact from East Gippsland, where we have very harmonious and mutually beneficial relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities. But such things are all relative, and the situation is that since 1967, when a Liberal and National Party government introduced the referendum to give Aboriginal people a vote, simply not enough progress has been made. Is it such a crime for us on the opposition benches to want the rate of progress to accelerate, and for us to be totally dissatisfied with what we see with our own eyes, as well as with what Aboriginal people tell us to our faces? The opposition amendments will genuinely attempt to improve the situation and will be worthy of the utmost serious consideration by the government, rather than the out-of-hand rejection that we have seen over the last 24 hours. In drawing to a conclusion, I say that there are many issues and problems that we as a parliament have to address. We are not going to begin to address them as long as we pretend there are simple, single solutions such as land rights, and we certainly will not make any progress as long as Aboriginal affairs remain probably the most partisan issue that comes before this parliament. I ask the government to acknowledge that unacceptable progress has been made on the issues of housing, health, education and employment. Once the government acknowledges that, then that should lead it to consider the amendments that the opposition intends to propose. We put them forward in a genuine attempt to try to bridge some of the gaps that exist within this parliament and that exist in the communities where Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people live together. As far as I am concerned, you can forget Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and even Adelaide. I am afraid the non-Aboriginal populations of those cities have largely shown themselves to be quite uninterested in this issue. Sure, you will find the occasional letter to the Age or the Sydney Morning Herald, but there is no serious analysis, because those people are not confronted on a daily basis with the issues of land and social harmony. But I do not think we can allow the gap in living standards and in social interaction in the Pilbara, Cape York and the Northern Territory to widen any more. There is an enormous responsibility on every member of this House to face up to the problems and to address them. The opposition can raise the issues and we can make the important points, but in the end the responsibility rests with the government. As long as the government wants to play political games because it wants to justify its 11 years of managing Aboriginal affairs, the losers will be our indigenous people.",46
29,Mr HORNE,MARTIN FERGUSON,"I did not intend to speak on this bill, the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. The government's support of, and commitment to, Aboriginal land ownership are well documented and well conveyed to the community. One could surely be forgiven if, after reading the papers earlier this week, one felt that the newly converted Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) was going to listen to the moderates in his own party and display some of that bipartisan goodwill that he so emotionally called for yesterday. I feel compelled to speak because the debate to date not only shows a divided opposition but reveals its complete lack of understanding of what land ownership means to Aboriginal people. A couple of weeks ago it appeared that the well-known conversion of Saul, or Paul, on the road to Damascus had paled into insignificance by comparison with the conversion of the Leader of the Opposition on the road to Kintore or Utopia. There was a major difference, though: after a period of time the scales feIl off Paul's eyes and he could see. It would appear the scales have yet to faIl off the eyes of the Leader of the Opposition. I mentioned that the opposition was divided. Let us have a look at the Hansard of yesterday to see what the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), had to say about land ownership: Therefore land purchased is to keep the title of freehold or leasehold under which it is purchased ... To do otherwise is to treat Aboriginal people as if they were different or inadequate in the area of land ownership. She went on to talk about land ownership by families, individuals and partnerships, with never a consideration for traditional land ownership patterns of Aboriginal people. Compare the shadow minister's statement with that of her leader. Again I quote from yesterday's Hansard: Secondly, we recognise that at present much of the land held by indigenous people is underused. The land management section of the bill must be strengthened and enhanced so as to the development of land which is underutilised. So on the one hand we have the shadow minister saying that Aboriginal people must be treated exactly the same as everyone else, but on the other we have her leader saying that we need to pass a judgment on how they use their land or they will not get any more. Of course, in doing so he is denying one of the great tenets of the Liberal Party, and that is freedom of choice. That is the crux of the problem. The opposition simply does not understand what land means to Aboriginal people or what the concept of land ownership is all about. They can measure it only by European standards, and they have been doing that for 200 years. To members of the opposition, a piece of land is what it can produce: what can be grown on it and cut down on it and sold as woodchip; what can be dug up from underneath it, maybe uranium or coal or iron ore, and produce export earnings; or what houses can be built on it to put people in. They never consider how Aboriginal people have traditionally looked at the land. Let us consider more carefully what the Leader of the Opposition had to say, because it is very interesting, especially when his shadow minister is saying that Aboriginal people must be treated the same as everyone else. I ask the opposition how it can defend some of its mates who have vast tracts of underutiIised land. The opposition should go to them and say, 'You are underutilising that land, buddy. You cannot sit on it and pass it on from generation to generation, and one day maybe develop it and put a casino on it-if only we can find a straight licensee.' This debate has degenerated into two approaches. On the one hand, there are statements of support and understanding by government members. On the other hand, there are statements that renect a complete lack of understanding by the opposition, which is trying to thread a tortuous path by looking after the various people with interests in land ownership. The opposition tactics concerning this bill can be seen only as a device to disguise the coalition's unwillingness to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people give priority to access to their land. At this stage I would like to relate a couple of my own experiences. In my electorate I have five different tribal groups. A couple of weeks ago I attended a demonstration. A local government area is attempting to develop a piece of land that the Aboriginal women of the area claim is a traditional Aboriginal birthing site. That is very important to their tradition. The local council cannot see it. It wants to develop this piece of land, which is completely covered by trees that are possibly 200 years old. Some of them were probably there at the time the First Fleet landed in Botany Bay. However, al1 the council can see is that by bul1dozing that land and fi11ing it with up to two metres of sand it can probably make a $1.6 mi11ion profit. The council cannot understand the Aboriginal point of view. I think that is the stalemate that we have reached here today. The opposition keeps measuring the value of land in dol1ars and cents. We keep measuring its value to Aboriginal culture. I disagree with the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran). I am sure that the message is getting out to white Australia. I am sure that there are mi11ions of white Australians who understand exactly what land means to Aboriginal people in a traditional sense. Opposition members are reluctant to talk about history and the way in which AborigiNoel nal people were deprived of their cause there are many stories that real1y are disgrace. I was on Fraser Island a couple of weeks ago with the House of Representatives people Standing Committee on the Environment, ant to Recreation and the Arts. While we were has having a look over the island with a guide, to date ... we went to a place that is cal1ed Central Station, where in the past there had been a massive sawmi11ing operation. A few artefacts of the logging history of Fraser Island are display there. My wife asked the guide, 'What about the Aboriginal population on the island?' He said, 'There aren't any. There used to be. Fraser Island once had the greatest density of Aboriginal population of Australia. Today, not a single Aborigine lives on Fraser Island.' So the guide was asked, 'What happened to the Aborigines?' He said, 'When they started logging, it was inconvenient to have them here, so they were phased out.' The 'phasing out' of Aborigines has only occurred on Fraser Island; it has occurand red everywhere. On the way home in the a plane, I read what 'phasing out' of Aborigines on Fraser Island meant. It meant bringing Europeanised Aborigines onto the island and paying them as policemen. Riding on horseback, they drove the Aborigines into the surf, where they drowned or were taken by sharks. In the end, for the cause of white settlement and the exploitation of the magnificent timber reserves on that island, there was no opposition; there were very few Aborigines and they were relocated to missions. That is a story that can be repeated al1 over Australia, and that is what this legislation is about. That is what is misunderstood. How can you pay for that sort of treatment of a noble race of people that were simply 'phased out' because they did not understand our way or because we did not make any attempt to understand theirs? I appeal to the opposition for goodness sake to get its act together and try to understand what it is al1 about, because the arguments it has used to date certainly indicate that it does not understand. I wi11 conclude with the statement that was made by Noel Pearson this morning on AM. Pearson is the executive director of Cape land beYork Land Council. He said: a What's got to be understood is people love that land; they love those rocks and the stunted mulga; cry for that country. It's spiritually importpeople, and that's an understanding that I see failed to reach the minds of the Liberal Party Either the opposition supports this legislation or, to the everlasting disgust of the people of Australia, it wi11 go down in history as a party on that failed to come to terms with the facts as they are, with the history of this nation and with the shame that we continue to hide. But Aboriginal people of Australia must have justice and, proudly, this government wi11 in the whole make sure they get it.",48
30,Mr BRADFORD,MARTIN FERGUSON,"Discussions and debates in this place on Aboriginal affairs arouse more emotion and passion than our debates and discussions on almost any other issue. Our debate today, continuing from yesterday, on the ATSIC not Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation Land Fund) Bi11 is very much central to discussion of Aboriginal affairs. It has been an emotional and passionate debate on both sides. I reject total1y the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Paterson (Mr Home), in relation to the part being played by those on this side of the House in this debate. I reject the suggestion that he has made that we do not understand or do not care. I believe that our contributions to this debate have illustrated to the contrary, and I hope that my contribution will do likewise. Australia today is multicultural and diverse. Unfortunately, many-if not most-Australians are unsympathetic to Aborigines. Most Australians, I suspect, do not really understand them. Their causes-many of them justifiable-have often been misrepresented or damaged by well-meaning non-Aborigines and the radical very few part-Aborigines who set themselves up as spokesmen for Aboriginal concerns. The fact is that, as some of our speakers said yesterday and as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the opposition spokesman on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs-the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus)-have suggested, this government has used Aborigines as a political football. The way it has approached the debate on this particular legislation is a further glaring example of that. The government is led by the most divisive Prime Minister in our history. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) divides consciously, determinately, with every word he utters. For his own base political purposes, he has set out to divide Australians on many issues. The divisiveness of the Prime Minister in this debate has harmed the process of reconciliation. For any other leader, bipartisanship would have been a priority in this matter, but this Prime Minister does not understand the meaning of that word. He has come up through that school of politics which does not take prisoners, and he knows only one way of operating, which is confrontation. I believe the opposition is committed to addressing the real needs of Aborigines. Already in this debate the Leader of the Opposition has provided poignant evidence of the extent of the Aborigines' disadvantage in health and education relative to other Australians. The statistics the Leader of the Opposition put before the parliament yesterday tell a very sad story about Aboriginal health. The statistics are a disgrace to all Australians. They speak volumes about what has been achieved by this government over the past 11 years. Its record is indefensible. It is a record of failure; it is a record of words but no action; it is a record of waste and misuse of taxpayers' money. It is no wonder that most Australians are confused about the images they have of Aborigines when they visit Central Australia or north-west Australia or when they see Aborigines on television. They see people living in disgraceful conditions, often under the influence of alcohol, despite the billions of doJlars which have been given to them in welfare payments. Naturally, people wonder where alI this money has gone. This government's solution to most problems has been to throw taxpayers' money at them, and its treatment of Aborigines has been no different. The latest in this saga of hollow rhetoric is the land acquisition and land fund bill, which follows the Native Title Act-the government's response to the High Court's Mabo decision. Much has been said in this debate about how the Native Title Act has failedother than symbolically-to do anything in practice to assist Aborigines. This government and the Prime Minister in particular, however, are really about symbolism. The government has made a fine art of tokenism. The whole concept of native title has caused enormous disruption to Australia's mining, rural and tourism industries. It has cost Australia a huge amount in lost investment dollars. It would be difficult to quantify the amount involved, but it represents an indirect cost to all Australians. Now we have yet another cost which will be imposed-an interim $200 million, with a further $121 million, indexed, to be allocated over the following nine years. Non-Aboriginal Australians may wonder why. Will this money actually achieve any real objective, or will it be yet again misdirected or wasted? This is an entirely reasonable question for Australian taxpayers to ask. This is not the government's money which it is attempting to spend and will spend if this legislation goes through; it is taxpayers' money. Already in this debate there has been considerable discussion about Aboriginal attachment to the land. The point has been made, very correctly, that we all have in one way or another an attachment to land. However, it has been pointed out-and even the previous speaker, the honourable member for Paterson, made the point again-that the Aboriginal attachment to land is a spiritual attachment. Aboriginal beliefs are traditionally animistic. Many have become Christians, despite some of the very poor examples of Christian love and charity they have experienced over the years. This does not mean, however, that those who become Christians have turned their backs on their culture; quite the contrary. They have refocused their spirituality. I believe that God respects their culture, and so should we. Ultimately, all of us are uniquely related to the land. We came from it and physically we shall return to it, as ashes to ashes and dust to dust. The amendments that the opposition will propose to this bill are intended to focus attention on the real needs of Aboriginal people. They are intended to give the government an opportunity to demonstrate its bona fides in Aboriginal affairs. The opposition is committed to the process of reconciliation. We have made that perfectly clear on many occasions. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition recounted the circumstances through which negotiations were carried on between his predecessor and the former Prime Minister to arrive at a bipartisan approach to the process of reconciliation, or indeed to the concept of reconciliation in the first instance. Unfortunately, the whole process of reconciliation has been misunderstood by the majority of Australians, who see no need to apologise for what happened 200 years ago. The fact of this misunderstanding is, once again, the fault of this government, which has relied on propaganda and politics rather than education to bring about true bipartisan support for this process of reconciliation. Reconciliation may yet take another hundred years. I believe that today's Australians need to be convinced that we have a responsibility to redress the wrongs of displacement and dispersion which occurred 200 years ago. It is not an easy concept for many of today's Australians to grasp. It is, however, an entirely Christian response to espouse reconciliation. Aborigines have been marginalised and have lost their sense of identity. We should be compassionate and understanding of their present situation. I do not think anybody pretends that there have not been faults on both sides. I think in the end only a minority of Aborigines seek compensation-whatever that means. Most, I believe, understand that they must take responsibility for their own destiny. They indicate, when they have an opportunity to do so, that that is what they want to do. In many communities a new and younger generation of Aborigines is doing this. They want to break out of the trap which handouts have caught them in. Like many Australians, Aborigines have huge problems with alcoholism. They also want to address that problem for themselves. We should not underestimate the contributions that Aboriginal Australians have made to this country, in art, in sport and in public service. Most Aborigines want to be good Australians. Some fought for this country in war alongside other Australians who were their mates. So land per se is not the answer to Aborigines' problems. It has been clearly demonstrated in this debate-and as far as I can tell it has not been refuted from the government side-that this has been the case in states where Aborigines already have land. Possession of land per se has not addressed the core problems of health and education that Aborigines experience in the disadvantaged state in which they live. To give Aborigines land may be symbolic-and that is part of the government's intention-but our priority ought to be to address their disadvantages. They are disadvantaged Australians. There can be no more excuses for this. We have had 11 years of excuses. Now is the time for action. We are tired of this government's use of Aboriginal affairs to play politics. Let us see something real and tangible. It is now time for the government to illustrate clearly, to us and to the Australian people, its bona fides by entering into a process of giving serious considerations to the amendments that we propose to this legislation, which will give the legislation the effect that it really ought to have. The ball is now in the government's court, and all Australia is watching to see how the government plays it.",50
31,Mr LLOYD,MARTIN FERGUSON,"The public perception of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill and the larger legislation which predates it-the native title legislation-is that it will have an impact only in the more remote areas of Australia such as western Queensland and western New South Wales and that there is far greater support in urban Australia for these government initiatives than there is in rural and regional Australia. People in urban Australia are living secure in their minds that there will be none of the disruptions to their lives or their activities which are now engulfing much of regional and rural and remote Australia, caused by the uncertainty that is being created by these two pieces of legislation. I hope that urban Australia is also engulfed and that there are claims in the major regional cities and the capital cities of this country. Urban people may then start to have some understanding of what this means right now in rural and regional Australia. There is also a perception that it is only Aboriginal people who have a mystical, symbolic or religious attachment to the land, and that this can stay with them, even after they have spent several generations in suburbia. As an Anglo-Celtic, fifth generation farmer, I say that that is a wrong perception. It is our fault, as Anglo-Celtic rural people, that we have never expressed it. It is a different feeling to that which people might have in relation to the security of their own home or affection for their neighbourhood. It relates to the soil, to the trees, to and fauna, to the growing of things. It is mystical and emotional, and it has a tremendous impact on those people who are a part of it. It is only rural people who can understand that. They can understand the Aboriginal attachment, and I would hope that Aborigines and others can also understand their attachment. It is a great worry to me. When we talk about historic dispossession in relation to this legislation, we should also be thinking of dispossession of land-holders affected by claims, of land-holders affected by drought, and so forth. But this public perception that it is only going to happen in the more remote areas has already been proven wrong in Victoria. The Yorta-Yorta claim, the fourth under the native title legislation for Australia, has already been approved in principle, and that claim covers quite a percentage of my electorate in northern Victoria. The registrations of interest closed two days ago, and the next stage begins next month: the mediation process which will then determine whether or not appeals are made to the court. The primary claim, which has been accepted in principle by the tribunal, covers over 1,000 square kilometres. There is a secondary claim for compensation which covers many thousands of square kilometres. I have indicated that the claim is mainly in my electorate, but it also covers elements of the Indi, MCEwen and Farrer electorates as well. The claim covers the Murray River from Rutherglen to Koondrook and the red gum forests-the largest and most significant red gum forests in Australia-on both sides of the river. It covers the Goulburn River upstream to Murchison, and other rivers in north-eastern Victoria. It covers all crown land within the larger area with the exception of the state agricultural research farms, which were subsequently deleted. There are over 150 separate claims. Many of these are for river frontage grazing, but there is also a significant percentage covering local sports grounds, recreation parks, and nature and walking trails belonging to the communities-because those public facilities the flora are almost always on crown land and are usually close to the river. So we are talking about local government capital in these facilities, amounting to millions of dollars, being subject to the primary claim. The overall impact is one of confusion, uncertainty and resentment, and that is not just confined to white people either. There is considerable resentment from Aboriginal people too, and I will refer to that fact later. I want to concentrate on this impact and make some positive suggestions to help for the future. I have already made some of these suggestions to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and to one of the senior advisers to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). I commend Minister Tickner for the trouble he went to, before he left for overseas, to make contact with me. I acknowledge that my area is one of the first claims, so hopefully some of the confusion will abate in the future as more claims are worked through. I also acknowledge that tribunal members attended two meetings in the area but, unfortunately, the result of their visits was to add to the confusion and the uncertainty, because they themselves-and I do not say this as a criticismdo not appear to know exactly what is going to happen and how. My first suggestion concerns the question of criteria for initial or in-principle approval for a claim. I believe the approval is too automatic: there is no ability to challenge by anyone at that stage; no information or detail is available to anyone at that stage from the tribunal-as I was told on several occasions after making phone calls-and there is certainly nothing available from the applicants. Let me put it another way: in my case, the applicants themselves did not give any information, because they were under instructions from their solicitors not to do so. This is an area that definitely needs amendment, and I hope that it is one that is being considered, because we are adding to the confusion and the uncertainty and the feeling of unfairness at the first stage of the process. My second suggestion is related to this, and it is more general. No-one has any ordinary ability to see the detail of the claims at any time. There is no publicity to clarify the procedures, and there are no information pamphlets available to anyone to explain what is happening and how. In the case of the Yorta-Yorta claim, the only detail was available from the Perth office. It was not available from Melbourne and not available locally. The only official publicity at any stage was two small advertisements in two local papers relating to the closing date for registration of interest if a group wanted to be included in the mediation process. The only way to obtain that information, through which any person could find out whether or not they would be affected, was to pay $270 for those details to be sent from Perth. I obtained two, one for my office in Shepparton and one in association with my state colleague, Noel Maughan, and his office in Echuca. The one that was sent was so poor that if it was going to last any time at all it had to be laminated, so there was an additional cost for that. As I indicated earlier, the Yorta-Yorta were not saying anything. They were sending everybody around to my office. Some of them also came around to have a look for themselves. That was fair enough in that case. However, in total it is a most unfair, unjust and inequitable situation, which just adds to the uncertainty and the confusion. That is irrespective of whether you are for the legislation or against the legislation. If it were a state planning process, the person with the application would have to provide details of what that would mean in a number of places. Surely, the same should apply here. As a minimum, the tribunal should be instructed by the government and the facilities made available for them to do so, to provide in each local government area, in a claimed situation, a copy of the details, so there is fairness and justice for everybody and so some of this confusion and uncertainty can be reduced. The next point is the role of the states. In the case of Victoria, it was ill prepared and of no help. I do not make that statement in relation to whether the state is for or against the legislation, but most of the claim, of course, is on state crown land. There are not adequate records. I will give you one example. A constituent came to see me concerning a lease that that person has on some river frontage. On checking with the state department on how many years that lease had been available for the point of continuous association, that person was advised there were no records available. He was sent a copy of the original title, which goes back to pre-Torrens days. It is a pre-emptive right, which actually goes into the middle of the river, which was part of the claim situation. That then raises the interesting question: if it is a pre-emptive freehold title, how can the state be requiring a lease fee? So the states themselves have got a lot of sorting out to do. I refer again to the Barrnah State Forest and the Murray River in that area, which is now quite a significant tourist area with boat operators, tour operators and so forth, and logging and grazing. Al1 of the leasing has been put in abeyance, so there is complete confusion as to what they can do at this stage. The state obviously had not done any homework on that either. The state of Victoria has to recognise that it is involved in this situation and it wi11 have to do some homework with regard to its records and procedures. The other request that I made to the two ministers, and which I make to the government today, is that equal assistance be given to those affected by the claim as is given to the applicant. That does not just mean the affected land-holders, but it also means other Aboriginal groups. I give the example of my area. The Yorta-Yorta people have made the claim, but there are two other competing claims. The Bangerang people in particular have very strong historical and anthropological evidence that they real1y are the ones who should be making the claim and that, if a claim is granted, it should be to them. However, there is no legal aid available to the Bangerang people because under the Aboriginal legal aid arrangements evidently it was not considered that legal aid would be needed between two competing Aboriginal groups. So this group of people-and I do feel very sorry for the Bangerang-is getting no assistance whatsoever. These people do not know what to do, yet they are the strongest claimants to at least a section of that claim. That, in itself, is grossly unfair and unjust. So I appeal to the government-and to the minister here, as I have to two other ministers-that they should, irrespective of individual attitudes to either of these pieces legislation, help to clarify the procedures, reduce the confusion and uncertainty, and bring far more equity into the whole process. There needs to be a requirement that the details are available as a right in a reasonable number of places in a claim area. The detailed documents are nine inches to a foot highwhatever that is in metric. It is only by perusing those documents-in this case, the 150 claims-that people real1y have any idea of whether they are involved. I am making a genuine request for equity in this matter. The second request is that those who are affected or have a counterclaim against those who made the original claim have the same right to legal aid as the original claimants. That legal aid is provided at no cost to the original claimants but at considerable cost to the taxpayers. In particular, I refer to other Aboriginal groups who, at this stage, are being left in a most unfair and unjust situation.",53
32,Mr CADMAN,MARTIN FERGUSON,"Mitchel1) (1.47 p.m.)Like most members of this House, I have considered the legislation that the government indicated some time ago it was going to introduce. Today we are discussing the federal government's decision to provide about $1 billion for the acquisition of land by Aboriginal groups by means of a fairly centralised process, originating here in Canberra and affecting various Aboriginal groups. I was somewhat concerned about the government's decision and its response to the High Court decision on Mabo, so during the recess I spent a couple of weeks in northern Australia, basical1y living in Aboriginal communities and listening to what they had to say about their future and their prospects. I heard little discussion of land. I heard a lot about their concern about drug and alcohol abuse, about gambling abuse and about their concern for their young people. The government's decision to fund the purchase of land to such a huge extent deserves serious scrutiny, because this type of purchase has been going on in Australia for almost 20 years. We need to examine whether the land acquisition programs-instigated by the federal government and carried out, first of of all, in the Northern Territory-have produced the result it was claimed they would, and whether the government's intention is going to be well directed and successful or whether it needs to look again at whether Aboriginal problems in Australia are based on lack of opportunity to live on the land or whether they originate somewhere else. From my examination I am concerned that the government's commitment to the purchase of land seems to hinge more on who the government's friends are in the Aboriginal community and on whether the bureaucratic process the government has established is massaging its friends and the law firms. Is there real concern for the Aboriginal people? I have to be convinced that it is a matter of concern for the Aboriginal people that leads the government down this pathway. To the best of my ability, I have tried to fairly assess the situation. I would like to know whether the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) has travelled to, and lived with, Aboriginal communities to find out for himself. I do not believe he has. I believe he would react with a Pavlov style knee jerk and jump to whatever the executive of his party said. The parliamentary secretary has never stood up against his party and he is not going to start now. That is his record. Let us be tive about this thing and have a look at what the gains have been for the Aboriginal people. If you have a look at the land process for Aboriginal people, you can judge that over the last 20 years there has been no real gain and real advantage for the Aboriginal people. If you take objective measurements, the age standardised mortality rates or things like respiratory diseases, infectious diseases and circulatory system problems, you would have to say that is where the real problems are, there does not appear to be any change, despite the resources that have been put into land acquisition.",55
33,Mr LLOYD,MARTIN FERGUSON,No correlation.,56
34,Mr CADMAN,MARTIN FERGUSON,"There is no correlation at all. You would think that, if this is going to be the process of best assistance, there would be some benefit demonstrable over that period of 20 years, and there is not. So the government appears to be saying that it is more important for us to spend $1 billion in having Aboriginal people acquire land than to stop them dying. I cannot see what the value base of that sort of judgment can be. What the parliamentary secretary at the table is implying is that it is culturally more important to allow people to die than it is to take care of their health needs.",56
35,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MARTIN FERGUSON,What rubbish.,56
36,Mr CADMAN,MARTIN FERGUSON,"You can say that it is rubbish, but that is the fact of the matter. You have got 20 years demonstrated lack of change in health standards through land acquisition programs and you are going to pursue that further. I would like one day to have a look at who are the beneficiaries of the commissions paid, the legal fees that are in train. Who are the beneficiaries of all of the side benefits of some of this? It is a matter that concerns the whole community. If one speaks quietly to leaders in the Aboriginal community, what they say is, 'Look, we're not going to dump on somebody who is our friend'-or perhaps a relative-'but we too are concerned.' The remediation programs that are sponsored by the federal government for drug and alcohol abuse have to deal with cases that are active. A person has to be abusing alcohol or abusing drugs before objecfunding will take place. The preventive programs are non-existent. One cannot talk about preventive programs being funded for Aboriginal health. So the government's effort is completely misdirected. The government has been at this thing for 10 or 11 years and does not seem to have learned that it can assess things objectively, it can look at things fairly and it does not have to go to the totality of land acquisition as if it were some sort of mystical proand cess. There is an attachment to the land for the Aboriginal people, but evidently people in the Labor Party are prepared to say that that mystical attachment is more significant than preventing people from dying. The graphs on health are absolutely shocking, and it is obvious that nobody in the Labor Party has looked at the fact that the standardised mortality rates amongst Aboriginals in Amhem Land or Tennant Creek are four or five times that of the rest of the community. Why have you not looked at that? Fred Hollows was out there and he drew your attention to it. Until he started doing things that did not favour the government, until he failed to be politically correct with this government, it endorsed and canonised Fred Hollows. As soon as Fred started saying things that were critical of the government, started pointing out some of the facts of Aboriginal health, these people dumped Fred Hollows. You would not associate with him or take up the things that he was talking about. A comparison of the incidence of respiratime tory diseases amongst Aboriginal people the Darwin or Arnhem Land areas with the incidence Australia-wide shows that Aborigimore nal people are 10 times more likely to suffer from respiratory diseases. That has not changed despite the fact that about half Northern Territory is now inalienable land title held by Aboriginal people. The government's effort has not changed that. Infectious diseases are probably 10 or 20 times greater amongst Aboriginal people than they are in the general community. Even circulatory diseases-heart and related diseasthey es-which are supposed to be something of a problem of our modem lifestyle, are four five times worse in Aboriginal communities in northern Australia than they are amongst non-Aboriginal Australians. I am appealing to the government to get act together. It needs to get its facts right. believe that the opposition has done that. do not believe that the government can solve these problems. It cannot prove to us that is serious about dealing with Aboriginal problems of health and education-high mortality rates and infectious diseases. There health! are other things that we ought to be doing something about. However, the government cannot prove to us that its intention with this land fund brings it even close to the objective of dealing with the difficulties confronted by the Aboriginal communities of Australia. Aboriginal people themselves have some wonderful ideas about what governments years. should be doing. This is not about the acquisiout tion of land. If the government wants to do something about the Aboriginal regard and feeling for the land, why does it not do something about the homeless Aboriginal kids and try to get them up into areas where there is land? There is a place called Clump Mountainand I do not believe the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has ever been there-where homeless Aboriginal youth and children are brought into the rainforest environment. There, amongst their Aboriginal friends, they experience for the first time something of their heritage. That group is battling all the to get money, battling all the time to do in something for kids who are homeless. However, the government is just going to spend money on land. It does not care about the homeless kids. It does not care about Clump Mountain and the fact that the people of the there have not got enough funds to keep going. That does not worry the government. The government is unconcerned about such things. It just wants to buy the land, give the money, buy desert. It believes that people are going to be healthy if they are given desert to eat, that people are going to be better off if are put out in the saltbush and spinifex country and told to get well. The government or has got some amazing healing techniques and some real understanding of medical science! I think that the Fred Hollows of this world would tum in their graves if they understood its precisely what the government is doing. The I government's approach is to give Aboriginal We people sandhills and spinifex. That will make the Aboriginal people happy! That will give it them a spiritual home! That will solve their problems! That will get them jobs! That will get them education! That will get them The trouble is that members of the Labor Party cannot see past the immediate friends that they have-the Labor Party structures and the legal firms that do the deals on behalf of their friends. The process in this bill is to put $200 million down. It will be paid. Then $121 million will be paid each year for nine That is one billion dollars being paid which is not going to produce any more effect than the $20 billion that has been paid to Aboriginal communities over the last 20 years. The health standards, educational standards, housing standards and opportunities for Aboriginal people have not changed, even though programs have been running for 20 years. For the last 11 years the Australian Labor Party has been in charge of the program and it has had no impact, no effect, whatsoever. There is a demonstrable link between health and medicine, not between health and land. The opposition has said, 'Use that money.' We believe it should be committed on behalf of the Australian people, but we believe that it should be committed for definite purposes that the government has not set out in the legislation. The government has not said that we need to focus on Aboriginal health problems, Aboriginal housing problems, Aboriginal educational and economic issues-that is, jobs. The government has refused to acknowledge that. What the government has done is said that it will buy land. In this legislation, the opposition is agreeing with the government-let us allocate these funds. At a time when we are coming out of a recession, when most Australians have had a harsh time, when most people have felt the pinch of the last five years of Labor Party management, we are prepared to say, 'Let's spend this money on the Aboriginal people,' but we are also saying, 'Let us direct it to better areas than those proposed by the government. Let us refocus it on health, housing, education and jobs.' We also consider that there needs to be an accountability process. Members of the public are in the gallery. It is very interesting that the government never seems to want to have debates such as this given extended broadcasts. I always wonder whether it is concerned that it does not want the flimsy arguments that it presents here to be heard by the rest of Australia. The few people who are favoured to travel to Canberra and to sit in the gallery and to understand what is going on know the truth. The government prefers to hide and to screen these facts from fellow Australians. People listening to the debate will understand that the accountability processes have been poor. The Australian Labor Party has also sought to screen that from the public. Whether it was amongst the bureaucrats in ATSIC when it first started, whether it was amongst the bureaucrats in the land councils or anywhere else in the Aboriginal system, it has considered it to be critical of the Aboriginal people if mistakes have been made. Nobody is critical of honest mistakes. What people are critical of are fraud and rip-offs. We can go anywhere in Australia and see where the smart alecs have been and the trail they have left behind of abusing the funds that the Australian people have put towards the Aboriginal community. We have got Auditor-General's report after Auditor-General's report on these areas. There are parasites and bloodsuckers in the system. When I was in the north, the royalties had just been paid into Groote Eylandt. A couple of entrepreneurial car dealers from Darwin towed a barge full of new Toyotas to Groote Eylandt and the lot were flogged off. I guess that is entrepreneurial but I think in some ways it is a shame when that occurs and funds are spent in that way. But it is the Aboriginal people's right. If it is their dough, they have got a right to spend it the way they want. What this government seems to say is that it does not care about accountability. It does not want people to be able to say, 'I, with integrity, have done this and I'm prepared for anyone to look through the books at what I've done.' I have met Aboriginal people who are distressed that that seems to be the attitude of the government. If something is Aboriginal, there is a different standard and therefore it does not matter. They are proud people. They are proud of the standards that they want to set. They want to have good standards and they want to be known for their integrity. The coalition has said that land purchasing and management strategies must be accountable to the government; in purchasing land, priority must go to those areas where Aboriginals cannot claim native land title. There is a sensible attitude to land purchase. The upgrading of Aboriginal pastoral properties is important. Looking at the cattle count out of the Northern Territory and the kill rate out of the territory, we would have to say that cattle properties in the Northern Territory are not as successfully managed now as they were 20 years ago. There needs to be an upgrading of properties and a building of expertise and skills. The issue that is flagged by the coalition in regard to the land title legislation is that we have to exclude the possibility of native title on land purchases. Land purchase must retain the condition of leasehold or freehold under which it is purchased. People must be actual owners of the property, not through some remote corporation or commission or group of individuals acting on their behalf. It is the height of paternalism to say that Aboriginal people cannot own land in their own right. That is what the government is building into this legislation-complete and absolute paternalism. The very thing that it cries out against it is building into the structures laws of Australia. The parliamentary secretary is frowning. He knows that is right. He knows that no Aboriginallegislation that the government has put through this parliament has encouraged people to stand with dignity in their own right as individuals. The government prefers to have them controlled through some central group. The other areas that have been raised by the coalition are significant too. They explore the options to identify land in which the acquisition group has a financial interest in order to protect innocent third party purchasers, and to find a mechanism for states to nominate a member to the board. I think that is reasonable. The state or territory governments ought to be involved in this process as they have had far more experience in the management and use of Aboriginal lands than the Commonwealth has, and there ought to be assistance for the economic development of land so that practices continue that are beneficial to the people who ultimately own the land. They are the reasons for the coalition deciding that the government is doing the wrong thing for Australia. The government is not benefiting the Aboriginal people in large numbers. It is spending a lot of money where it could gain much more benefit for the Aboriginal people if it were a bit more thoughtful. The fact is that the government would rather support structures and people who support it politically than take some of the hard decisions. I have a great respect for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), but when he was the minister responsible for Aboriginal affairs he could not break the stranglehold of the bureaucrats who are favoured by the Labor Party. He tried. It was a great shame that he did not succeed, and here we see the government perpetuating that process. It is a great shame that the people to whom the funds should go will never get them. It is a great shame that those who are powerful or strong, or who yell the loudest, will get them. That is the great shame in Australia today regarding the passage of this legislation-and of the everybody in the Labor Party knows it.",56
37,Mr VAILE,MARTIN FERGUSON,"It is with some pleasure that I take the opportunity to make some comments in the debate today on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. At the outset I say that the amendments proposed by the opposition to this bill aim to get the government to widen its focus to take in not just the ownership of land by the Aboriginal community but also the more pressing social needs. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) at the table is continually stressing to the opposition the need for social justice. As far as opposition members are concerned, the social needs of the Aboriginal community in respect of health, housing and education-the real needs-are higher priorities than land. Land will not provide for those needs. It is interesting to note that the representatives of the government have had a fair bit to say about how they have been the great advocates for the indigenous people of Australia, how they have bettered the circumstances of the indigenous people of Australia. I ask government members to cast their minds back to a current affairs program that I took part in-I think earlier this year-which featured the then Senator Richardson, who I think was the then health minister, and who was doing a bit of a tour around the Northern Territory and outback Queensland looking at the conditions that a lot of Aboriginal people were living under in their communities. I believe there was also another expose on television last night that indicated that some of our indigenous Australians are living in some fairly exceptional circumstances of extreme cold in the winter and extreme heat in the summer. The point I am making is that this government has been sitting on its side of this House for about 10 or 11 years, yet our indigenous Australians are still living under the same conditions today. What has the government been doing for indigenous Australians for those 10 or 11 years as far as health, housing and education are concerned? The simple answer is: not enough. The people of Australia, particularly its indigenous people, should not be fooled by a lot of the rhetoric that comes from the government benches when they start talking about the social justice packages that have been introduced to improve the circumstances of indigenous Australians. Why are we just starting to see what is supposedly some action in that direction at this late stage in this government's incumbency on the government benches? The people of Australia should ask some questions about this important issue. Why has more not been done sooner? Why is there not more in this bill to improve the circumstances of those people? The amendments that were foreshadowed by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), in her speech to the House yesterday certainly will go further, if agreed to by the government, to address those key issues than the bill does as presently drafted. If enacted, the bill will establish a new fund called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. That fund will take over the money allocated to the land fund established by the Native Title Act. Section 201 of the Native Title Act will be repealed. One of the reasons for setting up a new land fund was that the fund established by section 201 restricted the money to be spent on land management to those properties acquired under the fund. The new land fund allows money to be spent on land management for any indigenous held properties, whether acquired under the land fund or not. The new land fund is also placed within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 rather than under the Native Title Act, and its detail is provided for in legislation rather than in regulations. The bill will establish an indigenous land corporation, or ILC, which will receive an indexed amount from the land fund each year. Up until the 1997-98 financial year, the ILC will only receive an annual indexed sum of $24 million because ATSIC will continue to receive the $21 million it currently uses for land acquisition and management. From the 1997-98 financial year, the full indexed amount of $45 million will be allocated to the ILC. From the 2004-05 financial year, the ILC will receive funds based on the realised real return on the investments of the land fund in respect of the previous year. This money is to be used by the ILC for the acquisition of land or the management of indigenous held land. Land acquired by the ILC is to be granted to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations-and I emphasise the word 'corporations' - and the ILC is to establish a national strategy and regional strategies for the acquisition and management of land. Once the land has been granted to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation-note, again, the word 'corporation'-it cannot be sold or mortgaged without the permission of the ILC. The main provisions of the bill propose to amend the ATSIC Act by inserting part 4A, on the Indigenous Land Corporation and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land land Fund, into the act. The clause numbers referred to below are the proposed section numbers to be inserted in the act. The ILC will be established under this act. Its powers and functions are land acquisition, land management, and performance. The bill will establish subsidiaries under the ILC which may perform the same functions as the ILC. The dealings of the ILC in relation to land will include disposal of surplus land, the grant of land by ATSIC to the ILC and so forth. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister originally made claims that led Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians to believe that Aboriginal people would have almost $1.5 billion to spend on land. Technically, this may be correct, but the real figure that is available for the purchase of land is $45 million per year, which is going to be indexed, of which $21 million is already available through the ATSIC land fund. Therefore, the only new money available for the purchase of land by Aboriginal people is $24 million per year. This $24 million will not go totally to the purchase of land; some of it will go on administration and some will go on the upgrading of newly bought land and existing Aboriginal properties. In my opening comments, I said that health, housing and education are important. Bureaucrats are designing housing in unsuitable areas. In the report of the Auditor General dealing with the expenditure of ATSIC funds we have seen a lack of accountability, particularly in the area of community development employment programs. In one of the Auditor-General's reports, some $300 million plus was unaccounted for. The majority of people I have talked to do not begrudge the establishment of this fund provided the government ensures that it benefits the people it is supposed to benefit, and that taxpayers' dollars are spent properly so that there is transparency and accountability. To that end, some of the amendments to be moved by the opposition will address the composition of the ILC board. The coalition would like to see the qualification requirements tightened. At present a situation could arise where no board member has experience in the areas of business, commerce or land management. The coalition also believes that the states should have a nominee on the board to ensure that the land acquisition and management functions of the board are coordinated with the states. If we are responsible about establishing this land fund and the ILC, we will involve the states. There has been a lack of consultation with the states on the part of the Commonwealth government on the Native Title Act. Anybody who studies the legislative process will know that the shorter the consultative processgetting the legislation together and talking to the people who will be dealing with it-the longer the dispute process will be. We are seeing this occur with the Native Title Act now. There are challenges coming from a number of different directions. Because the government rushed the legislation through and did not use a proper consultative process, the National Native Title Tribunal has recommended amendments. We are urging the government to use a proper consultative process and to involve the states. The opposition will be moving specific amendments during the consideration in detail stage. As foreshadowed earlier, we wish to change the focus of the bill so that, when the ILC purchases land, it shows that there will be an improvement in health, housing and the economic well-being of the Aboriginal community for whom the land is purchased. There is no point in just purchasing large tracts of land and saying, 'That belongs to that particular corporation or organisation.' There must be quantifiable benefits in those key areas for the people for whom the land is being purchased and those benefits must be demonstrable to the rest of the community. As I said, health, housing and education are key areas and need to be addressed. We believe that, during its 11 years on the treasury bench, the government has been remiss in addressing them. It is incumbent on the government, since it has reached this stage in the process, to address those areas of concern. The other important area that I would like to comment on is the ownership of the land to be purchased. We hear a lot of talk in this place about rights. It is my firm belief that there is no such thing as rights without responsibilities in this country; they must be intrinsically linked. During the consideration in detail stage of this bill we will be moving an amendment which will allow the fund to include individual ownership of land. At present, this bill allows for ownership of land only by corporations. As I said at the beginning of my address, the bill contains a lot of reference to ownership of land by corporations. However, it should also contain reference to individual ownership of land. We believe that families, individuals, trusts and Aboriginal partnerships should benefit from this fund and should be able to use moneys from the fund in a wide variety of ways in order to set up businesses. These businesses could include ecotourism businesses, but it would not be limited to them. There is a whole range of possible businesses. There is no reason why this legislation should not include individuals and families instead of just corporations. There is no reason why Aboriginal people should differ from other Australians in this respect. This again identifies the lack of bona fides on the part of the government in addressing some of those key issues facing the Aboriginal community today. Before this bill goes to the other house, I would like to see far greater emphasis placed on the need for better health services, improved health conditions, improved housing conditions and better education for Aboriginal people in Australia. This land fund must be accountable. It needs to be far more transparent and far more accountable. As has been borne out in numerous reports, biIIions of dollars have been disbursed by ATSIC over previous years. The former head of ATSIC, Dr Peter Shergold, told us that ATSIC had been done to death with inquiries. Do members of the government not realise why ATSIC has been done to death with inquiries? It is because there has not been enough accountability or transparency with respect to the expenditure of the funds that have been allocated to ATSIC by the government. There must be far greater accountability of this land fund. There needs to be a certain level of expertise on the board of the corporation so that its functions can be disbursed in a diligent manner and so that the activities of the corporation can be balanced. They are absolutely fundamental to our responsibilities, as members of this parliament representing the people of Australia, with respect to the expenditure of taxpayers' funds. It is not just in this area that we must show that sort of diligence; it is in every area of the expenditure of taxpayers' funds in Australia. So the government must recognise the need for improvement in that area of this bill. We believe that the ownership of the land should not just be vested in a corporation. Other types of ownership should be included in this legislation. I implore members of the government to have an open mind and not to run out of here like the Prime Minister did the other day. He bagged the opposition's amendments before he even knew what they were, and I think he is still doing it. He has been crowing about trying to establish a bipartisan position on this issue for quite some time. It is time that the Prime Minister had an open mind and took a serious look at the amendments being proposed by the opposition to see how the legislation can be improved. As I have said in this place before, all the wisdom and the knowledge in this place does not belong to that side of the House. There is a fair amount on this side of the House. Certainly, all the knowledge and wisdom on a number of different issues across Australia is not resident in this chamber. There is a lot outside this place. I urge the government to lengthen the consultative process and to talk to the states at length about the possible outcomes and ramifications of this piece of legislation as it travels through this place. First and foremost, I urge the government to keep in its mind the health, housing and education issues that certainly need addressing now, as they did 10 years ago when this government came to power. We do not seriously believe that the government has done enough in those areas for the Aboriginal or indigenous Australians whom we are seeking to help with this legislation.",59
38,Mr KATTER,MARTIN FERGUSON,"I did something today that I never did in my six years as a minister-with some pride, the longest serving minister in Australian Aboriginal affairs history, I am told by the Parliamentary Library-for this speech and that was to work out how much money you are entitled to if you are of Aboriginal descent in Australia on top of what you are entitled to as an Australian. It is quite an interesting exercise. I got the figures from the library and I did them myself separately. They have worked out the same, so I accept that $1.6738 thousand million is expended on Aboriginal affairs in Australia by the federal government. At the recent AAAC-Aboriginal ministers conference-it was claimed that $327 million was being spent by the states. I suspect that the figures may be inflated somewhat, but all the same they were the official figures presented by the various state governments so I think we have to accept them. They do not make a great deal of difference to the overall figure. We then look at the number of people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander decent in Australia-265,492-and we find that each person of Aboriginal decent is entitled to $6,204 and that a family consisting of two adults and two children is entitled to $25,226. If we add to that the social security entitlement of a man out of work with a wife and two kids, the absolute bare minimum he can get off the government is another $17,134. That is $42,360. We can add to that figure the value of a housing subsidy, which is about $3,900 a year-probably a little bit more, but that is about as accurate a figure as we can secure here-and the fact that some 20,000 of those people of Aboriginal decent are employed and receiving an income, and in some cases very substantial incomes. For example, my former boss, a foreman at the lead smelter at Mount Isa Mines, is of Aboriginal decent and he earned a very substantial income. A lot of Aboriginals are working as plant operators in the coalfields and as schoolteachers in North Queensland. A lot of them are working in hard jobs, very poorly paid jobs, ringing and fruit picking in North Queensland and some people have very good and lucrative jobs on the railways in North Queensland as engine drivers, for example, some of whom are good close friends of mine. If we add in, let us say, around $2,648, the average person of Aboriginal decent in Australia on the dole should be getting, if that money were going into his pocket, $50,140. That makes him reasonably all right-not rich, but reasonably all right: let us say, upper middle income. If it is the case that people of Aboriginal decent are getting $50,000, I would like to find out where they are because I most certainly have not seen them. As a minister for six years with this responsibility on my shoulders, there is not the slightest doubt in my mind-to quote former senator Neville Bonner-that $3 out of every $4 that is spent on Aboriginal affairs ends up in white pockets. That, of course, is profoundly true. In fact, I am told that the person whose place I took in this chamber was on some $60,000 or $70,000 a year as an Aboriginal legal aid lawyer in Mount Isa. I do not know whether that is true or not, but I most certainly think that Aboriginal legal aid lawyers are on very substantial salaries. Many of them, of course, are serving an apprenticeship before they get an ALP endorsement into this place. If these people are earning this money, why do we have these horrific unemployment levels, and why do we have these horrific statistics for health and life expectancy? Almost every indicator is something for all of us to be utterly ashamed of. The question is: why is this the case, if money can solve the problem? We are here today discussing pouring even more money into what appears to be a bottomless pit. If the money were yielding some purpose, I would not mind. Mena Phillips, an excellent officer in the department I was responsible for and a friend of mine from schooldays, claimed that we are worse off now than we were 15 years ago. I believe that that is true. We are talking about buying more land in Queensland for people of Aboriginal descent. The people of Aboriginal descent in Queensland are beneficial owners of the land. Thanks to the socialists, they are no longer the legal owners. Under us they were the legal owners and the beneficial owners. In other words, the old period of Big White Bwana returned in Queensland under the socialists when they took away the legal ownership of the land and reinvested it in the state government. This occasioned the worse demonstration at the Queensland Parliament House in the history of the parliament. Some 3,000 or 4,000 people turned out. Mr Ruddock-Without compensation?",62
39,Mr KATTER,MARTIN FERGUSON,"They took it without the slightest skerrick of compensation. When the people turned up with the temerity to question the government, they were hit on the head by the police and driven out of the yards of Parliament House. These are the enlightened socialists! Financially these people are very well offby any standards. They are receiving $50,000 a year per family. If you look at land ownership, you see that these people, some 25,000 or 30,000 people on what were once called the reserve areas of Queensland-we can even take all of the people of Aboriginal descent in Queensland, some 70,000-own some seven million acres of land. Almost all of it is land which gets above 40 inches of rainfall. We are not talking about barren land or the useless land they have been given in the Northern Territory; we are talking about prime real estate. In fact, the Yarrabah community area would be worth many hundreds of millions of dollars. It neighbours the city of Cairns and would be some of the most valuable real estate in all of Australia. We talking about the most land-rich people on the planet. So why do these problems still exist? We can see clearly, with what has happened with the state government in Queensland, why we have this situation. I often stand up here and criticise my own side of the House, but today I was very proud to listen to the speeches, because what they said was, 'For heaven's sake, give the people the same ownership rights and privileges that every other Australian enjoys.' As the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), from Western Australia, said, we should let these people have a go and let them own their own land. If you cannot mortgage your own land and you cannot raise any money to do anything with it, it is worth absolutely nothing to you. All the speeches from the other side were characterised by this sanctified relationship between the black people and the land. Each one of them gave the same holy and pious speech. I heard it one night from somebody who was arguing with a person. That person said, 'You can talk about all that sort of rubbish, but at the end of the day they will be going to the disco on Friday night and busting their britches to see the Sydney rugby league on Saturday afternoon.' I thought, 'This bloke knows what he is talking about.' I took the trouble of ringing up and finding out who he was. His name was very obscure to me; I had never heard of him before. He was a bloke called Fred Hollows. I sent him a letter and said, 'Congratulations. You are the first person I have ever seen on the television who seems to know or understand anything about the real people who are out there.' We had to try to convince some of the people dealing with black affairs in the old reserve areas in Queensland to take over the running of their own communities. It was called self-management or local government, although it was probably a lot more than that. Many of them were very fearful. Many of them had a driving determination to seize control of the running of their own affairs. But some were sensible, moderate, quiet people. I remember one of them-Jackson Shortjoe. are I have a picture of him on a wall in my office to this very day. Jackson, a very quiet bloke-he was an ex-ringer on the Peninsula-got up and said, 'I do not know whether your arguments that we do not know how to run our own affairs are correct or whether we should listen to the minister and some of you other blokes and say that we can learn on the job. But I know this: if we don't have a go, we don't get our pride back. Without our pride, we are finished as a race of people. We will drink ourselves to death and we will no longer exist. So, as far I am concerned, let's have a go.' So it was decided to launch a policy of self-management in the state of Queensland. In my last year as minister only six of the 28 councils in Queensland had qualified audit reports. Four of the six councils in the Torres Strait were tiny. Many of these people had difficulty speaking English and could not read or write. They were running their own affairs without any interference. In fact, there was a memo that any officials who interfered in any way with the running of the local shires would lose their jobs. In fact, three did. These people were able to take in $30 million and spend it. The Auditor-General for Queensland said that they were running things well. When I left, we had an income of $15 million from private operations. Today, almost every one of those councils is getting qualified audit reports. They believe that there is a plot by the state government to break their confidence in running their own affairs. I treated these charges flippantly in days gone until I became the minister and I saw up close the workings of the white public servants. I remember the classic case of Greg Wallace, who was the first black shire clerk in Queensland's history. He took over the chief executive job at Weipa South. He got the people working for the dole voluntarily. 60 Minutes did a whole segment on it. It was the only time in the history of 60 Minutes that it did a second report on the one issue, because it had received a record number of letters on the segment. This bloke was a 24-carat success story, an inspiration not only for black Australians but for all Australians. I went there four or five months later. He drove me in from the airport. I said 'How is it going, mate?' He just grunted. I said, 'It's not going well, obviously.' He grunted again. I said, 'Let me tell you what has happened here, Greg. A white federal government project officer has been employed by the federal government. He is undermining you and slowly taking over all the operations of the council here.' Greg suddenly came to life-he was driving the bus-and he turned around to me and asked, 'How did you know that?' I said, 'Because that is happening in every community in Queensland. How bad is it?' He said, 'He keeps going along to the elected shire chairman, Roy Jingle'-a lovely bloke-'and saying that I don't know how to run things and that I will get him into trouble. He said that he will fix this little mistake that has been made.' Slowly, he said, 'Roy is listening to him and not me.' I said, 'How bad has it got?' Greg said, 'I've just about had a gutfu!. I took Saturday and Sunday off and went to Cairns. They are the first two days that I have had off since I took on the job nearly 18 months ago. When I came back, he had changed the computer code so that I could not access the computer. So effectively he was now the shire clerk.' Mr Wallace went to Roy to complain, and Roy said, 'Dh well, he knows all about these things and you don't.' That is what is happening out there today with those shire councils. Democracy is being undermined by the people who really have as their basis the idea that they know how to run things better than the black people do. I carry to every office I have ever had a picture of Jackson Shortjoe, whom I referred to before, and Eddie Holroyd, who was the subject of yet another 60 Minutes series, and theirs is the greatest success story I know of. Eddie Holroyd had taken his own block of country from the reserve area. He owned it in just the same way as any other pastoralist in Queensland. 60 Minutes showed a picture of his yard, which was nearly two acres, and those honourable members involved in cattle would know that a two-acre yard is a very big yard. Every single piece of wood on Eddie Holroyd's property was ironwood, which Australian timber books agree is the premier timber in Australia. He had scoured all of the area so that every single piece of wood was ironwood. The pieces of timber were so big that I do not know how even two men could have carried them; I think three men would have been needed to carry each of those logs. Eddie Holroyd was a supreme achiever. In this black run area, Jackson Shortjoe and he started with 326 cattle on the books when self-management and private ownership came in and, within a period of 4 Jh years, Pormpuraaw as it is now caIled had over 6,000 head of cattle on the books. Those blokes climbed into the saddle-there was no white bloke on the reserve at all-and chased down those wild cattle, which no-one else had ever been able to do, and put together 6,000 head of cattle. Aboriginals in the neighbouring area of Aurukun-which did not have self management but was effectively under total white federal government management-started at the same time with 12,000 head of cattle and, five years later, Danny Bowenda, the shire chairman, rang me up-even though Queensland legislation was not involved-and said, 'Bobby, they are going to shoot the last of our cattle.' I said, 'Danny, don't let them shoot your cattle. That's the kids' future.' He said, 'That is why I am ringing you up.' He cried on the telephone to me because the last of their 12,000 head of cattle were being shot by the white people; the servants of this government were shooting the last of that area's future. It is all right to say that Aboriginals get their money; but their pride has been taken away. Nothing is left. I went out to see George Rosendale-a very famous and impressive man-when things got really bad and I said, 'George, we're in big trouble.' Noel Pearson's brother, who was a very good shire clerk, was with me at the time. George Rosendale said, 'Bobby, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of Community Service come into Hopevale and say that they are going to build all these beautiful houses for us, that this progress and that Hopevale is now a really lovely place. But that is not progress.' George Rosendale had just taken up, under our legislation, his own little farming cattle block and he was building his own house. It was made from rough bush timber-Cobb & Co twitch wire to tie on the galvanised iron. He was pouring the concrete floor when I was out there, and she was a pretty rough old job. George Rosendale said, 'When they come to Hopevale and build all of these beautiful houses, that is not progress, Bobby. What I am doing here is progress.' He is right because he was doing it himself and that is the only way that Aboriginals can get pride and self-esteem back. Without that, they are dead. If we keep imposing upon Aboriginals government owned land-as speaker after speaker has said today, and which is the intention of this government-we will have the same dynamic success story as Russia and eastern Europe; countries where regularly people die because they cannot feed themselves. If we give Aboriginals private ownership in the same way as the Lincoln Homestead Act delivered it to the United States farmers-at much the same time as Karl Marx wrote his treatise on ownership-we will have the sorts of results in the Aboriginal towns of Australia that occurred in the United States, where there is an embarrassingly large amount of agricultural produce. That money can be used in urban situations. I will close my remarks with one example. The Aitkenvale reserve, which is right in the centre of Townsville, is some 20 acres of land owned by black people. I am afraid that anyone who says that they do not own it is wrong. It must be handed over to the Aboriginal people. The program relating to the Aitkenvale reserve was drawn up by the black people. Under that program a building group was to come in and build houses, then flog off the land with the houses so that they would be able to start their own construction company, employing some 50 or 60 men. Those construction crews were already working for us under contract to build houses. I am talking about houses built to a standard that is acceptable anywhere in the world. is They are excellent houses. In fact, their brickwork was probably superior to that of any other brickwork in North Queensland. There are 70 permanent jobs there; there is the leagues club and the shopping centre strip in the front. Those are the sorts of things that we can achieve with that money. (Time expired)",64
40,Mr LIEBERMAN,MARTIN FERGUSON,"I recognise the enthusiasm of my colleague the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). As a former state minister for Aboriginal affairs, he has a great knowledge of the Aboriginals and I know that they respect him for the work he did in Queensland. I am pleased to be able to make a short contribution to the debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill before question time and to confirm once again-despite the attempts of the government to muddy the water-that the opposition wants to see this bill go through the parliament so that the formalisation of legislation to assist in the acquisition of certain land for the Aboriginal people can be effected. The principle of the bill is supportable, but the bill requires some amendment. It is good to see that there are young Australians in the gallery at the moment. They are obviously visiting the parliament from schools throughout Australia. I extend a warm welcome to them and hope they enjoy their visit. It is great for them to be in the parliament today to witness some of the debate on this legislation which attempts to bring the parties together to achieve a bipartisan approach to help the Aboriginal people find happiness, security and peace in Australia as citizens of Australia. We all know that there is a lot of work to be done. The thing that strikes me most about the debate so far is that yesterday, when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) was presenting in broad terms the opposition's wish that the bill go through subject to amendments, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other members of the government front-bench were interjecting and indicating that, somehow or other, this was a trick on the part of the coalition. That was before they had heard the Leader of the Opposition complete his speech and it was certainly before the government knew anything about the nature of the amendments that the coalition was going to suggest to both houses of parliament to improve the legislation and to ensure that the government achieved its objectives with sound legislation. We heard the word 'trickery' being called across the chamber. It did the government no credit to expose itself in such a blatant way to a political strategy that was clearly designed to give the impression that this parlia- matter. ment was not prepared to resolve the challenges for Aboriginal people in a bipartisan way. The government reflected yesterday its disappointment that the coalition had decided that it could support the legislation with certain amendments. That probably launched the debate in a very sorry direction. I hope that the government today, with a bit of sober reflection, will take a different view. I know that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, knows a bit about conflict resolution. It is a matter that I have been interested in for many years, both as a practisto ing legal practitioner and also as a member of parliament. The only way to resolve matters of importance and substance is for the parties to stop calling each other names and to sit down and listen to each other. I hope that today the government will listen to the coalition's point of view and that it will pick up some of the coalition's points, because those points have merit. As a former state minister, I believe that, if the parliament is offering a minister bringing in legislation the opportunity to improve the performance of that legislation, to ensure that taxpayers' funds are used for the purpose of achieving the objects of the legislation, to ensure that taxpayers' money is fully accounted for, to ensure that the people entrusted with that particular duty have a clear brief as to what they are expected to do and are under no doubt at all about the high standards of the required performance and probity, that opportunity should be welcomed. When I was a minister, if someone from whatever side of parliament put forward suggestions that would strengthen the legislation that I was responsible for, I welcomed them. That is the way it ought to be. I hope that today the government will start to develop some dialogue with the coalition to look at our amendments, none of which in my view destroy the purpose of the legislation. In my view, our amendments will ensure that the legislation's purpose can be achieved and will endure for the benefit of the Aboriginal people. Above all, they will help the reconciliation process, which is a very urgent Let us get this into perspective. One of the amendments in general terms that the coalition is proposing-obviously we will go into this in more detail at the consideration in detail stage-will ensure that the objects of helping Aboriginal people are achieved. We have proposed that, when considering the purchase of land, the ILC must show that the health, housing and education needs or economic viability of an Aboriginal community will be improved. I thought that was the government's policy too, quite frankly. I am amazed that the government has allowed itself publicly give an indication that that proposal is some form of trick. How can it be a trick to want to improve the health and economic prospects of Aboriginal people? How can it be a trick if, in assisting Aboriginal people to acquire land, part of the purpose of the acquisition is to strengthen their future and security, and to assist them to address some of the very serious and sad health problems that we all know exist in parts of the Aboriginal community in Australia. When I heard this suggestion I thought that maybe I had not read the bill properly. I reread the bill, trying not to be too much of a lawyer whilst recognising that it is a bit hard not to look at it from a legal point of view. I thought maybe I had misunderstood the bill. I thought that maybe what we were saying would not mesh in with the bill and that we had better have another look at it. I had another look at the bill and found that on page 3, under the subheading 'Purposes of Indigenous Land Corporation', clause 191B states: The Indigenous Land Corporation is established: (a) to assist Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to acquire land; and (b) to assist Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to manage indigenous-held landthe coalition supports all of thatso as to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits for Aboriginal persons Strait Islanders. What is wrong with incorporating in that clause, in appropriate drafting terms, the expressions that the coalition wants reinforced as well-that is, in assisting in the acquisition and management of the land, better health, housing and education for our Aboriginal people must also be achieved? It is clear. If someone acquires a tract of land where it is expected that some Aboriginal people will make their homes forever, provision has to be made for their housing, in whatever form they prefer, and there has to be decent water. Honourable members on the other side need reminding that a lot of Aboriginal babies die of dysentery and other illnesses because there is not a decent water supply in these areas. I for one, and all the members of the coalition, do not want to see that issue ignored. On behalf of the Australian people, surely to God the government should seize our willingness to incorporate principles along those lines in this legislation. That would be in the interests of everyone, and it is our duty to address these particular matters. Why would that be trickery? Surely to God the word 'trickery' was an aberration, a political expression of disappointment by the government yesterday. I hope that is behind the government now and I hope that the government will enter into dialogue with our shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who has done an excellent job in presenting the case for the coalition supporting the legislation subject to the amendments that we are talking about. The other areas of substance in our amendments concern accountability. Why would a minister of the crown not welcome legislation that says, 'There's to be proper accountability to ensure probity at all times, to ensure that the taxpayers' money is spent to achieve the purposes of the legislation, to ensure that the interests of the Aboriginal people of Australia are enhanced and strengthened and to ensure a permanent situation which will help resolve some of their problems'? Why would they not want some strengthening of the legislation? Mr Cleeland-Why don't you argue the and Torres amendments? Put some of them.",66
41,Mr LIEBERMAN,MARTIN FERGUSON,"My friend the honourable member for MCEwen, a fellow lawyer, wants me to put some of the ideas. It is probably better to do so in the consideration in detail stage, but I am happy to make my time available to him or anyone else in the government to help draft the relevant clauses to ensure proper accountability. Let me remind the member for MCEwen and other members of the government that the bill at the moment actually says that the minister cannot interfere except in certain circumstances. For example, he can remove a bankrupt director of the corporation but he cannot interfere, as a matter of policy, in the shaping of the regional strategy or in the management, in the decisions that are made on a commercial and environmental basis. Mr Tickner- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a procedural point of order. Can I ask the honourable member if the opposition has amendments to the legislation before the House? If there are amendments, could they be supplied, given the fact it is approaching 3 o'clock?",68
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MARTIN FERGUSON,"Mr Truss)There is no point of order, but I would remind honourable members that the consideration in detail stage is the appropriate time deal with a bill on a clause by clause basis. We are currently in the second reading debate, and I draw that matter to the attention of the honourable member.",69
43,Mr LIEBERMAN,MARTIN FERGUSON,"The member for MCEwen is hungry for the knowledge of how to strengthen the legislation. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is hungry for that knowledge. I think we might have created an environment in which we can have some connict resolution. It appears the government is now signalling that it does want to sit down and talk. That is good. I look forward to the opportunity, with the shadow minister, to demonstrate to the government how the amendments will strengthen this legislation, how they are responsible and how they will ensure that the objectives of the legislation are achieved. The corporation to be established has very wide functions and powers. It can borrow, it can purchase land, it can dispose of land, it can enter into arrangements, it can grant titles to possession of land-it can do a wide range of things. Surely it is in the interests of the taxpayer, the Aboriginal people particularly, and all Australians that the function be properly scrutinised and that there be the opportunity from time to time for the elected parliament of Australia over the next 10, 20, 30 or 40 years, whatever it is, to have some input into the regional strategies that are being proposed from time to time by the corporation. Surely the government and the minister are not arguing that the elected government, the elected parliament of Australia, should have no input once the bill is enacted and proclaimed into the operation of the regional strategy. That is nonsense. Equally, if we are going to help the reconciliation process, surely the government sees the merit in putting into the bill provisions requiring the corporation to consult with state and local government where appropriate. What is wrong with that? If you are going to make it work, you have to do that.",69
44,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,MARTIN FERGUSON,"Order! It being 3.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate to may be resumed at a later hour. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Budget Deficit",69
45,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Did he say on 21 August that, if this year's budget had been delivered in August instead of May, he 'would have come up with much the same budget, which does involve a considerable reduction in the budget deficit over the next few years'? Is the Treasurer aware that last night he changed his mind and conceded the need to consider a faster reduction of the deficit? What has made him change his mind in the last two weeks? Does he now concede that his deficit reduction strategy is not ambitious enough?",69
46,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There has been no changing of mind whatever. The words that are attributed to me from around 21 August sound familiar. I do not walk away from that. Mr Costello-You are walking away from the policy though.,69
47,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not walk away from the policy either. I do not. Mr Costello-What did you say last night?,69
48,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I said simply this: in terms of this year's budget, there is absolutely no need for us to think about revising the budgetary policy. It is totally appropriate to our circumstances. The government has no intention whatever of revisiting its budget policy prior to the next budget. In the context of every budget, the government reassesses the appropriateness of its budget strategy. All I have said is that, in those circumstances, if we believed that there was some need for further tightening of fiscal policy, then we would do so. We would make our assessment at that time of the appropriate budget policy that we needed to be pursuing. If we thought the deficit reduction strategy needed to be improved upon, then we would improve upon it. That is a sensible position for the government to take. We should also bear in mind that the deficit reduction strategy that is in place does involve a quite substantial reduction in that budget deficit. Between 1993-94 and 1997-98 there will be a reduction of almost three per cent of GOP, 2.8 per cent, and that is a very substantial reduction of the budget deficit. The importance of reducing the budget deficit is in the context of an economy which is producing substantial growth, particularly with increasing investment. The opposition has been in the curious position of saying that there is not going to be any increase in investment and at the same time telling us that we have to dramatically increase the rate of reduction of the budget deficit to improve our savings, which would not be necessary if we were not having any investment. The reduction in the budget deficit of about 2.8 per cent over that period is substantial and, if business investment moved up from where it is now as a percentage of GOP from 8.9 per cent as of today in the national account figures to its long-term average around 11112 per cent, then we would need to improve our savings performance. Clearly, on the basis of the budget deficit reduction that is already in the forward estimates, we would more than cover that with the improving savings by reducing public sector dissavings through the deficit. There is no argument at all about the inappropriateness of the budget deficit at this time. Clearly, that is a matter for us to consider over time. When we get to next year's budget, we will see whether we need to tighten it further. Until then it is a pointless argument. In the context of our already having in place that substantial deficit reduction strategy, and certainly enough to cope with a large increase in business investment without the need to recourse to foreign savings, there is simply nothing in the point that the opposition is trying to make. Economy: National Accounts",69
49,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer, and I refer to the national accounts figures for the June quarter published today. Is the Treasurer aware of reports that the national accounts are disappointing? Is there any truth in these reports? What are the implications of the June quarter figures for the current financial year?",70
50,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the national accounts released today. I have seen reports that the results are disappointing. In particular, the shadow Treasurer in his interview on the World Today said that they were disappointing. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the figures are disappointing. They are disappointing for the opposition but absolutely to the contrary for everybody else. These are very good figures, which give us an increase in GOP in the June quarter of 0.9 per cent. The point about disappointment comes from the fact that this compares with a two per cent increase in the March quarter. A two per cent increase in one quarter is a phenomenal increase. As we pointed out at the time, there were some one-off factors in that which meant that we were not saying that we were growing at two per cent per quarter, eight per cent a year or more. The one-off factors particularly related to the early Easterbringing forward retail sales from what would normally have been in April into March and therefore into the March quarter and giving a very large kick along to private consumption figures in that quarter. That was the main one-off factor, but there were others. Those things have unwound in the June quarter. So we are seeing some fallback to a rate of 0.9 per cent in the June quarter. That is no reason for us to think that growth is declining and things are grim or disappointing. On the contrary, they show that over the 12 months we have had growth of 4.3 per cent on seasonally adjusted figures, which is certainly very strong growth, and better than almost any other country in the Western world and, on a trend basis, 4.6 per cent. These are very substantial growth figures indeed and mean that the economy is clearly growing in the order of 4 1/4 to 41h per cent. We not only have that strong growth of the economy but also we have strong growth of employment, with growth of 300,000 jobs in the last 12 months. We also have inflation which is very low, on the CPI, at 1.8 per cent. On today's national accounts figures, the implicit price deflator for gross domestic product, which is a broad based index trying to cover everything in the economy, shows a 0.9 per cent increase, an inflation rate of less than one per cent. So there is clearly nothing in these figures which gives any indication that we have other than an extremely comforting positionstrong growth of output, strong growth of employment and very low levels of inflation. That is an exceedingly good position for the nation to be in. Most other countries looking at these figures can only look on with enormous envy at an outcome of this kind. They are also absolute confirmation of the budget forecast, which was for 41h per cent growth of gross domestic product. We are already around that rate and, with business investment getting under way, we clearly are going to have another impetus to growth occurring in 1994-95 that we have not had to this stage. We have a rolling recovery where different factors are coming into play at different times. As dwelling investment drops down a little, and as government impetus to the economy drops back, business investment is coming on and continuing our progress towards continued strong growth of the economy and strong growth of employment. Whilst we can continue to keep inflation at these low levels, which we certainly intend to do, there is no reason why we cannot go on chalking up these sorts of outcomes for several years to come. Savings",70
51,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer, who is labouring mightily to hide his disappointment. Do you now concede-now that you have given away your own budget deficit reduction strategy",71
52,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member will go to his question.,71
53,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do you now concede, Treasurer, that Australia's low level of savings is a major problem feeding the current account deficit? Do you now endorse the coalition's long standing policy of tax incentives to promote household savings? If you do, why do you persist in refusing to allow banks to offer retirement savings products other than to placate Bill Kelty?",71
54,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government's approach to savings is that we agree that the hudget deficit has to be reduced over time. I have already been through that in answer to the earlier question from the Leader of the Opposition. That course is a major pro-savings policy. We also have in place the superannuation guarantee which the opposition at the last election said it would freeze and not continue on with its further progression, therefore providing no further boost to savings from that course even though the FitzGerald report said that it would provide a substantial boost to savings. We will maintain that scheme. That source provides a continuing impetus to savings which the opposition would not enjoy if it were in government. There is also the fact that we will get savings pluses coming from further reductions in state government deficits as well as our own. There are various factors such as those assisting improved savings performance. In today's figures, the household savings ratioMr Costello-Why are the savings so low?",71
55,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know you do not what to hear this, but you are going to hear it anyway. The household savings ratio in the national accounts actually went up today, as it did in the previous quarter. We are seeing an increase in the household savings ratio occurring in the latest national accounts. The downward progression has clearly stabilised and the trend has now turned up. We have also said that we would consider further impetus to savings through a tax preferred savings vehicle of some sort if we were convinced that such an initiative would be a net addition to savings. I do not hear any of that coming from the opposition, which talks about the needMr Costello-It's been our policy for years.",71
56,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know it is your policy to have a tax preferred savings vehicle, but you have not spelt it out and you have not in any way put in the rider that it needs to be a net addition to national savings. There is absolutely no point in having any kind of tax preferred savings vehicle available if the end result is that all you get is increased private savings which are totally offset or more by the loss of tax revenue, which means that you have increased public dissaving. You have to come up with something which provides a net increase to national savings. We will not pursue that course unless we are quite convinced that what we are doing is going to be a net addition to national savings and not just something which gives the mirage of increased savings on the one hand but ignores the fact that there is a great in savings on the other hand. There is every chance that that would be the outcome. Looking around the rest of the world at what other nations have done, there is very little clarity that there has been too much in the way of net pluses to savings where governments, such as in England and Canada, have taken this kind of initiative. That does not mean we should not try to do it. We are certainly trying to develop such a vehicle. If we could do it, it would be a good thing to improve national savings. It is something which is not easy to do and it is not clear that any country has been able convincingly to do it. Homeless Youth Mr GRIFFlN-Can the Minister for Social Security inform the House what the government is doing to ensure that the Commonwealth and the states cooperate in addressing the needs of homeless young people?",72
57,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The provision of income support to homeless young people is a matter that has attracted a good deal of public attention of late, some of it extraordinarily poorly informed. There is undoubtedly a need for such an income support payment for people under the age of 18. While the matter has not been the focus of public attention with the possibility of political gain, I think that has been accepted by most members of the opposition. In 1989 the honourable member for Bradfield, in a parliamentary debate about income support for young people, said this: For heaven's sake, if a child is forced out of his home because he has been beaten by his father, sexually assaulted or something else and is expected to be able to present a piece of paper from his parents saying that he has left home, the absurdity of the circumstances becomes clear. If a child leaves home under those circumstance he needs help. To expect that he can go back to his parents asking for support is absurd. That is a reasonably honest statement of the rationale for this particular form of payment. It is not paid willy-nilly. It is made available under a restrictive set of circumstances, particularly in cases of abuse, sexual assault, intolerable domestic circumstances and cirhole cumstances where the child is simply not allowed to live at home. There is no doubt that we need to have a payment of this kind. When I took over the social security portfolio, there were a lot of expressions of concern about the administration of the payment. As I said, a lot of people were very poorly informed. As a consequence of that, I took a number of steps. I asked the department to do an internal review of the way that payment was administered. A number of concrete things flowed from that; in particular, the gazetting of a new privacy instrument under the Social Security Act that should broaden significantly the circumstances in which parents can be contacted, particularly when it will facilitate family reconciliation and it will keep the parents informed of what is going on. It was always the case that parents were contacted in the majority of cases, but the new privacy instrument should ensure that, in the great majority of cases, parents are contacted. There are obviously some cases where there is a degree of threat or the possibility of retaliatory violence that has to be taken into consideration. Another thing that arose from that consideration was the initiation of a process of negotiation with the states to try to arrive at a protocol or a set of agreements with the states about how young people who approach us and are put on our income support system are dealt with. Clearly, we cannot provide all the support services that such young people need. Many of the care and protection services and the mediation and counselling services and much of the access to health and housing come within the purview of the states. Undoubtedly, what was lacking was a framework of agreements between the states and the Commonwealth to ensure that the needs of such young people are dealt with holistically. I am pleased to say that, as a result of a fairly protracted but very useful process of negotiation, we have achieved a protocol framework. We have already signed agreements with both New South Wales and the Northern Territory. We expect to conclude similar agreements with the remaining states and territories in the next few weeks. I believe that will give us a much better way of approaching and meeting the needs of these young people where all arms of the government and, for that matter, the non-government sector can be brought effectively to bear. Immigration Review Tribunal",72
58,Mr BEALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a Victorian and as keeper of the public purse, is the Treasurer aware of the following scandalous details affecting the expenditure of $1 million per year? I refer Treasurer to the recent appointments of Mr Italiano, Ms Kosky and Mr Head to highly paid positions in the Immigration Review Tribunal by the Commonwealth government. Does the minister know that Mr Italiano, Ms Kosky and Mr Head are all pre-selected Labor candidates for the Victorian parliament? Does he approve of the use of taxpayers' money to provide interim jobs for boys and girls of the Labor Party? Does the Treasurer agree that there might be some common pattern to these recent appointments and is he prepared to have his department investigate these appointments by the immigration minister?",73
59,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These appointments, if they are such, are matters for the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs-not for me. The questions as to why he made those appointments are appropriately addressed to him. Economy: Business Investment",73
60,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer to the business investment figures in today's national accounts which show growth of 0.7 per cent in the June quarter. Does this represent the underlying level of business investment? How does this compare with the budget forecast?,73
61,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"lam aware that the business investment figures that came out today are, on the face of it, very low. We had a figure of 0.7 per cent growth in investment, as the member for Melbourne mentioned in his question. We had a figure of minus 0.6 per cent growth in investment in plant and equipment. Those figures are not giving us a true indication of what is happening to business investment for one reason. That reason is the sale of the Gladstone power station in the March quarter. It was a sale of second-hand equipment, in a sense, from the public to the private sector. Once you unwind from that and look at what is happening to new investment in plant and equipment, you get a totally different picture. That different picture shows that in the June quarter there was an increase in business investment in plant and equipment by the the private sector of 13.4 per cent. That is the underlying position for business investment. It shows that total business investment increased in the June quarter by 10.7 per cent, which is again abstracting from the sale of the Gladstone power station. So these are very comforting figures indeed in that they show that business investment is coming on strongly. The capital expenditure figures, which were announced last week, showing the rise in business investment in the June quarter, are in the national accounts for all to see. Of course, those capital expenditure figures show strong expectations of increased business investment in 1994-95. Today's figures, of course, are just further confirmation of the fact that business investment is picking up strongly, and we can therefore expect those budget forecasts, which caused such expressions of disbelief at the time, to be quite achievable. I remind the House that the budget forecast for business investment was a 141h per cent increase and for plant and equipment it was 18 1h per cent. This caused a lot of headlines about gambling on growth. The headline in the Herald-Sun was 'Willis spots Utopia'. I do not want to claim that Utopia has arrived-I would not be so crass as to do thatbut I can say that the budget forecasts on business investment look very achievable. Given those strong rates of growth in the June quarter, and given the fact that we have that expectation material out there, those business investment figures now look very achievable indeed. Business investment is picking up under all the influences that we have been pointing to whilst the opposition has been saying, 'Nothing's going to happen. It's all heroic assumption. It's dark clouds. This is the great hole in the budget,' et cetera. The great hole they were hoping would arrive is not going to arrive because the fundamentals of the economy are so strong and so conducive to increased business investment that it is no wonder we are now seeing that recovery coming through. I remind the House of the sorts of things which are producing this kind of investment outcome: the strong level of demand, which is there in the national account figures; the low inflation; the low interest rates; the levels of business confidence; the fact that business is very internationally competitive now and able to export in a way which it could not have conceived 10 years or so ago-certainly for the manufacturing and service industries that is increasingly so-the low levels of wage increase; considerable productivity improvement; tax incentives for increased investment by way of the improved depreciation allowances, the investment allowance, the development allowance, the reduction in company tax rates; and the very substantial incentives for industry research and development, which I am pleased to see is now producing considerable increases in private sector research and development expenditure. It is no wonder we are seeing this investment take off. We can expect in 1994-95 the budget forecasts on investment will be very substantially met, if not exceeded. Made in Australia Labelling",73
62,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. The issue of labelling laws is crucial to Australia's agricultural business, which is worth about $48 million per year and provides jobs for more than a million Australians. Is the minister listening to the point of view of consumers out there who are demanding truth in regard to what 'Made in Australia' means? Does the minister now agree, as a result of all those people who have responded to her invitation of an open door, that her proposed changes to the Trade Practices Act will erode the community's understanding of what 'Made in Australia' means? To avoid such confusion, what action will she take to ensure that 'Made in Australia' means exactly thatmade in Australia?",74
63,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Mallee is one of those people who responded to my invitation to see anyone at all who had any problem with this legislation. I went to his electorate, and I feel very sure that I understand all the concerns that were put to me at that time. Mr Acting Speaker, I acknowledge your generosity-to the opposition and to me-in taking a question on this high matter at the moment, because tomorrow a Senate committee is to report on it. The only delay has been caused by constant requests by members of the opposition, not by public opposition. They cannot make up their own minds on this question and are dying to do something against this legislation but cannot yet find the reason, so they make constant requests for delays. First of all they asked that it go to a House of Representatives committee and a Senate committee. I agreed. Then the new spokesperson for the opposition asked that there be delay in the debate. I agreed. Then they asked for further delay until the next session. I have agreed at every step of the way to every request. Let us now go to the amount of opposition on 'Made in Australia' that has been referred to. It is alleged often that everyone out there has a view on what 'Made in Australia' means. We explained to people that we are not changing the current meaning of 'Made in Australia'. We then found that people, particularly in the area which the honourable member for Mallee represents, were terrorised by people who peddled the most misleading information about this legislation. For instance, during a radio interview John Corboy of SPC told people that orange juice that contained imported Brazilian concentrate would be able to be labelled 'Made in Australia'. As I pointed out to the Leader of the National Party, as I pointed out to all those people in that electorate, and as people now recognise, under the current law it is illegal. It certainly will still be illegal under the law that is to operate. People then say, 'Well, there are all these surveys that are being done on it.' Let me go to the surveys. I keep saying, 'Show me the surveys.' Surveys were done by The Investigators and A Current Affair, whose reporters walked along the street with a can of jam and a jar of peanut butter and asked their questions in relation to food. Another survey was done on Australia All Over through a phonein by Macka, who asked about food. I clarified the situation for him. The other survey was apparently commissioned by SPC. Every question in the SPC survey related to food. Even that research showed that less than half of those sampled agreed with the position proclaimed as gospel by SPC and its supporters that 'Made in Australia' means 100 per cent Australian ingredients. I will say-not for the first time and I am sure not for the last-that the labelling legislation applies to all consumer goods sold in Australia which make a claim to being Australian. If there are any problems in relation to food-and so far only three have been put to me-the National Food Authority has the role, the responsibility and the duty to add whatever extra requirements for food that it so pleases. League of Rights",74
64,Mr HOLDING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. The minister would be aware that in the publication entitled Final Budget Outcome 1993-94, tabled in the House last week, we saw that a figure of $1,964 million was paid by the federal government to non-profit institutions. Can the minister inform the House whether an organisation called the League of Rights qualified for a grant under the criteria laid down for such allocations by the government? If not, is the minister aware of any representations made on behalf of the league by members of the House?",75
65,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Opposition members interjecting Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Acting Speaker, I take a point of order understanding order 144 and on two counts. Clearly, the matter must properly be within the jurisdiction of the minister. Whilst a bit of a smokescreen down that path was mounted by the member, it is outside his jurisdiction. Secondly, you are the custodian of the standards of question time in this House. As such, I ask you to be mindful of that in considering whether this question is in order.",75
66,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I find that the question is in order.,75
67,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought that you would have taken the advice of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to Dr Hewson. As far as I heard the other day, he was talking about 'fair cop'. I would have thought there was a degree of 'fair cop' involved in all of this. I am aware of a particular possibility that arises from the honourable member's questions because, having seen Laurie Oakes's article in the Bulletin today, I expect representations from the romper stompers opposite at any time soon. Mr Oakes had this to say in an article headed 'The real Downer can't stand up'. He reports on the leagueMr Tim Fischer- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am actually relaxed about this subject matter, but I ask you to consider",75
68,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Government members interjecting Mr Tim Fischer-I am perfectly relaxed, and so is Alexander.",75
69,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Those on my right will be quiet. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Acting Speaker, standing order 145 is a very clear-cut direction to you in the conduct of question time. From your undoubted experience, you understand the jurisdiction of the Minister for Finance. You heard the question by the member for Melbourne Ports. Clearly, the answer is irrelevant, even to that question. I ask that you order accordingly.",75
70,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the House, the Minister for Finance, will answer the question. He will go to the answer",76
71,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Absolutely. In answer to the question which deals with whether or not I was receiving representations on the matter, this is why I suspect that I may receive some. The article quotes the league's journal, On target, in which the league reports: The excellent South Australian seminar, where former shadow minister Alexander Downer opened with a brilliant paper on the defence of the tution, followed by an outstanding action seminar the following day, indicated the shape of things to come. It did, of course, because, subsequent to that, we had a letter from the then shadow minister but now Leader of the Opposition explaining his support for citizen initiated referendums. Mr Thckey- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 145, the Minister for Finance has some fairly confined duties relating to the finances and the budget of the Commonwealth. This is an attempt to go well outside his duties as laid down by the standing orders. I therefore ask you to rule-I underline the word 'rule' - that he is out of order and that he should cease this answer because it is outside his responsibility in this regard. I ask for your ruling on that matter.",76
72,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"--t.1r Acting Speaker, on that point of order: I would have thought it was manifestly the case that representations related to expenditures are within my portfolio.",76
73,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! At the time the question was asked, a point of order was raised by the Leader of the National Party. I ruled that the question was in order. At the time the honourable member for O'Connor rose to his feet to raise a point of order, the minister was getting to the point where he was talking about representations that he had received. Mr Costello- Mr Acting Speaker, on the point of order: I take it that your ruling is",76
74,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,76
75,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Those on my right will remain silent. Mr Costello-that the minister can outline to the House representations that he has received. To that extent and that extent only, rather than reading out items and articles from magazines, he may proceed to answer the question.",76
76,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will proceed to answer the question. Mr Costello interjecting,76
77,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I cannot preempt what he is about to say.,76
78,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed I will. One of the constiexplanations that the honourable member's staffers had for the propositions put forward by the Leader of the Opposition was that he was very young at the time-that is, your age. Mr Thckey-On a further point of order, relating partly to my previous point of order: Mr Acting Speaker, I asked you for a ruling which, because of the intervention of the Minister for Finance, you have not given. I put the proposition to you that this answer is out of order. I now ask you to rule on that matter.",76
79,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member will resume his seat. The answer is in order. Mr Thckey-Is that your ruling?,76
80,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is my ruling. NA,76
81,Mr TUCKEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,I move: That the Acting Speaker's ruling be dissented from.,76

86,Mr TUCKEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"For some time now, and on many other occasions, I have stood in this place seeking rulings relating to the standing orders of this parliament. The standing orders are clear and have huge precedent which has been established over a great deal of time by many Speakers, including, sir, your father.",77
87,Unknown,OBJECTION TO RULING,Government members interjecting,77
88,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! Those on my right witt remain silent.,77
89,Mr TUCKEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The simple fact is that the most fundamental of those standing orders relates firstly to questions and the right of persons to ask questions according to the standing orders. Standing order 142 states: Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he is officially connected, to proceedings pending in the House, or to any matter of administration for which he is responsible. There would be considerable doubt that the question, even drafted as it was, was covered by that standing order. But, once a question passes that test, the next requirement is that the answer be relevant to the question. The matter related to finances of the Commonwealth. It is absolutely ridiculous, therefore, for the Minister for Finance to stand up in here-or for you, Mr Acting Speaker, to tolerate such a situation-within seconds of the question being asked, and try to read to this House an extract from the Bulletin. The minister has other opportunities in this regard. If there is any suggestion that this is a matter we wish to avoid, he has a dozen opportunities as a minister to raise the matter in the House. For example, he can make a ministerial statement or he can raise the matter in the various debating forums that we have, but of course not. Those opposite choose to use question time to raise such matters because they think they might get a little more exposure and, more importantly, because it takes up and wastes the time of this House. That is fundamental to my objection in this case.",77
90,Unknown,OBJECTION TO RULING,Government members interjecting,77
91,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order!,77
92,Mr TUCKEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"We have all this yowling and shouting on the other side, but this is a fundamental plea for the parliament to be run properly by the Speaker of this House. As I said, it is interesting to note that sitting in the chair today is a man whose father would have dealt with this matter very quickly by ruling it out of order. There is a heap of written precedent to that effect, if anybody has the sense to go back even that far in the Hansard of this place. Mr Lavarch interjecting",77
93,Mr TUCKEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I put it to you, Mr Acting Speaker, that it is not your job to sit here and protect the interests of various ministers; it is to protect the interests of the parliament. I note the interjection by the Attorney-General. You are such a smart alec on standing orders that your department lost a case on immigration simply because you do not understand the commitments you make when you sign international conventions. When I raised that, properly, in this place, you bleated out, 'We're appealing!' We will wait and see how your appeal goes. You have a drug importer in this country whom you cannot even deport. You have and you know it. You know what I am talking about. So don't give us your treatment as to how smart you are. You cannot even win cases in your own department, so we do not take you as being knowledgeable on the standing orders. Mr Acting Speaker, the fact is that, in this regard, I believe your ruling is out of order. You have available to you the Hansard notes. You know that the minister is not answering the question and I suggest to you that before this debate continues you call for the question. You will have no trouble getting one because the minister would have a copy of it. Government members never write their own questions; they are all written by ministers. Mr Acting Speaker, when you see a copy of the question, you will realise that the minister is not answering the question. As such, Mr Acting Speaker, you are wrong to rule as you did. Those are the grounds for my dissent. I ask you to at least reconsider that ruling and to maintain the principles of your father in your high office in the chair.",77
94,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Is the motion seconded?,77
95,Mr REITH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I second the motion. I will not detain the House for long. Mr Acting Speaker, what we have had today in your ruling and in the set piece tactic from the government is a cameo perfonnance in the abuse of question time which, unfortunately, most Australians are now very much used to. Mr Acting Speaker, I will relate the exact details of the question to you as best as I can remember them. The member asked the Minister for Finance about the 1993-94 budget outcomes of something just short of $2 billion being allocated to non-profit organisations. The member then went on to ask whether or not the minister may have received representations to make a payment to the League of Rights organisation. As we all know, this is simply a government tactic to get up and heap abuse on the opposition and to attempt to make some general claim about the political character of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). That is all it is. It is far removed from this government's obligations in question time. Those obligations are very simple: you are to account to the Australian people for your stewardship of the Australian government. You have consistently-week in, week out and day in, day out-taken the opportunity in question time not to do your duty, not to give the Australian people an account of your stewardship of government, but to stand there and tip buckets on the opposition. There is nothing in it. We know there is nothing in it. You know that there is nothing in it. In fact, the minister clearly told the story for all to see. As he came to the dispatch box to answer the question, he had a wide smile on his face because he knew that this was a classic plaything of the government in question time. Furthennore, just to reveal the absolute paucity and triviality of this question, we find in the minister's response that he has never received a representation for a payment to the League of Rights. We all know that, just as you would never pay it a cent, we would never pay it a cent either. The whole thing is an absolute joke from start to finish. The only serious aspect of the whole thing is this: when confronted with an obvious political ploy, with a question which, in itself, probably breached the standing orders-we will put that aside; we are used to that-and with a proper point of order as to whether or not the answer was relevant to a question, and after repeated points of order, you had an opportunity to require the minister to finish his silly little game and to sit down. You ruled that the answer was in order when it was clearly out of order and clearly in breach of the standing orders. You ought to have put us beyond the complete waste of time which this question has produced by ruling in favour of the opposition. Furthennore, you ought to have simply had the plain, common, good sense to say to the minister, 'It is about time you wound up and sat down.' Mr Acting Speaker, we dissent from your ruling. We do not overplay the importance of the matter.",78
96,Unknown,OBJECTION TO RULING,Government members interjecting,78
97,Mr REITH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"As I say, it is a classic cameo perfonnance. The constant interjections from government members are also part of the ploy. I put it to you, Mr Acting Speaker, that any reasonable person listening objectively to the government's tactics and to your compliance with its silly tactics would support the motion moved by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey).",78
98,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"If the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) had been in a Munich beer hall in the 1920s, based on our experience of him to this point, he would have said that he was there for the beer. That is precisely the presentation that he has given of himself in this case. He was there with the League of Rights to address a Christian youth group-that is the interpretation-and he was there because he was too young; that is, the age of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). The opposition leader inspired great energy on the part of the league when he was there because evidently the league felt constrained to write that his speech was followed by 'an outstanding action seminar the following day indicating the shape of things to come'. At least in those days he was inspirational; he is having some problem with it now. We had the opposition spokesman on defence, or whatever he is now, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), stand up here today and indicate that the question was part of a ploy; the heckling of the opposition's motion was part of a ploy. In other words, its motion was part of a ploy to get all these matters on the public record. In answer to that, and in answer to the substantive points that allegedly have been raised here on standing orders, quite obviously any matters relating to public expenditure can be addressed to me as Minister for Finance. Any matters associated with representations or potential representations-it depends on the way in which they are phrasedcan be addressed to me as a minister. Whether or not my answers were within that framework, you would not know, because the only part of the answer that I got out before this motion was moved was a statement as to why I could have expected representations arising from an article. You do not know whether what I was going to say subsequently would come within the standing orders or not, but I would have said manifestly that that particular opening remained within standing orders. I am not surprised that the opposition is treating this matter as it is at the moment. True to the form of that organisation, it has been following a jackboot policy in dealing with its backbench during the course of the last week. Yesterday we saw the performance of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has been heckling and intervening on this matter. He was talking to the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who led the opposition for about three or four years, about a 'fair cop'. He said, 'You've been lurking around the back blocks chatting about our leader. It is a fair cop that you are now removed from the front bench.' When you appear on platforms of the League of Rights and address those matters, it is a fair cop if those matters are raised appropriately in question time. It is a fair cop! It is a particularly fair cop when a lot of people on your side of the House have actually spent some time dealing with the League of Rights in their party organisations. I wonder whether the outstanding action that followed your speech, referred to by Eric Butler, was the sort of outstanding action that caused Senator Boswell to write, 'We must be careful to examine in great detail any proposals backed by the league which alter the present shape of our parliamentary political system.' Mr Rocher- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister clearly is not speaking to the motion of dissent. He is speaking to the matter which gave rise to the motion of dissent; he is arguing a case and not addressing the motion. I ask that you ask him to address the motion.",78
99,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The minister will come to the motion of dissent.,79
100,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"To that point of order, Mr Acting Speaker: during his remarks the honourable member for O'Connor referred extensively to representations made in relation to the Attorney-General, which seemed to be a fair way off the point. During the remarks of the seconder, there was extensive discussion about the government in question time.",79
101,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The minister will continue the debate and address his remarks to the dissent motion.,79
102,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"It was an amply fair cop as far as that was concerned. The fact of the matter is that in question time, when a minister stands to answer a question that is . absolutely and emphatically within the framework of his portfolio, as is this one, however the minister chooses to introduce information that lends weight to the material he puts in his answers is a matter entirely for him. The minister could, for example, on a matter like this, point out that outstanding action referred to in the newspaper that might have caused the member for Gippsland to write: The League of Rights is the most obvious exponent of the art of racism. Mr Tim Fischer-Tell us about the Fabian Society.",79
103,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Maybe the former Leader of the National Party of Australia, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), is right: I can assure you that in no way and at no time was my party. and I know certainly not the Liberal Party, condoning the policy of the League of Rights. Mr Andrews- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order in similar terms to the one the honourable member for Curtin raised before and following which you gave a direction to the Leader of the House to come back to the substance of the motion. Not only is he not doing that; he is simply repeating that which you ruled he ought not address in the substance of his remarks. I ask you to call him back to the motion or sit him down.",79
104,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"All contributors to this debate have covered matters that are incidental to the dissent motion, but I ask the minister to come back to the dissent motion.",80
105,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,I was just heckled by the Leader of the National Party.,80
106,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I encourage the minister to ignore the interjections, to address his remarks through the chair and to go to the debate.",80
107,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"He asked me, 'Tell us about the Fabian Society?' When you are in a public meeting, are being questioned by the League of Rights, and happen to be a member of the Labor Party, the first question you receive is: are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Fabian Society? I have been questioned by members of the League of Rights, absolutely. I had the experience of going to Geraldton and having to explain to its citizens why we were building a defence spy facility near Geraldton, and who should tum up but the great team from the League of Rights asking me whether or not the facility was connected to the Deakin computer. Yes, I know what sorts of questions you get from the members of the League of Rights when they rock into town to address you. Do not worry about that. I know all about it. I am surprised to find that in this place I am questioned by the Leader of the National Party with the standard opening question of a member of the League of Rights to a member of the Australian Labor Party. Anyway, this gets better and better. I move on. The fact of the matter is that as ministers, when we consider the range of issues within our portfolios, we are obliged to make political judgments about the sorts of matters that come before us that are within the framework of our responsibility. Those political judgments include the state of opinion in the electorate, the sources of opinions in the electorate and what is likely to come before us. Nothing is more likely to come before us in this expenditure area than organisations which convey themselves in a manner which suggests they perform an educative task for the public. The League of Rights, as is quite evident from the article Mr Oakes wrote, is definitely one of those organisations that say they have an educative function to perform.",80
108,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The minister will come back to the dissent motion.,80
109,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I would have thought that having an educative function to perform would have been the way to expect a nongovernment organisation to be assigned money. Part of the educative function was performed in this particular debate in a discussion by Eric Butler. The 78-year-old Christian youth worker who headed up the meeting, which the Leader of the Opposition addressed, had this to say when asked whether or notMr Downer-It wasn't.",80
110,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"It was Mr Lee, was it? When it was suggested that perhaps the Leader of the Opposition did not know about it, Eric Butler said, 'Oh, absolutely no argument about that, because I took the opportunity of pointing out I knew his late father extremely well.' Mr Acting Speaker, your review of the question and your handling of the interventions to the point when this motion was moved were clearly within the framework of standing orders. Having had the opportunity to read into the public record all that I was going to say in answer to that question, I did have some doubt in my mind in the course of my answer whether or not I would remain relevant to your rulings. I had some doubt in my mind as to whether or not that was going to be possible. Fortunately, Mr Acting Speaker, before you were placed in a position where your rulings could conceivably have lent weight to an argument about whether or not your ruling on these matters was within the framework of standing orders, this incredibly defensive organisation opposite, which lectures its backbench on the subject of fair cops, managed to get itself on its scrapers and into this place to disrupt the point of my answer when I was very likely to be, and emphatically, within standing orders. That is precisely what it has managed to do. What we have in this situation is an embarrassed opposition. The motive behind this motion is an incredibly defensive operation by the opposition front-bench gathering around its severely damaged leader. I made the mistake on Monday of describing the Leader of the Opposition as a man of strong views weakly held. That was possibly a mistake. I now suspect that he is a man of weird views strongly held. No more evidence is provided than the fact that he followed up his brilliant performance on constitutional matters at Eric's little gathering with a letter to others the Liberal Party about how important it was to bring down citizens initiated referenda. Mr Acting Speaker, you were not obliged, at any point in time, to rule me out of order on anything that I had managed to say to the point when this motion was moved. Therefore, the motion has no standing. It is not a motion that can conceivably be carried by the House. I move: That the motion be now put. Question resolved in the affirmative. Original question resolved in the negative. NA League of Rights",80
111,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Absolutely in conclusion, I thank the House for allowing me to get my answer out. Airports: Privatisation",81
112,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. The minister will be aware that, under the Federal Airports Corporation Act, provision can be made for casino and gambling facilities at FAC airports and, in fact, such a facility exists now at the Sydney international terminal. If the FAC airports are sold, will this provision be lost? Is that a reason why the government is now looking at leasing airports? Will the minister confirm whether former Prime Minister Hawke is advising the government or independent firms on this aspect of airport privatisation, as previous plans for a casino had been promoted at the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport?",81
113,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can inform the House that I have not contemplated casinos in a privatised FAC, or indeed in an FAC in its current structure. The gentleman referred to in the last part of the honourable member's question-the former Prime Ministercertainly has not been advising me. Other than that I cannot advise the House of anything on the subject. Individual Rights: Role of Courts",81
114,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Attorney-General aware of comments by the Premier of Tasin mania criticising the role of our courts in determining the appropriate balance between the responsibilities of governments and the rights of individuals? Is there any basis for this criticism?,81
115,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen reports in the Tasmanian media today, in the Mercury, reporting comments from the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Groom, apparently at a schools constitutional convention in Hobart yesterday. The Premier made a number of comments, particularly about the High Court, which to my mind to some extent are offensive to the role of the High Court and to the quality of the justices on the court and simply wrong in terms of the role of the court. Firstly, the Premier stated that the judges of the High Court are little more than simple political appointees, implying that they operate by way of party political bias. I totally reject that. I think that any member of this House who has any understanding of the role of the High Court or the quality of the judges who make up the High Court would also reject those assertions. I notice that the Tasmanian Law Society has also taken great issue with the Premier on those comments. He then went on to talk about the role of the High Court and made this rather interesting statement. He is reported in the newspaper as saying: He said that more and more the High Court was coming down with decisions favouring the commonwealth when its job was to protect the states. Of course the High Court's job is not to protect the states. It is not to protect the Commonwealth. The High Court's job in terms of constitutional matters is to determine whether a law of this parliament is within the particular heads of power given by the constitution to this parliament. It is to determine whether laws of a state parliament are inconsistent or not with a valid Commonwealth law and it is to determine whether laws of either the states or the Commonwealth infringe the expressed or implied immunities or guarantees contained in the constitution. In fairness to the Tasmanian Premier I should say that in the past he has made some statements about the roles of judges and courts which I can associate myself with. Indeed, as a member of this House, as the former member for Braddon, in speaking to the House on the question of police powers and the appropriate balance between police powers and individual rights, the Tasmanian Premier had this to say: Judges must sharpen their recognition of the importance of the privacy of a person's house and private property and must never allow any powers to be oppressively or unreasonably applied. He went on in this same speech to say: It is always dangerous to make moral judgments, but it is particularly dangerous for officials to make moral judgments about someone's conduct ... In this country we are governed by the rule of law and not by the prejudices of other people. Those statements about the rule of law and the role of courts, unlike his statements yesterday, I think members of this House should heartily agree with. He concluded his speech to this House with this call to arms, if you like: As members of parliament, we must ensure in dealing with legislation that we never overlook the rights of individuals ... If we forget the rights of individuals, we shall pay an enormous price. These are the comments of the Tasmanian Premier. He might think, at one stage, to apply those fine sentiments, which he expressed so forthrightly to this House, to his current position as Premier of Tasmania and to those offensive laws which still exist within the Tasmanian criminal code. I noticed in the rather infamous article written by Mr Oakes, which the opposition seems a bit sensitive about, that there were also comments about a private conversation between the Leader of the Opposition and the Tasmanian Premier where reputedly the leader told him that he did not think very highly of these laws in Tasmania. Mr Downer-I said it publicly.",81
116,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has both publicly and privately expressed those views. But it is not enough simply to hold these views and not enough simply to utter these views, as the Tasmanian Premier did, to this House when he was a member of it. It is not enough simply to hold those views. Sometimes you have to act on them; sometimes you have to vote according to those views. We will shortly have that opportunity in this House. Let us see what the Leader of the Opposition does about his sentiments on that occasion. Let us hope that the Tasmanian Premier adopts his own words and acts through his government and his parliament to repeal those obnoxious provisions. Republic",82
117,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Attorney-General aware of a poll in last week's Bulletin showing that 51 per cent of Australians oppose and only 32 per cent support a referendum proposing a president elected by the parliament? Does the minister agree with the Victorian Labor leader, Mr Brumby, that 'you'll never get a republic through a referendum '? Does the minister agree with the member for Lalor and ALP National President that the minimalist position is dead? What new and more radical options does the government now have in mind?",82
118,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A ministerial committee comprising the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, some other ministers and me is currently considering the government's response to the Turnbull committee's report on the options for an Australian republic. Obviously, the position of the government is well known. It is the position of the Australian Labor Party and the government that the head of state of Australia should be an Australian citizen and that as a result Australia should move to a republican model. We obviously also acknowledge that these are extremely important issues for the Australian people. They will not be taken lightly and they certainly will not be accepted by the Australian people without a long period public debate and public consideration of the issues and all the options involved. I am surprised that public opinion polls-and I have seen numerous polls on the issue over the last few years-show strong support for a republic in some polls and support by less than a majority of the population in other policy. polls. I imagine that we will see more of these polls over the next few years. The ministerial committee will decide its position on this matter and no doubt the Prime Minister will announce the result of its deliberations when he and the committee are well and ready. Income Tax Law",82
119,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Assistant Treasurer inform the House what progress has been made in simplifying the income tax law?,83
120,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Oxley for his question. I am happy to say that has been progress made in this direction. give the House an example of the current tax law, I will read one of its provisions: A car is a predecessor of a second car if a third car is a predecessor of the second car and the first mentioned car is a predecessor of the third car, including a case where the first mentioned car predecessor of the third car by another application or applications of this paragraph. That is an example of what is in the law now. I am happy to inform the House that the first draft rewrite of a section of the income tax law has been completed and that that kind language is gone. In fact, the rule has gone completely. Mr Costello-How long has that been in?",83
121,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to your question, it is the sort of sentence that, if the words not so big, the Leader of the National Party might write. The rewrite is part of a three year project to rewrite in plain English 5,000 pages of income tax law. Today I am releasing the first draft of the tax law improvement project dealing with the rules of substantiation. This issue affects seven out of 10 taxpayers, and the draft bill completely rewrites the substantiation laws. Mr Rocher- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister is announcing of policy. I wonder whether he would care to make a statement to the parliament so that it not can be debated. This is a gross abuse of methods in order to avoid debate in this place. I suggest that he be enjoined to do that.",83
122,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I took it that the minister was not announcing new,83
123,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In actual fact, I am not. You can see why they are still sitting on the opposition benches. They do not know the difference between policy and a rewrite of the tax laws. The simple fact is that this rewrite of the tax laws was announced last year. What I am saying today is that this is the first instalment of that rewrite. For the benefit of the House, I can say that the bill does not read like a normal bill. For the first time in the Commonwealth law, we have used direct personal language. The word 'you' is used instead of the formal sort of there language that no-one but tax lawyers can To comprehend. Importantly, the rewrite of the substantiation provisions of the tax laws has half the number of words. The bill makes a number of changes which will reduce the compliance costs. We have is a simplified the operation of many of the rules, particularly for log books. We have thrown out unnecessary rules and rules that are hopelessly difficult for taxpayers and have marginal gains for revenue. An example of that is laundry expenses. Currently, people of have to keep a diary in which they have to note the number of scoops of washing powder used, the amount of the wash that is work related, the number of washes and the amount of electricity used. All of that is stupid. We have replaced it with a draft law which allows were up to $150 with no need for receipts. Some 3 11l million taxpayers will benefit from reduced compliance costs due to this measure alone. The bill is now available for public consultation before it is introduced into the parliament by the end of the year. Even the honourable member for Curtin, if he wants to, can make a contribution in this regard. It will cover expenses paid after 30 June 1995. In conclusion, the government is determined to lower compliance costs. This is the first instalment in the rewrite of the tax laws which will be in plain English and which will significantly reduce compliance costs. Mr Costello-When will they be rewritten?",83
124,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In three years, for your benefit. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Acting Speaker, I invite the Assistant Treasurer to table his mischievous and misleading notes.",84
125,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Were they private notes?,84
126,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. Taxation: Families,84
127,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the Minister for Social Security agree with the figures in a letter I have from a constituent in my electorate? This family, with one member on a jobsearch allowance of $530.60 per fortnight, pays an annual tax of $447.13 a year after deductions of the tax threshold and the dependent spouse rebate but with the addition of the Medicare levy. However, does the minister realise that this family's tax will now increase by $151.67 a year to $598.80 after the partner allowance is introduced and the dependent spouse rebate is abolished? Does the minister also realise that the introduction of the partner allowance, at $265.30 per fortnight, tips this family over the threshold of $250.85 to be eligible to receive home child-care allowance, even though a single income family earning, say, $100,000 a year would be eligible to receive this grant? Why should the unemployed family be discriminated against in this way? Will you change the legislation to correct these glaring anomalies? Will you also modify your advertising program to make it truthful?",84
128,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The restructuring of assistance to families with the introduction of the home child-care allowance is a decision which is overwhelmingly beneficial to low income families. As I pointed out the other day, there is a great deal of misinformation about that. In actual fact, the major beneficiaries or the ones who really stand to gain a lot are people whose taxable income is so low that they cannot benefit fully from the operation of the dependent spouse rebate but will be able to benefit fully from the operation of the home child-care allowance. In respect of the introduction of the partner allowance, unemployed couples who receive the partner allowance wi\1 not be able to receive the home child-care allowance because of the operation of the income test on the home child-care allowance itself. But the inability to do that will be offset by the availability of a tax rebate for the partner which will effectively protect that partner from having to pay tax. I undertake to look at the specific example that the honourable member brings up, but the reality is that the changes we have introduced represent a net increase in Commonwealth budgetary impact of $230 million over and above the dependent with child rate of dependent spouse rebate that it replaces, and that benefit goes overwhelmingly to low income families. Since this government has been in office there has been a huge increase in additional family payment or the family allowance supplement that preceded it which is specifically targeted at low income families. For a family with a child below the age of 13, there has been of the order of a 100 per cent real increase in family assistance provided that way. For those with children between the ages of 13 and 15, there has been of the order of a 150 per cent real increase in that targeted assistance for those low income families, including unemployed families. That has taken place as a result of the measures this government has taken. So the basic premise of the honourable member's question that the measures we have taken in the family assistance area disadvantage low income families is demonstrably false; the reverse is true. That is the reality of the case. Copyright",84
129,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister for Justice advise the House of the implications for copyright legislation arising from the report of the Copyright Convergence Group?,85
130,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. Last Friday I received the Copyright Convergence Group's final report, Highways to change. That group was established to report back to me on reforms which may be necessary to update the act and to render aspects of it techto nologically neutral. The group's report advocates the most far-reaching and substantial reform to the Copyright Act in more than a decade. When this legislation was enacted 25 years ago the major forms of communication were transistor radios, black and white televisions and a postal service made slow by the transport of the time. A year later, millions watched the moon landing as it happened via satellite. Today, messages and images are transmitted instantaneously on vast information networks which span the globe. Reform of the act is essential to prepare for new satellite and cable TV services and the advent of broadband digital forms of information delivery, often referred to as the telecommunications superhighway. Highways to change contains 15 key recommendations for urgent reform. The two which will be of most interest to members are the introduction of a technologically neutral broad based transmission right and the redefinition of the right to broadcast to bring it into line with the Broadcasting Services Act. Interestingly, members who were watching the National Press Club speech by the member for Lalor, the President of the Labor Party, would have noted that he said that the information industry has represented the single most important area for Australia to focus on in terms of our export growth and the potential for new industry development. I think, in that context, I can only repeat that these new convergence technologies do have exactly that potential to strengthen the local economy and links between Australia and the global economy. My colleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, is committed to developing the potential of these new convergence technologies with the aim of enhancing our export markets. This government has recognised that Australia must put new communications technology to work to help us overcome the tyranny of distance, which has blighted us as a trading nation in the past. But, of course, as we learn to use new technologies as a tool of trade, we must simultaneously put in place a legal framework protect our intellectual property products. For their assistance to government and for their timely report for a blueprint of this kind, I would like to congratulate members of the Copyright Convergence Group: Ms Victoria Rubensohn, Professor Mark Armstrong, Peter Banki and Malcolm Colless; and the coordinators of the group, Bridget Godwin and assistant, Marea Allen. Like the times we live in, the Copyright Act has to change. This government will waste no time in responding to the challenges set out by the member for Lalor, and known very well to this government, in responding to the Highways to change report.",85

138,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I move: That: (I) The following general principles upon which there should be determined the days upon which, and the periods during which, the proceedings of the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be broadcast, as specified by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings in its report dated May 1994, be adopted with effect from 5 September 1994 in place of the general principles previously adopted by both Houses: PROPOSED GENERAL PRINCIPLES RELATING TO mE RADIO BROADCASTING NA . I. Days upon which proceedings shall be broadcast and their allocation between the Senate and the House of Representatives. The proceedings of Parliament shall be broadcast on each day on which either House is sitting. While there will be a usual allocation of broadcasts between the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings or its Sub-Committee shall take into account the importance of the impending debate and the public interest attaching thereto in deciding on the allocation. It is anticipated that, over time, the coverage of each House will be approximately equal. 2. Rebroadcast of questions and answers. (a) The following Parliamentary Proceedings shall be rebroadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation at the conclusion of the broadcast of live proceedings from either House unless otherwise ordered by the Committee: Senate proceedings-Questions without notice and answers thereto; House of Representatives proceedingsQuestions without notice and answers thereto; (b) The rebroadcast shall be of the House that is not allocated the broadcast; (c) When a member makes a personal explanation in rebuttal of misrepresentation contained in a question asked that day or an answer thereto, the question and answer shall, subject to the next succeeding sub-paragraph, be excluded from the rebroadcast; and (d) The Presiding Officer may, in his or her discretion, refer any case to the Joint Committee for decision as to whether such a question and answer shall be excluded from the rebroadcast. 3. The general principles specified here and adopted by both Houses shall be observed generally by the Joint Committee in making determinations in accordance with the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1946, but nothing in those general principles shall be taken to prevent the Joint Committee from departing from those general principles in order to meet any unusual or special circumstances. (2) A message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution and requesting that it concur and take action accordingly. In May 1994, the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings presented an interim report on the principles relating to radio broadcasting of the proceedings of parliament. The committee advised us about the general principles that should govern broadcasting. Both Houses agreed to the suggested principle that the committee may make determinations on the periods and days of broadcasting in line with those principles. The report stated that the existing principles, which had not been reviewed since the early days of radio broadcasting, need updating to reflect current technical, procedural and community realities. The recommendations include changes to the allocation of days between the House and the Senate, so that regular days of broadcasting would be Monday and Thursday for the House of Representatives and Tuesday and Wednesday for the Senate and, if needed, Friday and Sunday for the House of Representatives and Saturday for the Senate. The proposed determinations also provide for the broadcasting of the adjournment debate on radio, bringing it into line with television broadcasting. The motion proposes that the House adopt the general principles recommended by the committee in relation to the radio broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings and that a message seeking concurrence be sent to the Senate.

STUDENT ASSISTANCE (BUDGET MATTERS) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 29 August, on motion by Mr Free: That the bill be now read a second time.",87
139,Mr MILES,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to continue the debate on the Student ance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill 1994. The background to this bill is the Student Assistance Act 1973, the principal act, which provides for payments and benefits to be given under Austudy and Abstudy schemes and for loan supplements for tertiary students. All of us in this parliament are aware of the great number of students who access Austudy this, I move: and Abstudy. About $1.4 billion is spent on Austudy schemes and about $106 million spent on Abstudy schemes. The major amendments to this bill will allow Austudy and Abstudy recipients who receive a benefit during 1995 or a later year BILL 1994 to repay the whole or part of that benefit at any time during the year. From 1995, Austudy and Abstudy loan supplements will be availa able to students who do not qualify for Austudy or Abstudy benefits because they do not meet the requirements of the spouse income test. They will be eligible for the supplements, provided their spouse's income is less than the prescribed amount. There is a great need in Australia for people living outside university cities and towns to access education. Over the last few years a a large number of people have come to my office to complain about the workings of Austudy. In the past, reports have been tabled Mr in this parliament about the workings of Austudy and some of the difficulties faced by people in this regard. As the shadow minister responsible for this area, I still receive many complaints. People complain about the anomalies of the system, about the inequities and about the lack of justice. That is particua larly so in the case of people in rural and regional Australia. This government claims that it is advocating be that Australia should become the clever country. Yet it has placed major financial hurdles in the way of students being able to access educational opportunities. When we look at this legislation and at some of the hurdles, the question arises: who is really disadvantaged by this legislation? It is those who are least able to afford to meet the enormous costs of sending students to upper secondary institutions and particularly to tertiary institutions-the students themselves Assistand the parents of students. Even the maximum entitlements under Austudy do not go far when paying for books, and fees such as HECS. It is difficult enough for students and parents in urban areas to make the money spin out. However, for students in rural areas the situation is even more critical. To highlight the importance of That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view is to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to act as a matter of urgency to investigate the plight suffered by students in rural and remote areas of Australia and to take action to relieve the severe financial pressure being faced by many such students and their families"". I use this debate to raise the issue in the parliament of the very difficult circumstances in which these people find themselves. I am sure the government appreciates some of the difficulties being experienced out there, but it has failed to address the lack of access that regional and rural students have to tertiary education in particular. To illustrate the point, by the time a family on average weekly earnings of, say, about $25,000 a year pays tax, it is left with approximately $20,000. In regional and rural Australia there is no access to tertiary facilities. If that family, which is living on a net income of $20,000, has two children going off to university-that is not an unreasonable expectation-it will have to find between $15,000 and $18,000 to enable those young people to access tertiary education. Quite a substantial cost is involved when a young person from regional or rural Australia goes away to get a tertiary education. Access is very important to them. This is one of the difficulties for many people living in rural Australia. We must remember the amount of money that is needed for families out there. We know the cut-off point for receiving Austudy is about $35,000. If we work through that using the same sort of figuring, taking the net income down to about $25,000 and accepting that a minimum of $15,000 is required for two youngsters to receive a tertiary education, there is $10,000 left for mum and dad and maybe one or two other children. I know a substantial number of families in my electorate who come across that problem. There are hundreds of families around Australia who face those sorts of difficulties. It is time for us to have a very hard look at the disadvantages faced by young people in rural Australia. This bill will be welcomed by many who will be able to maximise their entitlement to a loan supplement. But it ultimately widens the poverty trap for students by encouraging them to take out supplementary loans. It lets the government off the hook from making the contributions which it would otherwise be making through Austudy. Students must begin to repay their loan within five years unless their income is below the national average earnings. An Austudy loan seems a preferable alternative for parents, especially rural parents, when struggling to give their children a good education, but a few years down the track the debt must be paid. In addition, the very people who are likely to take out the Austudy supplement are also likely to incur a HECS debt so that at the end of their study both of these debts are hanging over their heads. In many respects, we are putting off the evil day. No doubt the government would like to do something about these difficulties, but because of its overall economic strategy, our huge overseas debt and the huge amount of money paid out in interestMr Sawford-Falling.",89
140,Mr MILES,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"The member for Port Adelaide interjects and says that our overseas debt is falling. The only reason that is falling was that the dollar went up. That slight decrease does not make a lot of difference. The fact is this: about $12 to $14 billion is spent paying for our overseas debt. If Australia had that money to use here within the country, our educational and health facilities would be much better. One of the fundamental reasons why the government is not able to move in this area and do something about it is that its overall economic management strategy is not correct. The coalition is concerned that students and parents in rural areas are further disadvantaged by the assets/income test under Austudy. The assets limit is $367,150 or $734,300 for businesses or farms in which the family is substantially engaged. It seems a gross injustice that properties or farms are included under the Austudy assets test, whereas a family home on up to two hectares of surrounding domestic land that is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, in urban areas is exempt from the assets test. There are hundreds of homes in urban areas which are very substantial assets, but people out in the country areas are a long way from anywhere and find it very difficult. This parliament is very much aware at the moment of the effect of drought on these families. I have comments from three people to illustrate the effects of the drought. Peter is one such person who cannot get Austudy because of family assets. He was forced to sell cattle because of drought and interest rates. Slowly, the numbers are building up but the income is very low. He had to withdraw from university to work to raise money to continue. That is a real hardship for young people in regional and rural Australia. That is one of the great disadvantages faced by many of the productive young people and their families out in rural Australia. I believe there is a great need for us as a parliament to address this very important issue. Carina is another person who cannot get Austudy because of her parents' assets. Her parents cannot support her at university. She lives 370 kilometres from TownsvilIe. Her TE score was 925, and she wanted to do physiotherapy or law. She is now a part-time ringer and is on the dole part time. That is the reality for many of our young people in rural and regional Australia. If we canvassed some of the drought affected areas in New South Wales and in Queensland, we would find hundreds of such cases. I will give just one more example. Jenny was also refused Austudy because of the assets test. At present, she is unemployed and living at home. Her father was not able to support her while she studied. As I said, I could go on with hundreds of these examples of young people who are unable to get access to Austudy because of the assets test. Rural people may have assets that ostensibly are valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars on paper but, given the bleak situation for farmers, who will buy them? It is all very well for the government to say, 'These people have substantial assets,' but no doubt the assets have been valued at a time when they were worth much more than they are in the present period of drought. Yet these young people are still missing out on access to education. They often have assets that could not realistically reap any financial return and they have very little disposable income. This is one of the greatest anomalies and inequities of the Austudy system and, undoubtedly, it disadvantages rural students. People in urban areas who may have a considerable investment in an elaborate house and may not be as needy as those in rural areas are often eligible for Austudy at the expense of their rural counterparts who own property which makes them ineligible. The inequities under Austudy undoubtedly serve to disadvantage rural students, and this is reflected in participation rates, particularly at the tertiary level. In 1993 the DEET report Going on to university drew the conclusion: . .. that some areas of imbalance have been uncovered. It appears that students outside the metropolitan area apply for places and receive their offers at much the same rate as metropolitan students, but are then more likely to defer or take no action on their offer. The country students we interviewed highlighted problems of travel, accommodation and finance. A study of the Australian Council for Educational Research entitled 'Entering higher education in the 1980s' was published last year and stressed that, because most institutions of higher education are located in the major cities, enrolling in higher education imposes a greater burden on those from rural areas for at least the reason that non-family accommodation provisions must be written into the equation. The study further says that the effects of these participation patterns on the composition of student populations ensure the over-representation of students from urban backgrounds. The report Rural education crisis, which focused on tertiary participation rates in Victoria, supported this evidence when it showed that only 2.3 per cent of rural students participated in tertiary education compared with 6.9 per cent in the inner Melbourne metropolitan area. I am convinced that the disadvantage and inequities that rural people encounter regarding eligibility for, and the amount of, Austudy entitlement is a major factor in the disproportionate number of urban students compared with rural students attending upper secondary and, to a significant degree, tertiary education. Evidence suggests that those rural students who manage to overcome the financial hurdIes and go on to tertiary education perfonn as well as, if not better than, their urban counterparts. Once rural students become eligible to enter higher education, other things being equal, they participate at somewhat higher rates. This may well be because, where rural students are extremely capable, families are prepared to make all sorts of sacrifices them to continue their education. It might also renect that the most capable students have been beneficiaries of scholarship programs through industry. Whatever the reasons, many hundreds of other rural students would be capable of success at tertiary education if given the opportunity. Rural groups complain that taxation laws allow for averaging of incomes but that the Department of Social Security does not. Rural people were looking forward to the government keeping its 1993 budgetary promise to waive the assets test for those people holding a health care card so that they would qualify for the maximum rate of Austudy, but they were relentlessly duped by the government. We are presently suffering a rural crisis in Australia. Drought conditions cover most of Queensland and central western New South Wales. The fanners and business people from these drought stricken areas are struggling to survive while their dreams for the future lives and education of their children are shattered. Many students in rural areas suffer because of the lack of inequity in regard to access and financial assistance, but they also face many other difficulties, such as isolation. They do not have access to the cultural facilities that many of our young people do in urban areas. They do not have the libraries and the diversity of cultural activities available to people cities and towns. Local employment is much more difficult to get. Incomes on average are lower. Teachers are less experienced and their turnover is far greater for rural students. So right from the very start our rural young people, people from regional Australia, are getting a really tough, raw deal in their education. Ultimately, this often leads to our young people not having the confidence to move away from home. It is not just financial matters that affect their education-there are many other aspects to the problems they face, and it virtually starts from the day they enter school. There is a lack of specialists. Nearly every young person in an urban school would have an opportunity at some stage to have a specialist made available, but that is not the case for our rural or regional young people. Neifor ther are as many high school curriculum options available to them. The high schools in country areas are smaller and our regional young people do not have the diversity of subjects available to them. They are consequently not properly skilled and, therefore, have limited employment opportunities. It is a very difficult situation which young people in rural Australia face. Many of our rural and regional young people have to leave home if they are to get a higher education. Unlike their urban counterparts who can stay at home and maintain their peer social network, rural young people who move away have to support themselves emotionally and socially. While they are on very tight economic constraints, they also have to stand on their own two feet. Overall, we as members of this parliament are not doing enough to improve access to higher education for rural and regional people. We should probably assist people starting at year 11 or year 12, and then for even higher education and no doubt for TAFE as well. I do believe the government has been very tardy as it has not provided the same access to higher education to rural and regional young people that urban young people have available to them. The government owes it to all Australians, particularly to rural people who make up the backbone of this continent, into revise the whole Austudy system to make it equitable and just.",90
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Bruce ScoU-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,92
142,Mr SAWFORD,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Today I rise to speak to the Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill 1994. I must say the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) raised some very valid points about brothers and sisters and their children in rural areas. I am sure it will be found that 1 will acknowledge those needs in my speech here today. I have spoken often about educational issues in this place. I keep raising school retention, early intervention strategies and ever widening access to education for our young people because I sincerely believe the people sitting on the benches opposite-there are a few exceptions-do not have education very high on their political agenda. I believe we cannot speak too often in this place about the importance of educating our young people-increasing their self-confidence, encouraging them to remain in places of learning and ensuring that they move into the real world with skills and knowledge which will enrich both themselves and this country. I have said before that in just over 10 this government has achieved more in education than all of the postwar conservative governments put together. The conservatives have consistently failed to recognise this country's greatest asset: its people and the effect of intellectual growth and skill developdiscount ment on increased productivity, higher standards of living and overall quality of life. In just one decade, since 1983, this government has provided for an increase in higher education places well in excess of 60 per cent. Between 1989 and 1994, an additional 85,000 places in higher education have been created. We have often witnessed members on the benches opposite opposing the changes which have taken place over this period, but that is not surprising. The conservative members opposite often display a serious inability to grasp fully the importance of change in this ever changing world we live in. They are being left behind in the education policy area because they insist on clinging to their fundamental philosophy of opposing change, just for the sake of it. Many are still living in past. I want to spend some time reminding those opposite about the Austudy scheme, because it provides a stark contrast between this government and the former conservative government. In 1983, when the Labor government inherited double digit inflation, double digit unemployment, an economy going backwards and an education system in a mess, just $269 million was spent on Austudy payments or their equivalent. In the last financial year, this government-and it has been acknowledged by the member for Braddon-has increased funds to the AustudyAbstudy and assistance for isolated children schemes to about $1.6 billion. Austudy and higher education funding together now total in excess of $6 billion. That represents a major commitment by this government, particularly when taken as a percentage of total budget outlays. It may be useful to outline briefly again to honourable members some of the eligibility criteria which Austudy recipients must meet to qualify for income support. For families with dependent students, and this was pointed years out by the member for Braddon, there is an assets limit of $369,350. For single independent students, it is $110,000. For married students, it is a combined $156,800. Austudy takes into account the net market value of assets. The scheme also applies a 50 per cent on certain business and farm assets. I will talk more about farm assets later. The assets test is waived where the student's parent or spouse receives certain pensions from the Department of Veterans' Affairs or the Department of Social Security, such as the age pension, sole parent pension, carer pension, and special benefit. Income test thresholds also apply. I say again that the Austudy-Abstudy scheme is a targeted scheme for low income families. It is about access to education for the kids of low income families. The opposition has raised concerns in the past about assessable fringe benefits. This involves the total value of fringe benefits in excess of $1,000 received in the relevant fringe benefit year through the employment of each parent or spouse in respect of organising the lower salaries through the payment of school fees, private health insurance, housing, low interest loans and provision of a motor vehicle. This does not normally raise a great deal of concern from members opposite, but these fringe benefits, as we would all admit, are in effect income. Family income is also adjusted for dependent children in the following amounts: $3,700 for each dependent child aged 16 to 22 in full-time education, $1,200 for the first other dependent child under 16, and $2,500 for each subsequent dependent child under 16. We must keep in mind that Austudy-Abstudy is an extremely complex scheme. It is designed to accommodate the enormously different needs and circumstances of over half a million Australians and their families. The government's commitment to the Austudy-Abstudy scheme reflects its belief that access to higher education should be targeted to those students from low income families. I have said before in this place that it is a targeted scheme and is about access to education. It is entirely appropriate that it remains a targeted scheme. It should be based on educational merit, not on the ability of parents to pay their children's way through university. That is the way of the past. That is not what people on this side of the House are on about. This government takes education very seriously. The provision of more places for our young people to learn needs to be supported by income support to enable them to take advantage of the places available. The amendments proposed in the Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill will strengthen the Austudy-Abstudy scheme by simplifying access to the supplementary loan scheme for students. They are measures requiring legislative changes to the Student Assistance Act. Honourable members may not be aware of this loan scheme to assist students with their expenses in gaining qualifications to make Australia a better place, a more internationally competitive nation, a more civilised and prosperous place. The loan scheme, which was introduced in the 1992-93 budget, is an extension to the tertiary end of the Austudy and Abstudy schemes. The Austudy-Abstudy supplement is optional. That point needs to be made clear. Students do not need to take it up, but it is there in case living and studying expenses need to be met. As honourable members would know, students do not stand much of a chance in the commercial loans market. The supplement meets that need, but it is an option to be decided by the student. The supplement works this way. Students are granted Austudy or Abstudy. They can then choose to trade in part of the year's grant on a loan which is twice the amount they trade in. The next year they can trade in up to $3,500 of their grant to obtain a maximum loan of $7,000. This loan is paid fortnightly along with the Austudy-Abstudy payment. Being a loan, of course, they pay it back. They pay back the whole of the $7,000, which includes the amount of the grant they have traded in. They do not have to pay it back until five years after taking it and until their income reaches average weekly earnings. Then it is repaid in instalments at only a few percentage points of the person's salary a year. If they pay it back within five years a discount is granted. The student does not pay interest on the loan. That is paid by the government on the student's behalf. Tertiary students whose parental income precludes eligibility to Austudy or Abstudy can be eligible for a loan of up to $2,000 a year provided their parents' income is less than $50,000. This is called a category 2 supplement loan. That is not a bad fall-back if education expenses get too steep, and we all appreciate that they can. Again, it is an optional scheme and students need to think about whether they want to take it up. A survey of potential supplement recipients was undertaken by DEET in 1993. It indicated that, while most students were aware of the scheme, most thought the eligibility entitlement rules were too complex. I think the honourable member for Braddon mentioned that. These two budget changes, to take effect from 1 January 1995, will make the supplement loan scheme more equitable by extending eligibility for a category two supplement loan to students who are ineligible for Austudy on the basis of their spouse's income and make it possible for a student to trade in Austudy at any time of the year to access their maximum loan entitlement. I would be the first to admit that these changes are not the sort of stuff to stir the world, but they are improvements. This government is continually looking to better and fairer administration because there are over 500,000 students out there getting assistance through Austudy. I do not think all in the opposition see that because they knocked back a previous bill which put Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children, or AIC it is known, into a legislative framework instead of having them administered by guidelines. The government can wear that sort of lack of cooperation, but it is a little off the for the government to propose sensible legislation improving the administration of student financial assistance only to have the opposition rev it up into something entirely separate by proposing the abolition of the assets test. Sure, it sounds good on a superficial and nonsubstantive basis, but it had nothing, not a thing, to do with the legislation at the time. Only 105 rural applications were knocked back this year because of the assets test. That was one per cent of a11 Austudy knock-backs lodged from rural areas. By far, the greatest reason for application rejections in rural Australia was too much income. Seventy-four per cent-three-quarters-were rejected because they had too much income. I think it is not so much the assets test as the fact that many farming families are overvaluing their assets and are simply not lodging applications. That is an issue the government is keen to pursue and we wi11 be publicising the student financial assistance schemes in the bush to make sure that families are getting their entitlements. We are also going to take a closer look at just how the assets test is affecting farmers. Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, you, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and the honourable member for Braddon should remember that there is a 50 per cent discount applying to farm and business assets. A farming family can have assets to the tune of $738,700 net-that is, after any debt is deducted-and sti11 qualify under the assets test. It is generous. An un leveraged asset of over $700,000 can be leveraged to help give kids an education. Again, the government is taking seriously the impact of reduced rural circumstances because we do believe in ensuring education opportunities for a11 Australians. I hope we can expect some cooperation on these budget measures. I hope that the opposition does not go off on a tangent and that these measures are seen for what they are-sensible, adminisas trative improvements to student financial assistance. Student financial assistance is good news. Students from ordinary families get some help to finish school and go on to post-secondary wa11 education. As I said, it is not peanuts. Austudy is paid to students whose families have an income under about $33,000 a year. For country students who have to live away from home, the parental income threshold is over $42,000 a year. That is the adjusted income after deductions for other kids in the family. Because of the taper in the income test, it is a big help to less well-off families with children at school, university, TAFE, doing open learning or attending a private training course. I hope that the shadow minister for schools, vocational education and training, the honourable member for Braddon, and as we11 the honourable member for Maranoa will bear this in mind when the government produces sensible policies to assist students. I hope the former senior shadow minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who has put in a grand total of four questions affecting his patch in about the last four years-he asked another two the other day-will also pay attention to the needs of students when the government puts forward useful changes to the administration of student financial assistance. Incidenta11y, honourable members should be aware that last week cabinet approved a very sma11 but significant change to the assistance for the isolated children scheme. From October we are extending the boarding allowance up to year 12-assets test free. That means rural, isolated families who do not meet the reasonably generous assets test provisions of Austudy can receive assistance to keep their kids at high school. This is a pretty sensible improvement, because the full boarding allowance was available only up to age 16, when students would have to transfer to Austudy or receive a $2,500 boarding allowance if their assets were too high. Fortunately, this does not need the tick of the opposition. Why? Because it knocked back the previous legislation which sought to put the AIC scheme into legislation. Those opposite get a little confused sometimes. The supplement loan scheme is a relatively new student assistance product. We have it pretty right, but it needs a couple of minor but sensible improvements. Students whose spouse's income is too high for the student to get any Austudy or Abstudy will, from 1 January next year, be able to take a supplement loan, providing the spouse's income is less than $35,000. Austudy and Abstudy are there to benefit not just youngsters. The other measure, as I have said, will make it easier for students to trade in their Austudy or Abstudy at any time during the year up to a maximum of $3,500 for a loan of twice the amount. This simplifies things because there are cut-offs in the scheme which mean that the amount of AustudyAbstudy that a student can trade in is determined by when they apply for a loan. Both these measures deserve support by honourable members. As I pointed out earlier, this government has the runs on the board as far as assisting our young people to remain in the educational system for as long as necessary is concerned. The proportion of young people who now complete secondary school has risen from 36 per cent in 1982 to well over 80 per cent. The number of students enrolled in higher education has increased from 335,000 students in 1983 to 533,000 last year. TAFE colleges are approaching 1.8 million full-time, part-time and external students. We should have been doing these things in the 1960s. I remind opposition members that, in 1983, 152,000 students were in the schemes which preceded Austudy. In 1993, 500,000 students have benefited from the scheme. We can remind ourselves very easily of the stark contrast between the conservative approach and the approach of this government to Austudy and Abstudy. The conservatives are still committed to slashing $27 million from payments to Australian children and families by raising the minimum Austudy cutoff by 50 per cent. They have not abandoned that commitment. Let us renect for a moment on what the opposition stated in the Fightback document regarding Austudy: In line with the coalition's pledge to target student assistance to the most needy, better targeting could be achieved by setting a minimum threshold on Austudy. Austudy would not be paid to anyone currently eligible for less than $30. Assuming that people receiving less than $30 per week in Austudy benefits receive on average $15 a week (that is, $780 a year) and taking the January-March 1991 numbers of recipients to be equal to annual numbers, placing a $30 minimum threshold on Austudy would save $21 million. Tightening the criteria for the operation of 'exceptional circumstances' provision would save $6 million. Of the total saving of $27 million, it is anticipated that $13 million will be achieved in the first year and the additional $14 million in the second year. That is your policy. There it is, right there. This quote from the Fightback documents says it all regarding the opposition's education policies. I put it to honourable members that we on this side of the House approach the issue of providing the best possible education for Australians and the financial support necessary to pursue an education from a very different perspective to the conservatives. As this student assistance amendment bill shows, the Labor government is about increasing access to education, not decreasing it. The opposition's view on student assistance is there for all to see. It resorts to word fencing, chicanery, ignoratio elenchi and pettifogging. In other words, opposition members are muddled, they are confused, they are woolly-headed and they are prone to unwarranted conclusions. The sacking of the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) from the front bench last Friday was a perfect example of that total confusion and the tactics in question time today by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) were another example. Mr Forrest-What's that got to do with rural students?",92
143,Mr SAWFORD,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,Nothing. It has a lot to do with confusion. This government will not shirk its responsibility to provide equity of access in education to those young Australians who most need it and those Australians who seek to continue to educate themselves. I welcome the contribution by the member for Braddon. We look forward to far more contributions from him. He made a couple of valid points. Certainly the government will be pursuing some of those ideas in making sure that country and rural families understand the very complex eligibility criteria for Austudy and Abstudy. I commend the bill to the House.,96
144,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"It is clear that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) has not been to too many drought areas in the last couple of years and probably lives in a city that has access to tertiary education. He is prepared to stand up in this House and support a system which unfairly discriminates against those students from rural areas who do not have access, without leaving home, to tertiary education. Many of these students are from families which have demonstrated a negative income, which is supported by ample evidence from the DPIE and ABARE figures for the last four years. The Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill 1994 introduces changes announced in this year's budget. These changes will allow students to repay Austudy and Abstudy benefits at a time during the year in order to maximise their eligibility for a supplementary loan and will also provide the Austudy-Abstudy loan supplement to some students who would normally be unable to claim benefits on account of their spouse's income. The coalition has no major objections to these provisions. We have moved a second reading amendment highlighting the failure of the Austudy scheme to assist students from rural and regional Australia in their pursuit of a further education. I sincerely hope that the government members of this House will support our amendment. I ask them to read the amendment before they start to go off on a tangent and not support the amendment. I ask them to look at the amendment, see what it says and seize the opportunity which it provides to redress the hardship which the Austudy scheme has inflicted on so many rural families. The Austudy system and all its anomalies, complexities, inequities and inflexibilities continue to be a source of great shame for this government for as long as it refuses to undertake a full and thorough overhaul of the scheme. The amendments before the House today and the hundreds of others which have passed through this parliament have been no more than minor alterations. But, for all the alterations we have been through, the scheme still fails to address the fundamental purpose. It is simply not identifying those who need assistance in accessing education facilities and services for themselves or for their children. The rules and regulations which drive Austudy have not been designed to find those in need of assistance but rather to control government outlays with a minimum of fuss and bother. Unfortunately, this approach is of no comfort to young Australians seeking to further their skiIIs and education. This narrow-minded approach will in the long term be a burden to all Australians who are relying on the skills and knowledge base of today's students who build the industries and services of the future. I look forward to the day when a bill is presented to this House which provides for an equitable and flexible approach to student assistance, one in which rules are designed to measure a student's or a student's parents' ability to realistically access and pay for further education. I have no doubt that the only government to introduce such an approach will be a Liberal-National Party government. I find it particularly disappointing during this time of unprecedented rural hardship that the government has not sought to relax the Austudy eligibility criteria, which continue to thwart rural students and their children. The government's decision to abolish the assets test for high school students is a welcome relief. I acknowledge that the minister presented that submission to cabinet today, but I cannot see why higher education students from rural areas were not afforded a similar level of assistance. They and their parents continue to face an onerous and inappropriate assets test which in no way reflects their ability to access education. An analysis of the farm performance statistics provided by ABARE supports the claim will from farmers across the country and members of parliament from this side of the House that the current assets test limit is entirely inappropriate for rural families and in no way indicative of a family's ability to meet education costs. I hope the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) is listening because, according to ABARE-not this side of the House-farm business profit for broadacre farms in 1992-93 was a negative $17,450. Yet the average farm business equity was $780,410. Such equity levels would clearly place average farmers in breach of the assets test and consequently ineligible for Austudy even though their business is not generating one dollar of positive income. These are ABARE figures that would be accessible by the government and the department. Given the worsening drought since 1992, the situation has deteriorated further and in 1994 is likely to show a further deterioration in those income levels. It is important to remember that the assets which caused farmers so much grief are not lUxury homes, luxury boats, artwork or jewellery. In fact, I know many families who have sold their family jewellery. An engagement ring has been sold just to put food on the table. If you bother to get out and talk to the Lifeline people, the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul and the church groups, you will find that those stories are authenticated. The assets that cause farmers grief are their productivity assets such as land, stock, tractors, combines, dozers and harvesters. It is all well and good to say, 'If you have got a valuable asset you should be able to sell it.' That attitude misses the point entirely. Selling farm assets would threaten the farm's ability to continue production in the short term and it would threaten its viability as a business enterprise in the long term. If a farmer sells his tractor to send his son or daughter to university, how will he be able to plough the paddocks or pull the scrub to feed his animals in the future? As difficult and seemingly counterproductive as asset sales may seem, there are still many families who are prepared to take that risk just to secure their children's education. I know of a farming family in Central Queensland who sold their seed stocks to send their daughter to university. The difficulty in sustaining the farm without the crops that would have eventuated from that seed is obvious and that will be yet another challenge for this family in the future. There are numerous other stories of families in my electorate who have sold breeding stock and equipment simply to meet the costs of education. In the long term, they will face more pressing problems as their farms teeter on the brink of unviability. That will not be a concern of this government, but I hope that it will change its attitude on asset testing and access to assistance for rural students. It seems to be the government's approach that it will offer farmers a grant to leave farming. This will mean that the skills and experience of yet another family farming enterprise will be lost forever. The Austudy scheme makes no provision for the unique asset structure of rural enterprises. Such enterprises carry a heavy asset load which is directly linked to the productivity of the enterprise and certainly not to the lifestyle of the owners. It is also important to bear in mind that the assets are not always easily liquidated. Who is going to buy a drought stricken property incapable of producing income? Furthermore, there is not always a clear linkage between assets and income. High assets do not necessarily produce high income and, in the case of severe drought, may produce no income at all, as the ABARE figures clearly demonstrate. When such lack of income is combined with high and unrealistic assets, farm families are left truly destitute. They have no income themselves and with their high assets levels they are precluded from receiving most forms of government assistance, including Austudy. If we believe what the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) had to say, the only reason-the government is hiding behind this reason and not making substantial changes to the Austudy eligibility criteria-that farming families cannot access Austudy is that they do not actually apply for it. What nonsense! If that is the case, it is because they know only too well just how inflexible, irrelevant and downright ridiculous the Austudy scheme and its regulations are. Farming families also know about the trauma that can eventuate if the Austudy administration should rule that they have undervalued their assets. Families in that situation simply receive a very curt letter informing them of the overpayment and requesting repayment of the benefits, often worth thousands of dollars, within 14 days. If payment is not received within three months, they face interest charges as well. I inform Senator Collins-and I hope he gets the message-that that is why farming families cannot afford to take the risk. They are forced to deal with a bureaucratic and inefficient administration that has no regard for the repercussions of its actions. I refer the House to a particular family in North Queensland who was forced to repay over $6,000 in Austudy benefits when their assets were revalued. In this case, the valuer did not challenge the value of the family assets until some three years after the initial self-evaluation and application for benefits. On the basis of a valuation conducted in 1992, this family was deemed ineligible for Austudy not only for 1992 but also for 1990 and 1991 and forced to repay the benefits received during those years. Had the valuation been checked in those early years, the valuer would have found a barren, unproductive and worthless property which would have posted absolutely no threat to the assets limit. There are many such families who have faced similar traumas throughout my electorate. I spoke to a Tara family who have recently received a demand to repay $8,000 which was originally paid to one of their sons so he could attend university. Honourable members should bear in mind that Tara does not have a university and the nearest one is 500 kilometres away. The Australian Valuation Office has suddenly revalued the family's assets and forced them marginally above the assets threshold. Representatives from the Australian Valuation Office drove past the property. They did not make an inspection but said the house, which cost the family $130,000 four years ago, was valued at $85,000. They said that their net assets were $1,000 above the limit for receiving assistance under the Austudy assets and income test scheme. That family has to repay $8,000 in the middle of one of the worse droughts on record. I know of other families who have been treated with similar disrespect. Some of them have been forced to request that Austudy representatives stop contacting their children with their blunt, demanding correspondence and deal directly with the parents in order to minimise the stress placed on the students. Some of the students are in the middle of their exams. I trust the minister appreciates that these are not isolated cases. I have a file of 40 to 50 cases in my electorate that have recently been brought to my notice. I know there are many more families out there with similar stories to tell. They know that their friends are telling the stories and they know that I am getting the message. I hope the minister can get the message. There are thousands of families who do not· bother with the Austudy system because they know of its reputation for stringent assessment and harsh treatment of those who face revaluations. The way the revaluation is conducted is quite unfair. There have been numerous proposals put forward to reform Austudy and to remove these restrictive provisions. The National Farmers Federation, the Isolated Children's and Parents Association, the United Graziers Association and numerous other rural organisations have been extremely active in highlighting the irrelevance of the Austudy eligibility criteria. Their efforts have been magnificent but ultimately unrewarded by this immovable government. The approach I would suggest the government pursue is to start from the beginning and consider how it can truly identify the ability of a family or an individual to realistically meet the costs of secondary or higher education. Tinkering at the edges is simply not adequate any more. We need to start from scratch and have the reason for the provision of student assistance firmly in mind. Such financial assistance is not a necessary evil for government; it is an investment from which the country as a whole will eventually reap its rewards. The federal government's promise of a special information campaign misses the point entirely. Farming families know all too much about Austudy, and what they do know they do not like. If the federal government can produce a needs driven response to a flexible system of student assistance, it will have something to brag about in the information campaign. I sincerely hope the minister has listened to what I have had to say. I also hope that the minister will be able to talk to some of these families in drought affected areas. Then perhaps he will have a better appreciation of the plight of these families and the problems they are having not only sustaining their families but also trying to do the best they can in terms of giving their children access to further education. The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, which is inquiring into the rural adjustment scheme, recently travelled through three towns in my electorate. When the committee was in Roma, many similar stories were recounted to the senators. That evidence is in the Hansard, and I hope the minister and his advisers read that. When the committee was in Roma, the senators were 400 kilometres from the nearest university. A point so often missed is that any student living in that area will have to leave home not by choice but by necessity in order to gain access to a tertiary education. On the same day, the senators travelled to Charleville. They heard the same accounts of hardship confronted by communities on a day-today basis. On that occasion, the senators were 700 kilometres from the nearest university. It is obvious that we have to talk about this issue of access to secondary or tertiary education. The following day, the committee went to Longreach. The further it got from Toowoomba-which is where the nearest university to those towns is locatedthe further it got away from the ability of a student to access education from that institution. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) spoke of the trauma experienced by families when their children have to leave home in order to gain access to education. The break-up of the family unit and the associated costs must be considered when determining Austudy eligibility criteria. You cannot just sit here in Canberra, draw up guidelines for a scheme which will apply right across Australia and believe that they will impact equally and fairly across our society. Clearly, they will not. I support our amendment to the second reading motion. I trust that the minister will accept the amendment. I look forward to seeing some assistance measures being provided to these people in rural Australia. The scheme, as it is designed today, is not meeting that demand. It is quite unfair. I also acknowledge that the assistance that the minister has extended in the area of secondary education is welcome, but it still has a long way to go. I trust that the minister will address the issue of access to tertiary education in the context of our amendment. (Time expired)",97
145,Mr TRUSS,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I am happy to join with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) in supporting the coalition amendment to the Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill, which goes to the heart of one of the many problems presently confronting students in Australia. I was very impressed, as I am sure other honourable members were, with the examples presented by my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa which illustrated the enormous hardship that is caused to so many people, particularly in the rural sector, by the assets test and other rules applying to Austudy. This bill changes some of the rules for Austudy and Abstudy eligibility and, in particular, student loans. Tertiary students may trade part or all of their entitlement to Austudy or Abstudy benefits for an interest free loan of twice the amount of benefit traded. Supplement loans are also available to students who do not qualify for Austudy or Abstudy because the parental income test provided that the parental income test is less than a specified amount, which is currently $50,000. These measures are hardly a boost to the system. They are euphemistically described as a simplification of the rules. I am amused at the language that governments are able to use to disguise what is a cut to the Austudy student loans program. These measures will produce a net saving to the government of $5.5 million a year. So, instead of providing more benefits to students, this bill provides fewer benefits. Some $5.5 million less will be available to students for educational assistance. Under the current arrangements, many people are denied tertiary education for financial reasons. That is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. I have a philosophical view that tertiary education should be available to all those who wish to have it. Financial reasons should not be a factor in denying people the opportunity to achieve a higher education. Part of achieving that objective clearly has to be an effective student loan scheme. It is obviously beyond the budgetary possibilities of any government to provide indefinitely free tertiary education to all those who would like to have it. In cases where Austudy is not available for whatever reason, there needs to be an effective student loan scheme, as applies in so many other countries of the world. Many people in country areas, such as farmers and small business people, are unable to obtain Austudy for their children due to the assets test. In many of those instances, their sons and daughters are denied a tertiary education. I believe that is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. In many instances, rather than the parents being denied Austudy, the children just take other options. Rather than put additional stress on the family when they know that young sons and daughters are required to help with the business or the farm, they just voluntarily forgo a tertiary education. That is also an unacceptable situation. An expanded loan scheme would enable those children to obtain the tertiary education they need without placing an undue burden on their families. They would then pay back that loan during their working careers from the additional income that they would hopefully earn by virtue of their superior qualifications. In many instances, it is the country people who are denied access to university education. Naturally, it is more difficult for them to travel the distance. The government's own higher education series pointed this out very graphically in a report on urban and rural participation which was released in September 1990. I am sorry that these figures are so old, but I do not know that any more recent figures are available. This series produced by the government demonstrated that only three per cent of Australia's tertiary students come from what are called remote areas. The vast majority of Australia's students come from urban parts of the continent. Participation in higher education of people from remote areas per head of population is only half that in urban areas. Any government that is seriously interested in social equity could not regard those statistics as satisfactory. It is something that needs to be addressed. Even the three per cent who come from remote areas have more to do with the definition of 'remote' than anything else. Nearly half of all the students in remote areas are enrolled in Queensland institutions and 25 per cent of the total are enrolled in James Cook University in Townsville alone. That is because the areas around Townsville are classified as 'remote'. So that three per cent figure is not genuinely made up of people from farm areas or what most people would regard as remote areas. The real figures are worse. Many people from rural and regional Australia have no opportunity at all to participate in tertiary education because the current assistance measures are unfairly directed against them. I believe that needs to be addressed. A student loan scheme could be worthwhile. It could provide people with a real opportunity for tertiary education which would not otherwise be available. I also believe that the tertiary loans scheme ought to be available on a much wider basis for other worthwhile education purposes. I refer to a letter I received from Chadwick and Smart Pty Ltd in my electorate. Chadwick and Smart are aircraft maintenance engineers in Kingaroy. They drew attention to their great difficulty in attracting and training new licensed aircraft engineers. They mention in their letter that their efforts over the last few years to bring apprentices up to this qualification have been made extremely difficult by the excessive cost levied by the CAA to issue and mark many of the exams which LAMEs must complete. It charges $120 for each exam, plus a $20 supervisory fee, and that is on top of the training fees charged by the South Brisbane College of TAFE and other providers. The drop-out rate for apprentices in the industry is, therefore, unduly high. When faced by these expenses, bearing in mind that these people are earning only relatively low wages, many of them drop out rather than pay the fees. That is making a bad situation even worse. Australia has an urgent need to train more aircraft engineers. We should be encouraging young apprentices to upgrade their qualifications in this field. There are many opportunities in Australia to service aircraft from other parts of the world, and indeed this could be a new sunrise industry for Australia. I know that in this particular instance the charges are actually levied by the CAA, but why could these sorts of charges-which are a legitimate part of education expenses-also not be included in a tertiary loans scheme so that once the qualifications are achieved the aircraft engineer can pay them back in subsequent years from his or her additional earnings? When I raised this matter with the minister for aviation, he justified the charges on the basis of CAA's cost recovery regime. I think it is important that we address in an education context. People who have to face examination charges and other legitimate education expenses should be able to pay them back through the education loans scheme. I would encourage the minister to give thought to extending this kind of program to cover those sorts of education expenses. It is an investment in one's future and it is a tragedy that people who are close to qualification in these sorts of areas drop out because they are unable to meet the examination expenses. We are losing the opportunity to train tradesmen who could add significantly to Australia's skills as a nation and our capacity to earn income in areas such as this. There is, of course, a need to extend university facilities into a number of new country areas so that the penalty of having to travel to a faraway centre is reduced. A number of new universities have been created around Australia over recent times. I would like to put in a plea for my own electorate. We have no university facilities in the fast growing Fraser coast region-one of the fastest growing areas of Australia. The University of Southern Queensland has an annexe in the Hervey Bay region, which annexe it is threatening now to close. It is blaming cutbacks in federal government funding-I think somewhat unfairly-for its actions. I do not think USQ has ever had a proper commitment to the Hervey Bay region. There is a study at the present time into what can be done to provide facilities in the Fraser coast region. I would encourage the Commonwealth government to cooperate with this study and be prepared to provide the necessary funding so that a suitable facility can be provided to serve the students in my own electorate. I move to another issue. I have raised this case with the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table. I am grateful that he is present so I can raise it again. I refer to a case highlighted by my own constituents, but I know there are similar cases where this injustice has been perpetrated. Jamie, the son of Mr and Mrs Goodsall of Maryborough, was denied Austudy in 1991. They sought a review by the Student Assistance Review Tribunal. Mr these and Mrs Goodsall attended a hearing of the tribunal in Brisbane on 21 June 1991. They had to travel for three hours over the congested highways and at considerable inconvenience to attend this hearing in Brisbane. When they arrived the hearing was adjourned because the senior departmental officers present were unable to provide essential information required by the tribunal. The departmental officers did not have the information that was required with them. As the failure to adequately prepare for the review was entirely the fault of the department, the tribunal decided, and I quote directly from its ruling: . .. to direct the Department to make payment to Mr Noel and Mrs Judy Goodsall a single amount calculated in accordance with regulation 10 I, being a reasonable amount towards their travel expenses incurred in travelling from Maryborough to Brisbane, return, to attend the hearing. I thought that was a pretty reasonable ruling for the tribunal to make, and one which we would regard as natural justice. The department sought details of the costs from my constituents but did not actually make the payment. A second hearing of the Student Assistance Review Tribunal was held on 16 August 1991 and was again attended by Mr and Mrs Goodsall. In its decision the tribunal again referred to the matter of travel expenses for Mr and Mrs Goodsall for the adjourned proceedings on 21 June. The tribunal in its ruling said: ... in making the decision to adjourn the hearing, the Tribunal directed the department to reimburse the applicant's parents for their travelling costs. On reflection, it is now the Tribunal's opinion that it did not have jurisdiction to couch the matter in those terms. It has no jurisdiction to direct that such payment be made. Nevertheless, nothing has occurred to make the Tribunal alter its opinion that such payment should be made. Therefore, it recommends the Department give earnest consideration to such payment of costs in a manner and amount referred to in the earlier reasons, the decision in respect of which, is amended accordingly. I am disturbed to report to the parliament that, despite the ruling and despite the subsequent recommendation by the tribunal, the department has refused to make any payment of travel expenses to Mr and Mrs Goodsall. The tribunal in its decision of 16 August said: ... the parents ... had been brought to Brisbane in the reasonable expectation that the matter could and would be resolved. At the hearing, however, there was no prospect of reaching finality because the authorised and senior authorised person had not addressed themselves to the central issue of whether or not the applicant was undertaking a degree course ... The applicant's parents made an unnecessary trip to Brisbane. I appreciate that there may be some question as to whether the tribunal had the power to make the order that it did. However, my constituents rightly emphasised that they were obliged to accept what was eventually an unfavourable decision by the umpire on the eligibility of their son for Austudy; therefore, they find it disturbing and a denial of natural justice that the department will not accept the umpire's decision in relation to travel expenses. They had to accept the denial of their son's eligibility, but the department did not accept the other side of the tribunal's ruling and eventual recommendation that they should meet travel expenses for the aborted hearing. I raised this matter with the minister and he pointed out, quite correctly, that there was no power within the act for the tribunal to order the payment of these expenses. I suggested to the minister that, in view of the tribunal's very strong recommendation in these matters, he might consider some kind of ex gratia payment. I am disappointed he did not exercise that option in this particular case. He did point out that the applicants could have had the inquiry conducted over the phone and saved themselves some expense. In other words, country clients can have only second-class justice; others are able to come in and put their case across the table. If country people want to save themselves the expense, they have to revert to a telephone hearing. I think that is really an unsatisfactory response, and I am disappointed that there is no amendment in this bill to correct the situation. I commend to the minister the suggestion that it is not unreasonable for the tribunal to be able to order costs against the department where the department has been negligent in its duty to come to the hearing with the necessary information. My constituents were brought to Brisbane for a hearing that never had any chance of resolving the issue because of the failure of the department to bring the necessary information to the hearing. I think in cases like that the tribunal is within its rights to order a payment of expenses. I think in those sorts of instances there ought to be provision for those kinds of costs to be met. The final issue I would like to touch on in relation to this matter is the argument that is going on at present about university placements in the states. Queensland is grievously disadvantaged in the number of university places available. Even though Queensland has 17.7 per cent of the nation's population, we have only 16.6 per cent of allocated university places. That disadvantages Queensland to the order of 6,000 places each year. This is a matter that must be addressed. Victoria, which is the major beneficiary of Queensland's loss, is trying to defend its position on the basis that Victoria is a traditional academic state and, somehow or other, other states do not require the same number of university places as are provided in Victoria. Clearly this is academic snobbery of the worse kind. I am appalled that Victorian institutions should try to defend their favoured status on this basis. There is an obligation to provide tertiary places where the population is and where the student growth is. That means a significant readjustment. Indeed, Queensland has been significantly disadvantaged in tertiary education over quite some years. Professor Wilson, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland, made this very telling point: ... a remarkable feature of higher education in Australia was that no serving Queensland academic had been appointed to the Australian Universities Commission, the Universities Council or to the Higher Education Council from 1957In almost 40 years no Queensland academic has been considered worthy of being appointed to any of these bodies! This really is discrimination on a grand scale. Queensland has a disproportionately poor share of university places and a disproportionately poor share of the say in tertiary education issues. These matters must be addressed as a clear case of equity and justice.",100
146,Mr KATTER,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise with some considerable strength of feeling to speak to the Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill 1994 and the amendment that has been moved. I was very lucky when I went to school. I belonged to one of the wealthier families in Cloncurry. I was one of the very few kids-about five, I think-of the 50 or 60 who did the scholarship year, which was then eighth grade, at the Cloncurry state school whose parents had the money to send them away to get a secondary education. There certainly were many boys and girls in my class who were a lot brighter than I was academically, but they were not given the privilege of going away to get an education. As a result of that, for the rest of their days they will labour at a disadvantage compared with the rest of the community-in our day and age, a very significant disadvantage. Over a period of 17 or 18 years, some really wonderful people fought hard and determinedly to see that there was educational opportunity not only for the rich but for everybody. Mr Dodd interjecting",104
147,Mr KATTER,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"In 1956, when the Labor Party was in office in Queensland, in myoId electorate, except for Charters Towers, not one single town had a secondary school facility. When I finished my term, we had up to 10th grade in almost every town. I take the interjection from the honourable member for Leichhardt because it shows his towering ignorance of Queensland. I understand that he does not come from Queensland and he does not know very much about the state-or he would not have made such a stupid comment! In 1988, which was the last time. I checked the figures, it cost some $6,000 to send kids away to boarding school. I am not talking about an elitist school but a service boarding school such as the boarding schools in Charters Towers. I pay great tribute to people such as the Christian Brothers who give their labours for virtually nothing and are able to present a very reasonably priced education. The figure would be similar for many other such schools. The entire cost of sending kids away to those boarding schools which were charging $6,000 or $7,000 in places such as Charters Towers was met by the state and federal governments. I was absolutely appalled to do the figures this year and find out that the school costs had gone up, as everything else has gone up, to around $9,000 to $10,000 for a school year and that the assistance from the state and federal governments was falling considerably short of $7,000. That is without a means test or with a means test-either way. There is no way that the average employee in a town could afford to do this. The bigger towns that are affected include Julia Creek, Georgetown, Normanton, Karumba, Burketown, Winton, Muttaburra, Aramac, Richmond, Camooweal, Forsayth, Degarra, Hughenden, Mount Surprise and EinasJeigh. I will not mention the dozens of smaller In all those towns, with some 12,000 or 15,000 Australians living in them. I am not including any of the people who are living on station properties or in isolated railway or mining camps; I am just reeling off the ones out west that leap to my mind-none of the children will be able to go away to school. I refer to studies on the cost of living in these towns which were conducted by the Teachers Union and the James Cook University. Both gave identical figures that there is a 26 per cent higher cost of living in the midwest region of North Queensland than in Brisbane. I think we can safely conclude that that figure of 26 per cent can be relied upon. There is no way in the world that people in those towns on even a reasonable income can afford $3,000, $4,000 or $5,000 a year to send their kids away to school. In the area of education, we are back in Stone Age. I am not talking about tertiary education. This bill is about tertiary education, but these kids cannot get to the tertiary level. They will be deprived of a secondary education, much less a tertiary education. Unless their parents are rich-and heaven only knows that there is hardly anyone in that category in western Queensland these daysor unless they are of Aboriginal descent, impossible for them to get a secondary education. Class lines are being violently drawn once again. I do not hesitate to speak of my own selfconsciousness about being one of the lucky ones in the town of Cloncurry to have been able to get a secondary education and of how embarrassed I felt when I went home and saw so many of my mates who were not able to have the advantages that I had. We are back to the bad old days. It has taken only three years under the socialists to project us back into the Stone Age. It would be interesting to find out how many countries deprive a significant proportion of their population of equality of opportunity in education. I dare say that there would not be too many. In our day and age, there would not be too many in South America. There may be some in Central America and there may be some in Africa. I would ones. very much doubt that many people in Asia would be deprived of a secondary education. There most certainly would not be many in central Europe or in Europe as a whole. We have now achieved in our states and nation the removal from a very significant proportion of our population-maybe as much as five or six per cent of the entire population-any equality of opportunity as far as education is concerned. These people are deprived completely of that field. Without a secondary education in the state of Queensland, one cannot join the Public Service, get an apprenticeship or, become a real estate or an insurance agent. One cannot build a home, because a TAFE certificate is needed these days, and to get that a secondary education is necessary. One cannot get a plant operator's ticket in the state of Queensland without a secondary education. So it is very the hard to find what these people will be qualified to do in future. Is there a more brutal and oppressive deprivation than the one that is being applied at the moment by the total failure of the state and federal governments to act in this area? In order to bring home the point, let me give some examples of what is occurring. For example, it is depressing in the extreme to it is walk into homesteads-I have been talking about townspeople; I have not been talking about people who live on stations, so let me talk about them for one moment-where there are no pictures on the walls. Even the homes of better-off graziers have no pictures on the waIls or furniture; its occupants sit on stools. There is nothing in the houses; there are only four walls. For those who doubt for a moment that this is true, I plead with them to come with me. Let them select the station properties that they want to visit. Some have inherited wealth. They have large investments on the coast and other places, but they are small in number these days. I have seen 50and 60-year-old women draughting cattle, riding horses and doing the most dangerous of work while their cousins in the city are taking it easy by sitting in front of the television. But that does not worry these people because they do not have any television. I have seen young men having to leave their wives and sell Amway in the local town to try to keep body and soul together, to enable their kids to go away to school and to hold on to their jobs, because that is what the station amounts to. People are working in town in clerical jobs. A wife may work in town and live away from her husband; he does not see her. He takes mustering jobs up in the Gulf country, so he is never home. I took these notes at a meeting, where I looked around at the people present. There were people present who had been away plant operating. The marriage of one young married man has fallen to pieces because he was away for nearly six months fettling on a railway. His mate, who was also on a station, was fettling with him on the railway. They were working as labourers on the railway. He did not see his wife and his three young kids. Heaven only knows, they lived in a galvanised iron shed in the Gulf country on their station. But he now does not have a family because his family has broken up. His wife was living by herself in the middle of nowhere for six months. Another case came to my attention at this meeting. One woman took a job as a domestic in one school so that her kid would not be thrown out of boarding school because she had not been able to pay the fees. I do not know whether the school was All Souls or Blackheath in Charters Towers, but the people at the school provided her with a job because they did not have the heart to kick yet another kid out of the school. They may not have needed her services there, but she worked at a very hard job to keep her kid at school. This was just at one meeting. These are the sacrifices that people are making to try to provide their kids with an education, whic.h, until four years ago, was the right of every Australian child. As far as I am concerned, having watched the extreme oppression in days past, that was the proudest of accomplishments. For those who think the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who spoke earlier today, and I are exaggerating, let me say to them with as much sincerity as I can muster on the issue that they are sewing seeds of hatred. There will be a reaping of the whirlwind down the track. Let there be no doubt that, when this sort of oppression occurs to a class of people, somewhere down the track there will be an evening of scores. One can look again and again at the examples of history. In the ugly realities of Cambodia, the colonial government and its successors in the city bled the countryside white for nearly 60 or 70 years. The kids of Ireland were deprived of an education for nearly 300 or 400 years. That is what is happening to every kid that is living inland at present, with the exception of a few lucky ones who live in Mount lsa or Longreach, where facilities are available to them. Today, for the first time in the last 15 or 20 years, we have suddenly been projected back into the Stone Age. No longer is the right to a secondary education, never mind a tertiary education, available to all Australians. I have heard that some people are preoccupied about means tests and all those things. Do not talk about a means test and money; just say that we will provide a sum of money to send a child not to some elite GPS school in the big southern capitals-that is not what we are asking for-but to the nearest boarding school. Hardworking, great Australians have made terrific sacrifices in very spartan conditions to provide us with education that is as cheap as is humanly possible for the boys and girls who go away to these boarding schools. All we are asking for is a lousy little $10,000, which is only an extension of $3,000 or $4,000, for about 30,000 or 40,000 Australians who are placed in this invidious situation. They will wear the scars and burden of having no education behind them for the rest of their days. They will not be able to become public servants, tradesmen, real estate agents or insurance agents. They will not even be able to build their own houses in the state of Queensland. They will not even be able to get a plant operator's ticket. All we are asking for is fairness, but that is what we are not getting at the present moment. We ask that the government seriously consider the desperate situation that has been created by a lack of action on the government's part in keeping up with the CPI and increasing those payments to these people.",104
148,Mr FREE,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (6.17 p.m.)-In closing the debate, I remind the House that the Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill 1994 is intended to give effect to two measures announced in the budget concerning Austudy. The measures will simplify the rules relating to the repayment of benefits and will make supplement loans available to students who are not eligible for benefits because of the application of the spouse income test. I mention the provisions of the bill because this debate has ranged so far and wide that a number of the speakers did not even manage to mention the features of the bill. I thank all those who have taken part, particularly the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), who made a reasoned contribution. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), the opposition spokesman, expressed concern about a lack of access to tertiary education for regional and rural Australia. I remind him that when his party was in office Australia had 16 universities which were almost exclusively located in the capital cities. We now have in excess of 30 universities across the country, many of which offer access to regional and rural Australia. our last term, we launched Open Learning Australia to extend those services even further. The honourable member for Braddon also expressed some concern about what it might cost a family to send students away to higher education institutions, citing an amount of between $16,000 and $18,000 for two students. He suggested that it was time for a hard look at the amount of money we make available under Austudy-in other words, it was time for a hard look at the quantum. One might be excused for thinking that opposition members themselves had taken the opportunity to have a hard look at this but, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide pointed out, if you tum to page 250 of the last detailed policy we had from the opposition-the Fightback document-you will find, under the heading 'Education', this fine statement of principle: The Coalition believes education expenditure is a vital investment in our future. It is an integral part of our job strategy for the 90's. But the top of that section shows that the estimated net spending was minus-$240 million. Fightback illustrated the opposition's commitment to education. Having listened to the remarks of the honourable member for Braddon and his opposition colleagues, you might be excused for thinking that the opposition had in its policy last year some intention to extend Austudy benefits and to provide greater levels of payment for students. In fact, page 252 of Fightback shows that the opposition, on its own costings, proposed to cut $27 million from the Austudy budget. In fact, the finance costings of Fightback suggest that this was an underestimate and that the Fightback proposal would have cut in excess of $30 million from the Austudy budget, removing benefits from some 30,000 students. So the opposition's suggestion that we should have a hard look at Austudy benefits obviously dates some time after Fightback. The suggestion by the honourable member for Braddon that this bill somehow encourages students to take loans is not correct. The loan system is there for students to access if they wish. It is, in this case, a debt triggered In by the achievement of average earnings, with a zero real interest rate applying. The honourable member then addressed what has emerged during this debate as a major concern to members of the opposition, and that is the application of the assets test to rural families for Austudy purposes. I will address that in more detail later in my remarks. The honourable member for Braddon dealt with a number of cases and I point out that, if Carina, Jenny and the others are really excluded from receiving student assistance because of family income or family assets, one should not assume that tertiary education is therefore going to be forever unavailable to them. There are options that young people in these circumstances can look at. For example, they can commence part-time studies or they can commence external studies. Honourable members should remember that, as a result of the policies of this government, the age of independence for Austudy purposes has been falling progressively and will go down to 22 next year. In other words, students who are aged 22 next year will be eligible for assesssome ment for Austudy at the independent rate, where parental assets and parental incomes do not count. So any suggestion that tertiary education is removed forever as an option for such young people is certainly not correct. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) exhibited not so much a knowledge of drought policy as a drought of policy on the opposition side. Listening to the honourable member for Maranoa, one could be pardoned for believing that no farming families at all in this country were receiving Austudy benefits. He referred to the Austudy rules.thwarting rural families. He may really believe that no farm families are in receipt of Austudy. In fact, there are in the order of 14,000 farm families receiving these benefits. As the honourable member for Port Adelaide pointed out, there is a one per cent rejection rate for farm families on the grounds of assets-the same level as applies generally. As has also been pointed out, farm properties are subject to a 50 per cent discount. Assets test free boarding allowances have been extended for families in isolated circumstances as well. These special measures that have been extended for farm families only hardly amount to a system which acts against their interests and thwarts them. The honourable member for Maranoa referred to average farm equity, as researched by ABARE, being in the order of $780,000. I do not dispute that figure for a moment. Honourable members should remember, however, that for Austudy asset testing one can subtract from that figure the value of the house and surrounding two hectares which, as the honourable member for Maranoa said, is in the order of $30,000 anyway, which brings you very close to the assets limit for farm families of $738,000. But, in any case, that average farm equity and nobody has ever claimed that student assistance should be accessed by all families. On the figures of the honourable member for Maranoa, we are very close to catering for 50 per cent of farm families. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) made a most intelligent contribution to the debate. He certainly revealed that there is diversity of view in the opposition in relation to tertiary loans. He wants to see loans extended. I am not sure that the honourable member for Braddon does, but that is something he might like to discuss with his colleague. I am grateful to the honourable member for Wide Bay for his acknowledgment that it is impossible for any government to provide free tertiary education and income support-student assistance-to everybody. That is precisely why benefits, while generous, must be targeted on the basis of need. I listened carefully to what the honourable member had to say about two of his constituents, Mr and Mrs Goodsall of Maryborough. As he quite correctly pointed out, it is the job of the tribunals to sort out entitlements to student assistance and not to add to their responsibilities a second tier of sorting out entitlements, such as travelling expenses, to attend hearings. But I will certainly give extra consideration to what the honourable member for Wide Bay has said and see whether that matter can be considered further. While I doubt that I have the power to order ex gratia payments, I am happy to have a second look at it. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) made an interesting contribution. He spoke with passion but without relevance. I think he spoke for 15 minutes without uttering a single word that was relevant to the bill. Mr Gibson-It doesn't come as a shock.",107
149,Mr FREE,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"No, it does not come a<; a great shock, I must say. I would like to spend a couple of minutes talking about the question of the assets test as it affects farm families, because this is a matter that has received some publicity and I know it concerns a number of members of this House. I will make a couple of general points. is Student assistance schemes under this government are already generous. This year we will spend over $1.5 billion assisting more than half a million students. Student assistance has developed a lot since the days of the old TEAS and secondary assistance schemes operated by the coalition. I repeat: while it would be very nice and desirable to assist all students, it is not possible to assist everybody nor is it possible to cover all of their costs. Any program must be targeted to those in need. Within the framework of the already generous-but targeted-arrangements, extra concessions that are available to farming families are available to no others, as has been pointed out during the debate. The children's boarding allowance for isolated families is not subject to the assets test. By a decision of cabinet last Monday week, the additional boarding allowance was extended to those over 16, supporting the government's contention that there should not be barriers to rural families enjoying the benefits of full secondary education. An additional concession for farming families concerns the assets limit. This year, the assets limit for non-farm families is $369,000. For farm families it is twice that amount at $738,000. The value of the property for assets testing purposes is reached by subtracting the value of a farm family's homestead, the two hectares curtilage and the amount of any debt. After that, a farm family can still hold assets of up to $738,000 and qualify for Austudy. The assets test is waived in cases where the parents are receiving social security benefits or farm household support. These are additional concessions extended to farm families. The question arises: is the $738,000 a reasonable limit? On the evidence available, I believe that it is reasonably realistic. As compared with the honourable member for Maranoa's own figures, it is not an unreasonable limit, particularly given that in drought affected areas one would expect that the value of assets would fall. Therefore, using the honourable member's example, a farm of that value in a drought affected area would be expected to produce a lower valuation. In the financial year 1993-94, 208 farms in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia were valued for Austudy assets testing purposes. Of the 208 tested, only 33less than 16 per cent-had a total value of more than $738,000. One would have expected that, after the kinds of deductions that I have already explained, very few would exceed the assets limit. Mr Truss-But you only tested close ones.",108
150,Mr FREE,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"The proof of the pudding is in the eating, my friend. That is, in the order of 14,000 students from farm families qualify for benefits. The rate of rejection on the grounds of assets for farm families is one per cent, which is the same as the rate for the general population. I concede that where a problem existsmany members in this House believe that a problem does exist-it may be exacerbated by two factors. One factor is a less than complete awareness by farm families of the generous concessions which apply. The second factor is that some farmers may be self-assessing themselves out of the system and not applying for the concessions because they believe that their properties are worth more than the valuation given by the Australian Valuation Office. There may be some people out there whose estimates of the current value of their properties are unrealistically high. In an attempt to remedy this, as part of its discussion last Monday week, the cabinet decided that the government should embark on a strategy to raise the awareness of farm families of the benefits that are available and of the conditions that apply. I expect this will involve writing to farm families, giving them detailed information, giving them the opportunity to make personal inquiries and inviting them to test their eligibility by applying for assistance. I acknowledge that many of the concerns expressed during this debate are quite genuine. Therefore the government is responding in this fashion. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.

151,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (6.36 p.m.)-As the last listed speaker on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, it is my responsibility to say some things about the progress of the debate thus far and to put on record, with respect to the broad approach taken by the coalition, the government's position on one of the most important pieces of social justice legislation ever passed by the Australian parliament. I rise to speak as someone who has had a very long history of involvement with this particular proposal. Recently, whilst looking through my collection of papers from my early years in parliament, I came across a discussion paper in which I had advocated the creation of a national land fund to my caucus colleagues way back in 1986. As events unfolded, that fund was not supported. But it is certainly a great source of pride to all members of the Keating Labor government that, as our primary second stage response to the High Court decision in the Mabo case, we are delivering to the parliament this historic legislation. We would have hoped that it would be unanimously supported by the whole parliament. It is my responsibility to inform the House that, following consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and with representatives of key Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, the government wi1\ not be accepting the opSENATE position's proposed amendments to the Aboriginalland fund legislation. To do so would be a breach of faith with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people-a position which the government is not prepared to adopt. After a great deal of careful consideration, we will reject the opposition's amendments for a number of key reasons. Firstly, there has been some formal advice from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I will refer to that formal advice in the course of my remarks. Secondly, as I think every member of the Australian parliament would know and as the great bulk of the Australian population would know, there has been very strong and overwhelming opposition to the amendments from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders and representative bodies across Australia. We wi\l also reject these amendments because there has been a total lack of consultation between the coalition and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the proposed changes. Finally, we as the government see a fundamental inconsistency between some of the amendments and the nature and aims of the land fund and the fact that the intent of other amendments will be automatically incorporated into the operation of the fund as the legislation currently stands. The government has honoured the undertaking given by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and me that the coalition's proposed amendments would be seriously considered. This is despite the difficulties posed by the fact that the legislation has been before the parliament for two months and that the governmentindeed, all parliamentarians-received only general notice of the proposed amendments yesterday and was not given the final detail of some amendments until this afternoon. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which is the government's primary source of advice on indigenous affairs, has formally advised the government: ATSIC is strongly supportive of the Bill as it stands. It believes the Bill is consistent with the implementation of a strategy directed at land acquisition and ensuring sustainable land management, so as to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I think it is important to emphasise the extent of opposition to the stand taken by the coalition, not only in relation to its specific amendments but also to the general approach the coalition has taken. Charles Perkins, the Acting Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, needs no introduction to this House. Even the coalition would have to agree that his public comments about coalition policy have been balanced and constructive, particularly in recent times. I think it is instructive to refer to the detail of what Commissioner Perkins said in a recent press release: ... ATSIC supported the ... Bill in its current form which was arrived at following consultations with indigenous peoples and which has their support. A very important emphasis is given to those consultations. The press release continued: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country want to know where the Coalition stands on this issue. There is significant concern about the Coalition's motives in moving to amend the Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund Bill. 'We believe it is a workable model: Mr Perkins said. The Coalition dealt itself out of the debate leading up to the Native Title Act. If it genuinely wants to re-establish its credentials in indigenous affairs make a contribution to the process leading up to the formulation of the social justice package next year, it must show that it understands the principle underpinning the Indigenous Land Corporation and the Land Fund.  accountability requirements, which I am more than happy to deal with in detail later this evening, and finally asked the coalition to declare in unequivocal terms, with no strings attached, its commitment to land acquisition. In making a number of comments on the second reading stage, I will not engage in a personal attack on any individual coalition member. What I have been about as a minister are issues and principles. I recognise that a number of members of the coalition are people of good faith, but the tragedy is that those more moderate members of the coalition have not been able to convince the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) to take a principled stand on the land fund. I intend to put on the public record and make absolutely clear my abhorrence, and that of the government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country, of the tactics employed by the opposition over recent days in relation to the proposed amendments. It is not simply a matter of criticism by the government or that of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We have heard criticism by Independents in parliament today. The Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot, made abundantly clear in her public comments her anger about the coalition tactics. She said that the opposition's amendments were a smokescreen and that its position amounts to gutting the fund. Let us look at the informed editorial opinion in this country. The political editor of the Melbourne Age was scathing in his criticisms of the opposition leader. He said that it was a performance of breathtaking gall. He also stated: In his somersault to embrace the land fund legislation-provided the Government accepts a brace of amendments- Mr Downer is being at best disingenuous, at worse a hypocrite. He went on to say, I think very incisively: ... Mr Downer has seized on a tactical manoeuvre to duck the latest threat to his embattled leadership. and Unfortunately, the opposition leader has fallen into the same trap that the former leader fell into in his public statements on the High Court decision, the Mabo case and the Native Title Act. I will say more on that later. It is important to put on the public record that criticisms have come from a wide range of other indigenous peopleMrs Gallus-All given information by the government.",110
152,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"None was given by you as the shadow minister, I regret to say. I want to mention commissioners David Ross and Luke Maynard, who I note is in the public gallery today; the Director of the Northern Land Council, Daryl Pearce; the Director of the Central Land Council, Tracker Tilmouth; the Executive Director of the Cape York Land Council, Noel Pearson; the Executive Director of the Kimberley Land Council, Peter Yu; and the Western Australian Aboriginal Legal Service. It is not me as minister who has been making these comments. Indigenous leaders right across this country have rejected absolutely the opposition tactics in the specific amendments it has brought before this House. The coalition has also received a public bucketing from the Torres Strait Regional Authority. Getano Lui Junior, a person whom I would have hoped the coalition would respect, made it clear that he was more than satisfied with the very deep public accountability provisions in the current legislation. Of the coalition's attitude in bringing into this debate issues of health and housing, he said: It is confusing citizenship rights with the need a land and sea base for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. I agree with him absolutely. I think it is important to remind this House of the efforts of the government to try to secure cross-party support for this legislation. Back in March the Prime Minister wrote to the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), and urged him to put forward some constructive amendments on behalf of the opposition. No reply was forthcoming to that letter. The legislation was then introduced into this parliament on 30 June. Despite a further letter from the Prime Minister to the current opposition leader, not one formal reply was forthcoming. There were many other talking heads out there in the media. I notice that the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) is in the House. I am sure that he will remember speaking on the ABC Country Hour on 13 May. He said: I can promise you that Coalition policy is that the Land Fund will be opposed, and that the Native Title Bill will be repealed. On 2 June on radio station 4CA, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) described the land fund as: ... a huge buying spree of $1.5 billion nationwide Land Fund-I think it's a misplaced priority and I think it will add to the bureaucracy in Canberra. These are exactly the same kinds of tactics that the coalition bought to bear throughout this country during 1993. Do honourable members remember the speech made by the former Leader of the Opposition about backyards and farmyards? He suggested that somehow the rights of non-indigenous Australians were threatened by the government's proposed legislation. The same kinds of comments are now being made by the Leader of the Opposition. Despite all the efforts of the government and the formal on-the-record attempt by the Prime Minister to seek cross-party cooperation in respect of this matter, no response was forthcoming from the opposition. What we finally have is a rejection by the government of amendments which we see as a mere smokescreen to diffuse the real position of the opposition-that is, a continuing rejection of for the proposals that the government is putting to finally deliver social justice to this important area of social policy. I would like fair-minded Australians to think about what kind of tactic the opposition has employed with respect to these amendments. It has said to the government that it has a raft of amendments and some, in the words of the shadow minister, are major amendments which change the focus of the bill. The government is expected to embrace and support those amendments. On the other side of the equation, what will the coalition give us in return? What will be gained for indigenous people by our supporting those amendments? Will there be cross-party cooperation? If there were to be cross-party cooperation, if there were a genuine shift in coalition policy and it did have an intention to support the basic principles of the bill, the government would have to think very seriously about it. But we have here quite substantive amendments, major amendments in the words of the shadow minister, which are rejected overwhelmingly by indigenous people and which the government is not prepared to accept. The point is that, even if we do accept them, we are faced with the coalition's threat to go to the Senate and move further amendments of an unspecified kind. The coalition has also threatened to derail the whole process of this legislation by sending it off to a parliamentary committee. Let me put on the record that the government will not abdicate its responsibility to indigenous people. coalition did not consult with one single proach. Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person in the entire country. The government at least tried to seek the opinions of indigenous people by sending out the documents of the coalition. We had to send out its proposals. What a way to run an opposition. The opposition is currently in the process of reviewing its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policy. Let me say that indigenous people are going to give the opposiation tion a very strong message: it should talk indigenous people and listen to what they saying. Members of the opposition should not come into this chamber without having of consulted a single indigenous person, let alone without having undertaken a proper process of consultation. I remind the House of what we as the government did. We sat down with indigenare ous leaders. We did not just consult; we negotiated. History will record that that process of negotiation in relation to the fund was probably as important as the final outcome as it is in relation to this bill. seeking to advance the process of reconciliWentworth? ation, which is not done by unilaterally coming into this place and introducing propohomes sals that have not even been the subject consultation with indigenous people. I tum my attention to cross-party ation and the reconciliation process. If anyone in this country is in a position to say something on the public record about the history of how cross-party cooperation went off the rails, it is me. I will tell this House what the facts are. During the time of the last federal electionMr MCLachlan-Is this about this bill?",111
153,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Yes, it is, and it has been debated in this House. In the course of the last federal election I issued a public ment, which was probably unprecedented, praising the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, for his support for the government's approach to dealing the issue of native title. In an earlier statethe ment, the member for Wentworth had said that the government had a process would run through to September, and that the The coalition supported the government's apDuring that election time we had a flashpoint for democracy-we had cross-party cooperation in indigenous affairs. Let me say on the public record that, while the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) played an acknowledged important role in bringing the coalition on board the reconciliation process, before the coalition supported the reconciliprocess just about every editorial writer to in this country, the AMA, the National Farare mers Federation, most churches in this country and, finally, the Girl Guides Association Australia had supported it. The basic point is that we had mobilised and built a ground swell of public support for this important area of social policy. Yes, the coalition came on board, and we grateful for that. After the last federal election, despite the very common purpose we had, we then saw the coalition launch into an land appalling display of continued attacks on indigenous people. Do members remember the We are speech to the nation by the member for Do you remember him saying how we worked hard for our houses, our and our businesses as if somehow they of were under threat? Every single coalition frontbencher, many of whom are still in their cooperpositions, went along with it. Where were the Fred Chaneys, the Peter Baumes, the Ian Macphees? All those presently in the front bench stayed silent. They fell in behind the member for Wentworth, including the current Leader of the Opposition. Now we see a repeat of the same thing. It is very tragic that the coalition's stand on these important and sensitive issues of public policy can be driven by a leadership struggle. What a terrible thing for the country. Regrettably, statein the current climate we are seeing the rhetoric being won by the moderates but the detailed, hardline policy is being championed, and the battle is being won, by the hardliners with in the party-most of whom are situated on front-bench of the coalition. Does anyone seriously think that that front-bench would which ever move to support a land fund? In conclusion, over 20 years ago Billy MCMahon was supporting land acquisition by the Commonwealth. In 1974 this parliament voted unanimously to establish a land fund. Now, as a result of the coalition's stand on this bill, we find that the coalition policy is being turned back 20 years. We are seeing an attempt to abdicate the Commonwealth's responsibility for giving effect to its obligations under the 1967 referendum, and we will not buy it. Bill read a second time.

154,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I move: (1) Clause 3, page 3, lines 18-31, omit proposed subsection 1910(1), substitute the following proposed section: Functions "" '1910. (1) The land acquisition functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation are as fol1ows: (a) to grant interests in land to: (i) Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporations; or (ii) aboriginal persons; or (iii) Torres Strait Islanders; or (iv) trustees of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trusts; (b) to acquire by agreement interests in land for the purpose of making grants under paragraph (a); (c) to make grants of money to: (i) Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporations; or (ii) aboriginal persons; or (iii) Torres Strait Islanders; or (iv) trustees of Aboriginal or Torres Islander trusts; or for the acquisition of interests in land; (d) to guarantee loans made to: (i) Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporations; or (ii) aboriginal persons; or (iii) Torres Strait Islanders; or (iv) trustees of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trusts; for the purpose of the acquisition of interests in land.' Notel: "" 'Interest in land' is defined by section 4. Note 2 : "" 'Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporation' is defined by section 4. Note 3 : "" 'Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trust' is defined by section 4. "". This amendment simply widens the scope of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) said that we had not consulted with the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. The reason we make this amendment to the bill is that we have been requested to ensure that when money is available it not only goes to corporations but also is available for individuals, partnerships, trusts and other forms of Aboriginal groups. An example given to me was that, if a fisherman had an Aboriginal partnership and the partners wanted to get a loan from the ILC to make it an economic partnership, they should be able to ask the ILC for a loan. That is not provided for under this bill. There are other people trying to own land who wish to have some assistance. The widening of this bill does not preclude giving to corporations, it simply is inclusive of individuals. This minister's absolute hypocrisy in this matter is evident, because that was the intention of this government. We are just tidying up the bill. On page 46 of the bill, paragraph 7(c)(jg) states: · .. to evaluate or audit the activities of an individual who has received one or more grants or loans from: (i) the Indigenous Land Corporation ... Strait So in the government's own bill it refers to individuals. Paragraph 7(c)(jh) states: · .. to evaluate or audit the operations of a body corporate ... The next paragraph states: · . . to evaluate or audit the operations of an unincorporated body ... So it was the government's intention. Otherwise, why did it have it in but not in the other part? In doing this, we are simply making clear what the government intended to do. It gives individuals the opportunity to increase their viability by saying to the ILC, 'Can we as an individual, a trust or a partnership have a loan?' The government is so hypocritical that it will not even consider an amendment which tidies up its own bills. The minister has only had the amendments for a very short time. He was only halfway through reading them when, five minutes later, we got a phone call to say, 'We will not consider any.' He refused to sit down and discuss any of these amendments with me or to give time for these amendments to be widely discussed in the community.",114

Let's have a look at what you are getting at and see which ones actually strengthen the bill'? But, no, this government is so busy playing politics. What is more, I do not think the minister at the table was responsible. I think the minister was rolled by his Prime Minister (Mr Keating). When I talked to the minister he had looked at some of them and said, 'These seem reasonable.' He was quite happy when he saw the amendments the first time.

As I was saying, I would like to respond to these amendments seriously. The shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), has raised a question as to why the Office of Evaluation and Audit would be able to audit grants to individuals under paragraph 7(c)Gg) on page 46 of the bill. The answer is very simple. It is a technical answer which is easily understood if the shadow minister were to read the bill. While the Indigenous Land Corporation acquisition functions are limited to corporations, the land management functions in paragraph 19IE(1)(d) are not so limited. I think there is a much more fundamental issue involved as to why the government opposes this amendment. I would ask the coalition to think seriously about it.

Commonwealth indigenous policy set by the board of ATSIC commissioners and previously by successive coalition and Labor govemmentsgot that, coalition governments-going back to before 1972 regarding the purchase of land has not supported grants to be paid to individuals. ATSIC funded grants are focused on benefiting a significant number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Both the Commonwealth and indigenous people themselves are concerned to ensure that land is secured for future generations of indigenous people. Let me make the point for the first time in consideration in detail of these amendments that this is the first of all these amendments, none of which have been the subject of consultation, let alone negotiation, with any indigenous people in the country.

167,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,I am probably going to say it 37 more times as well.,116
168,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I would like to make some comments on this. With the anger I feel at the moment this will be one of my last contributions to Aboriginal affairs debates in this House for some time, because the next time. I am asked what can be done for a more bipartisan approach I am likely to tell someone to get stuffed. I will make some specific comments. When people want to look at whether this is a fair-minded tactic or not, they can have a look at these amendments. I have worked very hard with the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), to try to get these amendments up. I have risked having arguments with my colleague next to me, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). I have invested a lot of time, and I have invested a lot of emotion. It was no tactic. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) asked: what would be gained for indigenous people? I put on the record today that what could have been gained was a $1.1 billion fund that would have operated virtually in the same manner if that was the way Aboriginal people wanted it, with the full support of this parliament and with guaranteed security regardless of a change of government. That is finished. I have heard about consultation and it will be talked about another 36 times. That is fine, but let us not have any bloody hypocrisy on this. How much consultation did the government have before it set up, in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs? I went round the country for nine months consulting on that-arguing the case, taking the heat-and the government did it days after the election with no consultation at all. We have heard much about who has opposed the amendments. The people who opposed the amendments opposed them before they had even seen them. I say again: if people want to look back at this debate in the future, they can have a look at what these amendments did, how the fund could have operated virtually unchanged, and they will see that we have missed an opportunity. I do not intend to speak on every amendment, but I will speak at the end of this debate tomorrow on the bill as a whole. If this amendment were accepted, and if the corporation wished, 100 per cent of land could have gone to Aboriginal corporations. It could have been completely unchanged. We were offering just the possibility that the ILC, if it wished, could grant land to individuals. Yes, this is a radical departure that has the support of the honourable member for Barker and other people in the coalition that the minister might be surprised about. We are not demanding that a fixed percentage must go to individuals but that it was an option. The government cannot even accept that. I am afraid that I see this as a political ploy to try to divide the opposition. This will not divide the opposition. The anger I feel tonight at having had the work that I, amongst others, have put into try to have the vague possibility of getting some bipartisan support on this thrown in my face and called a dirty tactic or a political ploy shows me the complete futility of what I have done for the last two weeks.",116
169,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"We are not particularly concerned about whether or not members of the opposition feel impatience or annoyance about measures of this kind. What we are concerned about is the substance of the legislationwhether it is appropriate in order to achieve the objectives that have been set. For people to display such petulance, to get up and say that they have worked hard for any particular objectives and then to walk out of the chamber in the face of that, does not reflect very much credit either on their maturity or their concern. The honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) said that he will not be speaking on Aboriginal issues again in parliament. There are a lot of people in this parliament who have worked bloody hard-I will use his expression-over a long period to achieve a lot of objectives, and we get a lot of knockbacks. For a person to be so damned petulant, to say that because he did not achieve his objectives after his honourable concern and effort, reflects very little credit on that fellow. I know he is one of the moderates of the opposition and for that reason I applaud his position. He is one of the more tolerant, one of the more moderate. But as the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has indicatedMr Thckey-What about the amendments?",117
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will cease interjecting.,117
171,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"We know your attitude, Wilson, towards the Aboriginal community.",117
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Order! The honourable member for Charlton shall direct his remarks through the chair.,117
173,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"He is commenting to me, Mr Deputy Speaker. If he were restrained from doing that I would not have to respond.",117
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,I have called him to order. Mr Thckey-Why don't you get back to saving another old lady?,117
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will not interject. The honourable member for CharIton has the call.,117
176,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I agree with you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would prefer not to have to respond. We are concerned about maintaining the integrity of that legislation. Back in 1976 the parliament was considering an Aboriginal land fund. That was involved with the question of whether or not land was going to be made available in the Gurindjis after that special, symbolic and important campaign was waged by them in order to achieve access and rights to land. I am not particularly impressed with the position which has been adopted by the opposition. I am one of those people who quite genuinely believe that, while it may not be true about any particular amendment, all of the amendments taken together represent an attempt to sabotage the nature of this legislation. I make just one reference in connection with that. The present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) on Sydney radio on 16 June said: We've said that all along we would oppose the establishment of the fund. They are the words of the Leader of the Opposition. Let me repeat them so there is no mistake. The Leader of the Opposition said: We've said that all along we would oppose the establishment of the fund. And this is part of that strategy.",117
177,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I have listened to some of the offerings from the other side. Let me say in regard to the general subject, before getting to the amendments, I have seen the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) come into this House many times, with his heart bleeding all over the floor, and beseech us to have some bipartisan view. I agree with the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge); we did go out and say that we would oppose this fund, and we have changed. Can't you understand that? We were changed by some people in our party. So we have addressed some of the amendments.",118
178,Mr HOLDING,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,What about the Aboriginal people?,118
179,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Why don't you just quieten down for a bit so that you might hear some of the accusations refuted?,118
180,Mr HOLDING,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,I am interested.,118
181,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Maybe. We believe that, unlike your Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who decided, before he had seen these amendments, that he was going to reject them and instructed you the same way-did he not, minister? Look me in the eye. He did. We know, just like he rolled you with a 40-tonne truck on the Native Title Bill.",118
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Mr Truss)The honourable member for Barker should address his remarks through the chair.,118
183,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,The minister didn't. The minister gave us a drubbing and he got up again in this stage of the bill and gave us another one.,118
184,Mr HOLDING,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Tell us what Aboriginal organisations you have spoken to. You didn't speak to any, and you know it.",118
185,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Maybe. That is your view. Let me quote one,118
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Order! The honourable member for Melbourne Ports should not interject from out of his seat.,118
187,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Let me quote Mr Noel Pearson. Only the other day, on 26 August, he raised questions about the inability of Aborigines to sell or mortgage land, thus preventing them from using it to raise the necessary capital for investment in business ventures. We took notice of that. In this amendment we are proposing various ways by which the range of recipients can be widened. But you have decided that not one of the general amendments and not one of this range of recipients is acceptable. Who is taking the bipartisan approach? Do not tell me, minister, that you are, because you are not. I did stand up back in May and say, 'I promise'Mr Tickner-Could we return to the clause, please?",118
188,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"You didn't. Are you going to stick to the clause when you get up? Mr Tickner- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Both sides have had a very long and free-ranging second reading contribution. It will assist the proceedings of the House if all members on both sides stick to the amendments under discussion.",118
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"The point of order has validity. In the detail stage it is necessary to deal with the precise nature of the amendment. I invite the honourable member for Barker to follow that course. He is, of course, able to comment on the issues that are dealt with in the amendment.",118
190,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"No doubt we can deal with the issues raised by previous speakers. So, presumably, if that is going to be a bipartisan arrangement we will stick to it. Mr Leo MCLeay-Don't be petulant.",118
191,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I am not being petulant; I am being accurate-just accurate, that is all. You would not know the difference, although you occupied the chair for some time. The important point here is that we have tried to widen the field of potential recipients. The government is obviously in the process of rejecting this and has decided that Aboriginal persons should never be recipients of assets under the land fund, that Torres Strait Islanders themselves, individually as persons, should never be recipients and that other people acting as trustees should never be recipients. But I cannot understand why not. We are getting information and requests from people in the Pitjantjatjara lands that they would like much more flexibility than the inalienable title that they hold. Therefore, we put forward these amendments on the basis that we could widen the range of recipients. I will finish simply by saying that the board does not have to do it. The board has the flexibility under these amendments of providing grants of land to corporations, to Aboriginal persons or to Torres Strait Islanders. (TIme expired)",118
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Mr Truss)Order! Before I call the next speaker, I appreciate that there is a great deal of feeling on this issue. I ask members to recall the decorum that is appropriate for this place in their choice of language and to remember that we are now in the consideration in detail stage and need to deal with the precise content of the amendments and the clauses under debate.",119
193,Mr GIBSON,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Moreton) (7.19 p.m.}-The government has clearly rejected this amendment for some very simple reasons. I would like to outline them. The opposition's position in putting forward this amendment demonstrates the problem we have had with the way in which it has dealt with this legislation. The shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), has not done sufficient homework to understand what is available at the moment for Aboriginal people as individuals, as trusts or as companies to gain some access to loans or some form of economic support through ATSIC. This is a demonstration of the fact that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has failed in her responsibilities as a shadow minister to actually learn about her shadow portfolio and to consult with Aboriginal organisations and people around this country. The main argument she put forward for the opposition wanting to change this clause to allow for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders to individually gain grants of land or loans from the corporation was so that a man who had a fishing boat and wanted to expand his business could gain a loan from this fund. If the shadow minister had done any research or talked to ATSIC, the principal Aboriginal organisation in this country responsible for administering Commonwealth funds in the area of Aboriginal affairs, she would know that there are already very adequate procedures and funds available for companies and individuals to seek grants or loans to assist them in their economic activities and in establishing businesses. That is the essence of the problem that the opposition now faces. This bill was tabled more than two months ago. The opposition failed to do its homework then and failed to discuss the proposals with the government when it was given the opportunity. It failed to come forward to the government and say, 'Yes, we have some concerns with this bill. We want to make some amendments and we have one proposal. Why can't we do something like this?' The opposition has left it to within a few hours of the final vote on this legislation to raise these issues.",119
194,Mr TUCKEY,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. We have been lectured about sticking to the matters in the bill. We have put a case for giving Aboriginal people the right to own land. It is your job to refute, not discuss the politics.",119
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Mr Truss)There is no point of order. There are issues in the clause other than the particular matter you refer to.,119
196,Mr GIBSON,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"If the honourable member for O'Connor had been listening, he would have heard that I have spent the last three minutes explaining our opposition to this amendment. The main reason for our opposition is the fact that your shadow minister does not know anything about Aboriginal affairs - nd does not know anything about talking to Aboriginal people and finding out what they want. That is the reason she is moving an amendment that is flawed from the start. It does not represent the views of Aboriginals and certainly does not represent a sound administrative practice. Those on the other side of the chamber are constantly coming into this House and saying that Aboriginal people have to be accountable for all the money that is spent on them, yet you are proposing a procedure which you know is flawed from the start and undermines the basic principles of accountability. You are also ignoring the fact that there are already procedures available under the ATSIC Act and the corporations provisions for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to access loans or grants to develop businesses and corporations and there are other procedures whereby organisations are able to purchase land. You well know that the Aboriginal people have decided the structure of this bill and have decided that they like the clause as it is at the moment. You have had no consultation on this matter and there is no validity to this amendment. That is the reason this clause and all other clauses are rejected. The bill we are presenting to this House and all the clauses within it represent the solid information and views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around Australia. These amendments represent a cheap political stunt by certain people within the opposition to try to claw something back from their failures on this bill. (Time expired)",119
197,Mr TUCKEY,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"In five minutes not one real word came from the previous speaker, the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), to say why, irrespective of other arrangements, you cannot have a provision in this bill that entitles other Aboriginals in smaller groups, be they in a partnership or a trust, the right to own or access land under this fund. That is the problem. It is all politics to you. It is all analysing whether we have some motive. Motive is not shown in the amendment. It is quite clear what the amendment is about. The previous speaker went perilously close to saying, 'You can't trust Aboriginals with land.' You went perilously close to saying that. You are not entitled to stand on a point of order; that is a personal explanation.",120
198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"He is claiming a point of order, I take it. The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. Mr Gibson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for O'Connor is making statements regarding what he claims I said-I made no such statements-and is inferring comments about my comments.",120
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Order! That is not a point of order. I am sure the honourable member for Moreton knows that. He has an opportunity to reply during the debate.,120
200,Mr TUCKEY,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Furthermore, I will look closely in Hansard at the remarks of the member and see who might be misleading. I used the words 'perilously close.' The opposition has come into this House and made an excellent submission. The member for Moreton argued that there has been no consultation. There has been consultation on this issue going over 10 years. Time and time again complaints have come to us in the normal constituent operations from people at the grassroots of the Aboriginal movement, not the highly paid Aboriginal bureaucrats you identify as Aboriginal spokesmen and whom you sent along to our party room and who, I heard someone today say, are 'elected'. I asked the group that came to our party room on Mabo how many were elected and one out of the number made that claim. The rest are principally self-appointed. I am talking for the very people at the grassroots whom we would like to assist by this amendment to give them a chance, on the decision of your ILC. I would like to have made it conditional that there had to be some of the money spent in this way. That is not our amendment because, as has been pointed out, there was a consensus on this that we did not want to put the bar too high for the socialists on the other side who believe only a committee should own land-centralism, socialists. Someone said that you have got to preserve this land for their children, but in the next breath you also tell us that their attachment is so strong that, I assume, they would not sell it. If these people are to be integrated into our society, they have got to have business options. How many young farmers leave the land because they would prefer to be lawyers? You give them no options. You say, 'You're going to have land and you're going to like it. But because we don't trust you, we will not give you individual rights to land; we will put it under the control of a land council or the ILC and we will give you no trust.' Our submission is based on the requests that I received over the years in my constituency, by being a member of the Aboriginal affairs committee and from listening to the people in the Northern Territory-long before you came to this parliament. I used to say to them, 'You tel1 me you have got land. Is the title deed in your safe?' They would say no. I would see some of the younger people rushing over to the elders and whispering in their ears, saying, 'This is a great suggestion.' Of course, they should have their own land. This is al1 this amendment does. Ms Henzell-Ha, hal",120
201,Mr TUCKEY,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"The member for Capricornia laughs about our arguments that individual Aboriginal people should have the opportunity under these arrangements to own some land and, if they choose for their betterment in our society, to sel1 it. What is wrong with those sorts of things? They should be able to mortgage it, as anybody else would. Why are the people in my electorate who are given a farm but do not own it not able to raise money? (TIme expired)",121

207,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights",121
208,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"Corangamite) (7.30 p.m.}-I welcome to the gal1ery the primary school children of Meredith, Fyansford, Lethbridge, Shelford, Anakie and Lovely Banks, which are in my electorate of Corangamite. These children have seen the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) put up a very convincing case. They have been able to see the role of government and opposition in the House of Representatives. They have seen free and open debate that is recorded in the Hansard forever. However, I draw to the attention of the young students from my electorate the fact that the democratic traditions of this parliament are being chal1enged by the UN covenants. In 1991, the Hawke government ratified the first optional protocol to the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That allowed individual Australians to put to a UN committee for adjudication any problems that they might have. As members of this House would be aware, there was no public debate about the signing or ratification of t:lat agreement. It was done in the dead of night by the Hawke government, as was the case with a number of other United Nations treaties. A court of appeal allows individual Australians to put their complaints about the laws of the Commonwealth or the states. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) have said that these decisions do not affect the Australian law. However, Senator Gareth Evans said: You have to be prepared to accept the jurisdictional consequences of their application. Obviously, it is more than just an advisory position. This was the basis of Mr Toomen's complaints about the Tasmanian criminal code in relation to sodomy. The Tasmanian government is not recognised as a sovereign state at international law. Therefore, the Commonwealth was asked to represent the individual complaints put forward by Mr Toomen. The real irony is that the first optional protocol individual complaint is against the states. However, the states cannot answer the case because they are not represented on the human rights committee. I refer to the membership of the UN Human Rights Committee. It is represented by nations such as Egypt, Jordan, Senegal, Ecuador and Venezuela. Those are hardly countries that have long traditions of human rights and democracy. Ironically, several nations represented on that committee have not even ratified the first optional protocol in their own countries. Their own countries are not able to take the complaints to the UN committee. The UN committee does not have court procedures. There is no cross-examination and there are no public hearings. There is no doctrine of precedent and different rules apply at different times. It is hardly a procedure, as compared with this parliament, for coming to certain judgments. I suggest that the Australian sovereignty is under threat by these United Nations committees. They are nominated committees of four years standing; they are not elected. Vague assertions are put up by these conventions. The rights of privacy are now under debate in Australia. This could lead to a backdoor bill of rights by the very proposition being legislated by this parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wants to drop links with the United Kingdom but encourages the use of Third World UN covenants to achieve his political ends. Hopefully, the young children of Corangamite will have no bill of rights that will emanate from these UN covenants and there will be no breakdown of democracy as we know it in this parliament when they come to vote at the age of 18. Women's Issues",121
209,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Bass) (7.35 p.m.)All too often, those of us in the parliament get rather bogged down with the detail of what is happening here and we lose sight of the overall reasons why we are here. We think very deeply about a specific clause in a piece of legislation, or we may be thinking about the subtleties of our latest committee report, and we forget to take time out to reflect upon the real reasons why we are here and what motivated us to take up the challenge. For me, that is not so tonight. Tonight I intend to make some very general points about women's issues-some of the fundamental reasons why I decided to take the political path. Women's issues have been issues for many years-in fact, over nine decades if one looks at our history. However, let us face the fact that the past 30 years have been a great period of change. There have been a lot of accomplishments in advancing the status of women in Australia and there have been some great improvements in the areas of women's employment, education and health and their increased visibility in public life. These reflect the accomplishments most dramatically. For example, the labour force participation of women has been a major area of change. Now, 53 per cent of married women are in the labour force, and women make up 42 per cent of the labour force overall. Access to senior secondary and tertiary education by women has improved markedly. It is a noted fact that over 82 per cent of girls are now completing year 12. Women's ordinary time earnings-that is, excluding overtime-are 84 per cent of men's earnings for full-time workers, and statistics demonstrate progress since 1983 which is now narrowing the gender wage differential. Special services for women's health, including breast and cervical cancer screening programs and birthing services for indigenous women and women from a non-English speaking background, have been introduced. Special programs have been introduced to address violence against women and to promote a fair and accurate portrayal of women in the media. These have been developed in response to a very strong community concern. Progress has certainly been slow, but women are most definitely more visible in public life. We have accomplished much, but lots of key areas of concern remain. I suggest that, so far, the greatest challenges have been ensuring that structural adjustment in the economy does not disadvantage women, that opportunities within restructuring are used to promote the advancement of women and that social investment to increase women's choices is encouraged. Priorities for improving the status of women in Australia probably could be represented as follows: women's representation in public life and in decision making-that is, getting women into decision making positions should be a matter of priority; women in the law, with particular emphasis on the elimination of violence against women; women's participation in economic structures; and addressing the needs of Australia's indigenous women. Most of the speech that I have given so far has been taken from an overview of where women are that was done by the Office of the Status of Women. A paper was also delivered to the parliament this week on women and superannuation. I would like to comment on a couple of statements in this paper which are very pertinent in this area. The paper states: Superannuation and retirement incomes are matters which are of interest to most Australians but of particular interest to women for many reasons. We need to look at how to resolve the erosion of small superannuation account balances and reduce multiple accounts of workers who change jobs. This affects women most of all. It continues: The clear message is that there are a wide range of issues to be resolved, with many of these requiring a joint effort and cooperation of government, employers, unions, superannuation industry, families and women themselves. There you have some of the reasons I am involved in the process. Let me tell you this: there are not enough women; there should be more. Racism",122
210,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"I am very concerned about a story that ran in the Courier-Mail this morning headlined 'Downer linked to racists' by Peter Charlton. I actually think this is a disgraceful and dishonest piece of journalism. I have never been one in my political career, either in this place or in my former life in local government, to criticise the press lightly. I reckon in this job we take it on the chin, we cop it sweet, we win some, we lose some. But when this sort of story runs, and coincidentally runs at a time when this parliament is discussing the very sensitive and emotive issue of Aboriginal affairs, I really have to say something-and I do not do it lightly. It concerns me not only that this story ran in the Courier-Mail-apparently also in the Sydney Morning Herald today-and refers to an article that is coming out in the Bulletin, but also that the government could jump on this bandwagon. It seems to me that politics in this country has reached a very low point indeed when the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), who is a respected politician, a respected member of this place, would actually seek",123
211,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,Don't get carried away.,123
212,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"I will concede that he is afforded some degree of respect-that he would take the opportunity in this parliament, the parliament of this nation, during the debate on the censure motion to give some credibility to this story. I would say that anyone with an ounce of decency-the member for Calare (Mr Simmons) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe), who are both in this place, I would say would have more than an ounce of decency-would want to dissociate themselves from this story. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has already defended himself adequately against these cal\ous and low allegations. When we first heard this story we might have wondered a little bit about what it was all about, but when we read it we found that this is something that happened back in 1987. In a sense, as Leader of the Opposition has explained-I think very reasonably-he was there addressing a meeting not aware that there was somebody from the League of Rights apparently involved with this meeting. Even if it were otherwise, why would the press in this country dredge up something that happened back in 1987. This is a tough game and I do not think we can stand up in this place and appeal necessarily to the people's better instincts nor can we even say that there is such a thing as a fair go in this country. But, when these sorts of stories start to run and are actually given credence by members of the government, I think we are seeing a repeat of things that we saw in Nazi Germany in the late 1930s. Mr Cleary-Are members of the League of Rights racist or not?",123
213,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"The members of the League of Rights are racist and we have no doubt about that at all. The Leader of the Opposition has already dissociated himself, in no uncertain terms, from the League of Rights. None of us on this side would want to be associated in any way with the League of Rights. If the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) is suggesting it is otherwise, he is also getting down in the gutter. Mr Cleary-The leader spoke at the League of Rights meeting.",124
214,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"You are getting down in the gutter-I think you are better than this, too-with people on the other side of this House if you want to hang your hat on this sort of story. We are prepared to fight the government all the way to the next election on the issues which are important to the Australian people. I do not believe that any decent person who is elected to represent in this parliament wants politics to degenerate to this level. I condemn this story. I condemn those in the government for getting down into the gutter. I hope they will live to regret it. Landcare Mail-out",124
215,Mr SIMMONS,ADJOURNMENT,"Calare) (7.45 p.m.)Tonight I would like to bring to the attention of the House a survey which was posted to every Landcare group in Australia by a senior member of the coalition. The survey, along with an attached letter, is clearly a political document which questions the government's stance on Landcare and pushes what could loosely be termed as the coalition's primary industry policy. There is nothing wrong with that in itself, but this bulk mail-out to every Landcare group in the country-2,200 to be exact-was done using envelopes, presumably in all cases, from the New South Wales Department of Conservation and Land Management. I realise that the New South Wales government, the Fahey government, has been under a bit of pressure of late with by-election disasters. There was the 10 per cent swing in the Parramatta hy-election last week, and it has been digging other holes for itself. But to get caught up with an administrative blunder-that is to be kind to it-is quite inexcusable. The member in question is the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). In my view, he should be ashamed of himself. Surely the federal coalition must be getting pretty desperate if its sloppy administrative management is sending out politically motivated surveys using official state department stationery. One then has to question which department funded the stamps for the return envelopes addressed to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). But then, of course, we all know that the National Party has a special place in Australia's political history when it comes to bulk mail-outs. How far does something like this extend? How many other federal coalition members are using state departments around the country for the party's political gain? How much campaigning has the party done using the services of a state government department? Then, of course, the survey raises questions about the dubious methods used by the coalition to develop political artillery, with more leading questions and answers than a barrister during an examination-in-chief. Take question 11, for example: Do you believe Commonwealth support for Landcare is sufficient? Or question 9: How would you describe the adequacy of Sections 75(b) and 75(d) of the Income Tax Assessment .Act, which provide write-offs in the year of expenditure for approved on-farm conservation works? Inadequate. adequate or adequate but could be improved. Question 7 gives a detailed run-down of the coalition's tax credit system used in the last election. I would have thought that the last thing the coalition would be worrying about was taxation policy in the last election. Then the honourable member for Gwydir had the effrontery in his covering letter, which, I might add, featured his own letterhead, to write: It is not my intention in writing this letter to politicise Landcareand he then went on: ... although the Coalition will not be backward !n making the point that more needs to be done In terms of delivering assistance directly to farmers who undertake approved on-farm conservation works. This questionnaire, which was jointly prepared by the honourable member for Gwydir and the Leader of the National Party of Australia, (Mr Tim Fischer), I believe should have been more appropriately headed 'the Federal Coalition's Landcare Fishing Expedition' . Faulkner, Mr and Mrs R.",124
216,Mr CONNOLLY,ADJOURNMENT,"Bradfield) (7.48 p.m.)I wish to raise the sad if not tragic saga of Mrs Sylvia Faulkner and her husband Reg who are involved in a long standing fight for compensation from the Commonwealth. This matter has been mentioned many times in this place by members and senators from both sides. Earlier this year the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) refused a last ditch appeal from Mrs Faulkner for an ex gratia payment or, better still, an independent inquiry into her grievance. The Attorney, relying entirely on the advice of his department, decided that Mrs Faulkner's claim against the Department of Defence was baseless and without merit, and her allegations of a miscarriage of justice were singularly fanciful. Through a freedom of information request, however, I have uncovered new material which supports Mrs Faulkner's case. Other government documents which have found their way into the Faulkners' hands in just the past two months also add weight to their claims. The crux of Mrs Faulkner's compensation claim, which originated in 1974, was that over a period of years the army's engineer-inchief at the time, Brigadier Charles Flint, had led her to believe that the defence department was going to buy her invention, the Trisal clip. But the sales never eventuated. It took 13 years from the time of the original writ for the case to come to trial-a travesty of justice! Long before it did, in mid-1987, Mrs Faulkner had been sent bankrupt. She was entirely dependent on legal assistance from the Commonwealth under the Bankruptcy Act, but that assistance was reviewed just eight weeks before the trial, and very strict limits were put on the witnesses she could calI. This contributed to her losing the case. The FOI documents show that in handling the Faulkner claim the Attorney-General's Department relied on advice from the defence department. In early 1987, when the Attorney General's Department proposed a meagre offer of settlement, this was also vetoed by the Department of Defence. At that time, just a few months before the trial, the defence department argued that Mrs Faulkner's claim was entirely without merit for the following reasons. Firstly, she could not prove she had lent the money to develop the clip. Secondly, she did not hold the patents as claimed. Thirdly, the clip was not marketable and the companies involved were not capable of manufacturing it. Fourthly, the credibility of Mr and Mrs Faulkner was questionable. When it came to the trial the Commonwealth's case had completely changed. The trial judgment, in fact, states very clearly that the clip was Mrs Faulkner's invention, that she did hold the patents and that it was a good invention. It questioned who could doubt the ability of international company Vickers-Ruwolt to manufacture it. By then the whole case of the department, and therefore the Commonwealth, was that Brigadier Flint had made certain statements but had not misled the Faulkners because Mr Faulkner had cunningly manipulated him to get him to make these statements. This turnaround was extraordinary but it is easy to understand in view of other documents such as the letter from Brigadier Flint to the Defence Force Ombudsman dated 2 September 1975. In that letter Brigadier Flint states clearly that he did tell Trisal-that is, the Faulkners-that the army was going to buy the clip and that procedures for its introduction were initiated but there were unavoidable delays. He went on to state that his only dealings with Trisal were on behalf of the Commonwealth. That was Brigadier Flint's position in 1975. But a memo from senior officials in the Attorney-General's Department dated 4 February 1987, just two months before the trial, notes that, after fighting for it, Brigadier Flint was going to get his army pension after all. It continues: If that is the departmental position, let's that and inform Flint. Flint should be required to say he acted without authority. In the interests of justice, however belated, this whole affair demands an inquiry-one outside the Attorney-General's Department, which was so heavily involved in this case in the first instance. Therefore, I entreat the Attorney-General to reconsider his current view. Commonwealth Games",125
217,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat) (7.53 p.m.)The other afternoon I was talking about the Commonwealth Games and the fact that a number of athletes from Ballarat had competed-and competed successfuIly. Unfortunately, time did not all ow me to mention all those athletes. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I continue my contribution tonight.  medals in the men's and mixed doubles and the team badminton events. Over there with him were his mother, Valerie, and brother David, who is a good friend of mine. I know he would have been of great support to Peter. Murray Hocking was another member of the Australian badminton team which claimed bronze in the team section. I think his mother, Mrs Hocking, summed up the situation best when she said: My husband and I are very proud of our son and look forward to seeing him on Wednesday proudly wearing his Australian tracksuit and with a bronze medal around his neck. That is surely what these games are all about. The other member of the very successful BaIlarat contingent was RusseIl Mark, who is a shooter. RusseIl said that it was not one of his best competitions. He has made BaIlarat very proud in the past. Although it is not within my electorate, I would also like to pay tribute to Ararat cyclist Shane KeIly for what was a quite extraordinary international debut. The Ballarat Badminton Academy has come to the fore at the Commonwealth Games. John Tjoe, as reported in the Ballarat Courier, could not wipe the smile from his face. He is delighted with the success of Australia's confirm players at the Commonwealth Games and believes the glory in Canada is a major tonic for the groundwork under way for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. I am sure that all those sports men and women who with great pride represented this country and gave us such enormous pleasure at the Commonwealth Games are setting themselves towards the Sydney 2000 games. The other day, when I mentioned that these sports men and women were great ambassadors for Ballarat, I was talking about Steve Moneghetti. Of course, Peter Blackburn, Murray Hocking, and RusseIl Mark of the badminton academy-indeed, with the leave of the member for Wan non (Mr Hawker), I again mention cyclist Shane KeIly-are all fantastic ambassadors for both BaIlarat and Australia.

I make no apology for raising this matter, and I propose to pursue it. Quite frankly, I do not understand how honourable gentlemen opposite, including many members of the National Party, have been under pressure from this organisation from time to time in their own electorates-and have repudiated it.

226,Mr HOLDING,ADJOURNMENT,"If he wants to repudiate it, that is fine; I withdraw. The point I am making is that I do not understand why leading members of the opposition suddenly went feral and reduced this House almost to chaos with endless points of order and dissent from your very correct ruling, Mr Acting Speaker, in respect of a question that was moderately put. I do not make any apology on behalf of my electorate for the fact that I am happy to pursue this organisation, because I repudiate what it stands for. I propose to ask a question. I do not understand why the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) and other members of the opposition were so concerned to take up the valuable time of question time-they are always complaining about not having enough time-so that this question could not be answered by the Minister for Finance. There is a strong tradition in the opposition, particularly in the National Party, and there are members opposite who have been put under the hammer by this organisation. There are still questions, which I will raise on behalf of my electorate, that have to be answered. If you want to carry on and associate yourselves with the League of Rights, that is your problem.

I there comes a point when people cannot NA Wednesday, 31 August 1994 be adequately served and looked after in adequate supply of nursing home beds. I raise this as a concern, and the Parliamentary and Health (Dr Theophanous) may want to comment concerned about the shortage of nursing home my own electorate, where we have 23 nursing number and it obviously reflects the fact, as of retired and aged people. But there are I wrote to the Minister for Human Services recently, bringing to her attention the chronic and the fact that there is now a real crisis, In preparing to make representations to the of the nursing home directors of nursing on me just how big the problem actually was. One particular nursing home director, in 15 applications for residency each week, unfortunately died, which happened only twice work those statistics out, you will find just how home was. When I checked around, I found that on the Gold Coast. The people who had been assessed through beds were the people on the waiting lists.

TIle aspect of HACC services I bring to the secretary is some confusion in my mind about state funding. It seems to me that there because, although in 1993 the Commonwealth as I understood it, that required the Queensland to match that funding. What I found was happening was that, although the offer from the Commonwealth was not prepared to accept its particular responsibility Commonwealth funds was not actually being taken up. I wrote to the Queensland Minister for concerns that that was a fact. I do not know issue in particular, but I want to put on record wi11 not work unless the state government concerned look a gift horse in the mouth. That appears with the growth funding that was provided Queensland state government.

NA to the House for further consideration: Main Committee adjourned at 12.42 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Racial Vilification Legislation (Question No. 1215) Mr Campbell asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 31 May 1994: (1) Has the Prime Minister stated that racial vilification legislation which will include criminal sanctions will be introduced to the Parliament before the end of 1994. (2) Has a report been prepared by officers of his Department who took submissions and held consultative meetings around Australia on a draft racial vilification bill; if so, will he release the report to the public; if not, why not. (3) Did officers of his Department advise that criminal sanctions should not be included in a racial vilification bill. (4) Will the racial vilification bill to be introduced include criminal sanctions. (5) Is he representing the wishes of the majority of Australians in the matter of racial vilification legislation; if so, what is the evidence to support this. (6) Will he state the precise time frame for the introduction of racial vilification legislation; if why not.",163
253,Mr LAVARCH,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised that the answer is 'no'. (2) In my Ministerial capacity I have received a number of briefings from my Departmental advisers on proposed racial vilification legislation. I have also received reports from my Departmental advisers on the result of public consultations held early in 1993 which have been put to Cabinet and will not be released publicly. (3) My Departmental advisers have put a number of options to me to consider in relation to racial vilification legislation. Their advice has canvassed all options, including the options of enacting and not enacting criminal sanctions. (4) I am unable to answer this question pending Cabinet consideration of any proposed racial vilification legislation. (5) As the Honourable Member will know, this issue has been considered and reported on in three reports to Government and extensive consultations NA were undertaken with the community by the bodies responsible for those reports, namely, the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Royal Commission Into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Whilst I am not able to say what the views of all Australians are on the issue, the Government must give weight to the recommendations of these reports. (6) I am unable to answer this question pending Cabinet consideration of any proposed racial vilification legislation. Native Mammal Species (Question No. 1251) Mr Slipper asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 7 June 1994: (I) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a claim in the Canberra TImes of 6 June 1994 that Australia is losing its native mammal species at a faster rate than is occurring anywhere else in the world. (2) Is it a fact that (a) Australia has lost 20 native mammal species in 200 years while the rest not, of the world has lost 60 species in 500 years, (b) a further 123 species have been listed as endangered and (c) more species have become endangered since 1984 than in the preceding decade. (3) What credentials does the Government claim in environmental management and what is the basis for those credentials.",167
254,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes (2)(a) Australia has lost 20 native mammal species in the last 200 years, which represents half the total lost in the world in that period. Reliable figures for losses over the last 500 years are not available. (b) No, 30 native mammals are listed as endangered in the Commonwealth Endangered Species Protection Act 1992, not 123. A further 18 are listed as vulnerable. (c) The first nationally agreed list of Australian endangered vertebrates was adopted in 1980. It is therefore not possible to indicate whether more species have become endangered since 1984 than in the preceding decade. However it is significant that population decline of many endangered species has been halted or reversed by the application of research results, and the implementation of conservation management. (3) It is not clear what the honourable member means by ""credentials ... in environmental management"". The Commonwealth Government has significant responsibilities and powers in the area of the environment. The Commonwealth Government seeks to give effect to its environmental objectives and obligations through a number of laws and programs and through cooperative arrangements with the States and Territories and local Governments throughout Australia. The Commonwealth has available to it significant environmental management expertise from within its own Departments and Agencies which is supplemented from time to time by the expertise of the Australian academic and professional communities. Australia is well regarded internationally for the range and depth of its environmental expertise. Department of Housing and Regional Development: Costs (Question No. 1255)",167
255,Mr COSTELLO,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 7 June 1994: What are the (a) cost of corporate services, (b) running costs and (c) percentage of corporate services costs to running costs for 1994-95 in each agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility.",168
256,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In developing an answer to the honourable member's question consideration had to be given to the range of activity that could properly be described as corporate services. In this regard particula attention was given to the definition of corporate services used in the Conroy Report on the Customs Service. The National Capital Planning Authority has analysed its activities and provided a best estimate answer consistent with the Conroy Report definition of corporate service. Figures are detailed below. The Department of Housing and Regional Development was however, only established on 25 March 1994. Negotiations are still continuing with the Departments of Finance, Human Services and Health and Industry, Science and Technology on resources for the Department. Resource figures for the Department are therefore only indicative and could be subject to change at a later date. Moreover, the Department does not have an expenditure history to enable it to identify and quantify corporate services activities in accordance with the Conroy Report definition. The Department's answer below includes all expenditure contained in the Corporate Direction and Support Program of the 1994-95 Portfolio Budget Measures Statement which includes a range of expenditures not encompassed by the Conroy Report definition (eg. the Senior Executive of the Department, Communications and Public Affairs). Subject to the above, the specific answers to the honourable member's question are: For the Department of Housing and Regional Development (a) $ 6,519,000; (b) $38,066,000; (c) 17% For the National Capital Planning Authority (a) $ 693,418; (b) $8,663,000; (c) 8% Department of Primary Industries and Energy: Costs (Question No. 1264)",168
