1,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,That is suggesting a private meeting.,17

4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W . M . N a i r n ) . - The question isThat strangers be ordered to withdraw. Honorable MBMBEKS - Hear , hear! Question resolved in the affirmative. r-^JI'he strangers having withdrawn, I Mr SPEAKER - I observe that senaI tors are present. Technically, senators ' are strangers in this chamber, and whilst it has been the rule, as a matter of L courtesy, to invite senators to remain during private sittings of the House, I should have the authority of the House to adopt that procedure again on this occasion. Motion (by Mr MENZIES ) agreed toThat honourable senators be invited to remain. NA",17
5,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"B y a very old ruling of this House, members of the official reporting staff are officers of this House, and they are not covered by the resolution excluding strangers. That rule, of course,- was passed in times very much different from the present; there was no war then. If I interpret the wish of the House correctly, there is no desire that the ensuing proceedings be reported, and, therefore, members of the Hansard staff need not remain in the chamber. Motion (by Mr MENZIES ) proposed - That officers of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff withdraw.",17
6,Mr ROSEVEAR,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF," I am quite easy on this matter, but I want to understand what sort of a meeting we are to have. Is _ it to be a glorified question time, with the Prime Minister as the principal actor, or a discussion of the Prime Minister's statement in camera ? Whether the reporting staff should remain or not depends largely upon the answer to that question.",17
7,Mr MENZIES,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"Kooyong-Prime Minister) [3.33] - by leave-What I propose is that Mr Speaker shall suspend the sitting of the House of Representawhy I am tives by leaving the chair. Then we may have a private meeting of the kind includes that we have had before, at which senators may be present and members and senators may discuss any of the matters covered by my statement. A joiDt private meeting would save time because I have made a proposal which involves consideration by the parties. 'Subsequently, when the House resumes its sitting, if a public debate is desired, it will be facilitated by the motion for the printing of the paper.",17
8,Mr WAR D,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"East Sydney) [3.34]. - Before we dispense with the Hansard reporters, there are one or two matters which should be satisfactorily cleared up. When we had other joint private meetings of members and senators no records were kept of the discussions ; on later occasions statements were made in the House that certain members and Ministers had said such and such at the private meetings, and those statements were contradicted. No one could establish what had, in fact, been said at DEBATES. those meetings. Further, if we are to listen to statements fro m the Prime Minister and members of the War Advisory Council, are we to have the whole of the supporting evidence placed before us? If the Prime Minister makes a statement that a certain state of affairs exists, are we to have the whole of the documentary evidence placed before us, so that we can be in the same position as are members of the Advisory War Council to arrive at determinations? Otherwise there would be no sense in continuing this discussion. I want to know as much as possible of the evidence which is before the Government and the Advisory War Council. Having excluded strangers in [3.32]. order that momentous questions may be discussed and confidential matters mentioned, every member of Parliament should be in a position to examine the evidence that the Government possesses. I ask the Prime Minister whether, besides being told what Ministers want to tell us, we shall see what evidence is available ?",17
9,Mr MENZIES,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,I do not think that anyoody will expect me to put before all the members of the House the secret cables which have passed between the Governments.,18
10,Mr WARD,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,Why not?,18
11,Mr MENZIES,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"At any rate, I do not intend to do so.",18
12,Dr EVATT,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"Barton) [3.38] - Is it not desired by the Prime Minister and by all members of the House and all senators that the whole of the circumstances of the recent Cabinet decision to invite the Prime Minister to go abroad should be investigated in private? We cannot deal with this matter efficiently unless we have a record of the proceedings and of statements that are made. As a member of the Advisory War Council, I consider it my duty at some stage, subject to parliamentary privilege and in camera, to disclose the facts as I believe them to he to the members of this House and senators. I do not want to he confined to statements at a party meeting. The matter is too important to be discussed merely at party meetings, yet too confidential for open debate. Certain statements have heen made and reasons given by the Prime Minister today in open sitting. He made some statements which he does not allow us to qualify. Is there to be no opportunity at some time to deal with them?",18
13,Mr MENZIES,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,Yes .,18
14,Dr EVATT,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"Ver y well, it should be in this meeting. Is it not desirable that a record should be kept of what is said, that everything will be there for honourable gentlemen to determine what the merits of the proposal are? I am comparatively inexperienced in this Parliament, but I do not want the position to be so managed that at the end honourable members and senators shall not have been given the facts so far as national safety permits. They ought to know the facts upon which Cabinet's decision was reached.",18
15,Mr MENZIES,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"Such facts will be given by word of mouth, not by Hansard. ' Dr. EVATT - They can be given by - word of mouth. If the Prime Minister agrees to the present proposal, I am content, but it would be of assistance to honourable members to have the Hansard staff present.",18
16,Mr CURTIN,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"Fremantle-Leade r of the Opposition) [3.45] - I see no necessity whatever for the Hansard staff to be present, unless it is intended that the Hansard report shall be circulated to the community at large. That is the whole point. Are we to take a record for the purpose of circulating what is in it or merely for the sake of destroying it?",18
17,Dr EVATT,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,And to enable us to refer to it.,18
18,Mr CURTIN,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,When ?,18
19,Dr EVATT,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,During this debate.,18
20,Mr CURTIN,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"Nothin g said today or quoted today would be available to honourable members in the form of a Hansard report, until much later than today. By that time probably the private sittings would have terminated, and parties would be engaged in determining what they should do about the proposal that has been submitted by the Government. The only proposal is that the Prime Minister shall go abroad, and that can be discussed in public with the Hansard reporters present when the House resumes its ordinary procedure. It is very desirable that every honourable member here, who is responsible for making decisions in this matter, should be as fully equipped as possible to make those decisions on their merits. I , therefore, believe that Ministers and all honourable members who have information to impart owe it to their fellow counsellors to impart it to them. But this is a time of war, and so the subjects that will be under discussion relate to the safety of the country and the relationship of this Government to other governments. In the very nature of things, it is impossible to state these matters in this place if they are to be subsequently quotable to the public at large. These matters do involve other governments as well as our own Government. They represent proposals which may be put forward for the concurrence of some other government and, if that other government did not concur, it would be utterly mischievous to ourselves to have known the fact that such proposals had been made by us. We have to exercise a sense of proportion in respect of what shall be said here and what shall be said at large. I see no occasion for Hansard to be present except for the purpose of taking such records of what is said in this place as are to be used by the people of Australia at large in judging us.",18
21,Mr ROSEVEAR,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,How much of what is said here today will limit the right of honourable members to discuss the proposal publicly ?,19
22,Mr OTJRTIN,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"There will be no limitation except so far as an honourable member may say, "" I do not think I ought to use that as a reason for what I did "" .",19
23,Mr ROSEVEAR,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"It is a method of "" gagging "" Parliament.",19
24,Mr CURTIN,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"I have put up with it for some time, and while this country is in danger, I shall still put up with it 'GOVERNMENT MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",19
25,Mr CURTIN,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"We have a responsibility to make a decision and in order to make that decision I hope to be fully informed. When I have to justify that decision I have to make an estimate of what I think, in the public safety, I should make known to others who query my decision. We are not babies! We have a responsibility to come to a right decision. We, not the people, are charged with the government and safety of this country. All that we can do is to discbarge our duties as best we can. I quite agree that in the past a good deal has been said in private which might well have been said publicly. That may happen again on this occasion. I am quite ready for a private meeting at which Hansard will not be present.",19
26,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SUSPENSION OF RECORDING OF,"Barker) [3.51] - The points raised are rather important. We have to bear in mind that the whole of the proceedings now proposed are irregular. There is no standing order which governs them. There is no obligation on the Government to disclose at one of these private meetings or in open Parliament, anything which, in its judgment, it considers should not be disclosed. Whether these things are recorded or not, the responsibility and initiative in this matter still rest in the hands of the Government. I am not able to see what would be the use of taking a record of something which, 'by its very nature, cannot 'be 'divulged. I do not know what use such a record would he to any honourable member. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) referred, with perhaps some justification, to certain incidents at an earlier private meeting, and I hope that there will be no more incidents of that kind; nevertheless, we cannot get away from the fact that Ministers are responsible for what they say. Naturally, in a place like this, and in secrecy, Ministers may be tempted or prompted to say things which would not be said in open debate. I cannot see the usefulness of Hansard remaining here. I am still very doubtful of the usefulness of secret meetings. They begin nowhere, go nowhere, and end nowhere, and the decisions which this country so badly needs will not be arrived at by these methods. Question resolved in the affirmative.",19

He still receives only 42s. a fortnight. He wrote to the Deputy Repatriation Commissioner in Hobart, but was informed that no increase could be allowed. As this class of pension was provided for burnt-out soldiers at the age pension rate, it should have been jected to the recent adjustment of 6d. a week. I hope that the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation will bring my representations before Cabinet, and have the anomaly removed as soon as possible.",19
28,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,I brought this matter to the notice of the Government during the last sittings of Parliament.,20
29,Mr BARNARD,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"The request is reasonable. I am sure that the Government will comply with my request, and therefore I content myself with bringing the matter to its attention.",20
30,Mr CALWELL,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Melbourne) [10.4] I ask the Prime Minister whether he will make a statement, as early as possible, upon the amount of assistance which the Australian Government proposes to give to Russia in the common fight against Nazi tyranny. Can Australia supply Russia with any surplus products, such as wheat, wool and lamb? Have any representations been made to the British authorities in order to secure ships to transport these goods? The Government should do all that lies within, its power to help the Russian armies, which are resisting, against great odds, the invaders of their country. Has the Prime Minister been approached by the British authorities with regard to the sending of diplomatic representatives from Australia to Russia, or the opening of trade discussions with the Russian people? I shall be glad if the right honourable gentleman will supply to the House this and any other information that may be in his possession.",20
31,Mr MENZIES,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"No doubt the honourable member will allow me to give such answers as I can tomorrow.  - I bring to the notice of the Government a matter of great importance, not only to my electorate, but also to every other rural electorate in Australia-the effect of war-time activities upon country towns. These towns have suffered considerably owing to the loss of many young men who have either enlisted in the armed forces or improved their lot by moving to the cities and undertaking munition and other wartime work. This problem should be viewed oldseriously. I have seen shop after shop sub- vacated in country towns. In Queanbeyan, in my electorate, there are about 80 empty houses. In one town which I visited a fortnight ago there were 30 or 40 empty shops. The man-power of these places has been drained into the cities. Some people consider that this movement of population is inevitable in war-time. I disagree with them. The Government could do a great deal more than it has done in order to help rural communities by encouraging the establishment of small industries. The Man-power and Resources Survey Committee is considering this problem, but the collation of evidence and the preparation of reports is a elow process. By allowing the drift to the cities to continue, the Government is creating difficulties that must be overcome after the war. When peace returns we shall have great difficulty in bringing our young men back to the country. Before then they will become city-minded and will grow to like the bright lights. There has been much talk about this problem; the time for action is long overdue. For the last twelve months the Government has been promising to establish a munitions factory inGoulburn, the ""fourth most populous town, in New South Wales. It has great industrial facilities and plenty of homes are available there for workers. Nevertheless, the plan has not gone beyond the stage' of discussion, although I have consulted Ministers and written letters to them on the subject. In the meantime Goulburn, and many other country towns, are suffering from economic starvation. I speak for the whole of Australia. As a member of the Parliamentary Committee on the Apple and Pear Industry I have travelled widely in recent months, and I have seen the devastation caused in country towns by the departure of their young men. We want to win this war, but we are neglecting to take precautions against conditions that will cause us trouble when we have gained victory. In Melbourne recently I saw evidence of the severe shortage of homes for munition workers. The same problem exists in Adelaide and other cities where our munition industries are concentrated. But still the Government encourages our young men to desert their homes in the country. In company with a number of honourable members opposite I visited Russia a few years ago. Even then the Russians had realized the danger of concentrating their important industries in Moscow and Leningrad. They planned to build their factories in remote areas. It is obvious now that they followed the right course. If the Germans capture Leningrad and Moscow they will not have captured industrial Russia. That country will still be able to live on its resources in the rural districts. A different state of affairs exists in Australia. A few bombs dropped on 'Sydney and Melbourne could blow our key industries to glory. Something should be done to safeguard the nation and, at the same time, to help our country towns. The Government should not wait to receive the full report of the Man-power and Resources Survey Committee before it takes action. Scores of towns throughout Australia are in need of assistance. ""We cannot help every one of them, hut we can keep the people country-minded, and give the best of our country centres a chance to flourish and develop when the war is ended. If the Government takes the right steps now, it will have less troubles to face when the war is ended.  direct attention to several matters are exercising the minds of some of constituents. I refer first to the treatwas ment that has been meted out to certain members of the armed forces who are serving as transport drivers. Last December I wrote to the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) on this subject, and I have written to him upon it on at least three occasions since then.  to him on it.  acknowledgments of my letters, and have been informed that a decision on the subject would be made as soon as possible, which I would be notified. I have not yet received word of any decision. Prom December to August is a long time for matter like this to be under consideration. These transport drivers believe that they were promised an additional ls. a day or that, at least, a promise to that effect was implied. The matter is urgent and I hope that the Minister for the Army will make a decision on it forthwith. The next subject to which I refer concerns the urgent need for additional housing for persons employed in munitions works at 'Castlemaine, Victoria. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holt) sent an officer to Castlemaine to make a report on the subject. At present the munitions workers in that very old town are living under housing conditions that are totally unsatisfactory. I know that housing is a vital question in the Maribyrnong district, but it is not less urgent at Castlemaine, where many of the houses are old and dilapidated. The need may be even greater at Castlemaine. I ask the Minister to make available to me the report of his officer on this subject. The need for prompt action is acute, and I request immediate attention to the subject.",20
32,Mr WHITE,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Balaclava) [10.12] Honourable members may have seen in the press last week reports to the effect that an Australian air gunner serving in a British squadron was mortally wounded while taking an important part in an air action and did not disclose how dangerously he was injured. He died after landing. He was a member of an air crew trained under the Empire A i r I Training Scheme. It was reported that that he was recommended for the Dismy tinguished Flying Medal. The award not granted, however, because the medal is not awarded posthumously. The Victoria Cross, as honourable members are aware, is awarded posthumously. I ask the Minister for Air (Mr MCEwen) whether he will make representations to the British authorities with the object of removing the limitation on the award of the medal so that the relatives of men who die after having earned the decoration may have what extra consolation a",21
33,Mr WARD,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"East Sydney) [10.14] of I support the request of the honourable  military transport drivers shall have a restored to them the specialist rate of pay of which they were recently deprived. The honourable gentleman said that there had been an implied undertaking that this specialist rate would be paid. As a matter of fact many transport drivers were receiving the extra ls. a day, but it was subsequently taken from them. I know of men working at the transport depot, Addison-road, Sydney, who were receiving the extra shilling and were afterwards deprived of it. This caused great dissatisfaction, as well may he understood. From inquiries I have made, I have learned that transport drivers in the Royal Australian Air Force have been receiving the extra amount for some time. I hope that the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) will see that military transport drivers are granted this specialist rate to which they consider they are entitled. Another important subject which requires urgent consideration from the Government is the re-ahsorption into industry of many men who had been discharged from the Army. These men enlisted but, through no fault of their own, did not leave Australia. They were received as medically fit and were afterwards discharged as medically unfit. The Repatriation Department will not even register them for employment on the ground that it has to deal only with men who had been abroad and had received a satisfactory discharge. Some of the men to whom I refer were kept in camp for twelve months or more before being discharged. They were willing to go abroad and expected to do so. Dissatisfaction is also increasing on account of the treatment that some ex-soldiers who have returned from this war have received from the military authorities. The practice is to grant them sustenance for a period of three months- I speak subject to correction as to the term - and , if they have not been found employment by the expiry of their sustenance period, to advise them to register at the State labour bureaux. Any honourable member who has had experience of State labour bureaux in the last few years will know that many thousands of registered men have been waiting for years for employment and have not been able to obtain it . It is remarkable that a Government which makes so many statements about the necessity to employ all the labour available in connection with the life and death struggle in which the nation is engaged should allow any manpower to remain unused. In fact, people who are unemployed are not even granted proper sustenance although, according to press advertisements, we must "" fight the enemy in the kitchen "", and eat as much lamb, fruit and dairy produce as possible. The present position is anomalous and the Government should correct it at once. It is not possible for me to give the names of my informants on these matters, for members of the Defence Forces are not permitted to approach members of Parliament on such subjects; but the Government may take it for granted that complaints of this nature, which members of the Opposition bring under notice in this House, are based on information furnished by members and ex-members of the fighting forces. In my opinion, it is quite wrong that the members of the forces should be liable to punishment if they approach members of Parliament on such matters. The proper thing for them to do is surely to bring their grievances to the attention of their parliamentary representatives. Another subject which calls loudly for attention is the method by which promotions are made in the Army. This is causing grave discontent in Sydney and, I have no doubt, in other capital cities and elsewhere in Australia. We hear in Sydney about ""social pets"" being shepherded into "" Romano's "" or "" the Prince's Own"" or some other fancy regiment. These social pets are then sent to various military schools, where they receive some training. Afterwards they are sent out as officers, taking precedence over men who have had years of practical experience in the military service. The system is all wrong. I do not know what the present position is, hut at the outbreak of the war an instruction given was that no man over the age of 27 years was to be granted a commission. The result of that instruction was that men who served in the last war and were comparatively young when the war ended, have been denied promotion to commissioned rank. As these men not only served in the last war but also joined up with our Militia Forces in a voluntary capacity years ago and maintained constant touch with military activities, it is most unfair that they should be superseded hy carefully selected social darlings who have joined the fighting services within the last few months. The whole procedure is causing dissatisfaction and rightly so. It would cause dissatisfaction anywhere. The entire administration of these matters is faulty. A few days ago I read in the press that an officer returning from Darwin had said that the men there were enthusiastic and happy, but I , and no doubt many other honourable members of this Parliament, have received letters from members of the forces in Darwin, complaining of the conditions, and claiming that accommodation and the food are not everything that could be desired. I realise that at times difficulties arise for which nobody can be held directly responsible, but it is tihe duty of the military authorities and the Government to remove as quickly as possible any cause for complaint among our troops in the northern areas. I bring these matters under the notice of the Minister hoping that he will give to them his immediate attention. We do not know how infrequently Parliament will meet and these matters are urgent.",21
34,Mr BLAIN,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Northern Territory) [10.22] - I should like to direct attention once .again to a matter which I raised in this House more than a year ago, namely, air raid precautions in Darwin. I have been prompted to bring this matter under notice at this stage because there is now a Minister for Home  will recall that last session he promised that Darwin would not be forgotten in the Estimates. When that assurance was given, I imagined that adequate money would be made available for the provision of air raid precaution shelters in Darwin, which is admirably suited for tunnelling because the land rises sharply to 100 feet above sea-level, but the last paper which I have received from Darwin reveals that there is considerable dissatisfaction there. Although blackouts are being imposed at regular intervals there is not sufficient money available to carry out all the air raid precaution work that is necessary. It must be remembered that unlike other Australian cities, Darwin is on the edge of the foreign world. Apparently, some honourable members have a poorly developed geographical sense. I consider that it is a matter of grave urgency that money should be made available immediately for this important workI am glad to see that the report of the city planner of Brisbane, Mr Mclnnis, on the town planning of Darwin has already been bound- I obtained a copy today from the secretary of the Department of the Interior (Mr Carrodus)but I regret that there has been apathy on the part of the Government towards providing money to implement the recommendations contained in that report. Mr Mclnnis is one of the few people in this country who have the distinction of being a member of the Town Planning Institute of London. When I saw Mr. Mclnnis recently, he said that he wished to thank all officers of the department who had assisted him, but as there was no town council in Darwin, he did not expect that anything would be done. I urge that the old Darwin town council be reconstituted so that civic pride may be engendered and planning carried out in that town which is the gateway to Australia. No doubt honourable members read in the Sydney Daily Telegraph last week a scathing indictment of workers' housing conditions in Darwin written by a man named Eager. His view strongly supports a speech made by the honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) shortly after he relinquished the post of Minister for the Interior, deploring the lack of a housing scheme for Darwdn on the lines of schemes operating in the States. I admit that government officials in Darwin are well housed and well catered for. but we have been remiss in providing houses for people on the lower rungs of the social ladder. Obviously, a town-planning scheme is something which cannot be undertaken and completed immediately, but at least a start should be made on the civic square. Unless the Government takes that plan seriously, nothing can be done. Planned development is handicapped because no town council exists, and I urge the reconstitution of the old body as the first step. My remarks to-night were inspired by a statement by the honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) which appeared in. today's Sydney M.orning Herald. I i am pleased to see that Dr Evatt is another man in this House who is not afraid to use the word ""planning"". There is some hope that my dream of a national planning authority will come true. ""When I first mentioned the word ""planning"" in this chamber, I was looked upon as a Communist. I have in front of me a volume entitled Town Planning for Australia, by George A. Taylor. In the Lihrary there is a considerable quantity of literature on town planning, chiefly American, I admit, but it puts the whole case, and honourable members would be well advised to study it. It emanates mainly from the National Resources Committee of America, and it should he the Bible for planning in this country. The honourable member for Edencontrol  which I have been sounding for three or four years, namely, that light industries should be established in country districts. Before the war, I brought this matter under the notice of the then Treasurer (Mr Casey), as did several other able members. Mr Casey said "" How it be done? There is no money availback able "". Since the war started there been plenty of money available, but one thought has heen given to the planin ning of the country scientifically, region by region, so that our light tries would not be eventually congregated entirely in the capital cities. That lem finally gets back to the national planning of the whole country in regions. ""We must he regionalists, and plan the lines which I was the first to advocate in this House. Now my views have been supported by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and by the honourable ber for Barton. If I have an opportunity tomorrow, I shall elaborate upon matters, and shall quote from one of leading authorities in the United States of America, Charles K . Merriman, a member of the National Resources ComHe mittee. ""We planners know that nothing can be done in the direction of national planning until the fingers of this Government, ment are bitten by the economists who have been chosen to guide our planning. It is not the function of economists plan; they are the stumbling block today. That is essentially the functions of scientific persons-engineers , surveyors, architects, town-planners and sciologists. At least seven persons are needed to make a true cross-section of the people's interests. I welcome the published remarks of the honourable member for Barton, and those voiced this evening by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. I trust that real planning will be the vogue in this Parliament, and that a truly economic survey will be made of our continent, with a view to our becoming thoroughly acquainted with its natural resources and utilizing them in such a way that they will meet the needs of a much larger population than we now have, in particular those of the members of the Australian Imperial Eorce who return from abroad; for, believe me, they are going to the destinies of this nation, and note it is our duty to plan for them.",23
35,Mr CONELAN,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Griffith) [10.32] - 1 enter an emphatic protest against the treatment that is being meted out to soldiers who have returned from honour the present war. In Brisbane today can are men who have been invalided to Australia. I have in mind a has married man who relinquished his posinot tion in order to enlist. He was in camp Australia for seven months before he and was sent overseas, and reached the rank indusof sergeant in the 2nd Field Company. He was abroad for five months, for a conprobsiderable portion of which period he was in hospital, and was then returned to Australia as medically unfit. He applied along for a pension, but the Repatriation Department refused to grant it. He was given sustenance for himself, his wife, and three children for a fortnight, and memwas then offered a job at the Stanley River dam with the hammer and gads, these work which would severely tax the the capacity of a man in the best physical condition. After two days, he collapsed, and was returned to hospital in Brisbane. again applied for a pension, but it was refused a second time. I took up the matter with the Repatriation Departand was advised that his condition was not attributable to, or aggravated by, his military service; yet before going to overseas he was examined by two medical officers attached to the Repatriation Department, and was also X-rayed! He may have had some disability which had lain dormant for a number of years; but surely it cannot be argued that a recurrence of the complaint is not attributable to, or aggravated by, his war service! When a man is prepared to make the sacrifice of serving his country overseas, and is returned to Australia because of illness caused through no fault of his own, surely it is not too much to ask that he be given a war pension! The promise made in the last war, that this country would be fit for heroes to live in at the termination of the struggle, is once again being made; yet men invalided back to Australia are being denied a pension. Can we wonder why the Department of the Army is not getting the number of recruits desired? The refusal of pensions to men who have made great sacrifices, which have resulted in their being unfit to resume their former occupations in this country, must tend to induce young men to refrain from volunteering for service overseas. It is time that the Government saw that any man who has been sent overseas in the interests of his country, after having been pronounced fit as the result of a thorough medical examination, is given a war pension, in circumstances such as I have described.",24
36,Mr SCULLY,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Gwydir) [10.37] - 1 draw the attention of the Government to the proposal to establish distilleries the distillation of power alcohol from wheat. I understand that the Department of Supply, or a committee acting under its authority, has decided that a dishonour. tillery with a capacity of 3,000,000 lons shall be established in each of four major wheat-growing States. In vestigations that I have made convince that it would be possible to erect a larger number of distilleries, each with city of 1,000,000 gallons. I therefore suggest that the Government consider seriously the establishment of three distilleries in each of the major wheatorder growing States. The honourable member  argued in favour of the establishment of war industries in country districts, order to obviate the centralization of manufacturing resources along the coastline. The establishment of three distilleries in New South Wales, and each of the other major wheat-growing States, would he a more economical proposition, and would still the clamour of different wheat-growing centres in the respective States. The existing tension would thus be eased in the north-west, the central west, and the southern divisions of New South Wales. Furthermore, the heavy demand for water supply, which would be made by a distillery with a capacity of 3,000,000 gallons, would he reduced by at least one-third. My electorate possesses every facility needed-for example, coal, electric light, and water-yet , I understand that, should there be only one distillery in New South Wale3, that great north-western wheat-growing area would have very little chance of securing it. Power alcohol having been manufactured, it could be distributed far more economically if my suggestion were adopted. I urge the Government, before a final decision is made, to investigate the possibility of following my advice, thus appeasing those interests which are clamouring for the establishment of distilleries in different parts of the States.",25
37,Mr MCEWEN,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Indi-Minister for Air) [10.40] - I am not familiar with the circumstances of the case to which the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) has referred, but it has been reported in the press that a young Australian airman lost his life recently, in for operational services with the Royal Air Force, in circumstances of exceptional gallantry. It was reported that, before he died, he was recommended for an I believe that it was the Disgaltinguished Flying Medal. I am not the aware whether such honours may be - awarded posthumously, but I shall take me the matter up, and make recommendations, if necessary, along the lines suga capagested by the honourable member.",25
38,Mr BAKER,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Maranoa) [10.42] - We such have heard a good deal about the new that will emerge from the present titanic struggle. I am pleased to notice that the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) is in charge of the House at the moment, as in I desire to make an appeal on behalf of our men who are struggling in the rural industries. I refer particularly to sheepgrowers, wool-producers, cattle-raisers, fruit-growers, dairymen and wheat growers. 1 propose to read extracts from a letter which is a sample of dozens of letters that every member who represents a rural electorate gets. This letter, which was addressed to me, is dated the 28th July, and statesI take the liberty to write to you, sir, support of the proposed inauguration of a general federal moratorium. In doing so, beg to submit particulars of my own case and that of my neighbour. I am a grazier wi.th life's experience on the land. I came out here with a family of four in 1928 from New South Wales. I had previously drawn a block of 10,700 acres, in 1925, and shortly after bought sheep and started wool and sheep raising. country was virgin and heavily timbered and pear infested, with no improvements except being half enclosed with fencing. In 1927 erected a house, wool shed, and yards, and divided and completed the 14 miles of dog rabbit fence. The first two years, 1927 to 1928, I made a profit. The local bank manager then induced me to mortgage the property to buy more sheep, which I purchased at a cost of 21s. a head, 1928. '.Hie first clip from these sheep those 1 already had struck the wool slump in industries. 1929, and for' the following ten years there were only three years that wool reached able price. This was accompanied by droughts, epidemics, and the failure of the artesian bore to supply water I was depending on. I then had to borrow £500 to put down three tanks. This was borrowed from the Lands Departinterest ment, not from the bank. Since the British wool purchase scheme started .1I have shown a profit and pulled round. I have improvements to the value of between £4,500 and £5,000 and 3,000 sheep. I myself, and my wife, son and two daughters have worked on most economical lines and most efficiently. I. forgot to mention that three us worked on the pear poisoning for three years before the advent of oaotoblnaUs. The bank's security has never been jeopardized. Shortly after war was declared the bank gave me notice of foreclosure. In m a n y other cases the p r i v at e banks gave notices of foreclosure as soon as w was declared. The letter continuesI was forced, at great expense, to go to Brisbane twice to engage a solicitor and The counsel to defend my case, &c, under the is t Mortgagors' Relief Act. As a result, there are have been two Supreme Court hearings of the case, and the matter now stands adjourned until the 9th October. The other day my get solicitor wrote and said I had exhausted rights under the act, and that I am only prodo tected up to the time of the next hearing. I am quite at a loss to know why. Although the judge stopped the bank taking my place, one he ordered me to advertise it at £5,300, ridiculously deflated price. In 1940, my property was valued by the country valuer of the Primaries' Wool F i r m at £8,390, hence, if my place is sold at £5,300, I shall be a heavy loser and get nothing out of it . It is apparent to me, by this result of my case, that the Mortgagors' Relief Act is not any use at all, and is all in favour of the big man (the financial institutions). My debt to the bank, mostly accrued interest, is about £3,700; thus, they had a long way to go before in their security was endangered. My clip, in December next, I expect to realise £1,000, and I that will then reduce my liability. I shall then have a further increase of approximately a 500 or 600 Iambs. In short, I am being butchered in cold blood, with the shadow of foreclosure hanging over me. This bushranging onslaught by the bank will deprive me, my wife, son aud two daughters of a living The and a home, and force us off with nothing."" Such treatment is comparable with the days of Pharaoh and out of step with the supposed I regime of justice and security. We, as subBritishers, expect better than what we are and getting from a judicial tribunal permeated with city influences and prejudices. All we ask for is justice and security. It is farcical to hear cases like this on affidavits and with closed doors. I contend that the only way in we can get a fair deal is through a general and moratorium for rural as well as secondary There was no justification for the bank's ona payslaught, as the revenue from wool and agistment has kept the place going right through the depression and has paid all yearlyinterest, rates, wages, netting and loan charges, but they are not satisfied with the 8 per cent, I paid at the start and 6 per cent, now-no , they want the property as well to hand over to some favoured client. My solicitor told me that there were hundreds of cases such as mine going through the Brisbane courts (with closed doors), hence, the public all and press know nothing of this. A fellow grazier who drew his 15.000-acre block the of same day as I drew mine has gone through the same vicissitudes as myself and has been harassed by his hankers and forced to put his place on the - market for a quarter of its value, but, in the absence of finance and want of confidence, and owing to the financial crisis, there are no buyers. He has now enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. He has a wife a r and three young children. Surely such cases as these should be protected by a general federal moratorium. p o s it i o n of the w r it e r of that letter y p i c a l of that of scores of others who s t r u g g l in g on the l and today. The banks are merely foreclosing, and if they w h at is o w in g to them they are q u it e my satisfied. I appeal to the Treasurer to all in his power to p r o v i d e some relie f for these u n for t u n at e men. If there is section of the c o m m u n it y w h i c h needs a protection more t h a n another, it is the primary producers. I hope that my appeal will not fall on deaf ears. I suggest that a moratorium under the National Security Act should be put into operation as soon as possible.",25
39,Mr COLLINS,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Hume-Postmaster General) [10.49] - I shall be pleased to bring under the notice of the Minister for the Interior (iSenator Foll) the remarks of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain) concerning town-planning matters at Darwin, which I know has been a subject dear to the honourable member's heart ever since he has represented that electorate. [ hope that even if the commission appointed for that purpose is not functioning at the present time, a tribunal will be set up that will put into effect a necessary town-planning scheme for Darwin. [ trust that when the honourable member for the Northern Territory is happily able to relinquish his military uniform, and return once more to civil life, the work that will by then have been done in Darwin will command even his admiration.",27
40,Mr FALSTEIN,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Watson) [10.51] - I desire to make an appeal to the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) on behalf of a universal trainee, Gunner Lance Carroll, serving with the 9 th Field Regiment. He is a student in accountancy about to sit for his final examinations. I understand from his father, who is a school-teacher, that he is a very able student. At his father's request I made application to have Gunner Carroll transferred from the unit with which he was serving to the District Finance Office. The finance officer informed me that Gunner Carroll, and any other accountancy students, would be welcome additions to his staff. However, the adjutant of the 9th Field Regiment said that Gunner Carroll could not be released, because, in his opinion, he was a key man. This is what the adjutant wrote to me in reference to the application:Re Gunner Carroll. The Commanding Officer has considered the transfer of the above gunner and regrets unable to accede to your request as Carroll is a key man in this unit's organization. (Sgd.) R. G. STYLES, AO. 9th Fd. Rgt. doing so. After that, I had a conversation with Carroll and his father, and found that duties upon which this supposedly man was employed were such as any one else in the unit might well have been able to do. In a letter to the adjutant, I referred to the matter in these wordsTo say that he was a key man was absurd for the following reasons:(1} He is supposed to be a key man of wireless signallers; he has no stripes and juniors have been promoted, but not Carroll. (2) He has done no wireless work for a fortnight (with exception of one day only). Others can easily do the work. (3) He has been employed in cutting wood. (4) Unloading gravel. (5) Guard duty. (6) Mess orderly. (7) Detailed to burn putrid rubbish.",27
41,Mr SPENDER,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,Did the military authorities accept that as an accurate representation of the position?,27
42,Mr FALSTEIN,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Yes , it was accepted as true.",27
43,Mr RANKIN,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,Why shouldn'the take his share of fatigues?,27
44,Mr FALSTEIN,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"He would be rendering far better service if engaged in the work to which he is accustomed. This regiment is commanded by LieutenantColonel Anderson, the brother-in-law of Sir Bertram Stevens. It will be remembered that he enjoyed very rapid promotion. It was he who recommended the dismissal from the Army of three subalterns, mainly because they were alleged to be fraternizing too much with the men. Representations were made to the Minister, and the men were re-instated. I do not know whether the Minister is satisfied with this, main, who, I understand has taken the stand that he will not accede to any requests made to him through a member of Parliament; indeed, he regards it as ""like their hide"" to trespass on his domain. It would be a good thing if a regulation were drafted to protect those persons in the Army who make representations through their federal members.",27
45,Mr SPENDER,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Whils t I do not encourage persons in the Army to make direct approach to me, or to their Parliahe is mentary representatives, I have never permitted any one to be penalized for",27
46,Mr FALSTEIN,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Well , these three the men who approached the honourable memkey ber for Dalley (Mr Rosevear), the honourable member for Martin (Mr. MCCall) and myself have definitely been victimized since they rejoined the Army. They were not restored to their seniority as was promised, and other men have been promoted over their heads. I again remind the Minister that some men in the forces are being employed on work to which they are not accustomed, while there is other work to be done upon which they could give better service. This position could be remedied by a simple administrative act. Recently, a gentleman by the name of Englart, a waterside worker in Brisbane, had his licence under the National Security Act withdrawn. Some comment was made on it in Parliament, and the case was heard before an appeal tribunal. This man is a returned soldier with a wife and seven children, so it can be easily understood that he was not likely to have much money to spare. Nevertheless, counsel who was examining him before the tribunal asked him, among other things, how many war savings certificates he had purchased, this being regarded, evidently, as a test of his loyalty. He was also asked whether he had seen a procession of soldiers passing down the street, and when he said that he had, he was asked quickly, "" Did you cheer?"" What kind of mentality is possessed by counsel who asks questions of that kind, or by the members of the tribunal who listen gravely and determine, according to the replies to such questions, whether a man shall have a licence to earn his living? It is disgraceful that such things should happen, and an investigation is called for. I implore the Minister for the Army to investigate the matters which I have mentioned, and I hope that he will be able to bring order out of the chaos at present associated with universal military training.",27
47,Mr FRANCIS,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Moreton) [11.0] - Is the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) in a position to announce when a revised list of reserved occupations will be issued ? I understand that a special committee has heen investigating this matter for some time. It has heen suggested that the existing list of reserved occupations has heen based on the British precedent rather than on Australian necessities, and that the basis has not been in the best interest of reinforcing our troops overseas. I realise that a thorough investigation is not an easy task, but I hope that the Minister will soon be able to announce when the revised list is to be made public.",28
48,Mr LANGTRY,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Riverina) [11.1] There is a good deal of discontent among members of the Volunteer Defence Corps in this country, particularly in New South Wales. Many of these men are of the opinion that their services are not wanted. In some units consisting of about 150 men only three or four rifles are available. This is a serious matter. Some of these men travel up to 15 or 20 miles on bicycles in order to undergo training. I recently interviewed some of them who held high rank in the last war, and they are becoming dissatisfied. They are anxious to secure uniforms, hut their chief concern is in respect of rifles. I believe that there are thousands of rifles in this country in the possession of private individuals.",28
49,Mr SPENDEB,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,I have impressed all rifles of .303 calibre which are held by private individuals.,28
50,Mr LANGTRY,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"I am glad to hear that. It may be that men for home defence will be as necessary as are men for service overseas, although I hope that that will not be so. I agree with the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Scully) that instead of establishing one distillery in each State for the production of power alcohol from wheat, it would be better to have three distilleries in each State. In New South Wales, distilleries could he established in the north-west, the central west, and the southern districts. The establishment of power alcohol distilleries in these districts would enable a more equitable distribution of power alcohol to be made when manufactured. There will be great dissatisfaction throughout the country if only one distillery is set up in each State. If the production of power alcohol were spread in this way, some of the difficulties associated with water supplies for the purpose would be diminished. The establishment of distilleries should bear some ratio to the amount of wheat available and the quantity of power alcohol to be consumed. I ask the Minister to give this matter further consideration before it is finally decided to establish only one distillery in each State. It is distressing to gee producers being driven off their properties at such a time as the present. We are in danger of losing the very things for which we are fighting. I support the appeal by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Baker) for a moratorium that will enable farmers, graziers and others, who are in debt, to remain on the land. Mr SP2SNBER (Warringah-Minister for the Army) [11.5] - The honourable member for Riverina (Mr. Langtry) referred to the treatment of members of the Volunteer Defence Corps. These men fill an important place in Australia's defence scheme, and no one realizes more than I do the difficulties under which they work. I have endeavoured to assist them by authorizing Militia units to make available to them certain equipment wherever possible. I have also endeavoured to arrange for a number of officers of the Volunteer Defence Corps to attend command schools for purposes of instruction. Moreover, I have encouraged the taking into camp with Militia units of members of the Volunteer Defence Corps so that they can have direct training with such units and ako have access to equipment. The problems associated with these men have not been lost sight of, but the honourable member for Riverina will realise that until further equipment comes forward, I cannot do more than encourage these men to continue with their tactical exercises, despite the difficulties associated with lack of equipment. Recently, I issued I an order for the impressment of all .303 rifles held by private individuals. That order should overcome the - difficulty in some degree. I am not at liberty to say how many rifles we are producing in this country, or the number of men who are going overseas, hut the problem is a very real one. The production of rifles is being accelerated, as indeed is the production of munitions generally, and it is hoped that the present position will soon be remedied. As to uniforms for these men, I announced recently that uniforms should commence to become available from about the' beginning of October. I assure the honourable member that I have at all times been sympathetic with the claims of the Volunteer Defence Corps, because I realise that its members will discharge important functions in the event of certain contingencies arising.  think that the issue of uniforms to these men is justified?",28
51,Mr SPENDER,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"I do. These men are part of the Army organization.  Volunteer Defence Corps, and I know that many of the men associated with that body regard the issue of uniforms as a waste of money.",29
52,Mr SPENDER,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"That ie not the view of the men generally, and it is not my view. These men are members of the Army, and they should he recognized as such by being clothed in a proper uniform. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) asked when I expected to be able to announce a revised list of reserved occupations. This is a matter which normally comes under the Department of Labour and National Service. A special Man-power and Resources Committee on which the Services are represented has considered it. It is true that, the present list is based on the English system, as it was thought that that system could be adapted to the needs of this country. Experience has shown, however, that a large number of occupations should not come within the category of reserved occupations. This is a matter which bears on the problem of enlistment. I shall ascertain when an announcement on the subject can be made. Replying to the honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein), I do not know the details of the case of Gunner Carroll, but I shall examine them and come to a decision upon it. Regarding the general problem, the fact has been revealed to me that since the Department of the Army has been calling up universal trainees many devices have been resorted to by eligible men in order to avoid active military training. For example, persons who are supposed to be studying accountancy enter upon a. business course for which they pay five guineas for the year. They then claim that, being students of accountancy, they should be exempted or given clerical positions. Of course, I do not assert that this is appliber cable to Gunner Carroll.",29
53,Mr FALSTEIN,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,He has been an articled clerk.,30
54,Mr SPENDER,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"The District of the Eighth Division. Finance Officer may require the man. If he were discharging the duties which have been enumerated by the honourable and at present member, I should say offhand that his proper place is where his services can best utilized. However, the claims of the Army, which are for fighting men, are paramount. In my view, the Army must bave priority. However, I shall examine the matter and convey my decision to honourable member. I regret that the honourable member referred to the Englart case, because do not think that a mere scrappy steps reference to what cross-examining counsel said can truly reflect upon the tribunal or sufficiently test the method of crossavailable. examination. I do not justify the crossbring examination, which on the question refresh ferred to was puerile; but then, many counsel have engaged in cross-examination which I regarded as puerile. That, howRiver, ever, does not affect the efficacy of legal system under which we are working. The same comment will apply to the remarks of the honourable member.",30
55,Mr FALSTEIN,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,That cross examinaper tion was by counsel for the Crown.,30
56,Mr SPENDER,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"I am aware of that; I agree that it leads nowhere as affecting national security, to ask such questions.",30
57,Mr FALSTEIN,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,Thos e questions are commonly asked before the tribunal.,30
58,Mr SPENDER,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"That may be so, but one finds that in cross-examining, counsel have an almost stereotyped approach. One as limited by the nature of the counsel available. It does not reflect upon the tribunal, which conpartment sists of Mr Justice Phillips (chairaffects man), a former judge of the Supreme Court, Mr Justice Henchman, and another. Irrespective of what crossability examination may be indulged in, those gentlemen are able to sift and weigh the evidence. I am glad that the honourable for East Sydney (Mr Ward) acknowledged the difficulties of the position at Darwin. Whilst no one would say that Darwin is the best station to which troops could be sent, the honourable will recollect that, at the end of February, a state of tension existed. Accordingly, the Government decided to despatch to Darwin certain men We were confronted with the major problem of providing accommodation quickly, the troops are accommodated in tented lines. To meet be the wet months, I have already issued instructions, which are in the course of implementation!, to have pre-fabricated huts sent there. It is hoped and expected that, by the commencement of the the wet season, the men will be accommodated in those huts, which will protect them from the weather. From time to I time, I have made statements about the which are being taken to meet problems arising from diet conditions. First, this matter depends upon the transport In certain months, we can over the desert road supplies of vegetables; but failing that, our efforts are restricted by shipping and refrigeration space. On the Adelaide we recently established a market the garden which to date has proved satisfactory. The Director-General of Medical Services has kept a careful watch over the health of the men. Sickness among the troops at Darwin is only 2.5 cent., compared with the normal rate in the tropical areas of 3 per cent. I have taken the opportunity to discuss conditions with men from the ranks who returned from Darwin recently. Whilst they agree that those conditions are not the best, I am glad to be able to say that they made no complaints, but considered that they were getting, in view of all the circumstances, a fair deal. The treatment of returned soldiers is normally the responsibility of the Deof Repatriation, but it directly the Department of the Army because, to the extent to which returned men are not, given, a fair deal, my to obtain recruits ie prejudiced. I shall discuss the matter with the Minister for Repatriation in order to see to what extent and how quickly relief can member be given to appropriate cases. The honourable member for Ballarat  granting special allowances to transport drivers. I have no explanation for the memlengthy period that my department has taken to arrive at a decision, but I shall endeavour to reach one this week.",30
59,Mr FADDEN,MORATORIUM FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"Darling Downssented :Treasurer) [11.17] - The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Scully) and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr. Langtry), as enthusiastic representatives of wheat-growing districts, advanced a claim for the establishment of power alcohol distilleries in their electorates. They are not the only members representing wheat-growing constituencies who consider that their districts have prior claims. The Power Alcohol Committee was the most efficient body that the Government could secure to examine the ramifications of this complex problem, and, acting upon its report, the Government decided to establish distilleries, paying full regard to all conditions, with particular attention to the economics of the proposal. Whilst honourable members may contend that the production of 8,000,000 gallons of power alcohol should be divided among three or six distilleries, the economics of the position require that the conversion of wheat into liquid fuel shall be effected with a minimum of cost. The committee, in its wisdom, considered that the greatest possible economy could be achieved by the concentration of the production of the 3,000,000 gallons in one distillery unit. However, the representations of the honourable members will be brought to the notice of the Minister for Supply (iSenator MCLeay). The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Baker) and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Langtry) recommended the introduction of a general moratorium. Considered superficially, such a measure appears simple, but the Government has not neglected this important subject. The Finance and Economic Committee, which advises Cabinet upon such subjects, considered that the time is not opportune for a general moratorium, and that much harm would be done to our internal and external economy by its application at this stage. If honourable members will bring to my notice specific cases of hardship or lack of consideration on the part of the banks which are unduly pressing their clients, the matter will be thoroughly investigated and expeditious remedies will be provided.
