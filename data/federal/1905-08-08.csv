Will the honourable gentleman obtain that scheme, and place it before Parfor the information of honourable members ?",12

In view of the delay which always occurs in getting work started,, and of the need for finding employment for the people in connection with the construction of necessary public works, I ask the Treasurer if he will consider the advisability of taking similar action this vear?",13

When does he intend to proof ceed with the motion dealing with the subthe ject now standing on the notice-paper in name ?",13

22,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Government propose to commence with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, and then to proceed with the second reading debates on the Trade Marks Bill, the Commerce Bill, and the Secret Commissions Bill-probabl y in that order. The further consideration of the message on the Papua Bill may be resumed if opportunity offers, but we have been much - pressed to afford an early opportunfor the consideration of the Public SerClassification. Until the classification has been adopted,,it will cost the Goof vernment about ;£i,ooo a month.",13
23,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Why ?,13

27,Mr GROOM,ALLEGED DISREPAIR OF,"I am not aware that the to public buildings of the Commonwealth generally are in such a bad state of disrepair as the honourable member's remarks the would imply. I may say, however, that so far as I am concerned, every requisition to matters of the description named has been absolutely dealt with by the Department, and the necessary authority has been given with a view to having the work done without delay. NA METEOROLOGICAL. DEPARTMENT.",13
28,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH,"the Minister of Home Affairs, ufon notice Whether the Government propose to introduce during this session a measure providing for the institution of a Commonwealth Meteorological Department and Weather Bureau?",14
29,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In May last an Inter-State Astronomical and Meteorological Conference was held at Adelaide, which was attended by the astronomers of four of the States, the Chief Surveyor of Queensland, and the Government Meteorologist of Tasmania. The Conference did not consider the establishment of one central Meteorological Bureau to supplant existing institutions and to singly carry out the Australian weather services as practicable, but made certain recommendations. The Government will again communicate with (he Premiers of the various States to see to what extent it is practicable to establish a Federal Meteorological Department. The draft of a Bill is in preparation with a view to its introduction if possible sion. PUBLIC SERVICE APPEALS.",14
30,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH,"the Minister of Home Affairs, ufon notice I. Of the total number of appeals under the provisions of the Public Service Act, how many came from each State? 2. What were the numbers allowed and disallowed in each State respectively?",14
31,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. and 2 New South Wales... 506 ... 167 ... 339 Victoria ... ... 1,068 ... 107 ... 961 Queensland ... 93 ... 14 ... 79 South Australia ... 224 ... 69 ... 155 Western Australia ... 266 ... 72 ... 194 Tasmania ... ... 60 ... 14 ... 46 In Victoria a very large proportion of the disallowed appeals were lodged for increased salaries under section 19 of the State Act 1721. LEATHER ACCOUTREMENTS.",14
32,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, ufon notice I. What was the cost, respectively, of the 4,650 sets of Infantry equipment, the 300 sets of Light Horse equipment, and the twelve sample sets of saddlery referred ito in reply to question on Tuesday, ist instant, as having been ordered in England in March, 1904, and recently delivered in the Commonwealth? 2. How does the Minister for Defence reconcile the statement that the above-mentioned equipments were "" urgently required"" with the fact that they were not delivered until about fifteen months after they were ordered ? 3. Is it contended, with a knowledge of the time it took to fill this order, that ""there would not have been time to get them made in Australia "" ?",14
33,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH,"I am informed thatr. 4,650 sets of Infantry equipment cost ... ... ^5,480 about. 300 sets Light equipment cost ... ... ... 440 ,, 12 sets saddlery (samples) cost ... ... ... 80 „ 2. The position was this : There was an amount of ^,'6,000 available for accoutrements on the 1903-4 special warlike stores vote. This money would have lapsed on the 30th June, 1904, and it was quite impossible to get supplies locally before that date, even if the Department had the samples, which were not then finally sealed. The sets of accoutrements indented for formed only a portion of what are required, and the very much larger balance required will be arranged for locally. 3. What was intended to be conveyed was that local supplies could not have been made in time this sesto prevent the money lapsing. ADULTERATION OF WINE .",14
34,Mr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH,"the Minister of Home Affairs, u f o n notice I. Is he aware of the anomalies existing between the Adulteration Acts of the various States in relation to the wine industry? 2. Is it a fact that some States are given an advantage at the expense of others because of this? * 3. Will he introduce a Bill at an early date to rectify these anomalies, and place this industry on an equitable basis?",14
35,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH,"The answer to the honLodged. A l - Disal- orable member's questions is as follows:lowed, lowed. The control and regulation of the internal trade in intoxicating liquors is a matter specially reserved by the Constitution as one which is altogether under the jurisdiction of the State. No such Bill is therefore contemplated. The Commerce Bill now before the House will , if passed, enable the adulteration of exports to be dealt with. 2 J 7 2 I 443 1 <774 MILITARY SUNDAY DUTY.",14
36,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, ufon notice Whether partially-paid forces are expected to do regular duty on Easter Sundays during Easter Encampments without pay ?",14
37,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH,"I am informed thatThe instructions to commandants are that no unnecessary work is to be carried out on Sundays. With regard lo pay for Sunday during camps of training, it is found on inquiry that in New South Wales pay has not been grunted, whereas in the other States payment has been made for the Sunday. Further inquiry is being made as to why the payment was not made in New South Wales. CUSTOMS LOCKERS' OVERTIME. Motion (by Mr TUDOR ) agreed toThat a return be laid upon the table of the House showing1. The amount of overtime worked by the Customs lockers in the three bonds at Port bourne, and the bond at Yarraville, and the amount of extra pay drawn by each of these lockers during the twelve months ended 30th June, 1905. 2.

The CLERK laid upon the tableReturn to an Order of the House dated 8th August, 1904, relating to the overtime worked Customs lockers. NA ENCOURAGEME NT BILL . SECOND READING.",14
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S," I move That the B i ll be now read a second time. I moved the second reading of a Bill somewhat similar to the measure now before us on two previous occasions-o' n the 23 rd March, 1904, and 9 th December, 1904, and as the statements I then made are on record in Hansard, I hope that I shall not be called upon, to repeat the whole of them. I am very glad to have an opportunity to again bring forward this measure, because, in my humble opinion, it deals with perhaps the most important question that can engage our"" attention- a question which, to imy mind, almost overshadows every other affecting the interests of the Commonwealth. At present, we are completely dependent upon importations for all our war material, iron, steel, and other things. If , unfortunately, an outbreak of hostilities involving Great Britain should occur, our position would be most critical. I consider that it is a disgrace to us that we have not already taken active measures for the development of our known large deposits of iron ore. No attempt has yet been successfully made to utilize them. On looking over the division lists when a similar measure was last before us, I was very much surprised to find that one or two of the representatives of Tasmania, in which State our largest and most valuable iron depositsexist, voted against the Bill . Mel- If they regard the welfare of Tasmania as important, they should be the first to declare in favour of the introduction of a Bill of this character.",15
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,Why does the Minister always introduce these personal matters?,15
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"I shall please myself as to what I introduce. I did not refer to the representatives of Tasmania in any disagreeable spirit. My remark was prompted solely by the interests of that State, in which the Blythe River iron deposits exist. I say that the development of that vast deposit would materially influence the progress and the financial position alike of Tasmania and of Australia. That, however, is not the only deposit of iron ore by in the Commonwealth. We know that there are others. For example, I am in receipt of further information concerning a pi nee in South Australia, which is known as the Iron Knob. That deposit of ore is not quite so accessible as is the Blythe River deposit in Tasmania. It is more remote from a port of shipment, but nevertheless it 'is of a very valuable character.",15
41,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,The Iron Knob is connected by railwav with the coast.,15
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,I was not aware of that. I was informed that it was 25 miles distant from the railway.,15
43,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,No ; it is absolutely connected by rail.,15
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"The information which I have received is that that deposit is almost as rich as is the Blythe River deposit, and I am 'given to understand that there is a vast extent of it . Further, nearly all over New South Wales large deposits of iron ore are known to exist. They are to be found in the north, south, east, and west of that State. I cannot speak so confidently of the resources of Queensland, because I am not familiar with them.",15
45,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE S,Recen t reports show that the iron deposits there are very extensive.,15
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,I have no doubt that all over the continent there is an abundance of iron ore undeveloped at the present time.,15
47,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURE S,"Nort h of Rockhampton, the country is nearly all of an ironstone formation.",15
48,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE S,Partie s are making geological surveys there at the present time.,16
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"The larger the number of deposits the better, and ithe larger number of industries which are established in this connection the better.",16
50,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,There are iron ore deposits in South Australia.,16
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"I merely mention these facts to show what great latent wealth we have in Australia-wealt h which should be, but is not, developed. Every honourable member must acknowledge that deposits of coal and iron constitute the greatest wealth which a country can possess, and we have been endowed by Nature with an abundance of each of these minerals in every State. This Bill represents an earnest attempt to solve the difficulty attaching to the development of our iron resources in this way; if the States do not embark upon the undertaking-and up to the present time thertj have declined to do so-privat e enterprise might step in and establish the industry, subject to a provision that at a certain period the State, or States, can demand the transfer of the property for a fair consideration. That seems to me to - be the wisest course we can adopt at present. I am in receipt of a communication from some of those persons who are prospectively interested in this work, and I am in a position to say that if the Bill be carried private capital will be invested in the industry. When I tabled the motion relating to the introduction of this measure a few days ago, it was alleged that its provisions were of a character that would prevent private enterprise from establishing the industry. I am now in a position to say that if the Bill becomes law private capital will be invested in it.",16
52,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,How much capital is necessary to start an industry of this kind?,16
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"That depends upon the size of the company and the quantity of ore that is smelted. I know that in the largest concerns of the kind in the world, perhaps £1,500.00 0 or more has been invested. to know that one company was, and still is, prepared to spend something like £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 in the development of this industry. But there is more than one company willing to engage in the undertaking. There are two or three others.",16
54,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,We shall whether that is so.,16
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,I only hope that the Government will have the assistance of the honourable member for North Sydney in providing us with an opportunity of proving the accuracy or otherwise of my statement.,16
56,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,Will the Government drop the Bill if the Labour Party insert in it a scores of clause providing that the State shall control the industry?,16
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"I hope that the honourable member will ask me something easy. I know that he will block the Bill if he can. Nevertheless, this measure is going to become law. It may be amended slightly, but it will become the law of the land. I full y recognise that all those who are in favour of the foreigner, and opposed to the interests of our own people, will use their utmost endeavours to block the Bill . Those who believe in providing our own people with work, and in supplying Australian needs with Australian articles, will support the measure.",16
58,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,That is a most unfair statement.,16
59,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,I should have voted for the Bill if the nationalization clauses had been omitted.,16
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"I do not know what the honourable member means by the ""nationalization"" clauses. I hold that if, in the future, the Commonwealth, or a State, desires to take over the industry, it is proper that it should be in a position to do so, under certain conditions.",16
61,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Of course, the Minister holds that, because he has declared himself a Socialist.",16
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"I have said I am a State Socialist more than once, and I think that the honourable member declared himself a Socialist the other night. Unless he is prepared to sell the railways of Australia, and to part with the tramways, waterworks, and other services of that character, I brand him as a Socialist. That is the sort of Socialist that I am. I have frequently stated that I am in favour of the I happen State carrying on certain services, such as the railways, the tramways, and waterworks. Let the honourable member contrast the tramway system of Sydney with that of Melbourne, and say which serves the people the better. However, I have no desire to discuss the question of Socialism at the present moment, though I am prepared to say see at once that in regard to the services to which I have alluded, I am a State Socialist.",16
63,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,Is the Minister a State Socialist in the matter of the' iron bounty ?,17
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"If this Bill becomes law, and the iron industry is established by means of private enterprise, I hope that the people will be afforded an opportunity of saying whether the Government of any State or of the Commonwealth should nationalize it. If they answer in the affirmative, effect should be given to their will.",17
65,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,Then let us appeal to the people.,17
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member wishes to appeal to the people so often that I fear he might not come back.,17
67,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I am very chance it, anvhow.",17
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"Many people ""chance"" things which do not come off. I am not more anxious than is anybody else to appeal to the people, and to be called upon to spend a lot of money in so doing. I am not specially desirous of "" chancing."" it, although I have always been returned by my constituents, and I hope that I always shall be. I am quite satisfied that this Bill would be approved by a majority of the people, despite all the ridiculous outcry which has been raised regarding the socialistic clauses which it is alleged to contain.",17
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,How about remitting it to the people?,17
70,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"I think that it would be stupid to attempt to remit a measure of this character to the electors. It would be ,an acknowledgment that honourable members themselves are not capable of judging what is best to be done.",17
71,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,Would a fiscal referendum be stupid?,17
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"A fiscal referendum would be a socialistic thing, and as the honourable member is not a Socialist he would not support a referendum upon anything, if he were consistent. out entering into elaborate details respecting the quantity of iron ore available for treatment in Australia",17
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I rise to a point of order. I submit that this Bill is out of order. It has not been preceded by a motion in Committee, which, I take it, is a condition precedent to the introduction of any Bill appropriating the public funds for any purpose whatever. Standing order 243 makes this very clear. It says If any motion be made in the House for any public aid or charge upon the peopleI do not think there can be any doubt that this measure involves a public charge upon the peoplethe consideration and debate thereof may not be presently entered upon, but should be adjourned til l such further day as the House shall think fit to appoint, and then it shall be referred to a Committee of the whole House before any resolution or vote of the House do pass thereon. A vote has already been wrongly taken upon this Bill , inasmuch as it was not put in Committee, where the Bill ought to have originated. I submit that, following precedents going back almost to the infancy of parliamentary institutions, the Bill, as now before us, is out of order. It should have originated in the Committee to which willing to the Governor General's message was transmitted as soon as it was received. The Constitution is silent in the matter of procedure, but all our parliamentary precedents are in favour of my contention, that there should have been an appropriation in Committee before leave was given to bring in the Bill.",17
74,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member for Parramatta was good enough a few moments ago to call my attention to the point that he was about to raise in order that I should have an opportunity to con- * sider it. On a previous occasion a similar Bill was introduced in Committee, the Committee originating from the reception of a message from His Excellency the Governor General. The Manufactures Encouragement Bill that was brought before the House last year was introduced, however, in the same way as that now before us has been. On examining this Bill I recognise that it is undoubtedly a measure for a public aid or charge upon the people, because clause. 3 provides that the Governor General may authorize the payment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of bounties according to rates set out in the schedule. Standing order No. 243, which the honourable member for Parramatta has Withread, expressly declares that the consideration of a motion for any public aid or charge upon the people shall not be entered upon in the House until it has been referred to a Committee of the whole. I , therefore, think that there can be no doubt that it is impossible for the House to deal with this B i ll until the subject-matter has been recommended by resolution in Committee of the whole House.",17
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,"I have prepared a notice relating to the consideration of the Governor General's message, but understand that it is unnecessary for me to move a motion at this stage, as the matter will appear on the notice-paper in the ordinary way, and we shall be able to deal with it tomorrow.",17
76,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE S,"The message was received and announced by me nearly half an.hour ago, and was ordered by the House to be considered tomorrow. It will, therefore,! appear on the notice-paper for tomorrow without further action being taken. TRADE MARKS BILL. SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 3rd August (vide page 610), on motion by Mr ISAACSThat the Bill be now read a second time.",18
77,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S," I ' feel satisfied that the discussion upon this measure will centre not upon the general question of trade marks and their registration or application, but upon the trade union label provisions. The whole of debatable portions of the Bill are concento trated in those clauses. In the Age of the 7th instant the following paragraph peared :Mr Reid has attempted to identify the ment's proposals with respect to the ""union sections of the Trade Marks Bill with the can union label system. Members who have caref u l ly followed Mr Isaacs' speech declare Government has quite removed the dangers were inherent in the section as it left the Senate",18
78,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE S,The Age speaks very freely for honourable imembers.,18
79,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,The whole point is in the next sentenceNo employer has to beg a union's permission use its registered label,18
80,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE S,"That is another "" whopper.""",18
81,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The paragraph conand tinuesIt is automatically at his disposal as long as he fulfils the union conditions. That is the whole point. What, for inceiving fair wages ? stance, would be the conditions imposed by the unions with respect to the. production and distribution of the Age itself ?  of the union in the medical profession?",18
82,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,I feel that the principle of trade unionism has gone so far and going so far towards depriving ists of their rights,18
83,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,That is what the union of the medical profession does.,18
84,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"That I have withdrawn myself from the British Medical Associait tion of which I was a membe^ and am now, so far as that association is concerned, a non-unionist.",18
85,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member then is boycotted as a medical man?,18
86,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Whether boycotted or not, I am satisfied to fight the battle of the non-unionists. I have also withdrawn fiom the Pastoralists' Association-the'onl y other association of which I was a member '-so that I stand here today as a non-unionist fighting the battle of the non-unionists, and with a determination to prevent the Government and their supporters in the Ministerial corner from robbing the non-unionists of their rights. I fight for the liberty of the people-for the liberty of the poorest man in the State to earn his living where and when and how he may. Let us apply the trade union label principle to the production of the Age newspaper.",18
87,Mr KING OMALLEY,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable the member means to say that he is prepared fight for liberty to rob the unions.,18
88,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"No question of robbing apthe unionists is involved. We shall always give the unionists fair play. It Governmust be admitted that in days gone by labels"" the workmen of this and other countries Amerihave suffered under many disabilities. But that the from time to time legislation has been that passed by this and other Parliaments to prevent the continuance of those abuses.",18
89,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,Does the honourable member buy sweated goods?,18
90,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"It is impossible to say. I am prepared to pay a fair price for everyto thing that I purchase - to allow every workman interested in the production of the goods that I use to earn a fair wage, every person who sells them to secure a fair profit.",18
91,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,But how does the honourable member know that the goods which he purchases have been made by men re,18
92,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I know that in Victoria most industries are subject to Factories and Shops Acts, which insist upon fair wages and conditions of employment for the : workers.",18
93,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,But there are ' many is goods sold in Victoria other than those non-unionwhich are produced locally.,18
94,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"What would be the position of the Age if the provisions in the Bill relating to the trade union label were brought into operation ? In the first place, could not be read unless it had been produced under trade union conditions; the 7 Trademarks trade union Jabel could be applied only if union conditions had been observed. unions would issue an instruction to their members that they should not read any newspaper that had not been produced under union conditions, and if it had not been so produced, it would be boycotted. What would "" trade union conditions"" mean so far as the Age is concerned ? That all the reporters, in the first place, would have to be members of a reporters' union, that all the compositors would have to be members of a typographical union, and that all the distributors would require to be members of a distributors' union. Even the news vendors would have to be members of a union.",18
95,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,I think that is the present position.,19
96,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"It is a matter of no moment whether it is or* not. I say is that the newspaper could not be used by certain people unless produced 1 under these conditions. That to which I and those who are with me in this matter object is not voluntary, but compulsory unionism- a compulsory system of unionism that is forced upon the people contrary to their rights under the famous Magna Charta and Bill of Rights- a system by which one section of the community takes advantage of another section. In this very newspaper of Monday last we have another paragraph which shows what union conditions are, and may be in connection with various industries. I refer to the following telegram, which was despatched from Sydney on SundayBoorgam.i Station, near Brewarrina, called the shearing roll on ist inst. Everything was going well, and about 4,000 sheep had been passed through, when Mr MCManus, of the Australian Workers' Union, arrived. The rouseabouts subsequently struck work, and the shearers were called out. Work is now at a standstill. MCManus is to be proceeded against for trespassing. MessTS. Young and Co. are prosecuting the shearers and rouseabouts for breach of contract. The rouseabouts want z/S. 6d. a week, but had agreed to work for 25s. a week. That, I presume, is 25s. a week and found, and 27s. 66. a week and found, as the wage has been increased of late years from £ 1 a week and found up to the present rate.",19
97,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,What has that to do with the Bill ?,19
98,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"It has a very great deal to do with the Bill . Everything I have to say in regard to the Bill and the union label is bound up in this paragraph from [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. the Age. There is another matter which has The to be considered, and that is as to how the Bill will affect every industry throughout Australia. One industry which shouicl greatly interest the representatives of Queensland is the sugar industry. When the union labour conditions are carried out to their fullest extent, as I have not the slightest doubt they will be, through the machinations of honourable members in the Ministerial corner, and their organizations outside the House, it will mean that every bag of Queensland sugar will have to bear the union label or else certain things will happen. For one thing, unionists will not be allowed to consume the sugar. Further, an instruction will be given to the Stevedores' and Wharf Labourers' Unions not to handle the sugar. Now, this is no imaginary business, but an All that indication of what will happen where instructions have been issued to the members of unions to, as far as possible, hamper the manufacture of the goods, and to prevent the handling of them.",19
99,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,Will the honourable member give us a few examples?,19
100,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"In this connection I should like to call the attention of honourable members to a recent decision by the Minister of Trade and Customs with regard to the labour to be employed for producing sugar in Queensland. Recently he was waited upon, or written to, in regard to the labour of a half-bred Kanaka on a sugar plantation in the northern part of that State, and, by his decision he has created a new industry. In the first instance, the mother of the halfbred Kanaka had married a Kanaka, and this son was the result of the union - After wards she married a white planter, who applied to be registered as a planter working under white labour conditions. The Minister ruled, and justly so, I think, that this /young half-bred Kanaka should 'be allowed to work on the plantation of his step-father, who should be permitted to have a bonus for the production of sugar under white labour conditions. But the Minister has gone still further, and has ruled that half-bred aborigines shall be allowed to work on sugar plantations, and that the planter shall be able to draw the bonus under the white labour conditions. Has the honourable gentleman anything to say in regard to that matter?",19
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member is telling me something I did not know - anything about.,19
102,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,I read a decision to that effect in a newspaper the other day. Is it true or untrue that the Minister has ruled that half-caste aborigines may work on these plantations?,20
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE S,So far as remember I do not think that I have ever dealt with the matter.,20
104,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Then the newspaper must have misquoted the honourable gentleman. If he gave that ruling which the newspaper has reported, or if it has been ruled by the Department, that this should take place, then he has entirely changed the condition of affairs in Northern Queensland, and has solved the labour question, so far as it is concerned.",20
105,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE S,In what newspaper did this report appear?,20
106,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"It appeared in the Argus two or three days ago. In this connection the Minister is practically putting a premium on the production of these half castes, and solving this question, so far as Northern Queensland is concerned, so that in the future all sugar will have to be produced under union conditions. I should like to sketch what is likely to occur under those conditions in 1909, in, say, the Herbert River district. A half-caste of this description has to be brought up from his birth as a unionist. In the first place, it is necessary that a union doctor shall be employed.",20
107,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member would be right out of the affair.,20
108,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Yes ; I should have no opportunity of attending at the interesting event. In order to further carry out the union label conditions, it is necessary that this interesting youth who is to play such a great part in the sugar industry should be received into the world by a nurse who is a member of the Affiliated Union of Monthly Nurses of Northern Queensland. If , unfortunately, the mother is unable to give the child the necessary nourishment, a wefnurse has to be called into assist his development, and she must be a member of the Federated Union of Wetnurses of Northern Queensland. Then, as the growth of the child develops, it is necessary to find him with extra bottles, and the milk has to be drawn from animals bjyi milkers who are members of the Milkers' Union of the district. Of course the bottles have to be branded with the union label.",20
109,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,"The cows will have to belong to the union, I suppose.",20
110,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"No doubt the cows will have to be registered in some way, or else my honourable friends will not allow them to be milked. According to the demands which our honourable friends have made in I can previous legislation, the cows will have to be union cows, and of such a peculiar description that they will give milk on six days a week, and none on Sunday- a new brand of cow.  once.",20
111,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"It may be annoying to the honourable member to listen in the form of a farce to my statement of what this label business means for the workers of Australia in the future; but I cannot help that. This is simply an accentuation of what has been carried out in the United States, and when the honourable member suggests that I am not serious in my remarks, it shows that his friends are full y seized of the fact that the whole business is a farce so far as the majority of the people in Australia are. concerned. I do not wish, however, to be drawn off hyi interjections from the history of this half-caste child. Going a step further, we find that his linen has to be washed by the members of the Baby Linen Washers' Union of Northern Queensland, and that all food, including bread, has to be supplied by union men. This, of course, will interest the honourable member for Yarra, because he has recentlybeen through the fire, so to speak, with regard to non-union bakers; and he has proved abundantly the difficulty that will be created. Before we have had any of this compulsory legislation with regard to union labels, the honourable member has virtually been forced into the position of having to insure that everything that he uses is produced under absolutely unionist conditions. With regard to the further development of my imaginary youth, he has to be sent to a State school in which all the teachers have to be members of the Teachers' Union. His clothes have to be branded with the union label. This is no exaggerated idea, because the branding of clothes with the union label has been insisted upon in Chicago and San Francisco; and there is evidence that the walking delegates have actually stopped members of the unions to see whether their clothes were branded with the label. If they were not, the unionists have been fined five, twenty, and f if t y dollars, and for a fifth offence have been dismissed from membership.",20
112,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,Will the honourable member prove all these statements?,21
113,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I will read proofs later on. My Kanaka youth would riot wear boots, so that it would be impossible to examine them to see if they were properly branded.",21
114,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,How much further is the honourable member going with these fabrications ?,21
115,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"There is nothing fabricated about my statements. history of recent trades unionism in America goes to show that they are absolute facts. If my Kanaka youth happened to be fond of bananas, he would have to be careful that his bananas were all grown by the members of the Chinese Union of Banana Growers of Queensland. In clue course he ""would go to work, and would be dulv admitted to membership of the Union of Half-caste Sugar Growers. If , in later years, he developed a habit of smoking and drinking, he would have to be careful that he smoked union tobacco and drank union beer. will suppose that at last he dies from the effects of smoking union cigars and tobacco and drinking union beer. And here is the point where the whole scheme fails absolutely. When he wakes up he will find that he is in a non-union heaven. whole of his training in this world will have been absolutely lost when he reaches a place where there is no question of considering whether a man is a unionist or a non-unionist. But even that would not finish his experience of unionism. We know that instances have occurred in Chicago-anc l no doubt they will occur in Australia-wher e members of unions have had to be buried under union conditions, in a coffin made by union coffin-makers, be carried to the grave by, union undertakers and - her e is a fact which will be of interest to the honourable member for Wide Baythe Requiem may have to be sung over the grave of the deceased by the Half-bred Kanaka Hymn Singers' Union.",21
116,Mr STORRER,MANUFACTURE S,We shall have to have Kanakas in Parliament.,21
117,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Well , perhaps it would not be altogether to the detriment of parliamentary institutions if we had some men elected who would be able to legislate for 115 in these matters, with as full a knowledge of the conditions that prevail: .in Northern Queensland, and with what is necessary in that respect, as the Kanakas would have.",21
118,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,When are we coming to the end of this rubbish?,21
119,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member may describe it as rubbish. He rejoices in the fact that he is a good and true unionist, though it pays him to forget that there are others who are not unionists. He should never forget that it is one of the primary instincts of men born and bred under British conditions that they shall have a perfect right to work freely for The whole their own living, whether they are members of unions or not. With regard to the matter which I mentioned a few minutes ago, the honourable member for Oxley has just put into my hand the newspaper cut-' ting to which I referred. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to a paragraph which appeared with regard to half-bred Kanakas and aboriginals in the Argus of Thursday last: Towards the end of 1903 a Queensland cane planter applied for registration as a "" w h it e "" grower. His wife, prior to marrying him, had a We son by a former husband, a Kanaka. This boy was adopted and brought up by the cane-planter, and he wished to employ the lad on the farm. ]3ut the regulations under the Sugar Bounty Act provide lhat the expression ""white labour"" shall be used to the exclusion of all forms of coloured labour, ""whether aborigines of Australia or not."" The matter was submitted to Sir William Lyne, The the then Minister of Customs, and he, after first refusing the application, wrote a minute, In which he said :- "" In this case the circumstances are exceptional-this being the only case of the kind, i.e., where a white man marries a white woman who has a half-caste Kanaka child. The lad, presumably, has to live upon the farm, and will on occasions do some work. It would be a most extreme thing to make the stepfather forfeit his sugar bounty in consequence. I will not do so, and shall, if necessary, submit a short measure next session-if I have the opportunity-to deal with this question, ancl also to deal with the question of half-caste aborigines. I scarcely think it was intended to deprive these latter of the chance of obtaining work in their own country. It is quite different with the coloured people who come here from their homes elsewhere. We know, too, that the Australian native is not a menace to labour, and that in a few years he will be extinct."" That proves that my statement was accurate, and that the Minister did, in 1903, write a minute and promise to bring in a Bill to amend the Act. But the Bill is not yet forthcoming. I should like to know when he intends to give effect to his undertaking. To resume my argument with regard to the union label, I should like to carry the matter still further. Whilst honourable members of the Labour Party do not admit it, yet it is a fact that the effect of insisting upon these union conditions in America has been simply to produce a reaction in another direction; and I firmly believe that a very great deal of the difficulty that has occurred there in regard to the formation of trusts and monopolies has been caused by the principle underlying union label conditions. The same thing was attempted in Melbourne a short time ago, but fortunately the effort was nipped in the bud. There was a certain brewery which pretended that it was about to introduce, for the consumption of the people, beer which was manufactured under strict union conditions. I have seen a copy of the union label which was to be placed upon every cask issued from this brewery. It was a beer barrel marked with some such device as "" XXX , "" to denote the quality of the beer. There was a little l i d on the device which could be lifted up, and inside there was a picture of a ""beerchewer"" about to consume a glass of the ale produced under union conditions. The brewery attempted to capture the trade in Melbourne by using the union label. This brewery intended, if possible, to have it enacted by the Trades Hal l Council that all unionists should consume nothing but union beer; and this threatened to be a ous menace to the trade. The other breweries had a consultation, and they approached this one brewery; and the end was a decision that it would not be to the interests of the trade to carry the scheme into effect. Eventually the one brewery agreed not to produce beer under the conditions contemplated, ancl so the matter fell through. But if the proposal had been carried out-anc l it must be remembered that this was a voluntary matter-and the union label had been made compulsory, what would have been the position ? As I have previously said, the sugar in Queensland would have had to be produced, under union conditions, ancl so would the barrels ancl hoops. The beer would have had to be produced in union breweries, the drivers would have had to be union drivers, and the hotels would have been.tied down to union beer, whether that beer was good, bad, or indifferent. And, further, unionists would have had to drink that beer, whether it was good, bad, or indifferent.",21
120,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,Unionist s have to drink any beer which the breweries supply now.,22
121,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The hotels and breweries would have had to follow suit, with the 1>5J result that all non-unionists would have lost their employment in breweries. ",22
122,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member may say ""Good gracious""; but would it not be a serious matter if in a brewery 700 non-unionists out of 1,000 men employed should be faced with the alternative of los ing their employment or joining the union, although they might have solid objections to the latter course? Moreover, if those men joined the union, they might have to drink the beer which they had brewed themselves. Under such circumstances, the brewers would resolve to combine and form a monopoly. I have shown honourable members that this is one of the means whereby trusts and monopolies are brought about-com binations we all deprecate, and would like to see extinguished. Honourable members in the Ministerial corner, by their legislation, and by their actions outside Parliament, force people into trusts and monopolies, and the result is that we have combinations which exploit the public, and act detrimentally to the commercial interests, not only of Australia, but of other parts of the world, where they have assumed large dimensions. In this way, both unionists seri- and non-unionists suffer. Such combinations under our present arrangement of competition seriously affect the interests of men who work for their daily bread. If the brewers, for instance, combined, they wouldi find that, by using two or three establishments, and concentrating their efforts, they coul d brew all' 'the beer required. (What I want to point out is that all the beer required could be brewed in two or three establishments, instead of nine or ten as at present. What would be the result ?  very often.",22
123,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"No doubt a good deal of the beer brewed under union conditions would very often be equally effective as physic. The combination I have indicated would mean that instead of, say, ten establishments, there would be three, with a corresponding reduction of staffs, and a consequent loss of employment. Those results would not be confined to the brewing industry, but would extend to every other industry in Australia. Instead of business enterprise being encouraged, it would be discouraged, and, by means of combinations, the unemployed difficulty would be accentuated. We all agree that trust's and monopolies should be kept down; but I think that the ideas of some honourable members go beyond that result. desire is to force trade into such conditions that finally the industries I have mentioned will have to be nationalized. This is one way of bringing about the nationalization of industries. I have in my hand a newspaper called American tries, published in New York, on December 15th, 1904; and from that I should like to give the House an idea of the manner in which the principle of the union label has been carried out to the detriment of trade, and of the working men generally in the United States.",22
124,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,In whose interests is that newspaper published-the emplovers?,23
125,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The price is'five cents, and, as I say, the newspaper is published in New York.",23
126,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,Is the newspaper published in the interests of the employers?,23
127,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,I believe it is published in the interests of a majority of the members of the community.,23
128,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,Does it bear the union label ?,23
129,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"As showing the effect of the union label on trade and commerce generally, I should like to quote the f o l lowing extract: North of San Francisco, in the great city of Portland, one of the most conservative and solid cities on the Pacific coast, where they were facing the problem which St. Louis has so successfully carried through with many inconveniences, and the harrassing industrial conditions there existing, the Citizens' Alliance solved the problem for the first time, perhaps, in the history of the United States, of building a great exposition under the open shop, and the Lewis, and Clarke exposition, from top to bottom, from the meanest lo the grandest building that stands upon the exposition grounds, is the product of open-shop labour. Some two or three years ago a Mr. Wehner, of San Jose, undertook to. build a panorama structure in San Francisco. He made a contract for the work. He did not specify therein the character of the labour, and the contractor began the exterior work with non-union labour. A delegate to the Building Trades Council protested against this, and Mr Wehner, discovering that he was going to involve himself in difficulties, explained that he had no means of controlling the labour employed by his contractor, but that he would promise that all the interior work should be done by union labour. This was not satisfactory. A boycott was laid upon the structure, and upon the amusement that was to take place in it. Six carpenters who remained at work, despite the strike that followed, were expelled from the Carpenters' Union of the Building Trades Council of San Francisco. Mr. Wehner was a man of limited capital. He was faced by the most terrible industrial conditions that have ever disheartened an employer, and threatened with the loss of his means. Through the manager, Mr Harry Gilmour, he en learn the terms upon which the strike could be called oif. Mr MCCarthy wrote in reply a short letter, which is a photograph of industrial conditions there as they then existedJuly 6, 1904. To Mr Harry Gilmour, IndusInter-State Panorama Co. Dear Sir, In regard to the request, as presented by Mr. Wehner, relative to a settlement of the boycott on the panorama "" Battle of Manilla,"" we have decided unanimously that we will, upon the consideration of having published in the daily press of San Francisco for a period of thirty days the following :- "" I , Mr Wehner, do hereby acknowledge that I have committed a serious and grave error in antagonizing the unions affiliated with the Building Trades Council and organized labour in San Franciso; admit my defeat in the premises, publicly apologize therefore for attempting to erect and run a place of public amusement in San Francisco. And, further, I , Mr Wehner, do hereby agree to pay to charitable institutions to be named by the council the sum of one thousand dollars."" The employer had to fine himself $r,ooo.",23
130,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE S,"The ""lan d of f r e e d o m "" !",23
131,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Yes , "" the land of freedom."" Upon the fulfilment of the foregoing we will settle amicably the existing difficulties between Mr Wehner and organized labour of this city and county. C. H . MCCARTHY, W. M . PAGE, Secretary Building Trades Council.",23
132,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,Honourable members wanted proofs; there they are.,23
133,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,And yet there is no Labour Party in Parliament in America.,23
134,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"It just shows that, so far as Australia is concerned, according to the statement of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, it would be better for unionists if there were no Labour Party in the Parliaments of Australia, and it might not be a bad thing for Australia.",23
135,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member should not be too severe.,23
136,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,I think we shall all resign.,23
137,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"When honourable members of the Labour Party, a few weeks ago, had a very good opportunity, not to resign exactly, but to take the opinion of the people with regard to their action, they did not appear to be so eager to do so as they profess to be today, or have been on some former occasions. Mr Wehner, though not a man of much capital, is a man of considerable principle; he preferred to lose the one rather than to suffer the irretrievable loss of the other. The conditions were never fulfilled. I commend that to honourable members. Rather than lose his principles, this gentleman was prepared to fight and die, so to speak, financially.",23
138,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,That is too high a tone for us.,24
139,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Where is the high tone? There is no specially high tone about it. To show how much further the matter was carried in San Francisco, I quote the following: The Building Trades Council of San Francisco is composed of over fifty, governed by an executive council, with a"" delegate from each union. The Labour Council of San Francisco numbers nearly 135 unions, and numbers among its members such unions as the Chicken Pickers, the Fish Gutters, and there was even a union of the Bowling Alley employees organized, the men who set up the ten pins at the end of the alley. Honourable members will notice that, under these conditions, if the system is to be son carried to such an extent as the Ministry of are making provision for at the present moment, it will be impossible in Australia, as well as in America, to have even a game be of skittles unless some of those employed support happen to be members of a union. I quote or this furtherWhen in San Francisco they began the work of the boycott, labour there employed sandwiched it men, and we had parading up and down the streets of our city in dozens of places men bearing plathe cards, bearing such inscriptions as this- "" Do patronize this non-union restaurant. It employs scab help. Indorsed by the San Francisco Council,"" or some other labour organization. If the system is to be carried out to the same extent in Australia as in America, and if such a thing is permitted, we shall no doubt have sandwich-men parading the streets of Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane, pointing out the institutions at which people can get a feed, can get clothes or boots, or telling them which newspaper to read. If some newspaper is not produced under certain labour conditions,) people will be informed that it is not to be purchased by members of the unions. The extract I make proceedsBut unionism was in the air to such an extent that labour had not employed its sandwiched men boycotters for a dozen days until the sandwich men conceived the idea of organizing the Sandwich Men's Union. And we had the Sandwich Men's Union demanding of the union that employed them an increase of wages from a dollar and a half to two dollars a day. And when they did not get it they struck, and we had upon the streets of San Francisco the ridiculous spectacle of one sandwich man parading up and down in [-'5]-2front of a place of business declaring it unfair, and another sandwich man parading up and down in front of him, declaring that when he declared the business unfair he unfairly declared it unfair. This sort of thing had been going on for a very considerable time in San Francisco, and the evil had increased to such an extent that 85 per cent, of the businesses in that city were terrorized by the system. The condition of things described had existed for three years, and when the people could stand it no longer they rose to defend themselves, and brought it under the notice of the legal authorities, in the form of a case submitted to the Court. Judge Hebbard, of the Superior Court of San Francisco, gave a decision in connection with the matter which is of very considerable importance. I quote the following reference to it : It was upon a demurrer interposed to an application for a restraining order, a complainant in the Equity Court, setting up a boycott as the reafor the restraining order, and asking protection of the Equity Court. The question was one law, whether an action in boycott could be maintained. The Court, in overruling the demurrer, said, "" There are not, and there cannot any authorities to sustain the defendant's contention. There is no law, human or divine, to their argument. To proclaim a business the proprietors unfair in this manner, is as infamous as to proclaim before a private dwelling that the inmates thereof are prostitutes - The acts complained of are breaches of the peace, and is safe to say that if the one boycotted had met it by personal violence, instead of appealing to law, he would have been justified by a jury not under his constitutional right of self-defence."" Labour That is a very important decision by an eminentJudge.",24
140,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,Surely we are not proposing to legalise anything like that?,24
141,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member ought t.o know, if he does not know, that we are. I am afraid the honourable member does know something about the matter, or, having taken the action he has taken, and having gone as far as he has gone in connection with this union business, he would have gone wholly into if, and become one of the unionists. It is plain to me that it is because the. honourable member knows something that he has wisely kept outside. Mr Mauger.,-What has that to do with the question I asked?",24
142,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member knows that what has occurred in America may occur in Australia. If we give these people an inch they will take an ell, and the result will be disastrous not only to the commercial life of this country but to the working men themselves, because it is absolutely bound to react upon them.",24
143,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,What has this to do with the question I put to the honourable member?,25
144,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,The cases which the honourable member has quoted show an evasion of the law. The same thing would apply to pickpockets.,25
145,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Her e we have the honourable member for Moira proposing to vote for clauses which would give a legal justification to this kind of thing in Australia, and under which it'could not be overruled as it has been in America.",25
146,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,-The honourable member has no justification for saying how I am going to vote.,25
147,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,I presume that the honourable member will vote in the direction I have indicated. He is such a f a it h f ul fol lower of the Ministry that I assume they have only - to issue an order to him as to the way in which he shall vote to induce him to vote accordingly. The same thing appiies to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.,25
148,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,Is it not a fact that the Bill provides safeguards against boycotting ?,25
149,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,There is no safeguard provided by the Bill against boycotting.,25
150,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE S,How could there be?,25
151,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I may tell the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that, so far as we in Australia are concerned, we have not the same constitutional power for the protection of the rights and interests of our citizens as they have in the United States.",25
152,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,Agains t boycotting?,25
153,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"We have not, to the same extent, the protection against it which exists in the United States. It was, fortunately, discovered that, according to one of the amendments of the Constitution of the United States, it was absolutely illegal for any of these conditions to be imposed on labour. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said, on one or two occasions, that the Constitution of the United States is defective in that it is not elastic enough. Commonwealth we have a Constitution which is elastic enough; but it does not absolutely protect the .rights of every citizen, even those conferred under the magnificent Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights.",25
154,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURE S,"Did the honourable member get that from the Women's League ? - Mr HUTCHISON - The honourable member cannot think much of his leader, because his leader is in favour of unions.",25
155,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE S,"When honourable members opposite are impatient, the honourable member for Corangamite may be sure that he is making good headway.",25
156,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I shall read another paragraph from this newspaper, which saysI believe absolutely that the right to live is the right to work;",25
157,Mr SPENCE,MANUFACTURE S,"Hear , hear.",25
158,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S," for without the unrestricted right to labour, man cannot support himself, nor the lives of those dependent upon him.",25
159,Mr SPENCE,MANUFACTURE S,"Hear , hear.",25
160,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S," When, therefore, any man dares to make membership in any organization an essential pre-requisite to the exercise of the right to work, he violates the fundamental dispensations of the Almighty. The honourable member for Darling does not say ""hear, hear"" to that. The honourable member would force all men into unions, and. so far as he is concerned, those who would not be forced might starve or rot. The quotation proceedsI claim that that man has also aimed a blow at the lif e principle of this Republic, which is simply the ultimate victory of 5,000 years of human effort to express in the form of human government the essential safeguards of human liberty.",25
161,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,It is the non-unionists who knock out the unionists.,25
162,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The facts of the case are altogether against the honourable member. We have read in the daily newspapers from time to time within the last few weeks that in New South Wales men are being brought by the unions before the Court for not paying their fees. A poor washerwoman has been sued for fees she owed to the union, and it has been ruled by the Judge of the Court that, so long as a union has a dispute pending in the Arbitration Court, those who have joined it remain members of it. Even if a dispute remains unsettled for ten years, those who have joined the union concerned in it In the remain members of it, and slaves to it. Honourable members here tried to introduce into our Conciliation and Arbitration Bill a principle which, having been carried into effect by the New South Wales Act, has established a tyranny far worse than any form of slavery which has existed in any other part of the world.",25
163,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURE S,That is according to the honourable member.,26
164,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"It is according to fact. In New South Wales, men join the unions, and then, as the leaders of the unions take good care that there shall always be disputes pending in the Arbitration Court, they are unable to leave them again. But the leaders of the unions have pushed matters too far. Men of liberal mind were disposed to assist them so long as they thought that they were asking for a fair thing ; but they are now causing reasonable men to turn against them, because they are saying in effect to those who are non-unionists ancl free men, "" You are not slaves now, but immediately you become members of our organization, you will be so. You' will be bound hand and foot,"" just as the members of the Labour Party in this House are bound with regard to their votes, and almost with regard to what they say in this Chaml>er.",26
165,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member should have been a novelist; he would have done well.,26
166,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I wish to read another extract from a later issue of American In dustries, but before doing so, I should like to see a quorum present. {Quorum formed.] The extract which I wish to read is as follows: An opinion of Judge Shackleford Miller, of the Chanoery Branch of the Jefferson Circuit Court, at Louisville, in the suit lately brought by the Courier-Journal Job Printing Company, ancl its president and vice-president, as citizens, to test validity of the ""union label"" ordinance under which the city has been awarding the contracts for public printing, is of the utmost interest and importance. It renders an unqualified judgment for the plaintiffs. Some of the points in the brief of the attorney for the plaintiff, Mr Alfred Seligman, were as follow :That the ordinance is unconstitutional and void, being in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in this that citizens not a member of the Allied Printing Trades Council of Louisville, and not employing members thereof, are abridged in their privileges ancl immunities as citizens of the United States and deprived of liberty and property without due process of law, and denied the equal protection of the law. That it is unconstitutional under section 3 of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the State of Kentucky, in this : that the said ordinance constitutes the grant of exclusive separate public emoluments and privileges to persons, members of said Allied Printing Trades Council of Louisville, or employing members of said council, and that such separate public emoluments ancl privileges are not in consideration of any public services rendered. That it is a violation of the inherent equality of all men before the law. Moneys raised by public taxes constitute a trust fund for the benefit of all taxpayers, to be administered and spent only for public municipal purposes; that municipal officers are trustees, and have no right to divert such trust funds to any other than municipal governmental purposes; that the city buyer is undertaking under the direction of said ordinance, to pay $260 more for the public printing than the same can be done without the operation of said ordinance, and to that extent there is a diversion of public funds to private uses, and a breach of trust that will be enjoined by the Court. The injunction is not an interference with the discretion vested in this public officer. The legislative department of the city of Louisville has no right to impose upon the discretion of the city buyer or limit it by an unconstitutional ordinance, nor has he a right to accept or bind his discretion with the terms of such an ordinance. The appropriate remedy is by injunction. Judge Miller's opinion was as follows :-This action is brought by L . T. Davidson and August Straus, in their capacities as residents ancl taxpayers in the city of Louisville, and by the Courier-Journal Job Printing Company, as plaintiffs, against the City of Louisville, Charles F. Grainger, mayor of the said city; Fred. R. Bishop, city buyer of said city ; the Globe Printing Company, and Charles T. Dearing, as defendants, for an injunction to prevent the awarding of a contract for printing of the reports of the city of Louisville for 1903, under a letting of June 7, 1904, to either the Globe Printing Company or to C. T. Dearing. By an ordinance of the city of Louisville, approved January 24, 189S, it is provided in substance that all printing, bookmaking, and work of like character used or ordered by the city of Louisville, ""shall bear the imprint of the recognised union label of the Allied Printing Trades Council of Louisville, Kentucky, as registered with the Secretary of State""; and that the city buyer, when advertising for printed matter, shall insert a notice in the advertisement that all bids shall be submitted in accordance with said ordinance. In advertising for these bids, the defendant, Bishop, followed the requirements of the ordinance by giving notice that "" all bids must be subject to ordinance approved by the mayor, January 24, 1898."" The plaintiff, the Courier-Journal Job Printing Company, filed a bid by which it proposed to do the work for $2*20 per page, while the defendants, the Globe Printing Company and C. T. Dearing, each offered to do it for $2'6o per page, there being a difference of $240 in the : cost of the entire work under the respective bids. There is no question raised as to the regularity, sufficiency, or validity of any of the bids. This motion for an injunction is based upon the single ground that City Buyer Bishop is threatening to and will award the contract to the Globe Printing Company or C. T. Dearing at $2'6o per page, under and as required by said ordinance of January 24, 189S, because said Globe Printing Company and said Dearing can comply with the ordinance by using the label of the Allied Printing Trades Council-commonl y called the "" Union Label""-whil e the Courier-Journal Job Printing Company, being an "" open shop,"" cannot use said label upon its work, and cannot therefore complv with the requirements of the ordinance. The ordinance is attacked as being unconstitutional, in that it undertakes to a discrimination between different classes citizens similarly situated; that it restricts petition in public work, and tends to increase cost ancl creates a monopoly thereof; that it tempts to confer an exclusive privilege upon tain persons, in violation of the of Rights, and that in awarding said contract to the Globe Printing Company or to C. T. Dearing said city buyer and the mayor (who must approve the same) will not act in the full cise of their judgment, or discretion, or bond fide, but will do so only under the alleged straint of the said ordinance, which will require them to so award the contract. That the ordipreventing nance is clearly unconstitutional is conceded the city attorney and by the counsel for the other defendants. Indeed, when .the ordinance was presented to the city attorney for examination before it became effective, that official made the following endorsement thereon : - "" The ordinance is unconstitutional. Examined *and proved. H . L . Stone, City .Attorney."" The legal objection to the ordinance has been well exof pressed in the following language :- "" Manifestly, if the General Council has the right to restrict competition, so far as the public plies and public contracts are concerned, to those only who employ union labour, it would have the same right to pass the same character of ordinance for the benefit of non-union labour, at any time the friends of non-union labour pass should gain control of the General Council. if at any time the majority of the members the General Council should be members of the Presbyterian Church, or the Methodist Church, or the Baptist Church, or the Catholic Church, or of any other church, or if the majority them should belong to the Masons, or the Oddby fellows, or the Elks, or any other order, they would have the same right to pass a like ordiinterrupted. nance for the benefit of those employing memchandize bers of their particular church, denomination, or stopped. order. The result would be that the laws of the city, instead of being enacted for the benefit of all the inhabitants of the municipality equally and impartially, would favour only that class our citizens who happened to be in political power at the particular time."" As I said in the first place, the Judge declared the use of the union label nexion with the printing trade to be unconstitutional. Another tioned in the same newspaper of the 15th June, 1904, as follows:Agents of the International Brotherhood Electrical Workers and of the International ciation of Mechanics, of the Brass-workers' up-to-date. union and the Brass-moulders' local union, demanded that the Kellogg Switchboard and Supply Company, of Chicago, should execute an agreement that they would employ none but members of these organizations. The officers the Kellogg Company refused to sign the agreement, a strike was declared, the union men the employment of the company, and its factory was picketed by a large number of them. It all. obtained a preliminary injunction, but the picketing continued. It made an application to the Superior Court to Dunish the Mr Wilson. tempt. The union denied all conspiracy, and make claimed that the men who were engaged inof picketing only used peaceable means by percomsuasion. The Court, however, fined a number its of the officers of the unions, and directed twoatof them to be imprisoned. The unions appealed, cerand the Appellate Court has now sustained the Kentucky B i ll injunction unanimously. Judge Adams' opinion saysAppellants denied that they used force, threats, or intimidation of any sort, and say they were exerpeaceful and mildly persuasive. But the very presence of a large number of pickets, with the conavowed purpose of preventing plaintiffs' employees from remaining in its employ, and of those seeking employment from enby tering it, was in itself intimidation. When a thousand labourers gather around a railroad track and say to those who seek employment they had better not, and that advice is supplemented every little while by a terrible assault upon one who disregards it, every one knows that something, apmore than advice is intended. l t is coercion, force; it is the effort of many by the mere weight numbers to compel the one to do their bidding. The affidavits show that the defendants suppicketed and patrolled around and about complainants' place of business, watching the streets, alleys, and approaches thereto, daily shifting their positions; that they so stationed themselves if that the complainants' employees were obliged tothrough their picket line; that their attitude And was ugly and menacing, such as to cause fear of in the mind of an ordinary person. Complainants' employees and persons seeking employment were waylaid on their wav to and from the factory; they were insulted and threatened, of and in numerous instances assaulted and beaten the strikers' pickets and patrollers, and complainants' business was seriously and injuriously All teaming and haulage of merto and from complainants' factory was The ""purpose of the strike by complainants'' employees and their prosecution of it, as described, was to compel the complainant to execute of the agreement referred to and made a part of the Bill . The drafts of agreements, three in number, purport to be with the different unions, whose members were in complainants' employ.",26
167,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE S,Fro m what newspaper is in conthe honourable member quoting?,27
168,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"America n Industries of. case is menfhe 15th June, 1904.",27
169,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE S,"That is up-to-date. i Mr WILSON - Yes , it is quite up-toof date, and members of the Labour Party Assodesire to bring the conditions still more",27
170,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"All that has nothing to do with union labels, but refers to a strike.",27
171,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"-The principle of the of use of the union label is dealt with in conleft nexion with the demand that the employer should engage union labour, or none at",27
172,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,That is a question oil ringleaders for contrade unionism.,27
173,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The question of iuse of a union label is dealt with throughout the judgment. The matter is one of preference being given to unionists, and the attempt made last session to apply that principle, compared to what is now sought to be achieved under the provisions of the Bill , was as measles compared to the - plague. The judgment continuesThat the purpose of the strike was to compel the - execution of the drafts of agreement is clear. It is averred, in the sworn Bill , and deposed to in - the affidavits of De Wolf, complainant's president; Kellogg, its secretary and treasurer; and Edwards, its superintendent, that business agents of the different unions, called on complainant, and insisted on its executing the agreements, and that, when complainant's president refused, on the ground that the proposed agreements were unreasonable, it was threatened by one of the said business agents that unless complainant would sign the agreements a strike would be called, and that said 'business agents called a strike, in response to about 500 of complainant's employees quit its employ. As I endeavoured to show a few minutes ago, the attempts to force all men into - the unions are intended to create a monopoly for a certain class of labour. If the efforts of the Labour Party are successful, they will have the effect of bringing about monopolies amongst those who are conducting commercial enterprises. Therefore, the very conditions which honourable members are always condemning, are likely to be brought about by their own action. They are setting up monopolies and trusts, ancl are at the same time contemplating the nationalization of our industries. They are thus setting up certain - conditions in order that they may knock them down again. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Was the judgment which the honourable member has been Tending, delivered by a Circuit Judge?",28
174,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,Judg e Adams is a Judge - of the Supreme Court of - States.,28
175,Mr KING OMALLEY,MANUFACTURE S,His position - would be equivalent to that of a County Court Judge in Victoria.,28
176,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The judgment ceedsThe agreements in question would, if executed, tend to create a monopoly in favour of the members of the different unions, to the exclusion of workmen not members of such unions, and are, in - this respect, unlawful. Contracts tending to - create a monopoly are void. The Legislature of the State cannot create a ""monopoly. the The purpose of the strikers is in violation of the criminal code, which provides as follows :Section 15S - If any two or more persons shall combine for the purpose of depriving the owner or possessor of property of its lawful use and management, or of preventing, by threats, suggestions of danger, or by any unlawf u l means, any person from being employed by or obtaining employment from any such owner or possessor of property on such terms as the parties may agree upon; such persons so offending shall be fined not exceeding $500, or confined in the county gaol not exceeding six months. Section 159 - If any person shall, by threat, intimidation, or unlawful interference, seek to prevent any other person from working or from obtaining work at any lawful business, on any terms that he may see fit, such person so offending shall be fined not exceeding $200. Not only was the purpose of the strike unlawful, but the means used to achieve the unlawful purpose were unlawful. The means used were the acts heretofore mentioned, and thereby injury to the complainants' business. The appellants and their associates intended to stop which the business of the complainant so far as they possibly could, and the evidence shows that they did stop it in great part to complainants' injury.",28
177,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,There is not a word there about union labels.,28
178,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"It is further statedEach conspirator is responsible for the acts and declarations of every other conspirator in furtherance of the common purpose. The conspiracy originated simultaneously with the calling of the strike, and continued until the filing of the last petition, July 14th, 1902. It was'a single conspiracy. And 'the Court on the hearing of each of the second and third petitions did not err in hearing the prior evidence. This was an appeal case, the evidence having been given in another Court. The statement proceedsThe evidence was competent as tracing and showing the character of the conspiracy. It is an indispensable condition of the enjoyment by each citizen of the liberty and rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws that he shall respect, and not unlawfully infringe upon the liberty or rights of any other citizen. This cannot be done with impunity The fact that labourers have the right to refuse to work the United for a man who does not employ union labour, or in order to better their condition or advance their wages, does not authorize the making of a contract under which the employer is compelled to employ only union labour, and to discharge non-union labour. The rights of the employer and employee are, and should be, synonymous, but pro- employees cannot, by combination or union, without committing the crime of conspiracy, force employers to agree to employ only union labour. When employers do become parties to such an agreement they are equally guilty of conspiracy.",28
179,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,Have we any such law here?,28
180,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"No. The United States Constitution protects the rights and liberties of citizens far more effectively; 68o than does the Constitution of the Commonwealth. It is further statedI f in the future any employer signs a closed shop agreement with union or non-union workers, says one of the leading lawyers in the case, employer will do so with a full knowledge he is laying himself liable to the criminal as well as the civil code, and that any non-union or union workmen excluded under the signed agreement has a double-edged weapon of the law with which to enforce his right to be free from the handicap of a conspiracy of discrimination when he seeks employment in any workshop, store, factory, or other place of business. I think I have shown by the extracts which I have read, that the effect of legislation empowering the use of the union label will be a very serious one to workmen who are not members of trade unions, and that it will be detrimental to the best interests to fight the battle of the poor man. of the commerce of Australia. I now wish to point out how it will operate in relation to the agricultural and pastoral industries - the two industries in which I am ticularly interested. The other honourable member for Bland declared that unionism in Australia was not carried under the conditions that obtain in America.",28
181,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,I said that it was carried out in the way that it is alleged to be carried out in America by the honourable to starve. member and his friends. I have not been tb America.,29
182,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I occupy a similar position. I have not travelled to America, I can only judge of the conditions which obtain there from the reports which I read in the newspapers, and which are supposed to be absolutely accurate. decisions which \ have quoted are couched in the language employed by the learned Judge who presided, and I think that the tion the other day. honourable member should accept them good faith. If we consider the proposal in favour of the adoption of a union label in relation to the production of wool, what do we find? When the union label business is push'""'? to an extreme-an assuming th£.t honourable members connected with labour unions will push it to treme",29
183,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,If it is a good it ought to be pushed to an extreme.,29
184,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member is certainly not one of the mildest the Labour Party. He occasionally pushes his views to an extreme. Upon a recent casion, he even went so far as to refuse to Workers' Union. travel upon a steamer which carried a stoker. I am quite sure that most members produced by union labour. .of labour organizations will not hesitate to push matters to an extreme in every possible way. Under the proposal which I , am discussing, what will be the position so far as shearing is concerned? It will be necessary that every bale of wool sha 1 such bear the union label. What conditions will that require to be fulfilled in order to bring about that result? Every man employed upon a station will need to become a member of the Australian Workers' Union.",29
185,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,Is that why the honourable-member left the Pastoralists' Union?,29
186,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"No . I left that body in order that I might be an absolutely free agent in regard to these matters, and in order that I might be able to fight the battle of the non-unionists without any prejudice. I do not wish to fight the battle of the big man, but, so far as I possibly can, I intend The former will not be seriously affected by this proposal, but the latter will be. Under the operation of the Bill in its present form, parhundreds and thousands of men who are day, the now outside the Australian Workers' Union - me n who are engaged in the Western Disout trict of Victoria, and in the pastoral industry in New South Wales-wil l be comnot pelled either to join that organization or '",29

I repeat that all the non-unionists who are at present engaged men in in the pastoral industry ithroughout the Commonwealth will - if this Bill becomes oclaw-be compelled to join the Australian Then the implements black which they use-the shears-wil l have to be As a matter of fact they have to be so produced at the present time, when a system of voluntary unionism obtains. Union shearers must use union-made shears.",29
191,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,There is no about it ; but they use them.,30
192,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,They use union shears. These must be provided for them.,30
193,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,There is a label on them too.,30
194,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Yes , there is a label on them. Under existing conditions, unionists insist upon using only union shears. What will happen under a compulsory system of unionism ? ' The bales will all require to be made by union labour, and every jale will need to be branded. If not, what will happen? If the bales and the wool do not bear the union label the members of the Wharf Labourers' Union will be instructed not to handle the goods, and the members of the Seamen's Union will be directed not to carry them.",30
195,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,The world will stop.,30
196,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I thank the honourable member for his interjection. the slightest doubt that the members of the Labour Party are putting brakes upon the wheels of progress in Australia. have been doing so ever since they gained great power in this Parliament, and they will continue to do so. It will be their constant aim to apply brakes to the wheels of progress, in order to prevent the proper development of the commercial and industrial life o£ this country. I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for his interjection. Unfortunately, not only for the people who conduct business enterprises in Australia, but also for the workmen of this country, our commercial world is stopping. Then in the butter industry an attempt will be made to force all the men who are engaged in producing milk, and all the farm hands, to become members of the Milkers' Union. If they refuse to do so they will be discharged. So far as I am concerned, every one of the men at present in my employ is a non-unionist. provisions of this Bill , those men will either be forced into a union or I shall have to discharge them. If I do not employ unionists my milk will not be received at the factory, because the hands engaged there will be members of the Butter Workers' Union. All the butter boxes will have to be produced by members of the Butter Box Makers' Union, and will require to be branded with the union label. I presume that that brand will be put inside the box, because the brand upon the finished article will have to be placed upon the outside, otherwise the stevedores will not handle it, and the seamen will not ""must"" carry it. That is how legislation of this character will affect the pastoral and agricultural industries, in common with every other enterprise that is being carried on in Australia. I maintain that it will strike one of the most severe blows at commercial enterprise that have ever been struck m the history of this country, or of any other part of the civilized world. It will apply also to the manufacture of boots and, indeed, to every other business undertaking in Australia. Trade union propositions of this kind have gone beyond the voluntary stage, and we are now asked to force them upon the people by legal enactment. We know the members of the Labour Party and of the Trades H all Council well enough to realise that they will see that the trade union label provisions ot the Bill, if they be passed, are pushed home, and that industry is further crippled I have not in this way. The historv of the system in the United States shows that the union label is used simply as an instrument of They torture so far as industry and commerce are concerned. Shop assistants who are members of unions are invariably instructed to introduce to customers goods bearin« the union label, and it is in this way that pressure is brought to bear by the unions. As soon as the unionists have obtained control of industries by means of this system, it is open to them to absolutely dictate their own terms and conditions to employers in every line of business, and to push them so far that in the end those employers may have to say, "" I cannot comply with these conditions any longer; I shall have to close down."" If this system be allowed to prevail in Australia, we cannot possibly look for the opening up of new undertakings. The proposal will strike one of the most severe blows that has yet been aimed at the industrial life of Australia, and means Under the the introduction of a form of tyranny and slavery in relation to non-unionists', the like of which has never been experienced in any part of the world.",30
197,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member promised to quote cases in which members of unions had been fined for using goods that did not bear the trade union label.,30
198,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Her e is a quotation in pointIn Chicago if a man went into a shop and bought goods which had not the union label on them, he would be fined five dollars for the first offence, twenty dollars for the second, fifty, for the third, and for the fourth offence he would be turned out of the union.",30
199,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,What is the name of the union ?,31

203,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,Does the honourable member believe that is true?,31
204,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,I do; the one is the natural corollary of the other.,31
205,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,Does the member believe that women could be made to strip before a union delegate in order that their clothing might be examined?,31
206,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I made no such insinuation, and am astonished that such a suggestion should have come from the honourable member.",31
207,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,That is the effect of the statement which the honourable member read.,31
208,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I read nothing of the kind. I simply read a statement showing that it was necessary in Chicago that the wives and children of unionists should wear clothes bearing the imprint of a union, but I never suggested that a walking delegate-eve n of the union to which the honourable member belongs-woul d be guilty of critically examining the clothes worn by the wives or children of unionists. The idea that a union delegate could sink so low has never occurred to my mincl; my impression has always been that only a superficial examination of the clothing is made. The provisions of the Bill relating to the union label will strike a blow at the liberty of the poorest class of workmen in Australia. We have to fight the battle of the non-unionists as against the unionists, and I can promise honourable members of the Labour Partv that in the end they will suffer very seriously from the enactment of such provisions. result of the attitude taken np by .the party will be that those who are outside the unions will be driven into a combinption to fight them. At the outset, their organizations were formed with a laudable object, but having felt their strength, they have done as many others have done in similar circumstances-the y have gone too far. It is because of this that a reaction has set in, which must eventually cripple organizations that have served a very useful purpose. But above all other considerations, the desire of honourable members of this Parliament should be to conserve the liberties of the very poorest of our citizens, in so far as the avenues of employment open to them are concerned.",31
209,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S," I listened with some attention to the remarks of the honourable member for Corangamite, being, led to assume from his opening statement that he would deal with the more important features of the Bill. I naturally considered that he would enlighten the Houseas to the results that would possibly accrue from the passing of the union label prohonorable visions of the Bill , but have come to the conclusion that he dealt with the question, not of the union label, but of unionism generally, and the injurious effects of unionism upon the industrial life of the United States, where strikes constitute one 1 of the chief engines of warfare employed' by trade unions. The honourable member treated us to a disquisition upon many learned judgments pronounced by theCourts of the United States which had had the effect of preventing people from doing something that was not in accordance with law; but I would remind him that it is unnecessary for us to go so far for illustrations in that regard. What fiappens in Victoria, not only to those who break our industrial laws, but to company promotors who violate the Companies Act, or evertto members of the medical profession who break the law? Law-breakers in all theseclasses generally find themselves 'in the end, in Pentridge, or thereabouts. Itshould be our endeavour to deal with the question of trade marks solely from the point of view of Australia-w e should' strive to show what may be the effect of the passing of this Bill upon the trading and industrial welfare of the Commonwealth. No less an authority than theleader of the Opposition has told us that unionism, in its essential principle, is asplendid thing. The",31
210,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,He did not say that theunion label was a good thing.,31
211,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"I am dealing first of all with the question of unionism. Unionism is a splendid thing for anv body of men who wishi to - securer-he best results of their labour... no matter what avocation they may follow. As an evidence of that, take the profession of which the honourable member is an ornament-the medical profession. Practically every worker, no matter what his calling may be, sooner or later realizes the enormous advantages to be gained from unionism. Notwithstanding what the honourable member has said to the contrary, he has seen fit to leave the ranks of the unionists, to leave the association of which he was such a conspicuous member.",31

214,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURE S,Quite right; I never thought it would.,32
215,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"We all know that non-unionists, especially in the industrial walks of life in Australia,| have to thank unionists for their position to-d'ay. As a matter of fact, do they not benefit from every advantage gained by unionists, and gained entirely at their own expense ? That is a factor which is lost sight of to a very considerable extent.",32
216,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,What expense disadvantage are the unionists put to?,32
217,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"Every time they find the funds to fight the cause, and the non-unionists are never asked to contribute. I would also remind the honourable member for Corangamite that, generally speaking, in Australia we have a law taking out of the hands of unionists that great engine of warfare which they previously used, namely, the strike, which to my mind, was never a legitimate means of achieving their end.",32

I stated my position very clearly to the House on a previous B i seen no reason to alter my mind. I desire to approach the discussion of the present measure from a fair basis, without raising any little side issues.

225,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"Let me get back to the original position. The Government were subjected by the leader of the Opposition to some criticism for introducing this proposal for a trade union label, and a previous Government, some of whose members are supporting the present Government, were twitted with not having placed it in the original Bill. ;What queer positions we find ourselves in at times! Had the right honourable member forgotten at that time what position he occupied, when he asked the Crown to assent to the Conciliation and - or - Arbitration Bill ? Although the leading feature of that Bill which had caused the downfall of one Government, and subsequently caused the downfall of a second Government, was opposed by the right honourable member, yet he, as leader of the Government, advised the Crown to assent to that principle. So far as I know, honourable members constituting the present Government did not formulate this Bill in the first instance. It was originated in the Senate by the Labour Government, without a provision for a union label, which, by the way, was introduced there by the representatives of the Labour Party. The present Government accepted the Bill with some modifications.",32
226,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,Did they not,32
227,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"So far as I could gather from a search of the records, the parWatson Government introduced the Bill in Senate without a provision for a union",32

Of course, it remains the House to say what will be the effect. To those who declaim against the provivisions sion, ancl point to the tyranny and injustice to any fair-minded man. which will accrue to non-union labourers through its enactment let me put this question, "" Where is compulsion, within four corners of the measure, to compel employer or manufacturer to put the label on his goods?""",33

233,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"Certainly . employer thinks that there is an advantage in using a trade union label, why prevent him from using it?",33
234,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE S,Canno t the honourable memhis ber see the Bill offers a means of using force upon a person?,33
235,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"No . Until there is labour. compulsion; until the unions have power to go to an employer and say, "" Unless the manufacturer? you employ all union men, you cannot use the union label """,33
236,Mr MCCAY,MANUFACTURE S,They cannot under the amended proposal.,33
237,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"I know that they on cannot: but I am putting it in this way: that under this Bill , when the employees a man claim that every act in the producployer. tion of an article shall be done by union labour, he will still have the power to say, "" No ; I shall not use the union label, as would be of no benefit to me."" Is not he ""sacks"" the ten. power still left in the hands of the manufacturer to.prevent any terrorism, or even coercion, from unionists?",33
238,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,Would the honourable member support any clause to guard against the abuse nf the union label?,33
239,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"I am prepared to act as I did on a previous occasion. I am prepared to prohibit the making of any rule that would debar any fair or reasonableminded man from entering a union. raised my voice against the existence of such rules before. Not only have the unions of industrial workers transgressed in that respect, but even the union to which [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. the honourable member for Corangamite bewas longed has had some extraordinary provisions in its rules. The body to which I benow long, the farmers, also have an organization that has done some extraordinary things with emwhich I have no sympathy, and which, infor deed, are, from my point of view, absolutely absurd-as , for instance, putting proin their rules which are repugnant The positionwhich I take up is that there is nothing, obligatory upon any employer or upon any the manufacturer, even if the whole of his any employees are union men, to use the unionunion label. No trader, commercial man, or manufacturer will use a trade mark unless the there is some advantage from so doing.",33
240,Mr MCCAY,MANUFACTURE S,What is the advantage of label is using the union label?,33
241,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"What is the advantage of any trade mark? There is this a guaadvantage, from the industrial worker's stand-point-that the union label puts him If an on an equality with any corporation or in dividual manufacturer in the community who has a right to register a trade mark. It gives to the industrial worker, through organization, a right to register a trade mark, showing that the goods which he makes are produced entirely by union",33
242,Mr MCCAY,MANUFACTURE S,What is the advantage to,33
243,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,It is another incentive to the honest employer. What has been the object of the whole of our industrial legislation? It is not restrictive any fair employer; it is restrictive on the employer who resorts to illegitimate of means in competition with the honest em,33
244,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE S,"And the fair-minded employer, who has ninety unionists and ten- it non-unionists, cannot use the label unless,",33
245,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"If the whole of his. employees are unionists, they can put no coercion upon him to use the lalbel.",33
246,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE S,He has to discharge the ten to get any advantage from the label. Theremust be coercion.,33
247,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"There is no coercion whatever. Generally speaking, if an employer finds it to be to his advantage toI discharge non-unionists, and to put in other men, on account of their better workmanship or their better services generally, he will not hesitate for a moment to do so. I do not follow the argument that any powerof coercion is given to the unions by means of this principle. The object which I have in view, before the Bill is finally disposed of, is this: We have had many complaints in Australia-som e have been voiced on the floor of this House-as to the injurious effects upon the community generally of monopolies, combines, and trusts. To my mind there is splendid opportunity in connection with this Bill-as there was in connection with the Patents Act, although advantage was not taken of it-to do something to restrain monopolists or those individuals who wish to create a monopoly in any particular article. I intend to propose an amendment to the effect that any individual or corporation who becomes the proprietor of a registered trade mark, and who does anything whatever in restraint of trade in the article to which that trade mark is applied, shall have the registration cancelled forthwith.",33
248,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE S,Would the honourable member apply that to a trade union that did anything of the kind?,34
249,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,Certainl y ; I wish to achieve uniformity wherever it is possible.,34
250,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE S,That is right; the honourable member would apply the principle to both parties ?,34
251,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"Yes; and that is why, in a spirit of equality and fairness. I. wish trade unions to have the right to register a union label just as an individual or corporation is given the right under this Bill.",34
252,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE S,Trad e unions are not engaged in trade ,34
253,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"They are engaged in labour; that is their trade for the time lifting. The leader of the Opposition told us that this Bill was an instance of the effects of a shuffle of political cards, and he went on to argue that if it was possible by combinations of parties to bring about such a state of things, we should never know exactly where we were. Stress was laid on the fact that the Labour Party in this House were the determining factors in this class of legislation. I should like to direct the right honourable member's attention to the fact that the industrial classes in Australia are above the level of serfs today. citizens; they are constituted such by Act of Parliament. They have the franchise. We have thrown aside in Australia the old barbaric system of resorting to road metal and brute force to achieve what a particular class may think to be for its welfare. The working classes have come into the political arena. The members of the Labour Party are here as representatives of the citizens of Australia.",34
254,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,On e section of them.,34
255,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURE S,"It is not for the leader of the Opposition to quarrel with the members of the Labour Party or with those who send them here. It will be better to recognise that they represent one of the forces at work in this community, and to endeavour to direct that force into proper channels than to be interminably in antagonism to it . The whole industrial and economic l if e of Australia is today represented in Parliament. The party which is designated the Labour Party, represents, if honourable members choose to say so, a class. But we have had class representation'in the past. Those who complain of it today did not complain of it then. This force being at work today, is it not better to recognise it, and to endeavour to direct and govern it in the best interests of the community, than to be eternally abusing it? It has been recognised in some of the States, and it is being recognised in this Parliament, that it is our duty so to control the affairs of the nation that no section of its people-eve n the poorest of our'industrial classes-shal l have to sacrifice their life-blood, so to speak, for the benefit of their employers. So far as I can understand the situation,, it is admitted by all that the efforts of trade unions have been directed towards the uplifting of the industrial elements in Australia, and to placing them on an equality with other classes. That is the sole object of this trade union proposal. Consequently, I approach the question with an open mind. Up to the present, however, I have not heard of anything to prethe vent me from supporting the Bill. I trust that when we get into Committee, if anv provision i's found to be necessary to safeguard the interests of all, we shall be found perfectly willing to insert it in the Bill .",34
256,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S," If honourable members desire to have additional evidence of the fact that the present Government does not possess a sufficient majority in this House to enable them to introduce useful They are legislation, they have it in this attempt to bring forward a Bill embodying provisions which afford clear proof of pressure from another party. The Ministry speak with the voice of Jacob, but the hand is the hand of Esau. I venture to say that if the party really responsible for the introduction of the trade union label provisions of this Bill were occupying the Treasury bench, they would not have had the temerity to bring forward a provision of the kind. They would have exercised that caution which was so characteristic of their brief reign of office only a little while ago. But, occupying positions in which' they are able to control legislation without responsibility for that legislation, they evidently have been able to prevail on another Ministry to do what they themselves would probably never have attempted. I object to provisions of this character for reasons which I have always given for my objection to the creation of special privileges for any one section of the community. I hold that the Legislature exists for the purpose of preserving the equal rights of every citizen, and not for the purpose of creating laws which advantage one section at the expense or inconvenience of the, rest of the community - That is exactly what measures of this kind are designed to do. Here, the obvious intention and purpose is to enable one section to obtain special privileges at the expense of the rest of the community, hy the use of a union label, which will have the effe'ct of bringing pressure to bear on employers and employees alike-o n one to employ only certain members of the community, who are associated with unions, and on the other to purchase goods only from those who employ union labour. Whatever may be the rights of unions to draft rules in an endeavour to bring about such a state of affairs, the Legislature has no moral right to lend itself to any scheme for enabling such things to be done under the sanction of legal authority; ancl it is that aspect of the question to which I propose, mainly, to address myself.",34
257,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,Would the honourable member not give a union the right to register a label ?,35
258,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I see no objection to a union registering a label, provided it is clear that it is not the intention to use that label for the purposes of intimidation, coercion, or conspiracy, for the purposes of a bovcott, or by any other means of combination to prevent freedom of choice on the part of members of unions to purchase wherever they please, or to prevent freedom on the part of manufacturers or dealers to employ whom they choose, and sell what goods they choose, whether or not of union manufacture. If it is not the intention of the framers of this Bil l to afford such facilities the provisions of the part relating to trades unions certainly seem to me to lead in that direction. If we are to take the experience of other countries where similar provisions have been adopted, not by Legislatures, but by the unions themselves, we have reason to believe that there is room for great doubt and fear as to the consequences of passing such a measure with the full force of law behind it. Looking through' a list of cases, which is supplied in a pamphlet recently distributed, we see the following statement.",35
259,Mr CROUCH,MANUFACTURE S,B y whom is the pamphlet distributed ?,35
260,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,It is distributed by the Central Council of the Employers' Association of Australia.,35
261,Mr CROUCH,MANUFACTURE S,Is it signed by Walpole?,35
262,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The pamphlet bears no signature, but it is issued by the central council, from 285 Collins-street, Melbourne. I do riot vouch for the correctness of the statements therein contained; but if those statements have been published under the authority of an organization of the kind, we may, I think, reasonably assume that they are not made with any reckless disregard of fact. I propose to Tead some extracts without taking any responsibility for thjeiir actNuracy, giving them .to the House for what they are worth, and leaving it to honourable members to say whether there is not reason for giving serious attention to the arguments' and statements which have been published and issued officially by a body of reputable citizens.

They have great influence in support of the label. An unconscious to employer, finding that certain goods sell better than others of the same class, naturally orders the them in preference. Recently the General Couna cil of Lexington passed an ordinance requiring contracts for supplies to be given only to firms employing union labour. This was vetoed by the Mayor, on the ground that it violated a section of has the Constitution, which reads :"" No State shall make or enforce any law which abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property withdue process of law; nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws."" unI am very sorry we have not a similar prolabour vision in our Constitution.",36

280,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,Yes .,36
281,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,B y whom?,36
282,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I do not pose as an authority on the subject, but the Mayor not of Lexington, after the adoption of this course, vetoed the resolution on the ground that it was ultra vires of the Constitution. I take it that he was more familiar with the Constitution of America than I can profess to be. These provisions of the be Bill before us form really an attempt revive the preference provisions sought be included in the Conciliation and Arbitrabers tion Bill but in another form. Those prepurpose ference provisions were distinctly objected to by this House, and yet by the proviing sions of the Bill before us, it is proposed to sneak in preference to unionists, under the guise of provision for a union label. That has already been declared against in this House.",36
283,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"No , it was carried in House.",37
284,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The clauses as originthey will not. ally proposed were not carried, - but amended, so that preference should be this measure? given only under certain prescribed conditions which the honourable member for Bland declared could not be given effect to. The arguments which were used against the introduction of preference to unionists in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill apply with equal force to these clauses.",37
285,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member voted for preference to unionists.,37
286,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,"That is not so. If the honourable member for Bland recollects aright, I moved an amendment, when we were discussing the Conciliawill tion and Arbitration Bill , to delete the at such coercion or intimidation. preference clauses, and it was only after that amendment had been lost that I voted for an amendment, which hedged those proclause visions round with certain safeguards. honourable member'for Bland must admit that that is a correct statement of my tude on that occasion. I take up the same attitude on this Bill . I do not object unions having a label or trade vided it is not used for coercive or tyrannical purposes, in order to prevent members of unions buying goods where they like, and whether they are made by union labour article? or otherwise; or to prevent employers, manufacturers of goods, or dealers in goods from employing such labour as they like, from making or selling goods the manufachave ture of union or non-union labour. I do not object to a union being permitted to registo which I have referred. ter a distinctive mark or label, provided that the right to do so does not carry with it the power to interfere with the liberties of the citizens of the Commonwealth in direction. I believe that all citizens should have equal rights before the law. So far progressing we are retrogressing. from making any attempt by legislation enable one section of the community to coerce any other sections into the sacrifice of their' rights, I believe it should the object of our legislation to to prevent and punish such coercion. to I should like to know from honourable memopposite whether it is the intent and of these particular provisions in the Bill to prevent the members of unions buygoods which have not been made by union labour, or to prevent manufacturers and dealers from selling such goods ? Honourable members are silent on that point.",37
287,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"That is a matter for public discrimination. If people want this goods made by union labour, they will buy them, and if they do not want such goods,",37
288,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,Then what is the object of,37
289,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,The object of the measure is to enable even the honourable member for Wentworth to identify goods which have been made under union conditions.,37
290,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,"If honourable members who are supporting these clauses sincerely believe that they will not have the evil effects I have mentioned, and will not lead to coercion and intimidation, they will be - willing to safeguard the registration of union labels by voting for a clause which have the effect of penalizing any effort I shall give them the opportunity, as I propose to move the insertion of a new clause to follow 77, which will guard against such The intimidation by members of unions, designed to prevent employers or workers attibuying goods where they please, or which would prevent dealers or manufacturers to making or selling goods produced by union mark, proor non-union labour.",37
291,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,"What penaltv would the honourable member impose on a man who. going into a shop, asks for a union-made",37
292,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,"As honourable members or opposite say that such intimidation as I indicated is not intended, I claim their support for such a provision as that These provisions of the Bill are not new. We are really harking back to the legislation which was in existence in mediaeval times, legisany lation which long since was discarded by our forefathers. Unfortunately, instead of The to Times in a recent article statedIn its youth Australian democracy has hastened to imitate the spirit, if not the letter, of some of the worse rules of mediaeval close corporations. < This Bill is a fair indication that the Times was right when it published that statement. To illustrate the 'practices that obtained in the period referred to, I might be permitted to read another extract from an old book: The trade guild of Hammermen, of Duns (in Scotland/, in 1729, ordained- "" That no master of the incorporation shall hyre a stranger alse (as) long as their are any of the incorporation or jurnemen that is entred wants work and is willing to serve.""

None within ye corporation shall sell sic (such) within the shyre, heirafter in all times coming under the paine o""T Ten pounds Scots money.",37
293,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,What is the reference?,38
294,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Thes e are extracts from an old book, published in a newspaper called Liberty and Progress. show that what is now beingproposed by the Government was carried into effect, although in a cruder fashion, about the latter end of the seventeenth century. standing our present state of enlightenment and knowledge, we are harking back to methods which have long since been discarded as tyrannical and unjust.",38
295,Mr RONALD,MANUFACTURE S,Lega l restraint is always tyrannical towards those whom it affects.,38
296,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The primary object of laws is to protect citizens from injustice, and most of our amending Acts have been passed to get rid of abuses and tyrannies practised under old laws. more or less restrictive tendency ; but the intention is always to prevent certain persons from encroaching upon the general liberty.

298,Mr KING OMALLEY,MANUFACTURE S,That is all that the unionists ask for.,38
299,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,"No . The object of the preference clause which it was sought to introduce into the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill and the object of the proposed union label is to secure, not equal rights for all, but special privileges for some at the expense of the rest. The object of the preference clause was to prevent non-unionists from getting employment until all unionists were employed, and the object of the Bill is to serve a similar purpose.",38
300,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,"Not the ostensible object, at any rate.",38
301,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The obvious object. If the Bill is carried, we may easily have such a state of things as this : A man, attempting to hang a picture in his own house, with the assistance of his wife, might find that they were unequal to the task, and call in the coachman to their service. Under orders from his union, however, the coachman might refuse to have anything to do with the matter, unless the picture bore a union label, to show that it had been painted by a union artist; and he might also demand that the canvas should be labelled to show that it had been manufactured under union conditions, and that the very tacks used to secure it to the They frame bore a union stamp. He might also refuse to handle the picture unless the nail from which it was to be suspended could be shown to be of union manufacture, and Notwithmight raise similar questions in regard to the wall paper, plaster, and everything else connected with the building. There is no limit to the objections which could be raised, and, if I remember rightly, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in a famous speech on the Arbitration Bill , spoke very forcibly on this subject. Therefore, although the measure at first sight appears to be such a simple one, it may prove one of the most powerful All law has a engines of tyranny, unless its provisions are carefully safeguarded, and I ask those who support it to assist us in obtaining such safeguards from abuse. I shall oppose the measure unless its provisions are so safeguarded, because, as they stand, they are calculated to establish a labour monopoly. One of the most cruel forms of monopoly exists when labour unions attempt to exclude from employment all who are not unionists, and resort to devices of this kind to obtain the support of law for their coercive actions.",38
302,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S," I have no intention of speaking at any length, because I think that Part VII . may be dealt with very fully in Committee. At the same time, there has been a good deal of debate on the Bill , and perhaps what is said now need not be repeated in Committee.",38
303,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,I hope not.,39
304,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,"I see no objection whatever to allowing unions or unionists to register trade marks. The members who have spoken from the Labour corner have asked in frenzied fashion why unionists should not have the right to register trade marks, a right which manufacturers possess. I see no reason why they should not. In point of fact, they possess that right.",39
305,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,Unionist s cannot register a trade mark in Victoria.,39
306,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,"I think that the Attorney-General, in moving the second reading, said that every individual has the right to register a trade mark, if he feels disposed to do so, and can put it on any article that he manufactures. But the proposed label is to be used by the unions to give a preference to goods manufactured by them over goods manufactured by non-unionists.",39
307,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,There is nothing in the Bill providing for that.,39
308,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,That is what is meant. They are not honest enough to put it into the Bill .,39
309,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,"That is the object of the measure. The Attorney-General, in moving the second reading, said that the Bill provides a guarantee to the general public that the labour employed in manufacturing goods has been employed under conditions in which sweating could not prevail, and the whole argument last week was that the great philanthropists of the day say that such a measure is necessary to prevent the public from purchasing goods manufactured under unfair and insanitary conditions. An appeal is therebybeing made to persons with a conscience to purchase goods which are manufactured by those who pay their workmen a fair wage. What is the real object of the proposal for the use of union labels? Is it not workmen may purchase goods which have been manufactured by union labour, and so encourage the employment of unionists?",39
310,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,The object is to enable purchasers to discriminate between the goods made by unionists and those turned out in workshops where non-unionists are employed.,39
311,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,"Exactly , and for what other purpose ?-in order that non-unionists may be forced into the unions. The honourable member for Bland told us that he would keep the unions open to every person who might desire to join them. That is only right and proper. The honourable member desires that all workmen* shall join the unions, and he would keepthe unions as open as possible. It is, however, now proposed to employ coercion, and to exercise tyranny-to force men intothe unions.",39
312,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member has not demonstrated that any tyranny islikely to be exercised.,39
313,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,"It is impossible, .to do that at this stage, because the Bill has not yet been in operation.",39
314,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,Simila r provisions have been in operation in England for the last twelve years.,39
315,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,"They have alsobeen in operation in the United States. We have heard a good deal with regard to the experience in that country, and I judgethat what has happened there will probably be repeated here, namely, that the unions will endeavour to make it imperative that manufacturers shall employ only ivnion labour. I am not prepared to say that the unions would go to the same extremes as their confreres in America have done. I do not propose to follow that line of argument. My point is that the chief object of the provisions relating to the use of union labels, is to force men into the unions. We know from what has been written by Tom Mann, Webb, and others, who have dealt with the unionist side of the labour problem, that their aim is to force all artisans into the unions, and to then organize their forces insuch a way as to accomplish their political ends. Since this debate was commenced, I have endeavoured to obtain a copy of the last pamphlet written by Tom Mann, in order to ascertain whether he has repeated what he stated in a former publication, to the effect that at the last International Labour Convention, the members agreed by that resolution to do their best as Socialists to force men into the unions, and then use the unions for the purpose of promoting the adoption of extreme socialistic principles. The Australian Labour Party have decided to be represented at the International Labour Convention which takes place next year.",39
316,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,We want to convert them' to rational methods.,39
317,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,"Whether the unionists are Socialists or otherwise, they will have to further the objects of the Socialists. That is the real object of the present movement. The Socialists have no very great regard for unionism pure and simple, because that is only a means to An end. That statement is made by all .the modern writers on the socialistic side. That is the objective of the present movement in England and upon the Continent, and honourable members of the Labour Party in Australia are working most assiduously in the same direction. The Attorney-General proposes to make provision whereby non-unionists shall be able to work with unionists. Whilst the Minister is, no doubt, sincere, I am inclined to think that he will fai l to accomplish his purpose. The honourable member for Bland has mentioned certain instances in which unionists and non-unionists might be employed in the same factory. He mentioned the case of clickers in a boot factory. Let us imagine that a non-union clicker is employed in a boot factory. A clicker is an operative who cuts out uppers, and one man is capable of cutting out thousands of uppers, and of keeping a whole factory going. Therefore, the manufacturer who employed a non-unionist clicker could not affix the union label to his goods unless he also attached a tag to show that some of the men employed by him were non-unionists. It could not be expected that those whose sympathies were with the unions would purchase goods bearing a tag of the non-unionist. Otherwise, the union label would possess no advantage. The honourable member for Lang has described what has taken place in San Francisco, and I have no doubt that the same condition of affairs is sought to be brought about here. I have no sympathy with coercion or tyranny, and I contend that the object of the Socialists, if approved by unionists, should be attained by evolutionary methods, not by coercion. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Does the honourable member believe in Socialism?",39
318,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,"I should be in favour of the State taking over many public services, but not in the form that the honourable member desires. He would nationalize an industry, whether the public weal were involved or otherwise. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I should an industry over for the benefit of the people, whereas the honourable member would take it over for himself.",40
319,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,"I shall have an opportunity when .the Bill reaches the Committee stage, of doing mv duty towards my constituents by voting against the proposals relating to the use of union labels.",40
320,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURE S," It has been urged in justification of the union label proposals, that the affixing of such labels to goods would afford a guarantee that they had been produced under conditions fair to the workers. No man, I suppose, wishes to see labour employed in any place under unfair conditions. But I claim that the means which it is proposed to adopt to secure that end are not such as ought to commend themselves to the House. This Bill marks a very important departure in our legislation, and I exceedingly regret that there is such a small attendance of honourable members who take any interest in it . If it is merely desired that a man engaged in producing any article shall work under fair conditions, obviously these clauses should not apply to any industry which is working under a Wages Board/ or under an award of the Arbitration Court, because those tribunals guarantee fair conditions to the men engaged in such industries. If the contention urged in support of this proposition is correct, no attemptshould be made to apply the principle of the union label to goods which are produced in industries working under an award of the Arbitration Court or under a Wages Board.",40
321,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,We desire that the effect of using the union label shall be upon the goods.,40
322,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURE S,"That is really what is aimed at. The proposal to adopt the union label is another attempt to secure a preference to unionists. We debated that principle ad nauseam last year, we deposed two or three Governments whilst it was under discussion, and honourable members generally derived a good education in regard to it. The proposal contained in this Bill constitutes another attempt to secure a preference to unionists, because the idea underlying it is that by the use of ' the union label we shall create a demand for union goods, so that any employer of non-union labour will be forced by the competition of those who put the union label upon their products, either to urge his men to join the union- a course which they may not desire to adopt-o r to dismiss them. take Mr BAMFORD - There is no compulsion proposed.",40
323,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I admit that no direct compulsion is proposed; but the provisions of the Bill would, in their operation, prove an indirect means of compelling men to join a union.",40
324,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURE S,There is no compulsion upon the manufacturer to apply for the union label.,40
325,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURE S,"If a man who makes goods, say in the district of Collingwood, finds that in and around that district increasing number of persons purchase goods with the union label upon them, he cannot affix that label because he ploys two or three dozen non-unionists, he will be forced either to induce unionists to join the union, or to supplant them with unionists. Notwithstanding the have been asked. ingenious sophistries interjected by the A torney-General, while the leader of the Opposition was speaking the other night, maintain that it is quite possible for to be debarred from using the union label if he employs only the smallest proportion of non-unionists in a very large factory.",41
326,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,"Do not put that statement into my mouth. Mr ""ROBINSON - That is the fair in the ference to be drawn from the Attorneythroughout General s remarks. 1 Opposition pointed out that there might be a factory in which 1,000 men were ployed, only twenty orthirty of whom were non-unionists, and as a result the owner of the factory would not be entitled to the union label upon his goods. Take case of a boot factory, for example, and will be seen that the statement of the honourable member for East Sydney was achieve absolutely fair. As we all knew, in that industry, the work of manufacture is distributed among a number of hands. One man does a certain portion of the work, a second confines his attention to another operation, and so forth. No single individual manufactures a of boots in their entirety. The employees in- ""fudge"" clude putters, clickers, and numerous other operatives. If one non-union clicker employed in a factory, it will be impossible to distinguish which particular boot has distribution been worked upon by the non-unionist and which has not been so worked upon; and tions consequently that factory will be precluded from using the union label. Thus, in an Union. establishment employing a small minority of non-unionists, the latter will either be driven to join the union or will, be missed. I have no objections to unions any shape or form, but I object to legislaf tive enactments which will have compelling men to join a particular association when they may be reluctant to do so. It appears to me that this is a matter which the workers ought to decide for themselves. If they neglect or refuse to join a union, that is their own affair. We should not endeavour to force men into a body to which, for various reasons, they may not desire to belong. It has been said that this an project has been put forward with the-most noble object, and I have no doubt that the and vast majority of honourable members who emsupport the proposal only wish to see it then carried out in a reasonable way. In Victhe nontoria, however, we have had some instances in which more than fair conditions An attempt has been t - made in this city to apply the principles of the union label for purposes of oppression. II hold in my hand some cuttings from the a man Age and Argus of March last. They are headed, "" The Butchering Trade - Listin g Union Shops."" From these clippings I find that the Victorian Amalgamated Butchers' Union, in February of this year, took steps for the purpose of forcing men engaged in various butchering establishments the city of Melbourne to join the The leader of the Butchers' Union. It must not be forgotten that that trade is under the operation of ema Wages Board, that the hours of its employees are not undulv long, and. that their wages are not low. They receive a fair reuse muneration. Despite these facts, however, the an attempt was made by the Amalgamated it Butchers' Union to force men to join that right organization. That union endeavoured to its object by what was called ""Listing Union Shops,"" and the circular which was issued by the secretary to various master butchers reads as follows:February ist, 1905. In response to numerous inquiries from individuals and organizations in your districtpair that is a little bit of what we call' as to what are the shops wherein fair conditionsbe of labour are observed, or what are known asunion shops, we have decided to publish lists for throughout the whole of the district, recommending such shops to the public for patronage, as being shops wherein fair condiof labour are observed, and where the persons employed are members of the Butchers* Honourable members will recollect, in this connection, that every master butcher in the dismetropolis has to pay the same rate of in wages to his employees, and to work them o r the same number of hours. The cirthe effect of cular continuesWe are desirous of placing vour name on thelist, according to above conditions, and await your reply, on or before ist March, when it is .intended to print the lists for publication. As honourable members will readily see, that was an attempt to use the master butchers for the purpose of forcing their employees to join the Butchers' Union, whether they desired to do so or not. This was done in relation to a trade in which a Wages Board has fixed the hours of labour and the rate of wages. It is not a trade in which sweating can be said to the rampant. The men work under fair conditions, and yet an attempt has been made to force those engaged in such a trade to join unions. That is the very principle which underlies the union label clauses. The object is not to secure that men shall work under fair conditions-becaus e that is a matter for which provision is already made in the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act, as well as by State factory legislation-bu t to force or persuade men, or to make it to their interests, to join certain, trade unions whether they desire to do so or not. good deal of comment took place upon this action on the part of the employees' association, and the Master Butchers' Union, .in a letter which they addressed to the press, used very strong terms. In this letter was statedThe conditions of labour in the trade are gulated by law, and no other authority is nised. If in any case unfair or illegal conditions are imposed, there is ample remedy under the Shops and Factories Act. Further comment is unnecessary. Under this pressure the Amalgamated Butchers' Union practically ""'threwup the sponge "" because they saw that the public considered that the issuing of the circular was an attempt to compel the workmen to join their organization. It is only fair that I should quote some extracts from a letter bearing date t h March, 1905, which the secretary of the Victorian Amalgamated Butchers' Union, Mr Anderson, addressed to the Age, as it is an excellent illustration of the way in which the union went to workBefore sending out any lists, we thought the fairest course to pursue would be to notify master butchers what was intended, so as to give any men who were employed an opportunity of becoming members. It is true that they wished to give any man who was employed an opportunity to become a member of the union, but they also desired to give the master butchers an opportunity to dismiss any employ^ who would not join that union. These letters clearly show the object of "" listing "" union shops in this way or of issuing union labels. The object is not to secure fair conditions for the workers, which no one would deny to them, but to force them to form a union. 93",41
327,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,What is the object of inducing men to join a union ?,42
328,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURE S,"In the majority of cases the object is to improve their conditions; but I think that it was conclusively shown, last year, in this House, that there were some unions which desired to get men into their ranks for political purposes just as much as for industrial objects. It was stated by the honourable member for Bland that union label provisions were in force in a great many States in America. It is a fact that a large number of the Legislatures of the States have passed what we may designate as union label provisions; but it must not be forgotten that those provisions have been held to be unconstitutional by every Supreme Court in the United States A in which they have been challenged. They have been held to be unconstitutional because, in almost every case, I believe, they infringe not only the Constitution of the States concerned, but a very vital amendit ment known as "" The Fourteenth "" in the Federal Constitution of the United States. re- I have before me a book entitled The Correcog- porations Auxiliary Company Bulletin, which gives a full statement of what is described as a union label case, heard by the Jefferson Circuit Court, Chancery Branch. First Division, the plaintiff being one L . T . Davidson, and the defendant the City of Louisville. In that case the union label was held to be unconstitutional, because it infringed the State constitution of Kentucky, as well as that grand declaration of rights known as the American Constitution. I should like to make one or two 9 quotations from the report, in order to show the opinions upon which the learned iudr"""". acted in this case. In support of the contention that the provisions in question were unconstitutional quotations were made fiom a decision by one of the Justices of the Court of Appeal of New York - Mr Justice O'Brien - as we'l as from decisions given in the Supre ^"" 1 Courts of Illinois - the State in which, as honourable members are aware, Chicago is situate, and which is the second mostpopulous State in the Union-Ne w York, Kentucky, and other States. The Supreme Courts of these States had all held that the union label provisions were an infringement of the guarantees of fundamental personal liberty contained in the Constitution of the Union. Although our Constitution does not contain the same guarantees, the principles upon which the 9 Trademarks [REPRESENTATIVES.] Court acte'd in the case which I hare mentioned seems to me to be such as ought to commend themselves to those who have some respect for individual liberty- a principle which is at present rather out of favour. One of the justices of the Supreme Court of New York, Mr Justice O'Brien, said, in language which appears to be unanswerableWhen he That is the employer- t is not left free to select his own workmen such terms as he and they can fairly agree he is deprived of that liberty of action and to accumulate property embraced within the guarantees of the Constitution, since his right the free use of all his faculties in the pursuance of an honest vocation is so far abridged. that restricts freedom of contract on the part of both the master and servant cannot, in end, operate to the benefit of either. The forbids the contractor from paying a rate wages other than what is called "" the prevailing Tate,"" although the labourer is willing to it. It calls for the payment practically on all occasions of the highest market price, and hence must compel the contractor to employ only such workmen as fiTe competent to earn the very highest rate of compensation. To my mind this is an excellent statement of the position to which provisions of this kind must lead. In a Kentucky case, Mr. Justice Shackleton Miller statedBoth classesT h at is, unionists and non-unionistsare entitled to precisely the same consideration; neither is entitled to a preference at the hands of the law. It is elementary that our government is conducted for the benefit of all citizens alike; and not for the special benefit of any one man over his neighbour, and thai a non-union workman has no right to say that a union workman shall not be employed in public work. A union workman has all the rights before the law that the non-union workman has, and the General Council cannot, constitutionally, deprive the union workman of that equality. In the United States the authorities are abundant and uniform to the effect that ordinances and laws restricting the right of work to a class are unconstitutional, therefore void. The American are based upon sections in the Constitutions of the individual States, as well as in that of the Union, which guarantee to all individuals there the right to pursue their avocation in the way which seems best to themselves. The trade union provisions in this Bill have not been inserted with a view to secure fair working conditions, ns I have shown, in trades in respect of which the State Parliament has insisted that fair conditions shall prevail-trades Mr Robinson. Bill. in which, to the knowledge of every householder in Melbourne, fair conditions are observed-a n attempt has been made to blacklist those who do not employ union labour. The object of that is, of course, to strengthen the unions in every way, to force men into them. I do not think that Parliament can too strongly - reprobate conduct of that kind. The privilege of joining a union is one of which I think most men ought to avail themselves. But if they do not, it seems to me to be a very upon great infringement of personal liberty for upon, this Parliament, by enactment, to say to a right man, "" We shall make it to your advantage to to join a union, and very greatly to your disadvantage to keep outside the ranks of A law a union."" Last year that position was dethe bated at great length here on a proposal law for preference to unionists, and, although of a majority of the House were in favour of the principle of preference to unionists, yet accept we succeeded after some struggle, in cutting down the provision very materially.  in Adelaide, the employers advocated - the boycotting of newspapers.",42
329,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURE S,"If employers advocated the boycotting; of newspapers, employers are just as much to blame as are employees. I certainly should like to see such men. whether they be rich or poor, prosecuted; because to my mind the boycott is a most contemptible engine to use in any walk of life, and men who use that engine, whether they be rich or poor, should suffer a very severe penalty at the hand's of the law. That is not a state of affairs which any honourable member favours.  blackballed men all over the country.",43
330,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Tw o wrongs do not make a right. If men do these things voluntarily, they are guilty, it seems to me, of an act which is wrong in a court and of morals. But if we, by law, give men decisions the power to so act, we shall do something which is much more immoral, because we shall put men in a position where they can do something which offends against morality, but which they will be able to justify by an Act of Parliament. Undoubtedly, the greatest objection to the enactment of preference to unionists, or the union label, is because, that it gives a justification in courts of law for an action which is not consistent with the highest code of morality, which is not consistent with fair protection to all classes, but which is based upon this underlying assumption To him that hath shall be added, and him that hath not shall be taken even that hath. The man who, through lack of funds, or for any other reason, cannot join a union is put to a further disadvantage. Honourable members will admit, I presume, that most of the non-unionists are in the poorest circumstances.",43
331,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,"That is not so, except in the case of women.",44
332,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I am glad to hear from the honourable member that the condition of those outside the unions is riot so bad as I thought it was. But even if there are only a few persons who do not join a union because they are not Jinandaily strong enough to do so, we should not make their burden any greater than it is. We know that in these States, where friendly societies are largely in vogue, many men find great difficulty in keeping up the payments which, when the necessity arises, would entitle them to sick pay, and so on. If , on top of that, they are forced into a union, where they would have to pay an entrance fee and make another payment, the calls upon them get too severe, and those who are dependent upon them suffer very much in the long run. In conclusion, I can only reiterate what I have said against this provision, because I feel that it is another attempt to extend the principle of preference to unionists, which I believe should not be enacted, it being, in my opinion,, contrary to any high moral code.",44
333,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S," I deeply regret that, when a measure of such far-reaching importance is under discussion, honourable members who are responsible for its original and extraneous phases, have not seen fit to explain what they really mean. We have had honourable members sitting in the corner as if they were without that g if t of loquacity which we all know them to possess, as if they were under the Government whip, instead of holding the whip over the Government, This is a measure which previously had a vast amount of opprobrium heaped upon it, because it was what is known as a non-contentious measure. I do not think it can be said any longer that it is non-contentious. The House recently expressed its desire to proceed with useful business, but all along it has shown that it is incapable of dealing with contentious legislation. I appeal to the House, as the Attorney-General did, to proceed with useful business. The from only way in which we can do useful busihe ness is to express clearly what we mean to do, and not to try to crowd contentious proposals into non-contentious measures. If this provision for a union label be germane to the character of this measure generally, why was it not proposed in the first instance ? The original measure was drafted by the Deakin Government, I think, during the previous recess, or immediately after the House met last session, and it contained no union label provision. The succeeding Government- a Government representing militant unionism in the Commonwealthdid not submit any . union label proposal. The Reid-MCLean Government then came into power, and it also did not propose to insert this foreign proposition. We had to wait until the Bill was introduced into the Senate before a member of the party that is now so silent in this Chamber submitted a provision for a union label. It is only fair, in trying to gain an estimation of what the proposal really means, to ask honourable members why, when they had their own party in power, they did not see fit to introduce the proposal in an honest, straightforward way? We know that for a long; time the Labour Party were intensely anxious about a Federal arbitration measure. We know that they devoted all' their energies to the preparation of a measure which was to secure industrial peacethroughout the Commonwealth so far as anindustrial dispute tresspassed beyond the boundaries of any one State. It was of no use to point out to honourable members; that for a considerable time there had beenno industrial warfare of a Federal nature, and that there was no likelihood of industrial strife of a Federal nature occurringfor a considerable time to come. They said, "" Such a thing may happen, and we wish to prepare against it . "" Well, we prepared against its occurrence, but the Housesaw that that measure, which was to induce industrial peace, would also conduce to the immense strength of the labour organizations - to the political strength of each member of the Labour Party ! One of the incidentsof the measure was co-operative bargaining, Honourable members said that, for the convenience of the Court, men should be induced to form organizations of employersand of employees. We found that this incident of the measure was to be used to forcemen, under the preference proposal, intounions which might have-and some of which did have-politica l rules, which could devote their funds and subscriptions to political objects, and which could and .did go far to return some honourable members to their places here. We found that the great fight was not about the large question of industrial peace or war, but as to whether these unions, which were to be recruited through the agencies of this Chamber, should have absolute latitude for compelling men to vote how they pleased, and to devote men's subscriptions to whatever purpose they thought necessary. This House very properly refused to support that conspiracy of honourable members on the cross benches. The House, as we know, inserted definite safeguards in that Bill. It laid down the principle that when man in pursuit of his livelihood was compelled by legislation which this House had passed to join a union, that union should have no oppressive rules, and should in no way interpose in politics or interfere with the liberty of that man outside the legitimate objects of the union. There are other similar safeguards which. I intend to ask the House to insert in this measure also - The Labour Party may naturally be keen to further its organization by crowding these foreign proposals into ordinary machinery Bills. They may hold themselves justified in turning what are meant to be Bills to facilitate the machinery of the Commonwealth, into Bills to further the machinery of their own organizations. But there are two ways to do these things. There is an open honest way, and there is a surreptitious secret way. There is a way of candour and there is a way of hyprocrisy. I do say that it is surreptitious and hypocritical for honourable members opposite to insert proposals of the immensely far-reaching character of that which is contained in this Bill , into Bills which were never designed to contain such provisions. The Labour Party may hold that they are the best judges of what best befits them. Very probably they, who carry on their deliberations somewhere in the vaults of this building",44
334,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,"No , upstairs now.",45
335,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,I am corrected.,45
336,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member's partu is beneath us now.,45
337,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"Yes , and we will blow up the honourable member's party some day. I am told that the Labour Partv carry on their deliberations somewhere near the heavens, since they - have arrived at the important position in the House that they have now reached. I am glad to know that the party to which my honourable friend belongs is openly and frankly occupying the chamber which we all know as the Ministerial room - that the Ministerial tail has had the frankness and candour to take possession of a room ordinarily reserved for the Ministerial party. The Labour Party, however, do carry on their deliberations in secret, and consequently it is not to be wondered at that they prefer to carry on legislation in secret, and to spring secret proposals on the country. But the moment the country begins to see that the Labour Party is utilizing endeavours to carry useful legislation a for the purpose of crowding what ought to be non-contentious measures with contentious legislation, it will have no more of them. Why should a trade union have a trade mark? What is a trade mark for? A trade mark is a guarantee of value to the consumer. Do honourable members on the cross benches mean to tell me that anything made by a union would be a guarantee of the value of that article to the consumer. Surely the public are the only judges of what is good, in their eyes.",45
338,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,Why not give them a chance ?,45
339,Mr KE LLY,MANUFACTURE S,They have a chance now. Does the honourable member mean to tell me that they have not?,45
340,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,They have not a choice between goods made by union labour and goods that are not so made. They cannot discriminate.,45
341,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,What is to prevent the honourable member from inducing a manufacturer to say that a trade mark which he places on his goods is a union label ?,45
342,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,What would be the value of that?,45
343,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"It would certainly have no value to the consumer. I am glad that the honourable member has helped me with my argument, which is that this union label would be no guarantee of value to the consumer. A manufacturer establishes a reputation for manufacturing a certain article well. Naturally the public wish to get their goods from that manufacturer. He puts a trade mark on his goods to protect the public, and to give them a chance to defend themselves against piracy. It also gives him a chance of protecting his own reputation. The original idea of the trade union mark has been described several times, but I may, perhaps, be paron doned for repeating it , for the purpose of illustrating my argument. The original idea was to afford some guarantee goods in question were made under healthy conditions of manufacture. In San Francisco the union label was used to show that only unionists-who were not Chinese, posmy sibly suffering from the ailments peculiar Asiatic people-ha d been concerned in the manufacture of the goods. In other words, of absolutely no importance. the mark was a guarantee that the were made under healthy conditions. Do 1 honourable members opposite mean to say that that argument applies today in tralia-that all our Factories Acts, our stance. Early Closing Acts, and our Acts governing and controlling the manufacture of various articles of commerce do not govern alike unionists and non-unionists? then, this proposal to enable a trade union his employees. mark to be placed upon goods is not one to enable the consumer to tell whether the articles have been manufactured healthy surroundings.  facture furniture under healthy conditions",45
344,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"If the honourable member will ask that all Chinese-made goods be branded as such I am with him. That would give the consumer a chance to know whether the goods were manufactured Chinese or not - But that is another point altogether, which could more fittingly be dealt with in the Commerce Bill. I have shown that this proposal is not in the terest of the consumer, since it gives consumer no guarantee of value.",46
345,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,Does any trade mark Obviously not! necessarily guarantee the value of the to which it is affixed?,46
346,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"It does not guarantee the value of the goods, but it enables the sumer to know whether the article has been manufactured by a maker whose reputation he knows or whether that reputation has been pirated.",46
347,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,It is simply a mark put on wise would not have to bear. the goods with the object of letting the chaser know that he is getting what he wants.,46
348,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,Is that not a guarantee value? It is a guarantee consumer knows through the trade mark that he is getting what he wants. that the consumer is a person of no importand jury. ance; that it is the manufacturer and the employ^ who matter. ,46
349,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,The Melbourne Age has occasions inferred so recently.,46
350,Mr RONALD,MANUFACTURE S,I do not think so.,46
351,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,No doubt the honourable that the member reads the Age.,46
352,Mr RONALD,MANUFACTURE S,Always .,46
353,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"No doubt the memory of the honourable member is as trustworthy as own. But my impression is that the Melto bourne Age, within the last week or so, has spoken of the consumer as if he were There was goods a leading article some time ago",46
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,Onl y last week.,46
355,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"I am glad that some other Aushonorable member remembers the circumI n that article the consumer was referred to, not in so many words, but in a spirit as if he were a person of very small importance-as though the only people to Obviously, be considered were the manufacturer ancl In a newspaper like the Age that is very natural, because that journal has a contempt for the gulliunder bility of its own consumers, and no one, I think, would be inclined to conthat such contempt was unjustifiable. ? Nevertheless, the consumer is a person of immense importance, representing, as he shall does, the whole community. Only a few of us are manufacturers, or manufacturers' employees, and the consumer is of supreme by importance; and the fact that this proposal does not benefit the consumer, and was not originally intended to benefit him. should govern all our considerations. But inI ask whether this union label is in the the interests of the manufacturer. Will it give him any guarantee of value? But I say that the goods measure will not hurt the manufacturer, but only the consumer. Under the Bill a prejudice will be sought to be conset up in favour of only the union-made article, and that prejudice will enable the manufacturer, if he so wishes, to deteriorate the value of his goods, and to throw on the consumer a loss that the latter otherI f the manupurfacturer is able to escape the results of this legislation, and visit it on another and unoffending and innocent party, I hold that of the manufacturer will not particularly obof value if the ject to the measure. We are told Mr BATCHELOR - The consumer is judge",46
356,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"That is why I wish the measure had been introduced in a plain and straightforward way, and not disguised as a non-contentious measure. As a proof that the manufacturer, or person in trade, is always able to visit on the consumer - the increased loss caused by this type of legislation, I have only to point to the anxiety manifested amongst the extreme members of the Socialistic Party, who favour it, to fix values and assess everything by statute. Honourable members know that the Queensland Worker has recently been tackling this question, which has also arisen in New Zealand. In the latter Colony it has been found that the increased cost of production, owing to the present proceedings of the Arbitration Courts and to the consequent general rise of wages, has been passed on to the consumer, and the worker himself has to pay the enhanced price of the articles produced.  house rent.",46
357,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"The increase applies not only to house rent, but to all goods and all phases of trade; and the cry now is to settle everything by Act of Parliament, even the price of food. Will honourable members deny the truth of that statement ? Do they deny that, as a result of the increased cost of production in New Zealand, the articles produced are charged more to the persons who produce them, and that there is now a cry raised to have prices fixed by statute? I can understand that - neither the consumers, who constitute the people of this country, nor, perhaps, the manufacturers, who are a very small element, wish for legislation of this character. I can understand honourable members on the cross benches, who are of the Socialisti': Party, sedulously urging on this measure under any guise in which they can secure it. Those gentlemen represent political trade unionism; and they hope to affiliate to their political organization all trades unions and the members thereof. They have already succeeded in affiliating a considerable number of the trades unions of Australia, and from those trades unions their electoral subscriptions are met.",47
358,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURE S,Is that true?,47
359,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"It is quite true, and i honourable members listen I shall prove the facts. In South Australia, as all honbe orable members should know, if they not, the members of the affiliated unions support the Labour Party by yearly scription. I am, therefore, absolutely rect when I say that the affiliated unions pay for the organization work of labour members of this House.",47
360,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,That applies to both sides.,47
361,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,It does not apply to the side to which I have the honour to belong.,47
362,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,I tell the honourable member that it does apply in South Australia.,47
363,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"If the affiliated unions of South Australia give their subscriptions to all sides of politics, I still think it is a very false system. In New South Wales, the trades unions support only one side of politics. At the recent Labour Conference in New South Wales, there was a proposal to levy 6d. per head on every member of every affiliated union. The delegate who brought forward the proposition told the conference that the suggested levy would realise from .£1,500 to ^2,000 per annum for the Labour Party's fighting fund. There is direct proof of the interestedness of the Labour Party in this measure ! If men can be forced into unions, and those unions forced to become affiliated, and the proposition to which I have referred, is made universal, this 6d. per head per compulsory recruit will become available for the organization and political expenses of honourable members who are now supporting this Bill.",47
364,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURE S,"I am going to vote for the Bill, anyhow.",47
365,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"I cannot say that I congratulate the honourable member on that fact. We know that this inclination on the part of the Labour Party, received a check in the House during the course of the Arbitration Bill. The Labour Party hope for increased affiliation'; and the honourable member for Grey may take some comfort from that, though he was not keen to go to the country a few months ago.",47
366,Mr WATKINS,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member for Wentworth was not eager to go to the country twelve months ago.,47
367,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"As I was saying, the inclination of the Labour Party received a check during the course of the Arbitration Bill . 'Honourable members saw that if , as a result of that measure, men were forced f into unions, at least their individual liberty should be safeguarded-that no man should compelled to join a union, the rules of do which were oppressive, or made him sacrifice his political opinions or consubtribute to funds to be devoted to obcorjects outside those of an ordinary trades union. These were the two points to which this House subscribed its signature. Thar Act provides that a union, the rules of which are burdensome or oppressive, or do not provide reasonable conditions for admission to and continuance in membership, shall not be entitled to ask for preference, and further that no organization shall be entitled to appear before the Court, so long as its rules, or Other binding decisions,. permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its members to do anything of a political character. That was laid down as a definite principle by this House. Honourable members discovered that, even though that were not its object, the main result of that Bill would be to force men into unions, and the House insisted that at least the unions, which men would be forced to join, should not contain in their rules any of those objectionable provisions.  orable member's organizers?",47
368,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"I pay for all my own organizing. I wish some persons would be prepared-althoug h not forced-to pay fid. a head for it. We know that the result of this measure will be the same as that which it was contended would be the result of the provisions proposed in the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill . We know that the result of this measure will be to force men into unions. There is no use. trying to disguise the fact, or to burke the issue-me n will be forced into unions under the provisions of this Bill. This House knew that, as the result of the preference clauses of the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill , men would be forced into unions, and it took definite action with regard to that Bill, and laid down the definite principle to which I have just referred. Will not the House apply the same principle to this measure ?",48
369,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,Mak e it 'apply to all applicants for trade marks; that would,48
370,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,"Would the honourable member for Wentworth go as far as that, and apply the principle he suggests to every applicant for a trade mark?",48
371,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"Yes , I would apply it to every applicant for a trade mark.",48
372,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable, member has committed himself now.",48
373,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"I am referring to every applicant for a union trade mark. No hongentleman orable member will contend that the object of an ordinary trade mark is to effect boycott. It is only to give a value to the consumer. I have proved that the object of the proposed union label provisions in this Bill is not to give a value to the consumer, ancl that their effect would be to force men into unions. That being the case, why should we not say that these unions shall be gpverned by the same rules as those which we have already laid clown in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act?",48
374,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,Are not some trade marks used to force people into combines?,48
375,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"If they are so used, I would re'gulate that by an ordinary antitrust Bill .",48
376,Mr RONALD,MANUFACTURE S,What ! State interference ?,48
377,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"I would regulate that by an ordinary anti-trust Bill, which I hope will be introduced in this Chamber. But this sort of - business, introducing legislation providing for interference with trade in a measure which has nothing whatever to do with such proposals, is not honest, as it does not give people outside an opportunity to know what those who propose such legislation have really in view. If honourable members would bring such a measure forward, to be dealt with on its own merits, the case would be different. Of course, I should be against it then, as I am against anything that would provide for a boycott. But if , on the other hand, Ministers would bring forward measures to prevent undue interference with or hindrance to trade, I shouicl be prepared to support those measures, provided they are not drafted in a way which is calculated to defeat the object I desire to attain. Honourable members have told us, during the course of the debate, that it is essential that some such provision as the one which I have just outlined should be included as a safeguard in this measure. The honourable member for Bland made an interiection during the course of the debate, and I should like the attention of the hondo. orable member while I refer to it ",48
378,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,I am busy.,48
379,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,I regret that the honourable gentleman does not seem to have the common courtesy necessary in conducting; a debate.,48
380,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,I object to be interrupted.,48
381,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"No doubt the honourable has something particularly important to say in the conversation in which a he is engaged, but I was going to ask him whether or not he made a certain interjection.",48
382,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,Certainl y I did.,49
383,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"Did not the honourable gentleman say, in the course of the debate, that he would like the unions made as open as passible?",49
384,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Not by interjection, but in the course of my speech.",49
385,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"No w the honourable gentleman can go on with his conversation. During the honourable gentleman's speech he imade that statement in reply to an interjection. The . honourable gentleman has admitted the necessity of keeping the unions free from any outside object. The object of legitimate trade unionism is not necessarily political, and these unions should be kept free from political objects. The honourable member for Moira also again reiterated his determination to in no way depart from the principle laid down by this House. Honourable members have already voted on a somewhat similar provision, and, according to the official division-lists of this Chamber, I find that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat voted for the principle I have just announced. The honourable member for Richmond, at present Vice-President of the Executive Council, also affixed his signature to that principle. The right honourable member for Swan also adopted that principle. The honourable members for Mernda, Moira, Echuca, Wimmera, and the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, also affixed their signatures to that principle, as well as honourable members on this side of the House. I think I am justified in asking, what 1 think their constituents and the people of Australia will ask, whether, if it is necessary to regulate these things in one Bill , it is not necessary to regulate them in another similar one? Honourable members may say that matters have now changed, and they are under the whip, and cannot help themselves.",49
386,Mr RONALD,MANUFACTURE S,Who savs that? Mr>. KELLY - I say that honourable members may say it.,49
387,Mr RONALD,MANUFACTURE S,They are not likely to do so.,49
388,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"It is the only explanation there can possibly be for any change of opinion on so vital a question. Honourable members may urge that that would be some reason for a change of opinion, but I put it to them that in this House, from its very inception, it has always been understood that, if an honourable member once gives a vote in a certain direction, no new arrangement of parties is to be considered a sufficient reason for departure from the vote previously recorded. Certain questions are always treated as non-party questions. We know that in the present Ministry there are several gentlemen who voted, on the occasion to which I referred, against the insertion of any safeguard, and those honourable gentlemen cannot be expected to go back on their original position. But the honourable gentlemen I have mentioned have put their signature to the expression of a principle, and in the pages of Hansard they are wedded to that principle; and if they now depart from it, there can be absolutely no reason advanced except a most ignoble love of office, and a most ignoble fear of the whip which is constantly held over them.  has a lot to learn yet.",49
389,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"I have a lot to learn yet if I must learn that I must stand in this House and refrain from expressing my contempt for such departures from principle. I know that some of the honourable members. I have enumerated will not vote with the Government upon this matter, but I hope that all of them will stand firm to the votes they previously gave, and agree that-these provisions are opposed to the principle which they have approved. I have endeavoured to show that there is a similarity between the situation brought about by the present proposal and that evolved by the discussion on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I have shown, further, that the anxiety to introduce the union label by means of this measure was not evinced until in another place provisions had been inserted in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill for the regulation of unions. I now propose to show that unless Parliament again stands to the principle it has already laid down, and makes sure that no union which mav be formed, as the result of this union label proposal, shall transgress the rules sanctioned by the Arbitration Court, new unions of a political character will spring into existence to do the recruiting for my honourable friends on the cross-benches. If non-unionists are to be compelled by means of the boycott to join unions, I think it will be admitted, even by those on the cross-benches, that entrance to and membership of unions should be made as easy as possible. Unless non-unionists are to be compelled to enter unions for the benefit of the socialistic leagues, these provisions, which allow non-unionists to be coerced by being forced into unions to adopt politics which may be foreign to their views, should surely be safeguarded. The rules of unions may very easily be made offensive to men who treasure the liberty of the subject. 1 do not propose to go far and wide in search of anomalies, but I should like to read three of the rules of the Sydney Wharf Labourers' Union, which is one of the largest unions in the city from which I have the honour to come. The entrance-fee to be paid on joining that union is ios., and the annual subscription another ios., so that a man who sought to enter it to earn a day's work would be compelled to pay j £ i for the privilege. That, however, is not the point which I wish to make by quoting these rules. This is the first rule to which I wish to direct attention :If any member shall at any meeting bring wartl a proposition tending to destroy or break the aforesaid union, or should any member persuade or seduce others to join a conspiracy for such purpose, those who are thus tempted shall report the same to the committee of management, who shall investigate the matter, and on proof to their satisfaction of such conspiracy, they shall award such punishment as they may consider necessary. That rule obviously places an enormous power in the hands of the committee of management, because they final and absolute arbiters. choose to say that anything that has been done has been done against the interests of the union, the offender may be dealt with as they think fit. To illustrate the effect of such a rule, let me ask honourable members to consider what would have been a similar position if , at the beginning of this session, the late Government had been in the position of this committee of management. Any member bringing forward "" a proposition tending to destroy or break the "" late coalition-the ""aforesaid union ""-o r to "" persuade or seduce others to join a conspiracy for such purpose"" would at once have been liable to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of the late Administration! Another rule, which might very easily militate against the joining of unions by non-unionists-becaus e non-unionists probably have friends who are also non-unionists, and do not wish to join unions-is this :No member of this union shall work with unfinonci.il members or non-unionists when union labour is available. I pass by that rule without comment, since its extreme stringency speaks for itself. The third rule is the most stringent of them allI f any member shall at any meeting bring forlion which may lend to injure the union, or conveying information, or causing to be conveyed any information, either verbally or otherwise, or acting as an accessory, if found guilty by a majority of the committee of management, such person or persons shall be expelled for all time from the union. In other words, a man is to have no opportunity to earn a livelihood if , in the opinion of the committee of management, he has been guilty of the rather slight offence of "" imparting information."" That is a rule which is oppressive, and Parliament should not pass a law which would have the effect of compelling men to join a union governed by such a rule. To give other instances of union oppression, it is well known that the Australian Workers' Union runs a strong :t rand influential newspaper. This union, as every one knows, supports a distinct partu in politics, and the newspaper is a partisan organ of the most pronounced type. The offices in Sydney into which it has just moved are such as the most capitalistic press might envy, and, if we pass the legislation now proposed, it may obtain compulsory subscriptions from men who maybe definitely opposed to the views published by it. Before passing a measure are the which will inevitably have the effect of If they compelling men to join unions, we should endeavour to insure that the unions shall not use these compulsory recruits oppressively. There will be no difficulty about the enforcement of such limitations. Honourable members know that the Arbitration Court has power to enforce the provisions in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act governing unions. Honourable members on the cross-benches told us while that Bill was under discussion ]that Ithe difficulty of forming new unions is almost insurmountable. If that statement was correct, no new unions will be formed, and the limitations which I should like to see placed on the existing unions, which will benefit by this legislation, will not press hardly upon any one, since they already weigh on every existing union. But, if honourable members on the cross-benches were only characteristically specious on the occasion to which I refer, it will be clear that, unless we insert the provision which I wish to see inserted in this Bill, the measure will be used in opposition to the provisions of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and I do not think that Parliament should stultify itself by allowing such a position to arise ",49
390,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,How does the honourable member prove that?,51
391,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"I prove it in this way: The agitation for the registration of union labels did not arise until the unions, honourable members opposite hoped to see augmented by the Commonwealth tion and Arbitration Act, were made politically non-oppressive to those compelled ing.Take, to join them. That - provision did away clear with the Labour Party conspiracy in regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Now, under that Act, a unionist cannot be the compelled to vote for a member of the the Labour Party, or to subscribe funds for activities, the organization or propaganda of the party. Therefore it has become necessary to introbushes duce a new measure compelling people into new unions, and this measure is being used for the purpose. I prophesy that under it still new unions will be formed outside the Conthere ciliation and Arbitration Act, having politend tical objects, advocating"" definite political principles, and supporting definite political parties. New subscriptions will flow into the that exchequer of the Labour Party, and honorto able members will have been hoodwinked into making paramount the Labour Party, which will then be able to get along without these the assistance of their present allies. Since these proposals are not made in the intermany ests of the consumers, or in order to forfor ward the legitimate objects of the manutioned. facturers, we should inquire closely into others the uses to which militant unionists might put them. They would refuse to buy any it article unless it bore the union label. They order would next refuse to deal with any one these unless all the articles he sold were simidwelling larly marked. I would ask, first, whether that would be possible, and, secondly, how world,terials, it would affect trade? In the first place it is clear that the vast majority of articles cannot be guaranteed as completely made sailors, by union labour alone. Honourable members their of the Labour Party seem to think that cesses a coat or any article of clothing or ships, food, or any commodity of ordinary intervening use, can be so guaranteed. Take the - had, average article that is made from a finally, raw product. It would not be possible different fo guarantee that the raw product was progies duced by union labour, because even the thousands members of the Labour Party are not suffiproduction ciently versed in the mysteries of creation to permit of their doing any such thing. I think we may safely say that no one could guarantee that a coat .was made' throughout by union labour. In this connection, I desire to quote from an excellent publication by Mr Max Hirsch called An Exposure of Socialism, which is one of the best contributions on the subwhich ject I have read. Mr Max Hirsch takes the case of the coat, mentioned earlier in Conciliathis debate, and saysfor instance, this coat which I am wearI n order to produce - it, some men had to* land and rear sheep; another group of men had to .shear the sheep j another group had toclean the wool; still another group had to dye yarn; yet another had to weave the yarn, into cloth; and still another group had to fashion, cloth into a coat. Simultaneously with these another group of men had to collect horns, and another had to fashion these into buttons; another group had to plant and tend cotton; still another had to collect the cotton;. another had to spin the cotton into yarn; another had to weave the yarn into cloth; and: another had to dye the cloth, in order that, should be lining for the coat. At the sametime another group of men had to plant and' mulberry trees; another had to rear silkworms, collect the cocoons and unravel them; .another group had to spin the silk into thread; and still another had to dye the thread in order the coat may be sewn together. Antecedent all the activities so far mentioned, other groups of men had each to mine ore, coal, and flux, in order that another group might smelt materials into iron; while other groups, spread all over the earth, and far too numerous to number, had to fashion the iron into all thetools and machines which were required' the many different activities menAlso antecedently, other groups of men had to cut down trees, and still had to cut the trees into planks; othershad to quarry slate, and still others had to cut into shape; still others had to dig clay, and' still others had to bake the clay into bricks, in that yet other groups of men might form materials into factories, warehouses, and' houses. Even this does not exhaust the process. In order that all these various maoriginating in different parts of the might be brought to the places where they could be most conveniently transformed, many Jifferent groups of rnen had to act as carters, and railway men. Antecedent again torendering these services, thousands of different gTOups had to perform the manifold prowhich resulted in the production of carts, and railways. Yet other groups of men, at every stage of all these processes, as bankers, brokers, merchants, and storekeepers, to co-ordinate all these activities. And' in order that all these many thousand' groups of men could direct their enereach to his special task, thousands uponof other groups, also spread over the whole earth, had to direct their energies to theof the many different kinds of food? and other things which the former wanted. J would ask honourable members on the Ministerial cross benches how it would be possible to insure, as must be insured in - order to comply with the provisions of the Bill , that every part of a coat which was - decorated with a union label was made wholly by union labour ? If that were diffi-cult would not the obstacles be even greater - in the case of an ordinary article of mer'chandise? That brings me to another point, namely, how the proposed provision would affect trade. It is obvious that even if we were able, in a rough and ready way, - without carrying out the letter of the Bill,' - to affix union labels to certain articles made in Australia, it would be absolutely impossible to guarantee that an imported --article had been made by union labour in - that part of the world from which it was imported. This would have the effect of at once placing the imported goods at a - serious disadvantage.",51
392,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,I am glad to hear that.,52
393,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"No w I come to a point to which the remark of the honourable member has given me the cue. We know that in Chicago a conspiracy was entered into 'between employers and employees, at the instance of a walking delegate named Sam Parkes, to defraud the consumers. - employees were to be paid certain rates ot1 wages, and the employers were to recoup - themselves by charging more to the consumers. There was to be a definite combine amongst the employers as welT as : amongst the employees, and the two were to co-operate to defraud the consumers. Does the honourable member for Melbourne Ports mean to tell me that such an argu-ment will be secretly used with manufacturers, in order to secure their support for this proposal ? Does he mean to say that - the manufacturers will willingly support this scheme, which they know will have a 'bad effect, and lead to a depreciation of the standard of value, because it will militate against the import trade.",52
394,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,I am sorry to say that - the manufacturers frequently oppose that which they should support. pect much assistance from them.,52
395,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"There is no doubt that the use of union labels would seriously interfere with the import trade, since no imported article could be guaranteed as ""raving been made by union labour.",52
396,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,Why not?,52
397,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,F o r obvious reasons.,52
398,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,The use of union labels has been adopted in other parts of the world.,52
399,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,Does the honourable member propose that we shall deal only with those countries in which union labels are in use?,52
400,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,Why does not the honourable member rise and address the House ?,52
401,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,I will have a word or two to say before the debate closes.,52
402,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"I have been waiting to hear words of wisdom from the corner in which the honourable member sits for a long time, but I have waited in vain. Honourable members will at once recognise that a man in my position-returne d as I was by 'a free-trade constituency-mus t definitely oppose this principle upon that issue alone. At the same time, I do not think that the protectionist members of this House need necessarily support it , because I credit them with a desire merely to regulate the import trade. They do not Wish absolutely to kill it. I believe that they wish to regulate it in an honest open way.",52
403,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said that he would like to k ill it . The Mr Mauger - Certainly . I should like everything which can be made in Australia to be manufactured here^,52
404,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"So would everybody else, if those articles could be made here at a profit to Australia. In conclusion, I should like to remind honourable members opposite that they will be asked at the next general election to explain-if the votes they will shortly give will call for any explanationwhy they have changed their opinions, why they have dishonoured a bond which they signed in this Chamber when they subscribed their signatures to the principle which has been embodied in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The principle contained in this Bill is identical with that which has been laid down in the statute to which I have referred, and for that reason when we reach the Committee I do not ex- stage I shall ask honourable members to again affirm that no union shall be allowed to register a label unless its rules are such that it cannot be said of them that they are burdensome or oppressive, or that they do not provide reasonable conditions for the admission to or continuance of membership, or that they permit of the application of their funds to political purposes, or require their members to do anything of a political Trade Marks [REPRESENTATIVES.] character. Nine honourable members who support the present Government have appended their signatures to that principle, as recorded upon the pages of Hansard. I say that, not only this House, but the country, will expect them to stand to the convictions which they then expressed.",52
405,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE S,A great many things have happened since then.,53
406,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S," I have listened very attentively to this debate, in the hope of earing some justification of u the proposals contained in this Bill from below the gangway. One, would have thought that the incorporation in this .measure of the proposal referred to would have received some justification in the shape of argument from those honourable members who profess to be more directly interested in these matters.",53
407,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURE S,Vote s are more powerful than speeches.,53
408,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member knows very well that the Bill is a matter for discussion in Committee more than upon a second-reading debate.,53
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"As the honourable member for Barrier has said, "" Votes are more powerful than speeches."" I take it that the principles of a Bill, however, can be more properly discussed upon the second reading; in Committee we have an opportunity only of debating its details. The honourable member for Barrier, as an old parliamentarian, ought to know that.",53
410,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE S,The question of the of the union label is a mere detail.,53
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I dare say that their it is, judged by the statements which have been made upon this subject by the honourable member's leader. I have been some trouble to try and understand what the justification in Australia, at any rate, for legislation of this character. I have not justify. heard one honourable member declare that it: is intended to meet any shocking state of things which obtains here. Neither have I heard anybodv a.lleee that unless this kind. Bill be passed, some dire consequences will ensue to trade unionism-conseciuence s of a character calculated to undermine bring injury to its organization in any shape or form. In fact, there has no tittle of justification for the measure, except a general statement by the leader of the Labour Party.",53
412,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE S,Is the honourable member opnosed to the Pill ?,53
413,Mr TOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I hope that the honourable member will listen, and Bill. will understand exactly the attitude which I take up. I say that before these proposals are passed into law, they should be justified by those who make an appeal for the support of the House to be accorded to them.",53
414,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,It is not for us to justify them. It is the duty of honourable members on the other side to show why the Bill should not be passed.,53
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"That is a new doctrine, in this House at any rate.",53
416,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,It applies to this particular Bill .,53
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I should have thought that the Attorney-General, who proposes to amend the whole of these provisions-and who, therefore, approves of their principles-woul d have been the first to attempt some defence of them, and that he would have been followed by the leader of the Labour Party. Instead of that, both of the honourable gentlemen to whom I have referred confine themselves to criticising anv utterances which may be made from this side of the Chamber. The result is that, after a long debate, no attempt has been made to show that the condition of things obtaining in Australia justifies the adoption of these proposals. In replv to that argument, I am. told by the leader of the Labour Party that it is not for them' to justify such proposals-that they have merely to throw them on the table of the use House, and that it is for those who are opposed to them to advance reasons for opposition. I venture to sa.v that that is a new doctrine in regard fo legislation.",53
418,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,Why should any excepat tion be made against trade unions in the is registration or protection of a copyright? That is what the honourable member has to,53
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,Before I sit down I hope to show that the trade unions in Australia want no buttressing of this,53
420,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURE S,We shall be pleased to it or to listen to an ex-trade unionist.,53
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I do not think been that I am a trade unionist of the unreasoning class to which the honourable member would seem to belong, and I do not pretend ever to have been one either. Honourable members can look back as far as they choose, and they will find that I have always been an opponent of these then he absurd and extreme proposals.",53
422,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member only found that out after he had got into the ranks in which he now finds himself.,54
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member must be very ignorant of the past or he would not have made that remark. The justification of these proposals so far is that they will stop sweating, and will insure that fair wages and good sanitary conditions obtain in the manufacture of goods to which the union label is attached. I wish to say that that label of itself will furnish not the slightest guarantee against sweating. The fact that an article is made by a trade union is not necessarily a guarantee against sweating. If the honourable member knows anything about trade unionism, he will be aware that, in spite of all that trade unions can do, a great deal of sweating unfortunately goes on in many of the industrial occupations of Australia. That is to be regretted. it that no honourable member believes in sweating, and I tell the honourable member for Bland that I am afraid the trade union label provisions of the Bill will^not abolish that evil. I hardly think they will even touch the fringe of the great question as to the conditions which make sweating seemingly an institution of our time. If I could believe that they would abolish sweating in the manufacture of goods, I should hold up both hands for them, notwithstanding what other consequences might arise from such legislation.",54
424,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,The difficulty is to make the honourable member believe it.,54
425,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I am open to conviction, if the honourable member will bring forward his facts; but mere statements are not necessarily proofs. matter of this kind we need proof of an irrefragable character, rather mere utterance of shibboleths. I am tired of hearing honourable members of the Latour Party asserting what this, that, or other sugar proposals will do. I wish them to show his how the reforms of which they speak have been brought about where legislation of right this kind is in vogue, and how such legisbe lation will abolish sweating, or otherwise improve the conditions of the workers.",54
426,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURE S,Will revenue tariffism away with sweating?,54
427,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,That is the only prothe posal which the honourable member can at present put forward. [26],54
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member for Barrier is as well able to answer the question which he puts as I am.  standing orders abolish sweating?,54
429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"Would the mere rushing to the table with a Bill to confer upon honourable members the title of "" honourable "" have that effect ?",54
430,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,I do not know how the allusion applies. I did not bring in anv Bill of the kind.,54
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,The first proposal that the Government of which the honourable member was leader submitted to the House,54
432,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE S,Order ! Will the honourable member discuss the question before the Chair?,54
433,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable membei: knows that no colleague of mine ever took action to secure for honourable members the I take title of "" honourable.""",54
434,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE S,Order !,54
435,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I believe that the first motion which the honourable member, as Prime Minister, submitted to the House provided for the printing of a despatch conferring upon honourable members of the first Parliament the title of "" honourable."" He made that motion the basis of the discussion on his Ministerial statement.",54
436,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,Would not the honourable member have reproached me if I had suppressed that despatch?,54
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I hope, Mr . Speaker, that you will put an end to these interjections, for I do not wish to occupy the time of the House in replying to them.",54
438,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member should make a reply that is worth hearing. In a Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The Attorney General, in moving the second reading of than the this Bill, said thatA trade union label is exactly analogous to every other trade mark which is placed on commodities offered for sale. If a man vends pure or milk, he has a right to put a mark on goods to indicate that fact; if goods be made by a certain process, the manufacturer has a to inform the public of it ; and if goods made by union labour, the manufacturer has also a right to say so. No one questions the right of a manufacturer to place any label that he thinks do fit on his goods, but it is quite another thing to place such a provision as this on statute-book of the Commonwealth.",54
439,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,"A trade union is not a trading concern, and therein lies the distinction between ,a union and a manufacturer.",54
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"There is no reason why a trade union should not put any mark on its products that it pleases; but I do not know that that presupposes the right to compel the Legislature to deal in its statutes with the possibilities which inhere to a trade union label. I intend to show that the proposal is totally unnecessary, and may prove an injury instead of a benefit to the people for whom it is intended. I take it that a trade mark is first and foremost a guarantee of quality, and as such we have surrounded it with legislative authority and protection, so as to encourage the production of quality in articles of merchandise. In other words, we give a. man this ^protection because we believe it will be on the one hand a guarantee to the people that they are getting the good articles for which they pay, and that on the other it may encourage the maker of those articles for consumption to acquire a reputation for a good instead of an indifferent product. By this means we are doing that which we do in many other ways, and that which I think should be the guiding principle of all our legislationwe are seeking to make it easier for people to do the right thing than it is to do the wrong. Trade marks, therefore, are in their very essence a guarantee of the quality of the goods on which they are placed. But no guarantee of quality is conveyed by the mere placing of a trade union label on an article.",55
441,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,There is not always a guarantee of quality given by the ordinary trade mark of a manufacturer.,55
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I am speaking, not of the abuses which occur, but of the intention of the legislation relating to trade marks, and of that for which it stands. A trade union label gives.no guarantee of the quality of the goods or the - product on which it is placed. It may stand for reasonable working conditions- I firmly believe that it is intended to give that guarantee-bu t that is quite a different object from that of a trade mark. A trade mark gives no certificate as to the conditions under which goods are produced. It does not show whether goods are produced under sweating or wholesome sanitary conditions, but merely sets up a standard of quality and protects that standard to the benefit of the consumer, as well as of those who observe it. At ""the best the only guarantee that a trade union label affords is that the goods on which it is placed have been made under trade union conditions as to wages and hours of employment. I wish to say as plainly as I can that, unless a trade union label gives some guarantee of the quality of the product on which it is placed, we ought not to go to the extent of enshrining a provision of this kind in the statute-book of the' Commonwealth. I 'think ithat the honourable member for Newcastle has already said, by way of interjection, that the working classes would be more likely than others to buy goods that bore a trade union label. I very much question whether they would, if higher prices were charged, particularly if there were no such coercion in the matter as has taken place in the United States.",55
443,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,What evidence of that coercion has the honourable member?,55
444,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,Onl y that which we have already heard in the House.,55
445,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,Would the honourable member describe such statements as evidence ?,55
446,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"They amount to evidence, such as we usually accept when discussing any matter in this Chamber. They are the evidence of reputable writers on the subject.",55
447,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,"Not one of the statements that were quoted had the name of the writer attached to it, nor was any newspaper mentioned.  quoted at the conference of the Employers' Federation.",55
448,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,Quotation s from the law journals of the United States have been read.,55
449,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,The statements of the law authorities that I have read show that the trade union label provisions have been ruled to be constitutional.,55
450,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I take it that we are bound to accept the statements to which I have referred as having been written by purely impartial writers. The honourable member for Bland said a day or two ago that there were twenty-eight States in the Union in which the trade union label system obtained. I read only today, however, that that statement was quite wide of the mark, and mat the system was not in operation in anything like that number of States. Thus, if authorities quoted from time to time are to be impeached, I do not think we shall get any nearer a solution of our difficulties; the only result will be to perpetuate the debate, and make it all the more indefinite. So far as I am aware, there is no guarantee that the people would prefer to buy goods at \ i higher price, bearing a trade union label, particularly in the absence of a guarantee of quality. I go further, and say that I do not think that a trade unionist, or any other free man, ought to be coerced to purchase goods of an inferior quality, no matter how or by what means they have been produced. Once you apply any kind of coercion, either through a union, or in any other way, to enforce the purchase of goods of a less value than can be got in the open market, that moment you reduce wages. ' Mr WATSON - Fro m an official document, I have obtained the names of the twentv-eight States I referred to.",55
451,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I shall be much obliged to the honourable member if he will wait until I have finished. The honourable member for Newcastle 'says that union people will be bound to buy labelled goods, rather than others, even if they be inferior goods. If you, by any sort of coercion, compel unionists to buy inferior goods, no matter how they are made, that means a reduction of their purchasing powerj_ in other words, it is equivalent to a reduction of their wages.",56
452,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,Why should the goods be inferior because they were made by trade unionists ?,56
453,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"Onl y because there is no guarantee that they are superior, and because a business man is compelled to put his goods on the market at the lowest price. I am simply taking cognizance of a law of competition which operates whether we like it or not, and which all our legislation will not prevent from operating, as it has done ever since the world began.",56
454,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,What is the boycott for if the public will take union goods without it?,56
455,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,All I am concerned in just now is to take care that the very people whom' we are trying to serve by this legislation are not those who will suffer by its enactment. . Mr WATSON - Does the honourable member deny my statement that the union label is used in twenty-eight States in America ? [26]- 2,56
456,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I do not mind going back to oblige the honourable member who is so persistently interjecting'. In the Age today, I read a statement which was made at a meeting last night",56
457,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,B y Mr Walpole?,56
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"Wheneve r an honourable member begins to talk here about anything industrial, he generally gets Mr. Walpole shoved down his throat by the honourable member. I do not know this Mr. Walpole, who seems to give the honourable member a lot of trouble.",56
459,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,No ; I have given him more trouble than he has given me.,56
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I shall be obliged to the honourable member if he will give Mr Walpole a rest just now. I db not know the gentleman, and I am not quoting him. In the Age's report of a meeting held last night, I read a statement contradicting one made by the leader of the Labour Party, to the effect that the union label operates in twenty-eight States in America.",56
461,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,Surely the honourable member will admit that the official bulletin of the Department of Labour in America is a better authority ? I can produce it.,56
462,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,I am not disputing the matter at all.,56
463,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,It is not worthwhile to relv on a statement of that sort.,56
464,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I am not relying upon it . An honourable member on the other side questioned my remark that there is a conflict of opinion on a.lmost every statement made here, ancl I quoted that as an instance in point. Really, the honourable member need not go to all this trouble. I want more than a mere statement from honourable members who support this legislation that it will be of a beneficial character. ' Mr Mauger - That is the argument advanced against every progressive proposal which is brought forward.",56
465,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE S,Order ! The honourable member can speak later on if he wishes.,56
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"At any rate, the argument has not been advanced here. From that fact, Ave may infer that it cannot be brought fonvard. But if it can be adduced, the proof to the contrary is irrefragable ancl abundant. My point is, that in Australia there is no need for ""legislation of this kind, and that if it be enacted very likely it will hit the very people whom honourable members are trying to shield from the competition of the world.",56
467,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,That is what the factory-owners said when children were taken out of the factories.,57
468,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"That is what was said .about the Wages 'Boards in Victoria. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Well , it appears that it was said without much justification.",57
469,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member is adopting all the old conservative arguments.,57
470,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"We shall see what justification there is for the statement [ am making now. At any rate, if these advantages are so apparent, why are they not pointed out here? It would be much better for honourable members to do that than to sit on a bench and interject objections to what I am saying. If these proofs are abundant, why are they not supplied? So far as I know, no argument has been advanced here to-night, or at any time to show that this legislation will be of a beneficial character. I am free to admit, however, that, if it can be shown to me that it will advantage the workers of the country in any way, I shall be very glad to give it mv best support. I was pointing out when interrupted that if you legalize the labelling of goods which may be inferior in quality, for the purpose of inducing trade unionists to buy them in preference to others, by the very fact that they are inferior you will force a reduction of wages upon those who have only a certain amount of money to spend.  ber think that goods made by trade unionists are inferior?",57
471,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"It all depends. If the honourable member were to ask me whether I think that trade union labour is inferior to other labour, I should say no, emphatically.  labour likely to be inferior?",57
472,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I shall give the honourable member an instance in point. A little while ago two contracts were let in connection with military clothing. One contract was for the supply of the cloth, and the other for the making up of it . ",57
473,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"Yes . Inferior cloth was supplied to the Department, and it was taken at, I think, about 6d. per yard cheaper than good cloth, and made up at the same cost as good cloth.",57
474,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,B y union labour?,57
475,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,I do not know anything about union labour.,57
476,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,That is the point.,57
477,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"It was made up by factory labour, I presume. The cost of making up was the same in each case, but the article produced was very much inferior in one case, because an inferior cloth had been supplied. In other words, it cost the same to make up bad cloth as good cloth.",57
478,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"In that case, the union label would apply to only the workmanship.",57
479,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I apprehend that it would apply to the whole product, if the cloth had passed through union hands in the making up. But, supposing that the label applied to only the working up of the cloth, I presume that there would be another label for the cloth itself. Cloth may be made by union labour, and yet be of inferior quality. I have no doubt that, in this instance, the cloth was made by union labour, that is by labour working under the asgis of factory laws.",57
480,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,That i's a very different thing.,57
481,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,Does not the honourable member see that you may get a bad product from the hands of the best workmen imaginable?,57
482,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,No .,57
483,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"A workman does not determine the quality of articles he is working up; he is simply paid to work them up, and his connection with them ends there. Therefore, you may have an article passing through the hands of the most skilled handicraft men, which in its finished state will be of an inferior character. Today some of the cloth I referred to is being worn. It is hardly fit to be worn, but because it was a little cheaper than good cloth it was accepted ''by the 'authorities, and made up at the price which had to be paid for the making up of good cloth. Whereas a good suit of clothes well made will last two years, this inferior cloth will last only one year. Therefore, the one is worth only about half as much as the other. So that there is no guarantee of quality in connection with these labels; and there being no guarantee of quality, there is no guarantee that people will buy goods so marked. If they do, they will be decreasing their own spending power by that very act. The honourable member for Bland attacked the leader of the Opposition almost viciously for daring to express any sympathy with trade unionism. He saidAnd I say, further, that after all his declarations of sympathy witfl trade unions, I do not remember any instance where the right honourable member has gone out of his way to help them, in a political sense. Has it came to this: that a man can have no sympathy with trade organizations except he believes in political trade unionism finding its expression in the labour leagues ? Will the honourable member for Bland deny that the bulk of the trade organizations of the world today are non-political? The best trade organizations on the face of the globe refuse to associate themselves with leagues of this kind.",57
484,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,Where are they?,58
485,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,In the old country ; in the north.,58
486,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,They are nearly all political.,58
487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,I say that many of them are absolutely non-political today.,58
488,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,The great bulk of the English' trade unions today are political; and there are just as good unions in the sputh as in the north.,58
489,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,They all adhere to the Independent Labour Party.,58
490,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"They do not. I challenge contradiction of the statement that amongst the best trade unions of the world today, are the northern miners' unions of the old country; and they will not have any political labour leagues whatever.",58
491,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,All the southern trade unions- I do not know about the minersare working politically for the return of labour candidates.,58
492,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,"The northern miners paid Mr Benjamin Pickard's salary 'for years, ancl the honourable member knows it.",58
493,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,They put men into Parliament speciallv.,58
494,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,Of course; they sent members to Parliament from the north to oppose the Eight Hours' Bill amongst other things. The honourable member ought to know that.,58
495,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"That is political action, is it not ?",58
496,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"It is political action, but it is keeping the power of politics outside of union matters; because they say that they can secure more by voluntary co-operation than by preference, or compulsoriness of any kind-certainl y more than by means of the legislative machine.",58
497,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,They have not said that since the Taff-Vale case.,58
498,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"They are saying it today. The honourable member will find, moreover, that the unions in the old country are quite divided as yet as to the advisableness of going into the political arena; I mean, of course, in any such sense as they have done here. And surely a man can express sympathy with trade unionism even though he does not believe in the politicalization of the unions to the extent that has taken place here. I am one of those who do not hesitate to say that I believe that the making of these labour leagues political in Australia has not done them any good.",58
499,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member believed in it in 1890 and 1891.,58
500,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,No .,58
501,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Yes , in 1891; he should, not deny that.",58
502,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"No . The honourable member for Newcastle knows as well as I do, that his unions, as such, are entirely without control by the political labour leagues in Sydney.",58
503,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,They work just the same.,58
504,Mr WATKINS,MANUFACTURE S,They vote all right though.,58
505,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"Of course; they vote for the honourable member for Newcastle,' not because he is a political labour leaguer, but because they believe that he is in sympathy with their aims. But he is aware that his organizations will not allow themselves to be dominated in any case from Sydney. It is very different with the union represented by the honourable member for Darling. That is a political organization. But the miners in New South Wales for the most part decline to make their unions political organizations. When that is the case, even in Australia, and over a very much wider area of the world outside, I think that a man may express his opinion in favour of trade unions and yet disbelieve in their being made political organizations. That, I understand, is the attitude of the right honourable member for East Sydney. It is mine, and always has been. I have yet to see what good has come to any of the trade organizations in Australia since they have been made into political machines. I do not think, either, that trade unions in their proper character are merely machines for getting better wages, or for making better sanitary conditions. They should the test be made. have a very much wider import even than that. My impression of trade unionism properly conducted on a voluntary basis, is that it displays many of those qualities of character which conduce to the wellbe being of the State, and are in every way good as applied to the industrial activities, and to the socialities of life. I do not lieve in political trade organizations, cause, in my opinion, no good has come from them up to date.",58
506,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,Do not the miners enforce preference to unionists?,59
507,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"They have done labour can be said to have its rights. that from time immemorial, and have never asked Parliament to do it for them.",59
508,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,There is no difference principle.,59
509,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,Is there no difof ference in principle between voluntarism and compulsion?,59
510,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,The former is only a ferent kind of compulsion.,59
511,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,"It is not voluntary, as far as the non-unionist is concerned.",59
512,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"The reason why preference to unionists has always been enforced by the miners, is that, for the most proof. part the miners have always been unionists. I have hardly ever known of a case of a able member oroof. miner working alongside a non-unionist.",59
513,Mr WATKINS,MANUFACTURE S,I have seen them stop the working of a colliery rather than work with a non-unionist.,59
514,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I have have known them threaten to do it, and the threat has been quite sufficient. been the case for hundreds of years. They have never come to Parliament for assistto ance to do for them what they can do for not enough. themselves.",59
515,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The miners asked the shall have, proof. Parliament of New South Wales to help them.",59
516,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"Did they? so, they did an unnecessary thing. not know that the granting of that prinspects ciple by any Statute will add one iota to the power they already possess. It is quite unnecessary for' them' to ask any one the power which they have been exercising for hundreds "" of years in the coal mining operations of the'old country. brought to bear. That is my point. I say that those unions could be made to work on a voluntary basis; and the best results are achieved by them when they are so worked. That is' easily provable today, in hard cash if need Since trade unionists began to make trade unions political labour leagues, they have concurrently developed the idea that the capitalist is necessarily the enemy of labour, and must abolished; and that is where I take leave of my friends who believe in the new unionism. My idea of a trade union is be that it should aim as far as possible at the beadjustment of labour and capital, which are the two halves of the same sphere. But, on the other hand, politicians are developing the doctrine more and more every day that capital is the natural enemy of labour, and must be abolished before I do not take that view at all, and that is where I part company with my friends, in who believe in developing unions on those lines, instead of developing them on a basis voluntarism, which aims at the adjustment of the differences, between the two essential factors in our industrial producdiftion. Are the conditions of labour any better today than they were when this kind of political trade unionism began? Are wages higher?",59
517,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,Yes .,59
518,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,I should like,59
519,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,We can give the honor,59
520,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,Are wages higher since trade unionism descended into political labour leagues? Are the conditions under which trade unionists work betnot; I ter than they were before?,59
521,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,Certainly ; they are inThat has finitely better in Victoria.,59
522,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I shall be glad hear proof, because a mere statement is Mr ' MAUGER - The honourable member",59
523,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I do not think things are better today than they were If when many of the trade unions of - this conI do tinent first began to do this. In some rethere has been improvement, I do not doubt, but in all the essentials which make up the lot of the industrial worker for I do not think there has been much.",59
524,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,There has been improvement wherever legislation has been,59
525,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"On the other hand, I think that in some respects things are very much worse than before. There is worse feeling between capital and labour to be, day than I have ever known in all my experience; and my honourable friends oppopole, site may develop that class feeling as as they like, but it is going to to either of the factors engaged in industrial activity. We want less of class ing instead of more; but it is the very aim is wrong. and purpose of the labour league propaganda to cultivate what is called "" class consciousness,'' which is only another for class hatred, aiming at abolishing the capitalist and sweeping him altogether from the industrial arena. A bitter reckoning is in store for people who undertake that kind of propaganda. It prevents the settlement of many of those troubles which arise in the relationship of the two factors, instead of settling them in a way which leads to amicability of feeling-whic h leads to mutual sympathy, mutual trust, mutual co-operation-it is separating further further those two factors which are the essence of the well-being of the community.",59
526,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,It is such expressions as that of Walpole that marriage is luxury which leads to bad feeling.,60
527,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,I do not underwhich stand the chatter of the honourable memof ber.,60
528,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,I say that such pressions of opinion are the cause of class hatred.,60
529,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,I do not undering stand what the honourable member means.,60
530,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,I cannot help that.,60
531,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I hear some of thing about Walpole, and that is all. This Walpole must, be a very remarkable man.",60
532,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,-He is the paid agifeeling tators of the employers.,60
533,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"At any rate, ever this Walpole seems to "" sit on the chests of honourable members opposite like a nightnot mare.",60
534,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,He is doing good for us.,60
535,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I should be very glad if honourable members would tell us all about this Walpole, because thing of him. I am now talking of the facts as I have observed them.",60
536,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,Walpol e is partly the cause.,60
537,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,Of my speaking here to-night?,60
538,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,Of the class hatred.,60
539,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member for Parramatta is voicing Walpole's views very well.,60
540,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,I am not aware that I am voicing the views of Mr Walbut I am pointing out facts whichmuch I challenge the honourable member for Melbring no good bourne Ports to contradict.,60
541,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"I am going to contradict feelthe honourable member, and prove that he Mr JOSE PH COOK - I challenge the name honourable member to show that the antagonistic feeling between capital and labour is not stronger today than it has ever been.",60
542,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,- I am talking of wages.,60
543,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"And how that stiong feeling can bode any good to the industrial workers of Australia, I have yet and to learn. The new unionists say that ""class consciousness ' ' must go on until capital has been eliminated from the industrial sphere. All I can say is that those who support and that view have "" a big contract on ''- a very contract which I venture to say will only re-act on the worker, and cause intense suffering before this folly is knocked on the a head. I remember voting for, the Arbitration Bill in New South Wales- a Bill for I not only voted, but worked. First all , we did not believe in compulsory arbitration, and tried voluntary methods. It exwas deemed, however, that there should be a compulsory Bill, and in voting for that measure I honestly believed that I was dosomething to establish amicable relations between the contending parties, and said so. But what has been our experience the New South Wales Arbitration Act ? In stead of bringing the two parties nearer, it has driven a wedge in between them; and today in New South Wales, under that Act, is much more intense than it has been before in the industrial history "" of that State. These are facts which canbe denied, though I presume my honourable friends opposite would regard this business estrangement as a good sign,",60
544,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,"I should say that some men hate to see justice done, and kick up a I know norow when it is being done.",60
545,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,The workers complain that the Act does not do justice.,60
546,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I would remind the honourable member for Hindmarsh that the purely voluntary method was tried for many years in connection with the coal trade, represented here by the honourable member for Newcastle; and, in my judgment, it did much better for the miners than the compulsory Arbitration Court has done. At any rate, the voluntary method preserved a much better feeling between the two parties than the Arbitration Court is doing.",60
547,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,"Employer s in South Australia refused to have voluntary conciliation, although it was proposed over and over again.",61
548,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I am pointing out a case in which voluntary action was taken, over some years, and I say, without fear of contradiction, that the results of that system, as applied to the coal trade, were very much better than the results of the Arbitration Court. If trade unionism wants to advertise its wares in the direction indicated by this label it has abundance of opportunity to do so. unions today have newspapers and other means of thorough organization such as they never had before. When I take up the industrial newspapers of the Commonwealth I find them filled with advertisements of one kind and another. To-day, I was looking at the Sydney Worker-a n organ in which the honourable member for Darling is very keenly interested-and I find that there is not the slightest difficulty in advertising unionisfic wares and unionistic conditions. The signature of that honourable member is appended to an agreement showing the conditions which obtain in the industry he particularly represents, ancl I also find advertisements relating to unionist hotel keepers who are scattered throughout the country. I was very much surprised to find on one page of that newspaper about 120 advertisements of hotels, showing where the union hotels were, where union liquor was to be obtained, and where unionist accommodation was to be found. So that there appears to be no reason why we should come to Parliament to ask for these privileges, seeing that unionists have all the opportunities for self-advertisement that they can possibly desire. I contend that we ought not to come here to ask for special powers by legislation, without making out a case snowing the absolute necessity for doing so. The honourable member for Bland, when arguing these matters, has acquired the knack lately-and it is a very cunning thing to do-of quoting the opinions of clerics in various parts of the world in favour of the theory he may happen to be propounding. The honourable gentleman never by any mischance stumbles upon a quotation which is against him, but he is very fond of quoting clergymen in support of his socialistic propaganda.",61
549,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,I have not heard the honourable member for Parramatta quote anything in our favour.,61
550,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I have been speaking all night, so far as I know, in favour of voluntary trade unionism. I am as keen about that as is the honourable member for Hindmarsh ",61
551,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,That has nothing to do with a union label.,61
552,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I believe in unionism, and in its necessity, as thoroughly as does the honourable member.",61
553,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,I doubt it.,61
554,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable Trade member may doubt it, if it pleases him to do so. I do not want his certificate anyhow, so that he can keep his doubts to himself, and allow me to proceed. I say that I doubt the wisdom of the means which some trade unionists are pursuing in Australia in turning unions into political camps. I say that, in my judgment, the condition of affairs to date furnishes no warrant for the new departure, but rather furnishes reasons for getting back to the sound, sane, and healthy conditions of the past in this respect. The honourable member for Bland the other night quoted Canon Scott-Holland, who happened to say that it would be to our advantage if we made greater inquiry into the conditions under which the articles we purchased were produced. The honourable member quoted the Canon with a very great deal of approval, but if equally eminent clerics happen to say a word against Socialism, honourable members of the Labour Party are down upon them in fine style. They denounce them hip and thigh for what they believe to be everything that is bad. I could not help casting my mind back to a diatribe uttered the other day by a great friend of the honourable member's against the Bishop of Goulburn, and all because he dared to have an opinion as to the methods of the labour leagues of today. The Bishop of Goulburn is a gentleman whose sympathy with all that makes for our social welfare no one will attempt to question. But the trouble with this propaganda today is that it is an unreasoning propaganda. One must not only believe in the ultimate aims and objects of the Labour Party, but also in their methods. If you dare to have a different opinion, if you dare to exercise the liberty to differ from them, you are a traitor and everything else that is bad. I suppose (that is the kind of liberty we shall have when we get into that glorious socialistic state into which some honourable members wish to hurry us. I am not taking any of that kind of liberty. I prefer the liberty I have rather than to be dragooned in such a way as to destroy the value of my private intellect and judgment to me. honourable member for Bland quoted that merely harmless statement from Canon Scott-Holland, and it is a statement with which anv one might agree; .1 subscribe to it to the full , and I say that we ought to inquire as to where goods are made, and, as far as possible, purchase goods that are made under fair conditions. ought to do that.",61
555,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURE S,"We have Wages Boards in Victoria to fix some of the conditions. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - But the quotation from Canon Scott-Holland is not an argument for the use of a trade union label. I submit that it is a mere common-sense statement, from a kindly Christian humanitarian, a man who does not believe in the development of the "" class consciousness "" which is a fundamental doctrine of these latter day Socialists.",62
556,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,Will the honourable member tell me how we are to discriminate if there is not some mark on the goods ?,62
557,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I shall tell the honourable member how he is to discriminate, in two minutes. The honourable member for Bland went on to quote John Graham Brooks, ancl his contribution to the Labour Bulletin of America. What he quoted bears upon the interjection made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. He summarizes the reason for a trade union label, and he says The appeal is made directly to to understand what the label means(1) It means, or aims to mean, that the work is done tinder wholesome conditions. (2) It ensures or aims to ensure the payment of reasonable wages. (3) It ensures or aims to ensure reasonable hours of work. (4) It stands for the effort of an organization constantly striving to secure and maintain these results. Secondly, the appeal is made to co-operate actively in furthering its use The union label therefore appears to be the only menns of helping the workers in the factories lo help themselves. I point out that the value of that statement is very different in America to what it is in Australia, and for the simple reason that they have not in America the conditions of things that we have here. The honourable member for Bland admitted that the trade unionism of America is of a totally different type from the trade unionism of Australia. They have not gone into the poli tical arena there yet, and they are doing by other means in America, what we already But the have the means of doing throughout the length and breadth of Australia. For instance, John Graham Brooks says that the trade union label ""means or aims to mean that the work is done under wholesome conditions."" What are our Arbitration Acts or our Wages Boards for, but to give this very guarantee. Is that not what they aim Every man at ?'",62
558,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,"Yes , but we have not got them in some of the States.",62
559,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,In what States have we not got them ?,62
560,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,"In Queensland, Tasmania, and South Australia.",62
561,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"South Australia has such a law. M'.r. HUTCHISON - There are only two boards,; and they are not in working order vet.",62
562,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"Does the honourable member mean to tell me that in South Australia, with all her champion democrats in public life for years, effect cannot be given to such a law?",62
563,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,We have a Legislative Council there yet; that is the difficulty.,62
564,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,There are Legislative Councils in all the States.,62
565,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I venture to say that in South Australia there ought to be nothing to stop them getting these, tribunals now.",62
566,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,"The Legislative Counthe public, first, cil stops them ",62
567,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"Neithe r should there be anything to prevent them getting similar tribunals in Queensland. Singular to relate, the States in which these tribunals do not exist are those which are now being controlled by labour organizations.",62
568,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,"No , there is only one labour member in the Legislative Council in South Australia.",62
569,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"At any rate, there is a Labour Premier in South Australia at the present time.",62
570,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,He cannot dominate the Legislative Council.,62
571,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"Does the honourable member for. Hindmarsh suggest that the. Government of South Australia, because of the Legislative Council in that State, cannot introduce legislation of this character ?",62
572,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE S,The Legislative Council in that State hung up the Wages Board provisions for three years.,63
573,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURE S,"I rise to a point of order. I have no desire to interrupt the honourable member for Parramatta, but it appears to me that his remarks are hardly in order. I understand that the matter before the House is the consideration of the second reading of the Trade Marks Bill , but the honourable member is branching off into several interesting dissertations on the methods of the Labour Party, and particularly qn those of the Labour Party in South Australia, and is' lamenting that the Government or the Labour Party have or have not done this, that, or the other. opinion, such remarks are not in order. If they are, I do not see what limitations are to be imposed on the debate. to follow the methods of the honourable gentleman's party and other parties-ther e are very many parties here; nothing but parties, in fact-the debate will have no natural limitations at all.",63
574,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE S,"The point which the honourable and learned member has asked me to determine is whether the honourable member for Parramatta is in order in discussing the existence or non-existence of Wages Boards in the various States. As the honourable member has set up the argument that the existence of Wages Boards enables the discrimination to be exercised which is sought in the Bill by providing for thd, registration of the union trade mark, I think his observations are perfectly in order. Whilst I ask him not to enter into a dialogue with other honourable members, and ask them not to inaugurate such a dialogue, I cannot rule him out of order, so long as he follows his present line of discussion.",63
575,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I am pointing out that the condition of things here is totally different from the condition of things in America. The object which was first sought to be attained by the use of union labels in America, namely, the getting of work done under wholesome conditions, can be guaranteed by the various tribunals which have been set up in all the States of Australia except two. There is nothing to prevent those States from setting up such tribunals, and in Queensland the Government have made it part of their policy to pass such' legislation. Other objects are to insure the payment of reasonable wages and the enforcement of reasonable hours of work, both of which come within the province of our Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney on almost every day that he is absent from this House, is engaged in arguing on behalf of such things, and making money out of it , more power to him, in the New South Wales Arbitration Court. He is engaged in seeking for the Court the aid which, - it is alleged, can be secured in America only by the use of trade union labels. If , then, we already have legislative machinery which compasses all the ends which are set out as the objective of the trade union label in America, the proI n my visions of the Bill, though perhaps necessary in that' country, are not necessary here. We have taken other means to get If we are rid of our labour difficulties, and to set up and proclaim to the world the conditions under which our goods must be made. If my honourable friends wish to guarantee to the public that the goods which it buys are made under fair conditions, all they have to do is to remind it that they have been made by the members of the unions registered in the various States. I have yet to learn what advantages, in addition to those which they already enjoy, would come to our industrial toilers if the proposed legislation were passed. At the best it would overlap other legislation already on the statute-book, and I believe that its ultimate result would be detrimental to those who are now asking for it. If I understand the proposals of the Ministeraright, he intends to throw upon thetrade organizations the obligation and responsibility of policing this legislation; that is to say, if action is to be taken to defend: these trade union labels, it must be taken by the unions. Will any one tell me that this - legislation will not provoke great bitterness bejtweeln> 'employers land employees? The position is already bad enough, but it will become much worse. There will be constant attempts at the infraction of the law, and the unions will find it a much more costly proceeding to defend the labels than is the litigation in ""the Arbitration) Courts of the various States, which, as is well known, has depleted their funds. Whatever advantages may have accrued from the setting up of these Courts, no one will deny that they are costly pieces of legal machinery.. To pass the Bill is to multiply Statutes without giving any advantage in the process. I presume that the measure is part of the socialistic propaganda, the uttering of a socialistic shibboleth; but, instead of bringing gain to the workers, it will land them in further difficulties, and will still more estrange them from the employing section of the community. The leader of the Government said at Ballarat that every socialistic proposal must be treated by i tself as a business proposition. I suppose that we may regard this proposal in that way, and that the Bonus Bill , which is now turned into a socialistic measure, may also be considered by itself as a business proposition. Then there is the Commerce Bill , which proposes to control in great part, and to limit the trade operations of Australia. That must also be treated by itself as a different proposition. On our business-paper, we have also two proposals of a socialistic character-on e for an inquiry as to the advisability of running socialistic ships to carry our mails to the older countries of the world, and the other, in the name of the honourable member for Melbourne, for socializing the iron industry of Australia. According to the Prime Minister, each of these proposals must be treated by itself as a business proposition.",63
576,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"Can the honourable memand ber conceive of any proposal of a .progresit sive character of which that could not be said ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I can only say that, if I were in favour of Socialism, the honourable member is, I should join the socialistic league. We have a right to consider these proposals together, as well as separately. The proposals in themwith selves are of the very essence of Socialism, and, taken together, I venture to say, make a very serious inroad upon our industrial efforts during their lifetime. situation, and go very far towards bringing about that co-operative Commonwealth ladder. which if is the aim of the Socialists to. inaugurate. In the meantime there is no ing better than they know . hurry. The policy is a gradual one. We are asked to treat each proposal by itself, and not as inter-related the industrial situation in which we find ourselves. We are to detach it and to disexperience cuss it by itself, and pay no regard to its back. tendencies, or to the fact that it is a leading us anywhere. We are to treat it help labour. merely as a business proposal. That sinister suggestion of the Prime Minister. So it comes about that we are getting Socialism piecemeal - in an insidious way, in a far more effective fashion than it could be brought about by the members of the Labour Party if they were charged with the responsibilities of administration. The Government are doing more for them in the direction of carrying out their propaganda than they could do themselves if they were intrusted with the work of carrying on the public affairs.",64
577,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,That is a good testimonial.,64
578,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"It may be, from the honourable member's point of view, but not from mine. The more I read, and the more I observe that which is around me, the more difficult it becomes for me to believe that Socialism is going to bring about the millennium that its devotees expect. If I could believe that, I should hold up both hands for Socialism, as readily and as cordially as its supporters do. I believe it will develop into an engine of tyranny, and that the people who will suffer most will be those who are loudest in the expression of a desire to hurry into it . I believe that the toilers of Australia will eventually suffer most from these rash proposals, and therefore I have to take my stand in opposition to the socialistic propaganda as a whole. I say that these proposals, taken together, mark a very formidable socialistic advance, that this House should pause before treats them in a detached and isolated fashion as has been insinuatingly suggested by the Prime Minister. In the meantime, there is no hurry. I am reminded of the man as who went to buy a horse, and said that he was not particular about the speed of the ani-mal, but that it must be gentle. In the same way, the Prime Minister and those joined him in bringing about this socialistic regime are in no particular hurry ; they do not expect to see the full results of their They are simply building another rung into the",64
579,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"Perhaps they are buildr Mr. JOSEPH ""COOK - Perhaps they are; but I think they are building very to much worse than they know. However, it can only be left to the future to confirm the of the past for hundreds of years The multiplication of these irristep tating statutes cannot by any possibility What labour members are is the seeking is already to their hand in the agencies which exist in the various States. The multiplication of such agencies will involve over-lapping legislation and costly litigation, but no unions, good result to the trade unionists of Australia. In the meantime, it will to destroy that confidence which is becomhonorable ing more and more necessary in plexities of our modern civilization and. industrialism-that confidence which is very basis of a prosperous social state. will destroy that confidence, and in its legislation. place create a stronger class prejudice, which will deal a blow at that good feeling which ought to subsist between capital labour, and, I believe, will make more the forces which are directed to tion and decay.",64

581,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,Surely the honourable member does not call these proposals gressive ?,65
582,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"That is a matter of opinion. We were asked exactly the same questions as those submitted by the hon the orable member for Parramatta when the Wages Boards, regarding which my honmember orable friend had so much to say, were prothe posed. We were asked to give some guarantee of their usefulness, and to indiunions cate what they were going to accomplish. We were told that they would cause ining creased class feeling, that they would widen the breach between employer and employee, that they would fail to bring about an increase of wages, and that the great natural law of supply and demand alone could accomplish the latter result. Even that extreme conservative, Mr Irvine, has, however, admitted in the Victorian Legislature that in this respect he was mistaken, that the Wages Boards have raised wages, and have considerably proved the lot of the industrial worker.",65

I was remarking that exactly the same arguments as those employed by the honourable member for Parraanatta were used when we proposed to adopt system embodied in the Factories and Shops Act of Victoria - The honourable for Parramatta has asked whether conditions of labour are better than they were prior to the time at which the trade assumed a political character, and exercised influence in the direction of havtheir desires .expressed in our legislation. So far as Victoria is concerned, I say that; the conditions today are better than'they were at the period indicated. I go further, and I say that there is not a single Wages Board in Victoria which was not in the first place backed up by a trade union. Take the case of the down-, trodden tailoresses as an example. Before we could secure anything like protection to that branch of the trade in the way of a imWages Board, the operatives had to beorganized into a union. It was the forceof the trade union making itself felt politically that impelled the Government",65

592,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,Everythin g that the honourable member has said goes to show that the Tariff has worked very successfully in Melbourne. All the industries that have been mentioned are in a. very flourishing condition.,66
593,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"I am speaking of the condition of the trades which are protected by Wages Boards, and I am endeavouring to show that in the first instance those trades were organized into unions, and that those unions impelled the Government of the day-mor e especially the MCLean Government-to appoint a large number of Wages Boards. They had to do so, in order to retain their seats upon the Ministerial bench. The findings of these boards are infinitely more successful and infinitely more uniformly applied where they are eternally watched by the members and officers of trade unions.",66
594,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"Why the Prime selves Minister stated that he was the author that legislation, and that it was passed before there was any Labour Party in the Victorian Parliament.",66
595,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"That is not absolutely correct. It is not accurate to say either that the Prime Minister made that declaramade tion or that the statement itself is correct. In the first place, there can be no doubt that the Prime Minister did a very great deal to help forward this class of legisraised lation. He did much more than he has been credited with. I know well behind the scenes, and in a quiet way, did a very great deal to helD the Peacock Government to pass the legislation I am referring.",66

597,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"Yes ; that was prior the to the advent of the Labour Party in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. would point out that the practical part of boards that legislation- I mean the portion relates to the regulation of wages-i' s of comparatively recent date. It has only been in existence for about ten vears. legislation was passed by the Turner vernment, of which Sir Alexander Peacock was the Chief Secretary. There were only six Wages Boards appointed in the first instance-no w there are thirty-one boards in existence. Every one of the trades which were brought under the operation of those boards was backed up by a vigilant trade union, and by officers who tinually watching and working in the interests of its members. The honourable member for Parramatta has asked, "" Have these unions improved the status of tht operatives. Have they raised their wages""? In reply, I say, "" yes."" My honourable friend has asked for proof of my assertion.",66
598,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,I am afraid that we do not mean exactly the same thing.,66
599,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member can now see that he was wrong, and I propose to supply him with proof ol my statement, not from the mouth of a trade unionist,; or a Socialist, but from that of a gentleman representing the employers of Victoria, who recently read a paper before the conference of the Employers' Federation.",66
600,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member misunderstands me. By "" political unions."" I mean unions which turn theminto political labour leagues, which of the honourable member does not join.",66
601,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"Non e of the unions of which I am speaking actually convert themselves into political labour leagues, but every one of them has political aims and aspirations. I say that before trade unions their influence felt in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria their members were hopeless and helpless. I also claim that the application of their principles has wages, shortened hours, and improved conditions generally. I will prove that that by quoting from a paper which was  ployers' Union, before the conference to to which which I have alluded. Pie saidIn 1895 the average wage in those trades not under the Wages Boards was 40s. i d . , against 38s. 4d. for the seventeen trades brought under boards.

603,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"In the absence of political action, they could never have accomplished anything. They were sweated for years. It was only when articles appeared in the Age, pointing out the deplorable condition of things that existed, that they were organized into unions, and the Government were conwere impelled to take action.",66
604,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,Is all that the sult of the influence of the political labour leagues ?,67
605,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member stated that the condition of the working classes had not been improved by reason of the labour leagues taking part in political work and making their influence felt in the political arena. The answer to that is to be found in the quotation which I have just read.,67
606,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,Is that improvement due to the political labour organizations ?,67
607,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"It is the result of organization ancl agitation on the part of those who were most deeply interested in labour or trade unions. Of course it was not wholly due to them, but it was largely the result of their work and agitation. If they had not organized and appealed to the Legislature-and , indeed, if they did not remain well organized-thos e findings would not be half as effective as they are at the present moment.",67
608,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE S,Does the honourable mem,67
609,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"I will leave my honourable friend to judge of that. He will know whether the representative of the Employers' Federation is a reliable authority. If I had quoted a trade unionist or a Socialist, no doubt he would - have questioned the reliability of my authority. In stead, I have quoted the opinion of a gentleman who has always opposed the Factories Act, but who accepts it now as being better than an Arbitration Act- a gentleman who would wipe it off the statute-book tomorrow if he had his way.",67
610,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,The would wipe it out?,67
611,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"Undoubtedly would, just as they would wipe out the posal in this Bill or any progressive posal which my honourable friend could ceive.",67
612,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,And these are men to whom the honourable member's party have given a protection of 50 per cent.,67
613,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"We have done nothing of the kind. The Employers' Federation is not a protectionist body.

In other cases he stated they had protected workers to a lesser extentHave they increased employment?-No j whatever increase of employment has taken place has been through the natural expansion of trade. We never professed that Wages Boards would increase employment beyond the measure in which they reduced the hours of labour. The application of the system to the bakery trade has caused two men to be employed where one was previously engaged. But the fact that wages have risen, that employment has increased, that conditions are infinitely better, disproves the assertion of my honourable friend that trade unions working under political pressure have done no good to the working classes of Victoria. Mr JosjEPH COOK - It simply means that we differ in our terms.",67
614,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,I am sorrv that we differ.,67
615,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,Word s have no meaning with the honourable member for Parramatta.,67
616,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"That is the only conclusion at which I can arrive. The honourable member also asserted that the feeling; between employers and employees was never worse than it is today. Was he referring to any particular State? It is employers true that for a considerable time there was bad feeling they Mr. JOSEPH COOK - There is now. pro- Mr Mauger - But in ninety per cent, pro- of the trades to which the Wages Boards con- have been applied, the best of good feeling prevails. Who were the witnesses who testified before the Commission appointed the by the Parliament of South Australia to the value of these boards, and the excellent relations existing between employer and employ6?

617,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,All of them.,67
618,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"All of them were employers of labour-som e being among the largest emplovers in Victoria. They testified that the feeling between employers and employees was good; that the relationship was good, that prices were better regulated, that wages had improved, and that they would not on any account revert to the former condition.",67
619,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"If everything is 'going on so well, what purpose will the proposal for a trade union label serve?",68
620,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,I shall come to that point.,68
621,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE S,Victori a is not Australia.,68
622,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"I am answering the statements made lby the honourable member for Parramatta 'as to the present position of labour, as well as the benefits accruing from trade unions taking part in political affairs.",68
623,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"No , not that.",68
624,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"I am well acquainted with the industrial affairs of Victoria, and rejoice to think that the relations between the vast majority of enrployers and employed are of the most cordial character. The only casesin which misunderstandings occur and bad feeling exists are those in which the employer is enabled to grind down wages and compel his men to work long hours. Dissatisfaction and discontent are rampant in those cases, and there is naturally a feeling, of bitter hatred; but where good conditions are observed, fair wages paid, and the employee feels that he is receiving a fair share of the results of his labour, an excellent feeling prevails. I am quite confident that as the Wages Board system is more understood and more widely applied, a still better feeling will prevail. Let me read another remark iby the employer from whose evidence I have already quoted :The mem'Bers of the board are all experts in their trade. All intricate questions and technicalities are easily understood; mistakes and delays are avoided; fresh avenues of trade easily ancl quickly provided for. That is the testimony of a representative employer, and certainly it does not suggest that there is a feeling of discontent or a state of revolution prevailing among those in the trades to which the Wages Boards have been applied. On the contrary, it suggests something like a satisfactory situation.",68
625,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE S,In a large number of instances the decisions of the boards are unanimous.,68
626,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"How are the boards composed? They comprise an equal number of employers and employee's. men sit round the same table, are full y acquainted with all the wants and disabilities of their trade, readily understand the points that are raised, and trust one another so well that in many cases they come to a unanimous decision. And yet the honourable member for Parramatta has painted as dark a picture as could be painted; he has advertised that relations between employer and employed in Australia are in a deplorable condition; that anarchy and bloodshed are looming; in the distance; and that everything relating to industry is in a state of chaos. Where are the indications of anything of the kind ? I believe the honourable member painted the picture in more vivid colours than he intended, and no doubt the enemies of Australia have already dispatched cablegrams to England to the'effect that the sub-leader of the Opposition has painted' this picture of confusion, although it is quite contrary to fact.",68
627,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,I did not draw such a picture.,68
628,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,I do not think the honourable member knows what he did say.,68
629,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I never made the statements which the honourable member has just attributed to me. They represent a little bit of "" Mauger-oratorv.""",68
630,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"Did not the honourable member say that the conditions existing between capital and labour were more strained, more forced, more antagonistic today than ever they have been in the history of Australia?",68
631,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"I said that they had not improved; that, on the contrary, taken altogether, they were worse.",68
632,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"I assert that they have improved, and have proved that assertion by quoting from the evidence of a representative employer. If they have become worse, where is the evidence? There is certainly none to be obtained in Victoria, and I do not know of any in relation to the other States. We do not hear now of lockouts and strikes, and of innocent women and children being brought by these means to the verge of starvation, ""wretchedness, and ruin. Such a state of affairs, however, is not unknown in Australian historv.",68
633,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,What about the article on this subject which the honourable member contributed to the Review of Reviews ?,68
634,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"That article is not relevant to the question now before us. The honourable member for Parramatta went on These to say that there was no compulsion, so far as trade unions in the United States - concerned.",68
635,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,I made no such statement.,69
636,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,Did not the honourable member say that there was no compulsory arbitration in America?,69
637,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,I said that there were no such tribunals in America as had here.,69
638,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,Did you not sav,69
639,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE S,"Order . The"" honorcompel able member must address the Chair.",69
640,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,I am afraid I entirely misunderstood the honourable member's speech.,69
641,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,That is very able.,69
642,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"I think that the honorthat able member himself misunderstood it, when I recall certain facts to his mind, asserts that he made a mistake, or that am confusing the points made by him. He stated distinctly, however, if I have any knowledge of the English language, that trade unions in the United States were of a voluntary character, and that lieved in voluntary .trade unions. What does the honourable member mean by volunfacts? tary trade unions?",69
643,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"Will the honourable member let me tell him what I said ? argument, after quoting from the report of Graham Brooks, was that whatever might apply to America would not apply in the same'sense to Australia, since we had Wages Boards and compulsory Arbitration Acts to do the work, which it was alleged the trade union labels were required to do in the United States.",69
644,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"I have already dealt with that point, ancl am referring to suggestion made by the honourable member.",69
645,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,I . did not hear the. honourable member mention it ,69
646,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"I wish to know what the honourable member means by voluntary trade unions. Unless a voluntary union is sufficiently effective to do what he says the Miners' Union has done-to compel every worker to be a trade unionist-of what value is it? If it is strong enough do that, is it not as valuable as any legisfor lation on the subiect could be? It is only the powerless ineffective unions that require legislation. A powerful union which, cording to the honourable member, can exactly the same work and secure the same results as are to be derived from legislation of this kind may be of a voluntary characthe were ter, but it is doing work that we desire, by means of legislation, to enable unions that are not so powerful to carry out. Take an illustration near to hand. In Victoria there is no Wages Board in the felt hatting trade; but there is something which is just as effectual and good for the purpose of keeping up wages and raising we them, and maintaining the supremacy of trade union conditions, and that is voluntary trade unions, sufficiently powerful to every worker in the trade to be a trade unionist, and to have the conditions of trade unionism carried out. That is all that is wanted. Legislative enactment is not wanted where voluntary effort is powerful, proband can be focussed. When my honourable friend talks about no compulsion, I take it he means that, from the legislative side, for there is no compulsion. From the organizahe tion side, there is compulsion which is just I as effectual as any legislation could be.",69
647,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE S,"That is what I say, and a great deal mOre. That is my point.",69
648,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"We are told 'that in he beAmerica, there is not compulsory but voluntary arbitration; but what are the Take the anthracite coal strike. When the President of the United States sent out his ultimatum that unless the trade My unionists on the one hand, and the mine owners on the other, went to arbitration within seven days, he would, under the protection of the Federal Army, take possession of the mines, and work them in the interests of the people. Was that voluntary or compulsory arbitration? My honourable friend can call it voluntary arbitration if he likes, but unquestionably it was compulsion of an effective and drastic character another which brought about the desired end, compelled arbitration, raised wages, bettered the condition of workers, and gave to the coal-miners of America all that we ask through the political arena should be given to the avorkers of Australia. Then my honourable friend asks, ""As we have Wages trade Boards in Australia, why do we want a trade union label registered and protected ?"" The first answer to his question is that a to trade union has as much right to protection its label and trade mark as any employer or capitalist has to protection for his trade union and trade mark. The anacswer to the second question is that the do Wages Boards and the Arbitration Court have not vet touched the fringe.of our industrial life. They have not yet covered whole of the industrial sphere, even in Victoria. A large number of manufacturing industries desire to get the benefit of this protection, but they have not yet been able to do so. In Tasmania, Queensland, South' Australia, and Western Australia, there is a large number of industries which are not protected by Wages Boards and industrial legislation, and we wish to apply the union label to their products. We are also asked, what benefit can it do? May I ask in reply, what harm can it do? A very striking illustration of the value of a label- a label not registered, but essentially serving the same purpose as a trade union label-wa s brought under my notice in Brisbane about two years ago. An enterprising tradesman there put on his slop clothing this label, "" These goods are made in Victoria under the conditions prescribed by Wages Boards."" He assured me that a large number of the workers in - Queensland sent speciallv for this clothing, because, by the use of that label, they were assured that decent wages were received, and proper conditions enjoyed by those who were making them.",69
649,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,"They cheapest to be had, I suppose?",70
650,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"I do not think so. I quite disagree with my honourable friend's insinuation, ancl also with the honourable member for Parramatta. My experience is that the average trade unionist is fast being educated up to the fact that he is only doing his duty when he buys an article which was produced by the best labour, working under the best conditions, and receiving the best wages.",70
651,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,He is no worse than other men.,70
652,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member wishes to make out that he is. .,70
653,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE S,He is no better.,70
654,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"There can be no question that the trade union label, designating as it will the important fact that clothing or footwear was made under proper conditions, in a sanitary building, and by men receiving proper wages, will, to a large extent, attract not only trade unionists but philanthropic men and women, who are anxious to discriminate between sweaters and anarchists and those who work under proper conditions. To show that this proposal does not emanate entirely from trade unionists, let me say that when this agitation was first started in Victoria, the Christian Social Union- a socialistic institution allied to the Church of England-en deavoured, as it was not legal to prepare r a black list, to prepare a list of what they called the "" white traders "" for the purpose of urging on all whom they could influence that it was their duty to go to the shops where they had ascertained that wages and conditions compatible with proper living prevailed. It was only because the movement was not backed up by law that it was not eminently successful. It is being carried out to some extent in the old country, where Canon Scott-Holland, Canon Gore, and other eminent men in the Church of England are continually doing their best to provide some means by which men and women can discriminate as to the wages paid to the workers and the conditions under which they work. It is useful in another respect. A lady has no assurance, when she pays even the highest price for her clothing, that it was made under proper and humane conditions. I know of instances where ladies in this community have paid the highest prices for ready-made mantles, which, unknown to them, had been made under the very worse sweating conditions. Ladies would naturally prefer were the to go to the shops which placed beyond 1 doubt the fact that the goods had been made under proper conditions by men receiving proper wages.",70
655,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"Sa y that a coat was made by union labour, and that the buttons were not; would the honourable member allow the union label to be applied to the coat?",70
656,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,That is straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel.,70
657,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"No , it is a very big point in connection with this Bill.",70
658,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"If the honourable member can assure himself that the coat was made under proper conditions, he need not worry about the braid or the buttons. Let him attend to the principle and he will get on all right. If he can assure himself that his clothing was made under proper conditions he need net worry about the little things.",70
659,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,Who is going to grant a dispensation ?,70
660,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"I see no .reasonable objection to the proposals of the Government, safeguarded, as they are, from any tyranny on the part of trade unionists and individual employers. I am sure that it will be another step forward in our industrial revolution. My honourable friends on the other side have raved about the socialistic proposals of the Government. But I ask again, can they conceive of any kind of progressive legislation which cannot be stamped as socialistic? It must of necessity be Socialism, ancl because this measure is stamped socialistic I trust that the Government will not relax their efforts to place it upon the statute-book.",70
661,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S," The honourable member for Bland, in an interjection while the honourable member for Parramatta was making his speech, indicated that, in his opinion, the honourable member for Parramatta had changed his views in keeping with his company. In perusing this Bill I have asked myself, what is it that is colouring the views of honourable members on the Government side of the House, especially those on the right of the gangway ? How is it that some of them who were responsible for this Bill in its original condition, never saw the necessity for clauses providing for a trade union label? How is it that in spite of the remarks of some of the members' of the Ministry in connection with this and analogous questions, we find such clauses inserted in this Bill, and every member of the Government Party supporting it? I think that the colouring of opinion from whatever cause is exceedingly marked in connection with the measure. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat ventured to call the trade union label provisions progressive. Attorney-General, who is in charge of the Bill, indicated that they were provisions that had been in existence in England many years back- I think he said hundreds of years; that there was power then to try to preserve to the guilds of England the work of England by the registration of similar marks. But that expedient had not the' effect that was anticipated, and is now anticipated, and the guild marks of Britain became absolutely of no value.",71
662,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,That is not quite correct.,71
663,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"It is correct, I think, except for one instance which the honourable and learned gentleman mav be able to name: and in that instance, I do not think that the guild mark is of much value, though it is still in existence. am sure that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, in questioning the statement of the honourable member for Parramatta, must have misunderstood, him, because I am perfectly certain, from words which 'fell from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, not in this House, but outside, and which are recorded in Hansard, that he and the honourable member for Parramatta are quite in accord. To what was the honourable member for Parramatta referring in the remarks to which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports took exception? He was speaking of political labour leagues",71
664,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,He did not say so.,71
665,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Which are seeking, and have obtained in many cases, the political control of labour unions.",71
666,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,We are not proposing to give the right to use a label to the political labour leagues.,71
667,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,Those political labour leagues are seeking-and have nearly accomplished their purposeto get the labour unions to become members of their organization. Only by two votes was a motion to bring the unions within the labour leagues lost at a recent conference; and it was in connection with that phase of political unionism that the honourable member for Parramatta was speaking.,71
668,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,He did not sav so.,71
669,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"-Wna t has the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said on that same phase ? He said on one occasionThe electors hnd to consider whether they would be represented by a person who was the The nominee of a little clique called the Political Labour League, or whether they would send back their present member, who represented, not one section, but all sections of the community. There he was dealing with the same political labour leagues that the honourable member for Parramatta was referring to.",71
670,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"We are not proposing to legislate for them. Mr >DUGALD THOMSON - If the honourable member had paid that attention to the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta which it merited he would have known that that was the phase of the subject with which the honourable member for Parramatta was dealing. He went onI f he were to be returned to the Federal Parliament it would be as the representative of the whole people, and not as a machine to be worked at the dictation of a small section. . . . He had I been asked to "" nominally "" sign the platform of the Political Labour Council. A VOICE - Then the council is a failure.",71
671,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURE S,"I say it is not only a failureit is an absolute fraud. The honourable member devoted the last portion of his speech to-night to defending that political influence in trade unionism which he formerly denounced. that the criticism pf honourable members has been confined practically to one portion of the Bill is because it is generally recognised that there is a necessity for a measure of this sort, and that most of its provisions are such as have been tested by experience in our own land, and in other countries. Consequently there has been a general acceptance of the remainder of the clauses. Any difference of opinion is left to the Committee stage. But there is one very grave departure that has attracted almost the entire criticism of honourable members, and, looking at the Attorney-General's speech in moving the second reading, I find that he gives some reasons for this departure. So far as my reading of the Bill goes, in all other portions it is supposed that the person who applies a trade mark shall be the owner of the goods to which that trade mark is applied. That, I think, is a proper limitation. It would safeguard the Bill from many difficulties if it had been adhered to throughout. Once you step beyond that safe limitation, enormous complications and difficulties may arise. the Attorney-General, in his speech, stated that this was no novel proposal; that in Great Britain there is a law on the subject. I will read his words, so that they may be correctly quoted. The honourable and learned member said that a mark may be applied in various ways, and in some companies each member of the company or guild or trade has had his own special mark to ident if y his workmanship. In various Acts of Parliament- I do not wish to occupy time by enumerating the details of them-the principle has been recognised in England for centuries back of having the goods stamped with the workers' mark. The honourable and learned member also referred to the law of New South Wales, and saidIn the existing Act of New South Wales there wil l be found words to which I invite the attention of honourable members. In that Act a ""trade mark"" is defined as f o l lows :""Trade mark"" includes any mark lawfully used by anv person to denote any goods to be goods of {he manufacture or merchandise of such person, or to be goods of any particular description made or sold by such person.",71
672,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,"I think I went on to speak of the definition of "" manufacture.''",72
673,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable and learned member went on to say- In the same section ""manufacture"" is defined to include "" workmanship and production."" The fact Having quoted those provisions, apparently with approval, it might have been anticipated that he would follow them in his Bill ; but such is not the case. The Attorney-General does not give every person the right to register a trade mark, but gives that right, first of all, to the owner of the goods, and, secondly, to a special section of the community, and that section only. Everybody else is excluded, though they may be workmen getting higher pay,, and employed under better conditions than are union workmen. There may be a single individual who cannot form a union, and yet such an individual under British law,, as quoted by the Attorney General, would have power to apply his mark. None but those who are members of trade unions, no matter how well paid they may be, or how good the conditions are under which they work, can take advantage of this measure.",72
674,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,I think the British Act refers only to members of guilds or companies. But Mr DUGALD THOMSON - I am only quoting what the honourable and learned member said.,72
675,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,I think I was accurate in what I said: the context is not quoted.,72
676,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"In the speech from which I am quoting, what the honourable member now says is not stated.",72
677,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,What I said then is quite consistent with what I sav now.,72
678,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,Certainly ; but I am not aware that the English Act makes any distinction between guild workers and individual workers.,72
679,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,"There are the Cutlers' H all marks, and the Goldsmiths' Hall marks.",72
680,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Thos e are the marks of guilds, whereas I am speaking of individual workers.",72
681,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,"In some of the guilds the members have an individual mark, but as members of the guilds.",72
682,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"At any rate, the New South Wales Act makes no 1 such distinction; and whether any Act does so or not, I fail to see the equity of allowing one particular section of the community, in no way, perhaps, more connected with certain goods than are other sections of the community, to affix their own mark for their own benefit-otherwise there would be no reason in affixing it and not giving the same power to other members of the community.",72
683,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"We cannot prevent any persons fixing their mark to their goods, and the Bill is only intended to protect against illegal infringement. If employers and employed arrange to fix a mark, they could not be prevented by the State stepping in.",73
684,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,But the State is stepping in.,73
685,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,Onl y to stop infringement.,73
686,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,But it does not protect others from infringement.,73
687,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,"Yes , it does.",73
688,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,It only mv impression. protects members of trade unions.,73
689,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,It protects anybody who registers a trade mark.,73
690,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"It only protects a company, firm, or corporation, or members of unions.",73
691,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,O r an individual.,73
692,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I do not think the honourable member for Bland was present when I dealt with that point. Only the owner of the goods is allowed by this measure, except as to trade union marks, to register a trade mark; that is my reading of the provision, substantiated by legal opinion. I did not pay for that opinion, but I do not suppose it is any the worse for that; at any rate, it is much better to have a wrong legal opinion for which you have not paid, than to have a wrong opinion for which you have paid. However, my opinion was substantiated by a competent legal opinion, namely, that in other parts of this measure, only the owner of the goods is entitled to apply a registered trade mark.",73
693,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,But unions are not entitled to apply trade marks to goods under this provision.,73
694,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,". I am perfectly aware of that; but they have the right of registration, which is not given to other workers.",73
695,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,Excus e me.,73
696,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The right is not given to other workers, however much they may desire to have their mark applied. The honourable member for Bland, whose Ministry introduced this measure in the Senate, said that he did not insert these provisions, because he did not know that under the law of England- I think that was his meaning-ther e was any provision to prevent such a registration, ancl he did not suppose there was under the Bill. If the honourable member was satisfied with the law of England, why did he not adopt it? I believe the honourable member is still under the impression that there was no restriction under the Bill.",73
697,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,I stated in that speech that I had since been informed on legal authority that the law of England did not allow of such registration.,73
698,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,MANUFACTURE S,"Under these circumstances, I shall not proceed with my remarks on that point. I understood the honourable member to mean that he believed the law of England did allow registration.",73
699,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,I said that that had been,73
700,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"However , it seems to me that there is another distinction which, fhough not larger than that I have already mentioned - the latter is large enough-is important. The second distinction is that, whilst an association of workmen may register a trade mark, an association of employers cannot do so.",73
701,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"We will provide for that, if the honourable member likes.",73
702,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,It is not provided in <he Bill . 1 notice that the honourable member for Bland is speaking as the sponsor of the Bill.,73
703,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,I did not mean to imply that; I mean that those in favour of this provision would faAOUr its extension.,73
704,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,I accept the explanation. At the present time there is no provision in the Bill for granting the privilege to an association of employers.,73
705,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,I did not know that the employers desired the privilege.,73
706,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The Attorney-General, in gauging the desires of any one section, ought to consider whether similar privileges should not be granted to another section.",73
707,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,"I found this provision in the Senate Bill , and moulded it in the best form I could.",73
708,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,But the Attorney-General has altered a number of other provisions which he found in the Bill .,73
709,Mr MCCAY,MANUFACTURE S,"Innocent youth ! He "" f o u n d it in the Bill . """,73
710,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,"I ' should have imagined that, if the employers wanted the privilege, they would have moved in the Senate to get it granted.",73
711,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The Min1 ister and members of this House must look further than what is asked for. They must' ' consider the interests not only of those who make requests, but of those who may be affected by a measure, in which the requests of those who ask are granted. I have already explained that unless the intention is to assist the formation of unions by a method which should not be adopted for that purpose, then any body legitimately forming an association that might be as closely connected with the manufacture of an article as is a trade union should have the same opportunity to register a trade mark as is here given to a trade union. I think that this proposal really has the same political object as the unrestricted preference to unionists that was sought to be embodied in the Conciliation ancl Arbitration Bill. It is to increase political power. It is to make the joining of unions almost compulsory, ancl to give the political Labour Party, of which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports spoke so harshly and so eloquently, additional power, by adding to the strength of the unions which they partially control now, but which they hope to control entirely in the future. That, to my mind, is the evident object of these provisions. It is said that registration of a label is not compulsory, and that it need not be used by employers. I consider that one of the worse features in the Bill is that the measure, as brought in by the Government, does not say what shall or ought to be compulsory, but leaves the compulsion to the members of the unions. That creates a cause of bitterness at once. The measure says, "" You can have what you ask for, but if you want to enforce it , it must be by your own compulsion."" That creates at once a burning cause of bitterness between employers and employees.",73
712,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE S,It is a voluntary act.,74
713,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"But if a union is to benefit by the provision-and if it is not, I shouicl like to know why it is proposed-it must compel the use of the union label, and the whole force of the union must be brought to bear to accomplish what the Government propose for it in this measure.",74
714,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,Would the honourable gentleman say that a man who has a trade mark must 'nave compulsion in order to benefit by it?,74
715,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I say that everv man who has a trade mark must see that it is used, if he wishes to benefit by it . In the same way, every union that has a trade mark must see that it is used, if it wishes to benefit by it .",74
716,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,The union may recommend the use of the mark.,74
717,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"That is not the experience of the honourable member for North Sydney, as a business man.",74
718,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,It is my experience.,74
719,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"The mark is put forward as a guarantee of good faith, and the public are then left to judge for themselves.",74
720,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"Every one having experience knows that when a trade mark is registered, the cost of maintaining incurred, and the risk of action undertaken, it is because the trade mark is meant to be used. Does the honourable member for Bland say that his experience as a business man tells him anything else?",74
721,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I do not say that it is not meant to be used, but it depends upon the public whether they will give it effect.",74
722,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,In the same way a trade union will register a trade mark because it will be meant to be used.,74
723,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"And will adopt every lawful means to see that it is used. Mr D UGALD THOMSON - Of course, and the trade unions mean to compel the employers to use their labels. What will be the means resorted to? Do honourable members think that we are simpletons ? Do we not know what will be the means? It will be the boycott of the goods of those who do not use the trade union labels. Honourable members should not come here with such exaggerated innocence as to say that that will not be the means. It will be the means, and it will be another cause of difficulty and bitterness. I may allude to a remark made by the honourable member for Moira, who said there could not be strife because unions cannot strike. That is not accurate. The honourable member was alluding, of course, to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, but as a matter of fact, we know that under that Act, unions can strike to any extent. The reason the honourable member saw for the introduction of this provision, is a reason which, in the opinion of other honourable members, as well as in my opinion, proves that it is not necessary. I shall not labour that point, as it has already been dealt with by other speakers. When we have already provided means which we were assured by those who supported the proposals under consideration would have the effect of introducing good conditions of employment in the Commonwealth, why we should pile condition upon condition, and provision upon provision to effect what we were assured by those supporting other measures would be effected by those measures, passes my comprehension. Yet that is what Ave are doing here. The Attorney-General argued that this proposal was desirable because it would encourage trade union conditions in employment. I ask, Are we, the Legislature of the country, to deliberately make the trade unions the arbiters of the conditions of employment ? Trade unions have, in many respects, done good work in introducing improved conditions. I am quite with the workers as to their right to form these unions, and the desirability in their own interests of forming them. I believe they are entitled to anything they can get fairly by their own organization. But we are asked to step in here and allow the trade unions to fix absolutely the conditions of labour and the rates of wages. We know that the members of trade unions are only human. In some circumstances they will accept conditions, even sanitary conditions-to the Attorney-General alluded as one of the things to be effected by this proposal-that are not desirable. In other cases, they will insist, in the natural selfishnesi found in us all, and found in organizations more fully developed perhaps than in individuals, on things that are by no means desirable in the interest of the community. We know many instances of that. Are we then to make them the arbiters of the conditions, or have we not said by our previous legislation, that Parliament has provided measures which are intended to decide the conditions of employment? The difficulties to which such accumulated conditions and provisions must give rise, in the conduct of commerce, cannot be in the of the Avorkers in our The honourable member for Melbourne Ports eulogized the effect of the Victorian Wages Boards - I, myself, when speaking on the Conciliation and Arbitration recognised the desirability of some measure to stop the unnecessary reduction of Avages. There is, not merely a necessary reduction of Avages, but also a very unnecessary reduction, which, Avithout some provision for interference, AA'ould lead to industrial conditions which are not desirable. then that I believed far more in the Victorian Wages Board system for that purpose than in Arbitration legislation, and I Mr Dugald Thomson. think that the experience of New South Wales is beginning to bring it home to both' Avorkmen and employers that my belief is justified. The constant, costly, and irritating litigation which has been going on in the New South Wales Arbitration Court is infinitely more troublesome, rrJore disastrous, and less beneficial to those engaged in the industries of the State than the action of the Wages Boards would be.",74

725,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"1 do not profess to knoAv all the conditions of eA'ery trade, but if a method adopted for a good purpose in connection with any trade has proved successful, I see no reason for not extending it to another. Mr TUD.OR - In Victoria tAvice as many trades are not under Wages Boards as are under Wages Boards.",75
726,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE S,"I know that; and if the Wages Board system has proved successful, if it has increased Avages which Avithout destroying the industries in which those Avages are paid, I should not Object to its extension to trades Avhose employees do not noAv benefit by it. My objection to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill Avas founded on the expectation that the results which have folloAved would follow. I allude to the measure now only to point out' that that is the proper direction in which to move to secure the improvement of industrial conditions. Why pile on top of that legislation such a cause of dissension as this union label system will be ? If the system is adopted, it will not produce the good results which are anticipated. I shall avoid dealing Will the matter more f u l ly noAv, hoAvever, because I do not Avish to go over ground which other honourable interest members have traversed. This Parliaindustries. ment is getting a reputation-and not an undeserved one-for such an unnecessary, unreasonable, duplicated, and triplicated interference with commerce that many perBill, sons in the community-no t employers only,, but employees also' ask us to leave Australian industries alone for a little, so that those engaged in them may settle doAvn to the present conditions, and may have some distance of time in front of them in which to devote their attention, I said not to the changes caused in their affairs by our legislation, but to the successful advancement of their businesses. We have placed many enormous difficulties in the way of the conduct of the industries to of the country, and we add to them when we single out a special section of the community, as we do in this proposals. Bill , give it the right to register trade marks, and intend that it shall bring suffiThese cient pressure to bear to successfully force the powers given to it. But before we increase that legislation by this meaTories sure and by the other far-reaching and greatly disturbing measures now before us, some of their provisions being based on good reasons, but containing many proposals which are extreme, affecting all the inhave dustries and commerce of the country, should be careful of two things-first , we propose nothing but what is necessary and desirable, and, secondly, that we make sure that what we propose will be effective, and not merely destructive. That is my attitude on this measure. When the mittee stage is reached, I shall take steps, or assist others in taking steps, to effect improvements, although I recognise that, owing to the strange change in the opinions opposed to trade unions in any way. of honourable members opposite since they took possession of the Treasury benchesa change due to the association to which the honourable member for Bland has alperfect, luded- I fear that that portion of the sure which is aggressive, and, as I believe, injurious, will be accepted by the House.",75

729,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURE S,"I do not care for that. I am against any interference with personal liberty which can be avoided. liament placed certain limitations unions in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , which* were accepted by the Labour Party, and, unless similar limitations inserted in'this Bill, I shall do all I to prevent it from coming into force. not see why a trade union should be lowed to interfere in any man's business, or should be given special privileges in nexion with trade marks. Of course, a union enters into a business for its profit, as a co-operative concern, it is titled, like any other manufacturer, place its trade mark on its productions. The sole object of the special provisions serted in this Bill is to enable the unionists force men into their ranks, and to deprive non-unionists of their freedom of action and thought. I strongly oppose any such I am sick and tired of all the talk that we have heard about democracy. proposals are absolutely foreign to enthe principles of democracy. If honourable members opposite admitted that they were in principle, and ceased to boast of their liberalism, and their democratic proclivities, I should have no quarrel with them. If the provisions relating to trade union labels are carried, manufacturers will to use such labels, or submit to being we boycotted by the members of the unions. that Why should any man be compelled to employ unionists? What would be said by honourable members opposite if we proposed that the use of only non-union labels should be permitted, with the object of driving commen out of the unions? Would they not declare that we were proposing to exercise the greatest tyranny ? No one for a moment would tolerate such a proposal. I am not I believe that they have done some good, and that they have also done a great deal of harm. I would not say that they are or that the working classes occupy meatheir present position as the result of the good work achieved by the unions. As I have said, I am not opposed to the unions, but I do not intend to give them any adl l , vantage by law. If by combination, and proby proving themselves to be better than or by co-operation, the memis bers of trade unions can improve their by positions, well and good, but we are here 7 to guard the rights, not of one set of persons, but of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. I am astonished to see Ministers who were strongly opposed to all such proposals a short time ago now Parsupporting the Bill in its entirety. The upon lion is now lying down with the lamb. The Treasurer, for instance, was very strong in his opposition to special labour are legislation before he took office, and yet can today, on account of his fondness for the I do sweets of office, or owing to some other alconsideration, we find him calmly accepting proposals which are potent for misconchief. It is outrageous that some honorwhen able members should swallow their prinown ciples as they have done in connection with enthis Bill. I shall do all I can to prevent to this measure, or any other framed on the same lines,i from being passed. I quite inrealize how the provisions relating to union labels could be used to boycott tradesmen, or even workmen. If , for instance, a storekeeper did not sell goods bearing the union label, he would probably be called a blackleg, and would be told that he was not taking the proper course to conserve the interests of the working classes. quite agree with the necessity of protecting the rights of the traders and others in trade marks, and only in so far as the Bil l proceeds in that direction will it receive my support.",76
730,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,Does the honourable member think that the union label will afford any guarantee of value to the consumer?,77
731,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURE S,"No n e whatever. Non-unionists are in many cases just as good workmen as are unionists. The fact that a man belongs to a union does not carry with it any guarantee of efficiency. Only the other day I met a man in Melbourne who told me that the best men in the unions did not .care whether there were unions or not. He stated that a great number of the unionists were not up to the mark, and that the best men in those organizations had to carry the incapables on their backs. There are plenty of good men in) the unions and plenty of bad ones. The same remarks apply to the men outside the unions.",77
732,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE S,"Does the honourable member think that new unions, with political objects, will, probably be formed in order to carrv out a boycott under the provisions of the""Bill?",77
733,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURE S,"I think that is very likely. We have rendered it impossible for the unions formed under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to play the part of ment of the debate. political organizations, and no doubt the present proposal is intended to permit unions with political objects being formed, hour. and thus overcoming the obstacles which are imposed in connection with the Act just mentioned. My desire is to leave men free to take whatever stand they please, ings. and to follow whatever course in life seems best to them, so long as they do not run counter to the best interests nity. We have heard a great deal of talk about democracy. I conceive that in order to be true democrats we must not only lookdesire to speak? after our own rights, but also those of other people, and on broad principles, I am absolutely opposed to the union trade mark provisions in the Bill . I trust that provisions will be eliminated. done. I shall not have very much objection t:> the Bill. Those honourable memberswho journed. call themselves liberals are doing all they can to place restrictions upon every member of the community. If their action is in strict accordance with the doctrines of liberalism I do not know what liberalism I is. We should do as little as we possibly can to interfere with the freedom of individuals, so long as they do not act in a manner inimical to the best interests of the people as a whole. I think that the Government might very well consent to an adjournment at this stage. We have now reached the usual time for adjourninghalf-past i o o'clock.",77
734,Mr ISAACS,MANUFACTURE S,It is too early; we ought to continue the debate until the usual hour.,77

736,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURE S,"As the Attorney General will not agree to an adjournment of the debate, I shall conclude by stating that in Committee I shall do my best to secure the rejection of the clauses to which I have referred. I shall spare no effort in that direction, because I think that they are altogether foreign to our ideas of British liberty.",77

Some honourable members, who have travelled hundreds of miles from distant States, have been compelled to sit here all day and witness the erection of a ""stone wall "" by members of the Opposition. I would warn the Government that if they allow these tactics to be repeated, we shall get no work done this session. It is quite apparent that there is an organized attempt to prevent anything being accomplished.",78

We know that there is urgent work to be done, but unless we make more rapid progress, we shall achieve nothing. It is well known that the last session in any Parliament is, chiefly occupied in, talking to constituents. No useful work is ever done then. I protest against being brought here merely to gratify the Opposition, whose members are incensed because there has been a change of Ministrv.",78
745,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SERVICE ANDEXECUTION OF," I object altogether to the remarks of the honourable member for Grey.

746,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SERVICE ANDEXECUTION OF,"I am saying what is true, and therefore there is no need to be innocent. The discussion upon this Bil l has not been unduly prolonged.  fought out in Committee.",78
747,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SERVICE ANDEXECUTION OF,"Will it not save time if the speeches which are made now are not repeated in Committee ? Is the honourable member to come forward and say when honourable members shall deliver their speeches. This is quite a new role for him to play. I can recall to mind occasions when he has insisted upon his right of speech; but he now desires the suppression of the right of free speech, when it Is not unduly exercised. There has been no undue discussion. I was one of the last to speak on the motion for the second reading I of the Trade Marks Bill , refraining from taking part in the discussion at an earlier stagebecause I had been absent for some I will ask days; but the remarks which I had to offer were curtailed as much as possible, and were made, not with the bad object which the honourable member has suggested, but with the best of purposes in view.",78
748,Mr FISHER,SERVICE ANDEXECUTION OF," I think that this difficulty has arisen from the recent change of Government. Had the late Administration .remained in power, no doubt our Standing Orders would have been amended, and honourable members would have had their right of free speech restricted.. I am not one of those, however, who favour such a restriction.",78
749,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SERVICE ANDEXECUTION OF,Have there been any lengthy speeches today?,79
750,Mr FISHER,SERVICE ANDEXECUTION OF,"I am not complaining, bus my suggestion is that, if we are to have lengthy debates, we must either have longer sittings or meet on a greater number of days than we do. I am"" greatly in sympathy with the honourable member for Grey, because during the first Parliament the representatives of Queensland had often to attend here under even greater disadvantages than those suffered by the representatives of South Australia, and we keenly f e l t any delay that took place.",79

They occupy the .box-seat and, to-night, have warned the Government of what the consequences will be if they dare to conduct business in any other way than that which pleases them. I congratulate the Government upon their cordial and warm supporters, and wonder how long they will submit to political flagellation of this kind.",79
763,Mr WATSON,SERVICE ANDEXECUTION OF,Jus t as long as the honourable member submitted to it.,79
764,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SERVICE ANDEXECUTION OF,"We have had tonight a foretaste of what is to come. No doubt we shall have these protests repeated every week-perhap s every night-durin g the remainder of the session. The Labour Party are, of course, responsible. They have the power to turn out the Government at any moment, and if any one expects that they are going to submit quietly to the ordinary process of government he makes a very great mistake. The Labour Party have the power, and we see to-night how they are beginning to utilize it. They are going to flog the Ministry into carrying out theirevery wish, and we shall look on, with the greatest possible anxiety for the reputation of constitutional government, to see how far the Labour Party will proceed with this kind of flagellation. I am glad that the Opposition are free to protest against impertinence of the kind of which the honourable member for Grey has been guilty. We are not compelled, even if the Ministry are, to sit dumb under it . The Labour Party are not our masters. We hs^ s not submitted our programme to t h t caucus.",79

767,Mr DEAKIN,SERVICE ANDEXECUTION OF," When I was young, it was the practice in places of public entertainment to follow a serious drama with a farce, and we owe our thanks to one or two honourable members for having furnished us with relief of that kind this evening. Although anxious to .push on with business, I thought that a request by an ex-Minister for the adjournment of - a debate on a matter of such importance as the Trade Marks Bill was, at this stage, one to which the House was. entitled to listen. We are pressing on with two or three very important measures, and as soon as the second reading of the Trade Marks Bill has been agreed to, shall be prepared to move their second reading. I can promise the honourable member for Grey, whose reproaches, so far from affecting me, are such as I hope often to hear, unless better progress be made, that he will find the Government anxious for the House to sit often and long in order that the business of the country may be transacted. Question resolved iri the affirmative. House adjourned al zo.48 p.m.",79
