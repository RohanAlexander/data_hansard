(2) That while there is a need to establish in Australia a Natural Disaster Fund to provide compensauon for property damage and other losses resulting from disasters such as earthquakes,floodsand cyclones, such a Fund can be established, as in other countries, using the medium of the existing private enterprise insurance offices. (3) That a plan for a Fund was submitted to the Treasury in October, 1974. (4) That no sound reason for the establishment of an Australian Government Insurance Corporation (other than the desire to provide non-commercial disaster insurance and Australian Government competition with private enterprise) has been given by the Government. (5) That there is already intense competition between the existing 45 life assurance offices and between over 260 general insurance companies now operating in Australia, and that further compeution from a Government Office took would only be harmful at this time.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (a) That the use of Uranium as an alternative source of energy is currently unacceptable as it presents problems including radioactive waste, military implications and thermal pollution. (b) That there can, at present, be no assurances that radioactive materials exported for peaceful purposes will not be used in the producdon of nuclear weapons.

(d) That the export of Uranium from Australia is internationally irresponsible and is not, benefit to Australia. (e) That the export of Uranium from Australia only discourages importing countries from investing into research on viable alternatives. (f) That only the overdeveloped industrial nations will benefit from Australian Uranium and the gap between these countries and the energy-starved Third World will increase yet further. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will immediately cease the mining and exporting on Uranium until perfectly safe disposal methods for the radioactive wastes have been guaranteed; will greatly increase expenditure on research into safe clean and inexhaustible sources of energy; and will aid underdeveloped countries in their plea for a fair share of the world's energy resources, while at the same time honouring its obligations to the future of humanity.

To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parhament assembled. We, the undersigned, citizens of Australia, by this our humble petition respectfully request that the Australian Government make available, either singularly or in cooperation with the State of New South Wales, finance to allow the purchase and dedication as a fauna and flora sanctuary with part reserved for recreational usage that parcel of land known as 'Black Neds Bay' being the estuarine swamp and salt marsh at the entrance to Lake Macquarie, New South Wales, together with the land along the southern shore of the entrance to Lake Macquarie to the east of'Black Neds Bay' up to and including the headland known as 'Reids Mistake'.

Shire of South Gippsland To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House take steps to(1) grant to the Shire of South Gippsland an amount of $200,000 to enable it to provide the same standard of service in the long term, of it provided in 1972; (2) increase this grant annually in line with the inflation rate. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Nixon. Petition received. Fraser Island To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas the natural environment of Fraser Island is so outstanding that it should be identified as part of the World Natural Heritage, and whereas the Island should be conserved for the enjoyment of this and future generations, Your petitioners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to ensure: 1. that the Australian Government uses its constitutional Black Neds Bay powers to prohibit the export of any mineral sands from Fraser Island, and 2. that the Australian Government uses its constitutional authority to assist the Queensland Government and any other properly constituted body to develop and conserve the recreational, educational and scientific potentials of the natural environment of Fraser Island for the long term benefit of the people of Australia. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Young. Petition received. NA NA",15
3,Mr LYNCH,GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE,I ask the Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Treasurer the following question: Will the honourable gentleman tell the House why Government spending is continuing to increase at a rate in excess of 45 per cent in spite of the fact that the increase in oudays for the full nnanciai year is estimated at 23 per cent? Does this mean that there is a requirement for an addidonal appropriation of funds to enable the Government to fund its programs until the end of November?,17
4,Mr CREAN,GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE,"I beheve that the shadow Minister ought to be well aware that there are some pitfalls, if l may say so, in trying to draw a year's conclusions from the first month or 2 months of the financial year's transactions. I am sure that he, like other honourable members, has been supphed with the full details of the expenditure for the 2 months to the end of August 1975 as against the 2 months to the end of August 1974. If he reads those details carefully, he will .find that $60m of that expenditure was in the category of defence. Does he beheve that we are spending too much on defence? The expenditure on education is up by almost SlOOm. I have had many people claiming that there is not enough being spent on education. In the area of health, the difference is of the order of $140m. In the area of housing, it is $250m. Again, there seem to be complaints that not enough money is being spent in that category. Payments to the States are $200m greater in the 2 months of the nnanciai year 1975-76 than they were in the financial year 1974-75. This economy would have been in a far worse position had there not been an acceleration of Government expenditure over recent months. I suggest to the honourable gentleman that he read the figures carefuUy, indicate to me where he thinks expenditure could be reduced and I will answer his question. NA",17
5,Mr WHAN,COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRES,"I address my question to the when Mmister for Health. Last April approval was given by the Australian Government for the tabUshment of community health centres at Eden, Ulladulla and Sussex Inlet. I have recently been approached by local residents complaining that the New South Wales Government has said that money is no longer avaUable jects. Is the Minister aware of simUar problems elsewhere in New South Wales and can he give the House an explanation for this apparent change of pohcy?",17
6,Dr EVERINGHAM,COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRES,"Give n the good working relationship which exists at officer level, these holdups must be poUticaUy motivated. The States received an additional 34 per cent in unspecified, untied grants this year. New South Wales is suffering nnanciai difficulties from its poor handling of Medibank and its faUure to transfer country raUways to the Australian Government. Given the increase in unspecified grants and the fact that the Australian Government contributes 90 per cent of the operating costs and 75 per cent of the capital costs of community health projects, it is difficult to understand why this worthwhUe program has been slowed down. Consistent with the Australian Government's ongoing commitment to community health services, the Budget provides $65m for this year compared with $42.5m in 1974-75. Perhaps the New South Wales Government is finding it difficult to provide its 25 per cent contribution to capital costs. On the staffing side, a mere 10 per cent of State contribution .is required, and yet hundreds of positions have been left unfiUed. In all, about 1500 positions were created in New South Wales under the community health program. Not only is Mr Lewis threatening to stand down up to 600 employees of the PubUc Works Department; he is also failing to use grants avaUable from the Australian Government to boost employment in the healthfieldby about the samefigure.It is certainly a curious way of managing the financial affairs of a sovereign State. Most authorities in the world concede that most of the money put into more efficient community care is more than saved by reduced demand for costly hospital care. I shall take up the matter with the New South Wales Minister for Health to find a way to ensure that these vital initiatives are taken in the community health field. NA",17
7,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE,"Does the Acting Treasurer stUl say that the Government can keep within its overall budgeted deficit of $2,800m the deficit for thefirst2 months of the year is running at $l,071m? I note that the Acting esTreasurer made the point about taking the figures forward over the full 12 months. Is he aware that if the deficit continues to grow as it has grown in thefirst2 months of the year it will lead to a total deficit of more than $6,000m in for these prothisfinancialyear?",17
8,Mr CREAN,GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE,I can assure the honourable gentleman that that will not be the case. He knows as well as anybody else knows that this Government cannot spend money for which it does not have an appropriation. There are unevennesses from month to month. I cited the defencefigures.Orders came in which had to be paid for. The other day some curious character in Queensland suggested that the Government was not paying its accounts. I wish he would check the facts before making silly statements like that. There are unevennesses. Housing moneys were advanced to the States early because the States claimed that they needed them. It is quite wrong to multiply thefigureby six and say that that will be the end result. NA NA,17
9,Mr INNES,DEVELOPMENT SCHEME,"Has the Prime Minister seen can reports of a call by the President of the AusGovernment trahan Council of Trade Unions, Mr Hawke, the Government to reconsider the phasing out the Regional Employment Development scheme? Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the future of the scheme approaches made to him seeking the retention of the Regional Employment Development scheme?",18
10,Mr WHITLAM,DEVELOPMENT SCHEME,"The only communication I have had on the Regional Employment question Development scheme has been from the Premier of Victoria, and he has urged that it be continued or expanded. His Government, of course, on 19 December last challenged the vaUdity of the RED scheme in the High Court of Australia and is pursuing the chaUenge. I did hear on the that the Premier of New South Wales had also made some pronouncement about this matter. He, on 14 February last, also chaUenged the idity of the RED scheme in the his Government is pursuing that chaUenge. I wish people on the Opposition side who volunteer these comments about the RED scheme would make up their minds whether they want it to continue or or whether they do not. They are asking us to continue or expand appropriations for a scheme whose vaUdity under the Constisome tution they are chaUenging. In the meantime get no assistance from their colleagues in Parliament, because one does not know whether the Liberals, from the top to the bottom, or National Country Party of Australia either for wealth. that matter, want the RED scheme to be expanded or scaled down, or whether they it is unconstitutional. AU one can say is that the first reaction, and a very early reaction, by Liberal State governments-that is, in the parUaabnormal ments where the Liberals have options to do tilings-wa s to challenge the vaUdity of the scheme. I would point out that the scheme was introduced as a means of improving employment opportunities in areas of excessively high unemployment. It subsequently became a general unemployment reUef scheme. The Government has made appropriations which it beUeves will effect a more substantial improvement in the employment situation, and I will cite four of them. There has been a large increase in the present Budget in grants to local government bodies for them to spend as they seefit.In the last Budget they got $56m in grants. This Budget they are getting $80m in grants. Again, there are special employment grants schemes for the States. They are getting $30m in this way in this Budget, and they spend it as they seefit.In addition to that the is appropriating funds in its ChUfor dren's Commission program and in its area of improvement program which will reUeve unemployment. These programs have not been challenged in the High Court by the Liberal or of any other State governments. NA",18
11,Mr ANTHONY,UNEMPLOYMENT,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and Immigration, and it is a supplementary to that just asked by the honourable member for Melbourne. The Minister will be aware that in some country areas the ratio of people unemployed is twice that of the national average, in some cases exceeding 10 per cent. With the phasing out now of the Regional Emradio ployment Development scheme, is any action being taken or are any plans being undertaken by the Government to ensure that there will be valsome contmuing job opportunities for people in High Court, and these country areas?",18
12,Mr RIORDAN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The Government does have under consideration a number of schemes to assist employment generaUy. I dunk it is appropriate at this stage to mention that unemployment in the last month in fact fell. There were 3393 people fewer unemployed in August they than there were in the previous month, and this unfilled vacancies also showed a marginal increase of 627, so there are now some 26 155 the unfilled vacancies throughout the CommonIt is aU very well, of course, to rely on the statistical mechanism caUed seasonal adjustthink ment. Seasonal adjustment of employment figures works on the premise that we are in a northe mal situation. In fact, at this time there is an situation. Our economy is corning out of a slump which has afflicted every comparable country throughout the world. Of course, that causes concern to some honourable members opposite. They do not want that recovery and they do their best in this Parhament and elsewhere to continue to undermine pubhc confidence. In respect of the question of the phasing out of the Regional Employment Development scheme, I wish the honourable gentleman would make up his mind. On the one hand his colleagues are saying that they do not want the RED scheme, that it is invalid and unconstitutional; in the next breath they are saying that they want it continued. This Government is the first government to undertake seriously regional development. It is thefirstgovernment to make a serious attempt to see that there is decentraUsation in Australia and it is doing it in a number of ways. The honourable gentleman would do well to have a close look at what is being done in the area of techmcal and further education so that chUdren in rural areas and in the country towns will have the opportunity to be trained in skUled employment, thereby malting it possible for employers to start industries in those regions. If the honourable gentleman would look seriously once in a whUe at his own record he would find that although the Liberal-Country Party Government frequently advanced the argument that there should be decentralisation of industry, it did nothing to provide the facUities to train labour to work in those industries. The greatest single inhibition on employers decentralising their factories was that they did not have the capacity to obtain trained labour. AU these facUities are being made avaUable now whether the honourable gentleman Ukes it or not and they are being provided at a much more rapid pace than the honourable gentleman could ever have contemplated. NA",18
13,Mr JACOBI,UTAH DEVELOPMENT COMPANY,"I address my question to the Minister for Minerals and Energy. What prodexation, portion of profits from the export of Australian coal is derived by the Utah Development Comavoided? pany and its affiliates? What is the Australian equity in those compames? What steps has the Minister taken to ensure adequate Australian participation in them? Mr CONNOR Of the total gross profit of $544m derived this year from the export to Japan of coking coal the percentage which will flow to the Utah Development Company and its affiUate is 56 per cent. They will take $309m of $544m-56\ k percent to be precise. Only 10.8 per cent of that will pass to Australian shareposition. holders; the rest will go abroad. The Utah Development Company can thank the good offices and support of the Australian Government for its present situation because the contracts it entered into with 7-year pricing terms with various Japanese steel mUls did not provide for an annual review of prices. Thanks to our good graces and by grace and favour of the Japanese consumers, the Utah Development Company is receiving the same annual review of prices as the other Australian producers. For the future, this is the position: The Utah Development Company is in the cream. It has paid for its infrastructure and the question seriously arises as to whether it should continue merely to skim offthe 17 per cent of Queensland coal which is avaUable to open cut rnining at the highest profit rates and leave behind for posterity and for Japan ultimately, the rest of the coal that will be won at greater cost. A fortnight ago Mr WUson of Utah and some of his senior officers came to discuss with me their various pricing problems. The Australian Government was happy to assist them. I indicated to Mr WUson that the time had arrived when there ought to be proper Australian equity participation. There the matter remains and I hope to get a response within a reasonable time. NA",19
14,Mr MCMAHON,COMPANY INVESTMENT,"No doubt the Acting Treasurer has read or heard about the United Kingdom SandUand report recommending indexation of stocks and current cost valuation of plant and equipment and wiU know that the United Kingdom Government has allowed tax on stock profits to be deferred immediately. As well, it wiU permit depreciation of plant and equipment and other capital investment to be written off in one year. Does the Government now realise against this background, that the explanation on page 21 of the Budget Speech that very serious problems would be created by inis obviously superficial nonsense, and that in any event the difficulties could easily be I will teU the Acting Treasurer how if he cares to consult me. Does he now reaUse how wise the Leader of the Opposition was in recommending simUar poUcy changes to those of the United Kingdom? What does the Government intend to do about it?",19
15,Mr CREAN,COMPANY INVESTMENT,"I wish that these matters were as simple as the right honourable gentleman makes out. Perhaps if he and I did have a talk he would out learn as well as he thinks I would. The Budget did do certain things in relation to the company It doubled the normal depreciation allowances that could be claimed. It reduced the basic company tax rate by 2V4 per cent. The question of indexation was considered in a document known as the 'Mathews Report' and with all due respect to that report, I do not think it was anywhere near as good as the right honourable gendeman claimed the other day when he described it, if I heard him properly, as a brilliantly written document. The matters are not as simple as that and it is no justice when one tion of the community tries to index itself at the expense of the rest. NA",19
16,Mr MULDER,PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL,Is the Prime Minister aware of the report that the Prices Justification Tribunal would be abolished with a different Party in government? Would this be consistent with a slow down in the rate of inflation?,20
17,Mr WHITLAM,PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL,"I do remember that the Leader of the Opposition said that he would like to have an opportunity to abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal. I would point out that the Prices Justification Tribunal was estabUshed over 2 years ago in redemption of an election undertaking by the Government. I would urge honourable gentlemen who criticise it to consider what would be the attitude among employees-in particular those whose incomes in general have to be approved or vetted by tribunals such as the Arbitration Commission-if there were no simUar machinery to vet prices to be charged by companies. The Prices Justification Tribunal does not fix prices; it merely requires companies in certain categories which are contemplating increasing their prices to justify those increases. The Government believes that it is fair that people who charge for their vices and also people who charge for their wares should have simUar procedures appUed to them. It will make very much more difficult the quest for any restraint in income poUcies if there is any campaign to disparage or demolish the Prices Justification Tribunal. In fact a considerable number of people who are considered to support or advise the Liberal Party see virtue in the Prices Justification Tribunal. It is a matter of pubUc knowledge that among those whom the Leader of the Opposition asked to advise him some 4 weeks ago in preparing his speech on the Budget was Mr Rod Carnegie, the Chairman of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd. He has said that companies have found that the amount of work ana self-examination which went into a Prices Justification Tribunal submission was very healthy. The Government will support reasonable increases in prices approved by the Prices Justification Tribunal just as it wiU support reasonable increases in wages granted by the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission, but a new, unpredictable and provocative element will be introduced into our economy if there is any move to disparage or demoUsh the Prices Justification Tribunal. It has done a good job. It has pioneered a new field and has done so effectively. I believe honourable gentlemen ought to acsec- knowledge the skUl and wisdom with which Mr Justice WUUams has presided over this new form of law and order in the Australian economy. COCOS (KEELING) ISLANDS",20
18,Mr KELLY,PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL,I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Is it correct as reported in the Press that the Government is considering buying out Mr Clunies-Ross's interests in Cocos (Keeling) Islands? Is this being done to make us or the Cocos Islanders happy? Is it true that the Cocos Islanders use plastic money whUe we have to make do with paper money which seems to be rapidly losing its value? Is this fair? Does not the Prime Minister agree that the Cocos Islanders have no right to expect to be happy and contented forever whUe we suffer under sociaUsm here?,20
19,Mr WHITLAM,PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL,"The Government has decided to take 2 actions. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands should be obeying Australian laws that apply not only to continental Australia and Tasmania but also to the overseas territories, and should use Australian currency. Mr Clunies-Ross has always ignored the law in this respect. He has issued tokens to the people whom he employs. The only things they can buy with those tokens are the things which are avaUable in the store serwhich he owns. There is no other store. He is the owner, the operator and the employer and he makes the coinage. It is a paradise-for Mr Clunies-Ross. Mr Lamb-Is it free enterprise?",20
20,Mr WHITLAM,PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL,"It is free enterprise for Mr Clunies-Ross. He Uves in the way his ancestors hved 100 years ago. Those whom he employs and those to whom he seUs have to live as they Uved 100 years ago. There is no part of the world where things have changed so httle. The Government proposes to see that Mr Clunies-Ross obeys the law, that is, that he obeys the currency legislation of the Austrahan Parliament. The fact that our predecessors were prepared to condone this situation for aU those years since the middle 1950s-1955-whe n the Menzies Government accepted the Cocos (Keeling) Islands from Great Britain at the time when Singapore was being given independence is no reason why we should continue to condone it. Even if we wanted to condone it, the rest of the world is well aware of the position. It is true that until last Thursday the honourable gentlemen opposite, including their leader, suppressed the report which was made to them concerning conditions on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Mr Kerr, a senior pubhc servant who investigated the situation in 1971, said that it was like a slave plantation in the Deep South. No wonder when a Senator Committee which was investigating the affairs on Cocos sought to have access to the Kerr report and asked me to secure it, and I asked the Leader of the Opposition whether he would make it available to the Committee, that honourable gentleman refused to clear it. However, owing to a question which my colleague, the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, answered last Thursday, the report is now public property. The Senate Committee can now see it. All honourable gentlemen can see it. Quite apart from that the United Nations Committee of Twenty-four has been to Cocos and has reported adversely on the feudal conditions that there obtain. The other thing that the Government proposes to do is to introduce an ordinance for lands quisition on Cocos on terms similar to those which apply to lands acquisition by the Federal Government in continental Austraha and Tashis 2 Ministers? mania. Thereafter it will be possible for the Government to treat with Mr Clunies Ross to see that his estates can be acquired by the Australian people on just terms. Cocos Islands are and have been for a long time of some strategic imporbuUd tance to Austraha. If Austraha is to continue exercise jurisdiction over this remote territory ought to comply with the decent opinion of the world. I do not beheve that we ought to tolerate any employer paying his employees in tokens of his own creation redeemable in stores of which the employer holds the monopoly. I do not heve that we should tolerate a situation where Mr Clunies Ross can defy the laws whether lands acquisition or currency. Cocos is important to Austraha but Austraha will enjoy undisturbed jurisdiction in Cocos only if proper standards achere. ceptable to Austraha and the rest of the world are appUed. Our predecessors knew the situation. They covered it up; they did nothing about it. NA (Dr Klugman having addressed a question to the Prime Minister)",20
21,Mr SINCLAIR,DISALLOWED QUESTION,I take a point of order. think it is out of order for the honourable ber to ask a question seeking an opinion on article of that sort. I suggest that the honourable member's question is out of order.,21
22,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,I was waiting to see whether the honourable gentleman would get to asking a question. He did not do so. I think the question is out of order.,21
23,Dr KLUGMAN,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"I raise a point of order. Could I repeat the relevant part of the question to see whether you stick to that ruling, Mr Speaker? I have a feeling that there was noise in the House",21
24,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,Order! I think I heard the relevant part of the question. The question asked the opinion of the Prime Minister on a report in a journal.,21

27,Mr NIXON,OIL RIGS,"Will the Prime Minister sort out the administrative muddle between 2 ofhis Ministers, the Mmister for Transport and the Minister for Minerals and Energy? Does he know that ac2 Australian buUt oU rigs worth over $50m are unable to find work and are not allowed to be exported to find work because of the stupidity of",21
28,Mr WHITLAM,OIL RIGS,My knowledge of this situation is that some people who have had a very hefty subsidy from the Australian taxpayers to some of these rigs now want to use the rigs to elsewhere. I wish the honourable gentleman we would confer with some ofhis National Country Party colleagues who are always keen to support any claims by mineral or mining interests. I would have thought that these rigs could be used in Australia. That was the proposition upon bewhich the subsidies were paid for them to be buUt in Australia. They are perfectly suitable for for use in Australian territorial watersMr Nixon- Iriseon a point of order. My point of order simply is that they cannot find work,21
29,Mr SPEAKER,OIL RIGS,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. If he makes that sort of point of order again I wiU name him.,21
30,Mr WHITLAM,OIL RIGS,"The honourable gentleman probably at least agrees with his colleagues in supporting the assistance which was formerly given by our predecessors to the miiung interests. I Their very large taxation concessions did not memlead to any exploration or discovery; they did an lead to a very great deal of speculation. The brokers did allrightout ofit in general cases; the investors did not, and we did not discover or exploit our resources. Honourable gentlemen opposite seem to hold the extraordinary view that mining interests Austraha should not prospect unless the Governwere ment pays them to do it. There is nothing to preincluded vent mining interests from prospecting in Austraha or off-shore. Here we have 2 drilling rigs which are ideal for the purpose and the trahan people have a very large stake in them. The taxpayers have paid millions of dollars theserigsto be constructed in Austraha. Now the honourable member for Gippsland suggests that we should let them be used elsewhere. Well, I not agree with him. The whole of the Governthese ment supports the principle that if Austrahan taxpayers' funds are to be used to build things Austraha they should first of all be used Austraha. NA",21
31,Mr JAMES,OIL PRICING,"I address my question to the the Minister for Minerals and Energy: Is the Minister aware of the meeting being held today between State Ministers for Mines and/or Energy relative to the forthcoming indigenous oil pricing policy? What is his answer to the criticism ofhis Western Austrahan counterpart, Mr Mensaros?",22
32,Mr CONNOR,OIL PRICING,"I am well aware of this selfparticularly appointed group of people who are meeting as self-appointed experts on this matter. It is coincidence, following the Prime Minister's wer to the last question, that undoubtedly, result of a submission that I have made on the indigenous pricing, I will be able to give every possible assistance to the operation of off-shore drilling rigs. In point of fact, Mr Mensaros been one of the greatest impediments to offtrahan shore oU exploration. Only 22 wells were required to be drUled on the whole of the northeconomical west shelf. In total seventy-two have been drUled around the coast of Western Australia. In respect of the granting of renewals of exploration mits, contrary to our wishes and poUcy, the Western Australian Government has provided for total of only 36 wells to be drilled, spread over the next 5 years. In point of fact my Department advises me that that would be precisely enough work for one off-shore drilling vessel. With the submissions that I have made in connection with the indigenous oU pricing pohcy and a proper remuneration for new oU, I think even the carptems. ing critics from the Liberal governed States be more than satisfied and left without further grounds for criticism.

33,Mr NEWMAN,TASMANIAN PROJECTS,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. During the Bass by-election the Government made many promises to the people in of Launceston and George Town. Many of them made by the Prime Minister himself. They such things as a by-pass around the city of Launceston, the upgrading of the Bell BayLaunceston Road to national highway status, the AusestabUshment of a government information office in Launceston, additions to the Launceston for General Hospital, the establishment of a national maritime coUege and several other projects. WUl the Prime Mmister give an assurance to do the people of Launceston and George Town that promises will be kept? Assuming that that assurance is given here, wiU the Prime Minister in give some indication when the funds wiU be in made avaUable to start these projects?",22
34,Mr WHITLAM,TASMANIAN PROJECTS,"The maritime college legislation ought to be introduced within the next few weeks. It is very nearly fuUy drafted. The provision for the by-pass around Launceston to link 2 national roads will be made in the arrangements which the Minister for Transport is hoping to make with the States, I think towards the end of 1975. The honourable gentleman should know also that the Government is seeking continuously to make arrangements with the Tasmanian Government to upgrade port facilities, at Bell Bay, hi Tasmama and to coordinate them with road and raU transport. I am quite a in correspondence with the Premier of Tasansmania, for instance, about the wheat trade to as a Tasmania. The Austrahan Government, through Australian National Line, has provided the ship which suppUes Tasmama with wheat. It is coming to the end of its Ufe. We want to use bulk has carriers there. The advisers of both the AusGovernment and the Tasmanian Government say that bulk carriers would be much more for the job. At present there are no adequate port facUities in Tasmama for a bulk carrier, nor are there the proper transfer points perfrom the ports to road and raU. The Austrahan Government is constantly in a touch with the Tasmanian Government about these matters. It is very largely for this reason that we agreed to acquire the Tasmanian RaUways. Tasmania's economic difficultiesflowfrom the fact that she is the only island State. Accordingly the alleviation of those economic difficulties depends above aU on better transpon sysWe believe that by the combination of the will Austrahan National Line and the Australian RaUways we are making a great contribution to improving Tasmania's economy. We hope that additional arrangements we seek with the Tasmanian Government will assist more to that end. NA",22
35,Dr KLUGMAN,INCOME TAX PROPOSALS,"Mr Speaker, I should like to rephrase my earher disallowed quesuon. It is directed again to the Prime Minister. Has his attention been drawn to an attack on the new Budget measures in the Sydney Morning Herald by 2 lecturers from the Law School of the University of New South Wales, alleging that the new tax scheme gives advantages to large families. They say that the plan provides great tax benefits to the family man with 3 children or more and that it is an invitation or acts as a direct inducement to parents with 2 children or more to go on and to 'proliferate with a vengeance' as they put it, with a third, fourth, fifth or sixth child and so on? Is it a fact that the new tax scheme will benefit parents of non-zero populadon growth families?",23
36,Mr WHITLAM,INCOME TAX PROPOSALS,"I did notice, somewhat cursorily I will admit, the comments by the 2 contributors to the Sydney Morning Herald in a series of articles on the Budget. I must confess that I had not realised that the contributors were lecturers in law; I presumed that they were philosophers or sociologists. The general theme seemed to be: No procreation while there is taxation. Quite frankly, I have never adhered to the theory that people would have children only if the taxpayers subsidised them to have them. There are many vahd reasons for people having children and there are many vahd reasons, I suppose, for people not having children. I must confess that in all the considerations the Government gave to this great taxation reform in the present Budget we did not consider the effect that it would have on the birth rate. But we did consider the effect that it would have on people who have farnily responsibilities. Of course, it is true that people who have dependants-spouse s and children-wil l benefit very considerably from this Budget. They will benefit more from this Budget than they have benefited from any preceding Budget, total but also proportionately. Since my views are sought on this matter, it seems fectly reasonable that people who have the greatest number of dependants should in fact get the most assistance from the community. I supfor pose I would concede the converse, that is that those who have the fewest responsibilities get the least assistance from the taxpayers. But the great advance that this Budget makes is that all families of the same size will get the same amount of assistance from the taxpayers, ever their incomes may be. Under the previous taxation system, the higher one's income the bigger the subsidy the taxpayers gave for every dependent child. The new taxation system means that whatever your income is the taxpayers will give you exactly the same amount of assistance for every dependant that you have. This seems to me logical, rational, humane and overdue. NA NA",23

47,Mr SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Order! I have received a letter from the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) proposing that a definite matter of pubhc importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's demonstrated inability to deal with the problems of industrial relations. I , therefore, call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in thenplaces).",24
48,Mr STREET,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Prior to its coming to power in December 1972 we were told by the Austrahan Labor Party that it had all the answers to the problems of industrial relations in Austraha. We were told that there would be less industrial strife because of the so-called special relationship between the Labor Party and the trade union movement. The Federal Conference of the Labor Party in its industrial relations pohcy placed human rights and values first and provided for the development of full human dignity in the industrial sphere. It went on to emphasise full employment and freedom of choice in that employment. That is what we were told then. It sounded pretty good at thetime,and it still does. But what a gap there is between the principle and the practice, between the ideology and the actuality. Let us have a look at the promises of 1972 in the hght of what has happened since then. There would be fewer industrial disputes, we were told. But what a record we have seen. In 1972 there were 2 rnillion working days lost. In 1973 that figure had increased by over 600 000. Last year thefigurewas over 6 milhon working days lost. Thefigurefor wages lost by the people who were to benefit from this special relationship is even worse. In 1972 $32m was lost, in 1973 $45m was lost, and last year thefigurewas an unbehevable $128m. Some special relationship! Who did benefit as a result of this special relationship? If there was a special relationship, it was a special relationship of disaster-disaste r for the workers of this country, disaster for the employers, disaster for the general pubhc. No longer do we hear any resounding ideological pohcy cornmitments because there is no pohcy at all. Unfortunately, the story does not stop there, because this disastrous Government is still in power, and worse than that, it is still running true to form. At the beginning of 1973 the seasonally adjusted unemployment figure was 95 000, approximately 1V4 per cent of the work force- a remarkably low figure by any standard. From thisfigureand through successive months unemployment levels began to rise. How many times did we hear senior members of the Government pubhcly say 'It will never reach 100 000' or 'No way it will get to 150 000""? And there is that famous quote: ' I will resign from the ministry if it gets beyond 250 000'. Opposition members-Who said that?",24
49,Mr STREET,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"That was the former Minister for Labor and Immigration, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron). Where is the special relationship with 300 000 Austrahan unemployed now comprising 5 per cent of the work force? On these figures alone, the condemnation of this Government is overwhelming. Never before have there been so many unemployed. But that is not the end of it. Consider for a moment the 25 000 hidden unemployed temporarily under the Regional Employment Development scheme, the thousands of people covered by the National Employment and Training scheme, the tens of thousands of students who remain at school in the hope that employment will improve. They must come into the work force next year. Consider also the decline in business confidence. As a result of the Government's poUcies business will have to reduce its labour even further. I do not hear any member of the Government promising that unemploymentfigureswiU not reach 350 000. With this destructive combination of record industrial disputation and record unemployment one would have thought the Austrahan Labor Party would have come up with some constructive ideas, but the one initiative proposed was indexation, and then only on wages-no t on personal income tax, although that was recommended by the Government's own committee, the Mathews Committee, and is supported by the whole union movement. Wage indexation was to be the Government's great cure aU for industrial strife. Look at thefiguresin May, the month immediately after the introduction of indexation. In May this year there were 330 industrial disputes, the highest figure for any month this year and one of the highest for many years. Half a rniltion work days were lost, the highest for this year. An amount of $ 13.7m was lost in wages- a record again. If that is the result of the Government's only initiative in industrial relations, heaven help us for the future. The fact is that the Government is barren of ideas. Its poUcies on the various aspects of industrial relations are either non-existent or a positive liabUity. Take the question of communication. Communication is at the heart of industrial relations, because industrial relations are fundamentally human relations. It is obvious that if communication breaks down then industrial relations break down. But what did the Government do on roniing to power? It promptly aboUshed the only national consultative forum there was-the National Labour Advisory Council, where representatives of employers, employees and the Government could meet and discuss national employment and industrial problems, and God knows there are plenty of them to discuss. The National Labour Advisory Council was, and the under a Liberal-National Country Party Government will once again be, an essential part of Government, an essential instrument in the development of an industrial relations policy. We would reconstruct it as a statutory body with its own small secretariat, and it would be required to meet regularly. The Minister for Labor of the day, whoever he might be, will not be able to take refuge, as successive Ministers of this Government have done by just refusing to call the Council together. Communications must be encouraged not only at the national level, important thought that is. Industrial relations start at the shop floor, and communication at this level is vital. Where are the proposals of this Government? They do not exist. Again we have to look at the pohcies of the Liberal and National Country Parties. We recognise that it is not easy to legislate in this area-in fact, it is probably not desirathem. ble to legislate-bu t it is absolutely essential appropriate lines of communication be developed between employers and employees. It is essential for good industrial relations and fundamental to achieving Australia's full potential for development. The Liberal and National Country Parties are dedicated to developing a partnership concept in industry. We reject completely the outworn discredited ideology of the Austrahan Labor Party that industrial relations must be built on a class warfare concept. No Austrahan stands to benefit from that. All Australians stand to benefit from a mutual understanding of each other's problems and this can come only through the establishment of communication procedures to suit each individual plant or industry. Our poUcies strive to encourage, protect and respect the rights and responsibUities of aU engaged in industry. This is the foundation which harmonious industrial relations are estaband lished. However, aU parties involved in industrial relations must recognise that once an agreement has been reached or an award has been made they have an obligation to honour that agreetion, ment or award and that such arrangements must apply equally to both sides. The view that trial agreements should be the only legal agreealways ments which are binding on one party and the other is contrary to our plulosophy, contrary problem. to law and contrary to the democratic system. Let anybody on the other side of the House who denies that declare himself now. The implementasibUities. tion of such a pohcy requires leadership from government. The present Government will not provide it. It has done nothing to stop industrial disputes and it stands condemned by the record level of industrial disputation which has occurcent red since it came to power. The Opposition's industrial pohcy, on the other hand, sets out in quite explicit terms our order of priorities. First, the whole thrust of our policy is directed towards preventing disputes from occurring, and I have already described the key role of communication in that respect. But we recognise that it is unreal to expect that disputes ww never occur. Of course they will, and a realistic industrial relations policy must recognise that fact and include proposals to deal with disputes. We would give full support to the inclusion in awards and agreements of the dispute settling procedures which were agreed to by the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions and employers in 1970. There has never been a genuine concerted effort to apply these procedures. The present Government has never even mentioned Our policy recognises that in the last resort that' it is the right of an employee to withdraw his labour in an industrial dispute-to strike-so long as the provisions of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act have been complied with. However, long before that situation is reached there must be an obligation to talk, to negotiate and to concUiate. The dispute settling procedures would provide the machinery for this. Not only that, they would ensure that the public interest was protected. The Labor Party seems to have the peculiar attitude that there are only 2 parties to industrial disputes. It seems to forget that there is an unseen, sometimes forgotten, but vitally interested third party-the general public. A little whUe ago there were reports that the present Minister for Labor and Immigration was about to introduce amendments to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act to protect the public interest, to those give the Government power to appeal against on decisions of single members of the Commission to require commissioners to observe the indexation principles and guidelines of the Full Bench. Where are these amendments? If they are responsible and are designed to counter inflathe number one enemy of full employment in this country, the Opposition would support industhem. However, there has been no action, as seems to be the case with this Governnot ment when confronted with a real issue or The Government will not face up to its responThere is plenty of talk at national wage case hearings about the need for restraint but there is a strange sUence when it is confronted with the need to argue strongly in individual cases. Did the Government intervene in the recoal miners' case? Did it intervene when the meat workers in Victoria claimed another $60 a week? Will it intervene in the oil industry case this week? If the Government were genuine in its calls for restraint it would have taken every opportunity to argue the case. There have been plenty of opportunities but this pusillanimous, spineless, no-policy government turns its back on the problems and on the unemployed whose only hope of a job depends on innation being brought under control. This Government has abdicated its responsibility in industrial relations. It refuses to represent the people of Austraha. What other words can be used to describe a situation where a Minister of the Crown has the effrontery to tell beef producers, who are desperately seeking a market for their stock and who are desperately trying to stay solvent, that if they want to export cattle they should try to make arrangements with the union so that they will be allowed to export their stock. What bare faced impertinence, what gall for a Government to give such advice to people facing the gravest nnanciai crisis in the history of their industry. A government which adopts this attitude has forfeited all right to respect from the Austrahan electorate. A great principle is involved. That principle is that in a parliamentary democracy the elected representatives of the people govern the country and when they refuse to do so they lose their right to govern. This Government deserves to go. The former Minister for Labor and Immigration 12 months ago said: The Government would not want to continue in office if unemployment increased from the present 93 000 to a 2S0 000 figure. Mr Hawke, the President of the Austrahan Labor Party, said at a time when unemployment was less than half what it is now that he would rather see a new election than have the Government cause mass unemployment. This Government not only deserves to go to one of its own Ministers and to the president of the Austrahan Labor Party, it has to go.",25
50,Mr RIORDAN,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Phihp-Minister for Housing system and Construction) (3.22). There were 2 things about the speech of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) which impressed me. ment continues: The first was his statement that an elected government is entitled to govern. I wish he would office tell that once in a while to his colleagues in the organisation Senate. The second was that he apparently has which not read the Conciliation and Arbitration Act very carefully otherwise he would not have made some of the statements he made. I suggest that should look at what are the rights of government to intervene in industrial disputes, where governa ment is restricted and how rigidly it is restricted. After all, his colleague, the Deputy Leader of Opposition (Mr Lynch) had a long time in which to correct that situation if he had been able to do so. I am sure it was not an oversight on his part but that he dehberately decided not to do it. I notice also that the honourable member for Corangamite said that it was not desirable to legislate in this area. Not desirable to legislate! I have looked at a document of the Liberal and National Country Parties' called Employment and Industrial Relations Policy, a remarkable document if ever there was one. It is a document stolen from Dixie-Governo r Wallace would be proud of honourable members opposite. In it are some of the most remarkable pieces of proposed legislation that one could imagine and when the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions Congress meets next week it might well have a hard look at the alternative to the present Government to see what it is in for. Also the Austrahan people might have a hard look to see what they are faced with if the alternative government on the other side of the House came to power. The Opposition parties stand for industrial confrontation the type of which has not been seen in this country for the last 50 years. Let me give a classic example of what they have in mind. They want consequences for certain unfair practices of employees and unions.",27

56,Mr RIORDAN,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"I do not beheve it-certainly but also, according not. It says: Examples of the kind of consequences which could be available to the Court would be: deregistrationThat is a brilliant way to get a union outside the to comply with it. Push it right out. That is a brilliant idea. Nobody other than whoever wrote this document would think ofit. The docusequestration or garnishees of funds, fines, exclusion from of employer industrial officers or office bearers of an for a specified period, facilitation of steps by an innocent party may claim damages for loss suffered as a result of an unfair industrial practice. Will honourable members opposite think for just he a moment about what they are proposing there? They are saying that a company which employed personnel officer could be told by some court that it could not have that person. He would be, as it were, blacklisted by the Industrial Court not to be employed. Are members opposite serious? Are they seriously suggesting that a union which, in a ballot conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office under the provisions of the tration Act, decided by 25 000 votes to 200 votes that a certain person was to be the general secretary, could be told by the court that they could not have that person? Are honourable members opposite really serious about this? Who do they think would accept that proposition? Nobody would accept that proposition; nobody would accept it for one moment. Do honourable members opposite suggest that some court should have the power to say to the electors of Corangamite: 'You should not have elected Mr Street; he has been unfair and he cannot take his place in the Parhament.'? Members of the Opposition are seeking to deny the very basis of industrial democracy. They are seeking to deny the very tenet on which the whole'system of trade union elections is based. They are saying that one can elect who one likes as long as it suits the court appointed by a Liberal-National Country Party Government. We know some of the judges that they have appointed in the past and what they would do. We know them well. We have seen them well and, in fact, they are known too well. The alternative to this Government's pohcy is confrontation and disputation in the streets. That is the proposition.

They do not deserve to be taken as being a genuine effort to resolve industrial disputes. What they seek to do is to override decisions of arbitration tribunals in the past and to impose on arbitration tribunals their idea of industrial policies. For example, they deny the fact that there has existed in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act for at least 60 years a provision whereby members of registered unions may obtain preference of employment over those who are not members.

65,Mr RIORDAN,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,The facts of the matter are the that industrial disputes have decreased in the part of this year as compared with last year. Mr Street-Not in May.,28
66,Mr RIORDAN,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Yes-even in May. When one compares the first 5 months of this year with the corresponding period last year this is the The number of disputes is 11 per cent less; the number of workers involved is 40.9 per cent less; the number of working days lost is 68.7 per less; and the estimated loss of wages is 55.5 per cent less. How is that situation arrived at? to How can honourable members opposite possibly suggest that that is an indication of some upsurge in industrial disputes? In fact, exactly the opof what the honourable gentleman said is One can easily pick out a week or a day or a month, but I am talking about the first 5 months of this year as compared with exactly the same period last year. That would be the most recent comparison and the fairest to make. The honourable member for Corangamite said that when one speaks of industrial relations, one speaks about human relations. I commend him on having made that discovery but he should take it a step further. He should recognise that employees work in order to hve. They do not Uve in order to work. There is a great distinction to be made. Mr Street-Yes.",28
67,Mr RIORDAN,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"The honourable gentleman agrees with me. He would reahse then that the purpose of earning a wage is to achieve something in Ufe. When one talks about this Government and its attitude towards industrial relations, one must look at what has occurred for the employee and the quality of hfe that he enjoys. For example, his chUdren are now entitled to a far greater degree of equaUty in educational opportunity. The youth in the employee's fanuly and even the employee himself is entitled to undertake some form of training which was not avaUable previously. There is provision now whereby he and his farnily can have access to specialist medical attention which they did not always have previously. The Government is developing a manpower poUcy which the Government of honourable members opposite was never prepared even to undertake. Mr Street-You have to get jobs first.",29
68,Mr RIORDAN,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Le t me say this to the honourable member for Corangamite: When you poke contempt at the Government's wages have policy, you ought to think whether you are reaUy doing a service to yourself, your Party, this Uament or the nation. Mr Street- I am saying you should stand up for",29
69,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,Order! I warn the time honourable member for Corangamite.,29
70,Mr RIORDAN,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"The honourable member tation? ought to think very carefuUy about what he is doing. At this time there is a very great debate the community about whether there should be wage indexation and whether guidelines should be maintained. Certainly employers are split spht very deeply on this issue. Some have been responsible enough to recognise that this Government's initiative is in the national interest. AU trade union organisations have accepted wage indexation and as late as week have accepted that there must be some guidelines, certainly reserving the right to debate what those guidelines should be, as does the Government. This is accepted by aU trade union bodies, some employer bodies and every State government including those led by the Liberal Party and the National Country Party. It does not do members of the Opposition any credit to stand in this Parhament and to try to sneer away this very difficult situation on which so much depends. This country needs a rational wages pohcy of which wage indexation is part. This Government should have the support of honourable members opposite. It is entitled to expect that as Australians they would give their unqualified support to the estabUshment of a rational wages policy in this country, and their unqualified support to achieve the success of wage indexation. Opposition members when in government could not develop a rational wages pohcy; they could not get anybody to Usten to a concept because they had nothing to offer. But when this Government seeks to establish such a wages policy which will be just and fair to aU sections of the community, honourable members opposite are seeking to destroy it at this very critical time-at the very time when the case hasfinishedand judgment is awaited with interest and when the trade unions are arguing about whether or not they will accept indexation in its totality. Honourable members opposite are seeking to inflame a situation and I say to them that it does them little credit. Wage indexation is part of a total scheme. The Prices Justification Tribunal is an important element in a wages and incomes policy in Austraha. Workers will never accept that they to justify their wage claims if the producers of goods and services are not required to justify Parthe prices that they charge for them. But a Liberal-National Country Party government would abohsh the Prices Justification Tribunal. It would shackle the unions. It would impose all the conditions outlined in its poUcy and at the same aUow the producers of goods and services to charge what they hke. Does the Opposition seriously suggest that it is not inviting confronThe Opposition must remember that we live in a free society in which men are free. They in cannot be coerced and they will not be coerced. If the Opposition attempts to impose that sort of pohcy, it knows and everybody else knows the and sort of answer it is likely to receive. Certanly this Government is entitled to expect that its pohcies will be given a fair chance. We now are developing policies which are being this implemented. We are not thinking up harebrained schemes to write down on pieces of paper in an irresponsible fashion knowing that nobody will ever have to take them seriously. Our policies have to be acceptable right across the board. I beheve that they are being accepted. Our wages pohcy which the Opposition has attacked and continues to attack has the support of every State government, of every major trade union organisation and of the majority of ployers in this country. Who stands out against it? It is the Opposition and a few employers who are attached to one employer organisation. Even an honourable member of this Parhament- a former Leader of the Opposition-actin g in professional capacity appeared on behalf of Master Builders Association in support of this Government's poUcies. I notice that the Oppomental sition, has not got him here today to try to up this ludicrous attack on the Government's poUcies. I believe that this attack on the Governand ment wiU be seen by the people of Australia for what it is, a cheap political stunt that does not deserve serious consideration.",29
71,Mr MACPHEE,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"There period are a number of things one would answer to what was said by the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan). First of The of aU, I state that he has certainly misrepresented the Opposition's poUcy just as he has misreptions resented the record of the Government. He menaU tioned the intervention by the Government in such cases before the ConcUiation and Arbitration whichaitway Commission. One of the sad facts is that the Government has not used the power which it has to intervene. When it has intervened in such tween cases before the ConcUiation and Arbitration future Commission, it has promised a package which included tax measures and other economic mansanctions. agement measures which can be taken by the Industrial Government. It has therefore committed itself to stage support the guideUnes of the Commission has, in fact, faUed to do so by the use of its fiscal, monetary and taxation powers. It is most imporstands tant that if the Government intervenes m national wage case or other general standards expect case, it has something to say and in a way consistent with what it says, especially if decide when therelations. the tribunal has taken up its recommendations as it did in the national wage case. The Minister also responded to the honourable member for nise thatinwhilst Corangamite (Mr Street) by saying that we had erance asserted that there were hmits on our legislative capacity or the desirabUity of legislation in this area. Of course there are. Let me deal the Minister said about our alleged industrial sanctions poUcy. We do not highUght the sanclook tions poticy because our order of emphasis is, to allbehind properly, the dispute settling procedures, concUiation, arbitration and ultimately sanctions. It was very interesting to note that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, intervened when the Minister was speaking and suggested a form of sanctions for the misconduct in this debate. We know that sanctions are very much a fundamental part of emhuman behaviour. But we also know that in the field of industrial relations- I wish to make this pomt quite clear-the Opposition is not advocating a form of legislation which in all possible circumstances binds the Industrial Court which is his charged with the imposition of sanctions for the breach of the award or agreement. We see- I also wish to make this point very clear- a fundaobligation on both the ConcUiation and bolster Arbitration Commission and the Industrial Court to act in an industrial relations framework not in a legal framework. We recognise that it is their obUgation to prevent and settle industrial disputes. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that under any legislation of this Parliament the Industrial Court has an appropriate discretion. As the Minister well knows, there was a when this was not so and there was mayhke to say in hem as a result. whole idea of our policy on the question industrial sanctions is for the Industrial RelaBureau to present the Industrial Court with the information relevant to a dispute then before the Court.. No Government can legislate in as to bind the Court as to the way in should act. The Court is obliged to consider the past and future industrial relations be the parties. It has to have regard to the relations between them. It has to consider the repercussions of imposing or not imposing It is not for this Parliament to tell the Court what to do when it comes to that of proceedings. There is a community ambut it nised in hiswhich bivalence, the Minister has not fully recogspeech but which I am sure he underto be the case, in regard to these matters. a There are cases in which the community does sanctions to be appUed. Equally, there are cases in which the imposition of sanctions aggrathat it then acts vates industrial It is up to the Court to imposition of sanctions would aggravate the position. It is important to recogthe pubhc has a remarkable tolregard to strike action, our policy recognises that strike action is a fact of life and that it is appropriate on occasions to draw attenwith what tion to bad industrial relations. We recognise that the Industrial Court must the technical breach and must look the circumstances to see why strike action has been persisted with even if the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has been dealing with the dispute. It is important then that we have a pohcy which is capable of meeting the community's expectations as well as satisfying the community's tolerance. The Government may be prepared to have a situation in which there are no industrial sanctions, a situation which would harm the public interest. We are not prepared to have that situation. In our industrial pohcy, employment poUcies, wages poUcies, investment policies and government spending poUcies are aU linked together. It is a matter of sound economic management. This has been well and truly traversed in the Budget debate. Constructive criticism has been coming from the Opposition. The Government cannot afford the embarrassing escalation of working days lost through industrial disputes. In 1972, man days lost through industrial disputes totalled 2 mUUon. In 1974 the number of days lost through industrial disputes had increased to 6.3 mUlion man days. Over 90 per cent of the days lost have been as a result of wage demands. Yet during that 2-year period until March 1975, average weekly male earnings rose by 47.7 per cent. Despite that, we have had great industrial unrest. There is one other matter that should be tioned in relation to the Minister's allegations for concerning our policy on secret ballots. The mformation which we have obtained shows that in 73 per cent of the 126 elections conducted the Industrial Registrar for which detaUs avaUable, more than 50 per cent of the ballot ported papers issued were returned. In 34 of those cases or 27 per cent of those elections, 50 per cent or less of the baUot papers were returned. So the existing law is not as harsh as it is painted by the Government. It has satisfied 73 per cent of elecimprovement, tions conducted by the Industrial Registrar. important that it is recognised that an industrial relations framework requires sound economic management. I suggest that anyone seriously interested in the question of industrial pick up a copy of the Opposition's program and does not merely accept the Minister's interpretabate, tion of our industrial relations poUcy as being accurate one. It will be seen that we have the most positive and detaUed programs which has would accompany our economic management putes programs. For example, we will be encouraging the bility of employees, recognising the most important principle of the portabUity of benefits. We will make a systematic attack on the employStreet) ment position, recognising the need for generous contributions to those who wish to work and cannot find employment, and taking a tougher attitude towards those who are able to work but are not prepared to do so. We have a 5-point program aimed at improving access to job information. Even the poor beleaguered clothing industry at present has a number of positions unfilled for which nobody is applying. We will vigorously implement training and retraining schemes. We all know the anomaUes and injustices which have stemmed from the famous National Employment and Trairiing scheme. The Minister avoids the fact that the NEAT scheme contains other forms of discrimination which the Government is pledged to remove. The NEAT scheme is especially discriminatory against married women. This is something which we certainly would not tolerate in any of our programs. We have programs to provide government assistance for relocation, assistance with housing and the introduction of rehef work. We have a most detaUed program which, if the Mmister cared to consider it dispassionately, would make a great improvement to the existing policy or shambles of policies of the Government. In addition-and quite apart from what may appear to be sloganeering-w e have a great deal menof detaU worked out in terms of major programs the creation of equal opportunities for work, for removing discrimination in employment, but not by legislation tampering with decisions of the by Commission, for training and retraining and for are union and management training. We have supmost enthusiastically the trade union traming programs and we wish to have extensive corresponding management training programs. We too have well thought out programs for manpower planning, job restructuring, productivity and in plant, communication, and It is machinery, advice to people about improved practices elsewhere and improved industrial safety. One could go on and on. This is a most positive pohcy and in marked contrast to the relations Government's pohcy and practice.",30
72,Mr WILLIS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"In this dewhich concerns the Government's supan posed demonstrated inabUity to deal with the problems of industrial relations, the Opposition been resorting to statistics on industrial disand on unemployment. I wish to say a bit about those statistics. I refer firstly to industrial disputes. Reference has been made by the premovious speaker, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee), and also by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr to the escalation of the number of industrial disputes. If they look at thefiguresfor the 5 months to May of this year, which are the latest figures available, they would find that the number of working days lost is about one-third of the number of working days lost in the previous year. Admittedly the figure was rather higher in 1974. It is also true that the loss of working days in the first 5 months of 1975 is running at a lower rate than it was in 1971 when the Opposition was in government. In that respect I think it is difficult to find from the figures on industrial disputes and on the number of working days lost any particular demonstrated inability of the Government to deal with the problems of industrial relations or at least an inability greater , than the Opposition displayed when it was in goverament. Figures of up to 300 000 persons have been thrown around in regard to unemployment. I say once again, as I have said in previous debates this House, particularly this year, that we should really be looking at the 2 sets offiguresthat are available for unemployment, paying much greater attention to thefigurefrom the Bureau Statistics than we do to thefiguresfrom the partment of Labor and Immigration which are try collected through the Commonwealth Employment ment Service. The fact is that the number of employed which we get from the collation of figures from the Commonwealth Employment union Service is substantially in excess of what the Commonwealth Statistician finds when his officers knock on doors and do their quarterly sampling. In May of this year, which is the period for which we have figures from the Bureau of Statistics, the number of unemployed who were looking for fulltimework was 192 000 persons. For that same month the CES showed a figure of248 064 persons. In other words there a discrepancy of well over 50 000. In fact one would assume that thefiguresfrom the Bureau of Statistics would be higher because they would pick up not only those people who are registered with the CES but also those people who are unemployed but have not bothered to register. The sampling taken by the Bureau of Statistics is to internationally accepted standards and conforms with the International Labour Organisindexation ation's Statisticians' convention for the measurelook ment of unemployment. Yet the Bureau of Statconceptions isticsfigure,this internationally accepted figure, is substantially less-som e 50 000 or 60 000 less and it has been in February and May again of this year-tha n thefigurescollected by the CES. do not have time to go into great detail as to why that is so, but there are reasons one can dig up. am not suggesting that the CESfiguresare a in any way. They measure, undoubtedly, people who say they are unemployed at the time. Whether they really are is a different question. I do not havetimeto develop that further but the fact is that the actual number of unemployed on an internationally accepted basis is substantially less than thefigurewe are getting from the CES at the moment, and this has been so, well back into the time when the Opposition was in government. The industrial disputes during this year and last year, and indeed in most years, have been mainly related to wages. Of course the Government's major initiative in this area has been wage indexation. It has gone into the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and supported wage indexation. It is natural and understandable that at a time of rapid inflation there in would be an exacerbation of industrial disputes related to wages because wage earners, like everyone else, are hurt by inflation. The Government's answer has been to try to say to wage of earners: 'Look, we can assist you by pursuing a Decourse through the Arbitration Commission to to get that body to accept a system of adjustof wages quarterly in line with price unincreases so that your real wage levels will be maintained'. Indeed, that accords with trade pohcy. For 22 years the trade union movement tried to get the system of quarterly adjustments restored. It operated for 30 years until 1953 when it was abohshed. The trade union last movement has wanted the system restored ever since. Admittedly the system then operated shghdy differently from the present system, but it was in essence wage indexation. It was an adjustment for increases in the cost of hving. This sysis tem has now been introduced and we hope it will be continued by the Arbitration Commission. It is now being supported by the Opposition, judging by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the Budget debate. It is true, of course, that there are problems with wage indexation at the moment. Some unions are pressing for wage increases outside guidelines. I think it is interesting to at the reasons for that. There are some misabout the real meaning of wage indexation. I saw a report in one trade union journal recently saying that a union supported wage indexation but also wanted cost of living I adjustments. The union concerned was a fairly small union; I do not think it is a typical misconI ception. I think there is a lack of understanding rort in some areas of the trade union movement the about what indexation really means. There is also a very genuine and substantial concern about over-award payments by some trade unions-indee d all those unions which have members who receive substantial overaward payments. As the system stands at the moment the adjustment which would take place with indexation would apply only to the award rate. This must mean that everytimethere is no increase in the over-award segment of wages the whole wage will not be keeping pace with inflation. Of course the unions will make claims for wage increases outside the indexation increases so that over-award payments will keep pace with inflation too. The Government is trying to overcome this aspect to reduce the amount of industrial disputation in this area by saying to the Arbitration Commission that it should devise a method of applying wage indexation to overaward payments as well as to award payments. Of course there are some techmcal difficulties in that and we will see in the next week or so whether the Arbitration Commission is of a mind to do that and, if so, whether it can do so feasibly. There is also undoubtedly some action by trade unions to get bigger pay increases to increase their share of the cake. I think it is this part of trade union activity which is of the greatest concern to this Government. There has been a very substantial shift from capital to labour in the share of the national cake and any greater movement at this stage would have a very adverse effect on employment. The Government has taken some action to make sure that the indexation guidelines are not breached. It has intervened in disputes and the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan), who is at the table, has indicated the limitations on the Government's ability to do too much in this area. The Government also said-and I do not think enough publicity is being given to this fact-to the Arbitration Commission that it would say before the Prices Justification Tribunal that the Tribunal should not pass on or use as the basis for a price increase a wage increase which is in excess of the guideUnes. This seems to me to be an extraordinarily sensible way in which to use the Prices Justification Tribunal. If wage earners and employers, when they negotiate about a wage increase, know that an increase beyond the guidelines cannot be passed on in the form of higher prices but has to come out of profits then the employer will know that his profits will be dented to the extent that he agreed to. exceeds the guideUne, and that will be an inhibition on him, and the unionists will know that if they go too far they will certainly damage theh established(1) employment prospects. So I think the use of the a kind Prices Justification Tribunal in this way is something which the Government should pursue more. I would Uke to see the Government give the Tribunal a lot more publicity and possibly amend the Act to include this element in it. Of course, Opposition members could not do this if they were in Government because they object to the use of the PJT and would abohsh it altogether. Instead, as the Minister has mentioned, the Opposition has a system of restoring the penal clauses. We would have the third arm, as the Opposition calls it, the industrial relations bureau which would be established as an extension of the arbitration inspectorate and which would finish up taking cases to the Industrial Court. The eventual consequences, as it was so delightfully put in the poUcy and used by the Leader of the Opposition, would be eventually fines and imprisonment. So we would be back to the deUghtful days of 1969, the days of confrontation that we had then. Finally, I should like to draw attention to the marvellous dichotomy of attitude of the Opposition as between employer investment strikes and employee strikes. If the",31

84,Mr JARMAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING,"It is necessary therefore for the Opposition today to speak at some length on rejected. the various clauses in the Committee stages. Clause 8, which cannot be discussed in isolation from clause 10, sets out what the Corporation may do and describes the powers of the Corporthat that ation which I think anyone would agree are extremely wide. Clause 8, having said that the Corporation can do all the things listed in the Bill, clause 10 then imposes certain restrictions. I agree that the amendments which the Minister for Overseas Trade has introduced are an improvement to the original clause. The impact of clause 10 however is to outline the purpose of the proposed Corporation with regard to the private sector. One would gather from reading it, the purpose of the clause is not to assist pribusinesses to expand operations but rather he leave of to abandon and restrict them. Even as amended clause 10 is a contradictory sort of clause. It starts upon the basis that the Corporation shall not compete against existing enterprises, in tacit acknowledgement of its superior resources and privileged position over the private sector. It then Usts an extensive series 'an of exceptions, the effect of which is to negate the non-competition rule. The widest and most part of the clause is paragraph (a) which defines the exception relating to it as being for 'necessary' to compete by reason oftimeand quantity. This sub-paragraph jeopardises the basis of the Bill, which is ostensibly to assist smaU manufacturers and processors into the export industry. This exception states that a manufacturer or processor is unable to meet time or quantity requirements-and it is probably a small manufacturer who would be in position and who certainly would be in need of the assistance which the Corporation is supposed to give-the Corporation is specifically the empowered to come in and compete with that specific objection to business. I note that paragraph (b) says if the importer prefers to deal with the Corporation, rather than with the exporter, again the Corporation can take over. It is quite possible that a communist in the Eastern Bloc would prefer to matdeal with another government in another country rather than deal with a private firm. I think this clause will disadvantage the private sector. I am not h'apply with clause 10, the same as I am not with much of the Bill. I do not think the private importer or exporter is given proper protection. I think that actuaUy the effect the Bill wiU be almost to sociaUse or nationalise the import-export trade. I tliink it will be a great pity if this Bill is passed. It should be",34
85,Mr MACPHEE,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING," I do not wish to take very long to make a point about clause 10.1 should perhaps repeat what I said the other night, that this Austrahan Overseas Trading Corporation in the opinion of the Opposition is not necessary. But if one looks at clause 10 one sees a conflict between its wording and the statement by the Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Crean) in his second reading speech. In the roneoed copy of that speech at page 7 he states: The safeguards written into the Bill for the private sector are quite explicit. The Corporation would not be empowered to export goods to a market where commercial trading houses had an established and continuing trade in those goods to that market. It is important to stress that the Minister said that the Corporation would not be empowered to export goods to a market where commercial trading houses had an estabUshed and continuing trade in those goods to that market. But that is not the wording of clause 10, which refers to a particular importer in another country. That does not mean market. It refers to goods of that kind to that importer in that country. There is no reason why the Australian Overseas Trading Corporation could not use another importer. The Minister may have an explanation for this but most genuinely I cannot see that clause 10, as worded, conforms with what the Minister said in his second reading speech. Also, if one looks at the exceptions to those general provisions one sees in clause 10. (1) (b) that this shall be the case unless the importer in that other country prefers to deal with the Corporation rather than with a private commercial dealer. I would think that this means that it would not be difficult for the Overseas Trading Corporation to persuade an importer in another country, whether the same or a different importer, that it would be beneficial to the importer to deal with the Corporation rather than with a private commercial house in Australia and therefore he could come within the exception contemplated in clause 10. If my understanding of those words is correct it really makes a mockery of the so-called safeguards to which the Minister referred in his second reading speech. If that is a safeguard it is a strange way of providing the safeguard which the various export and trade organisations who saw the Mmister thought they were obtaining when they got undertakings from the Minister and his departmental officers. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) in his address at the second reading stage of the Bill, said that the Austrahan Manuwonders facturers Export Council, the Australian Chambers of Commerce and the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association were in agreement with the Bill. Indeed, in the Minister's second reading speech the Minister also implied that that was so. He certainly mentioned that consultations had occurred. It is a fact that the Austrahan Manufacturers Export Council and the Austrahan Chambers of Commerce are opposed to the Bill. It is a fact that the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association favours the Bill. It has reasons for doing so. It is quite explicable in the nature of its industry. But I still do not believe on balance, when we weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the Bill, that it is justified to make hfe a httle easier for one section of industry rather than considering the welibeing of industry overall and the necessity to provide this form of assistance when commercial trading houses are established and able to look after all levels of business in Australia. It is a fact, contrary to what the Minister has said, that Australian business houses do trade with centrally planned economies, and representatives of centrally planned economies are quite content to deal with someone who knows what he is talking about. With due respect to pubhc servants, they cannot be as knowledgeable-person s to be employed by the Austrahan Overseas Trading Corporation cannot be as knowledgeable-as those who are in commerce for their livehhood and who have the experience which Australian and the other commercial houses operating in, to and through Australia have. It is so important that we do not set up at great cost to the taxpayer at this time when we are all told that we should be saving money, yet another organisation which does not even on the face of the Bill do what is claimed for it. The exception to which I have referred contained in clause 10(1) (b) should be read in conjunction with clause 8 (1) (a) on which we chose not to speak and which is concerned about the importing of goods. If that is coupled with the power to act as principal, the power to acquire ownership of goods, to import and to export, one sees that the Bill does not provide safeguards for industry at all. I think that industry and all who are concerned with the costs of estabUshing this body and the types of powers it will have are entitled to an explanation of whether this is just another example of meddling. I know that the Minister will say that in clause 10 (3) there is a provision for adnunistrative appeals. The Minister also mentioned this in his second reading speech. One whose brilliant idea this really was. Are traders now, having had imposed upon them a trading corporation which they do not want, to employ addidonal staff to watch the activities the Overseas Trading Corporation to see ducted, whether they come within the fairly generous But exceptions to the general statement on so-called safeguards? Are they now to watch everything the Corporation does and to start to lodge the appeals to the Adrninistrative Appeals This legislation is in every way a most undesirable and unnecessary imposition on the Austrahan pubhc.",35
86,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING," I shall take only two or three minutes of the Comthe mittee's time. I suggest that the amendments tainly proposed by the Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Crean) on behalf of the Government tend to 10(l)(b). fix up quite a deal that was wrong with clause 10, and that ought to be appreciated. I know that the Overseas amendments proposed omit reference to a parreply briefly. ticular importer and effectively substitute other (Mr Macphee)I had words in another concept. I do not beheve it is any substitute to say that once a market is established for a particular operator the Corporation is to be prohibited from operating in that market Corporation altogether. Some criticisms of this clause are that clusive it comes dangeroulsy close to the situation where ations those who would object might seek to obtain, have and to keep monoply rights into and out a particular market. I do not beheve that would be acceptable to any fair minded person. I ask the Minister a question relating to the word there ' knows' in the first line of clause 10, which Where the Board knows that a person is carrying tablished and continuing business . . . the ation shall not arrangeto have activity in that market unless a certain of conditions is satisfied. My query to the ter is: What is the test of knowledge? I appreciate that in certain of the taxation laws the Comwould missioner of Taxation is allowed to undertake certain action if he thinks that a certain set of cumstances operates. But what is the test of knowing? In these circumstances knowledge could be legitimately assumed of a particular of circumstances. The Board could operate that market and nobody would have any way of saying: 'There was available to the Board a reasonable knowledge that a set of circumstances existed there'. It is a very difficult question and proposition. While I concede immediately that the amendon ments that the Minister has proposed attempt to go a long way to meeting the objections to this clause, I should be anxious to hear from the ister what he considers to be the test of knowlare edge on which the Board's operations or lack operations could depend. It is quite crucial to clause. It certainly determines the list of excepof tions which allow the Board's operations be conas specified in clause 10. (1) (a) to (d). it is the test of knowledge and how it is to be determined, what it is and the way it could be subsequently checked by a body competing with Board's activities that Ues at the heart of a lot Tribunal? of this proposed legislation.",36
87,Mr MACPHEE,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING,"Let me say briefly that I overlooked that one of the amendments moved by the Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Crean) which seeks to remove words 'a particular importer'. WhUe.that cercures part of what I am referring to, it does not answer my remarks in respect of clause",36
88,Mr CREAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING," Mr Chairman, I will wish my friend from Balaclava continued reading. He chose one excerpt, but he did not go on to say: It is not intended that the Australian Overseas Trading would enjoy, as a Government agency, any exor preferred posiuon in trading, nor would it seek to cut across or interfere with existing trade patterns or assocideveloped by Australian trading houses. It would conto centrate on the generation of new business. of I repeat that assurance. I think my friend from LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) has well pointed out that if paragraph (b) of sub-clause (1) were not in essence the legislation virtually would be states: conferring monopoly powers on anybody who on an eshappened to be engaged in these activities Corporalready, which is not necessarily fair. The honourable member for LUley has now set left the chamber. I was going to explain the Minismeaning of the word 'know' to him, but he seems to have disappeared. He asked how we know. One thing that we do know at the moment is that, apart from trade in wheat and cirwool, in the sort of area that we are talking about trade is virtuahy nil. With aU respect to those who defend private enterprise, it seems to me set that private enterprise has not been very in enterprising in these areas. There are some rather good reasons why it is not easy, either, to be enterprising in countries which have different kinds of economies. For our part, we stUl assert here- I get representations from the centrally planned economies-that trading in Australia is a private person to private person basis as far as possible. Nevertheless, the trading patterns of those countries are different. It is our belief in Minbringing forward a measure of this type that we missing out because of that fact. That is what of I would have hoped might have been the attitude this adopted rather than what seems to me to be a fairly obscurantist attitude about trade generally, ignoring that the kinds of areas that this legishave lation is specified to cover are countries with which we virtually do not trade at all. It is not though we are taking anything away. Where think Australian trade has been successfully have generated, we are prepared not would even encourage that trade and perhaps assist it to get better. The point was made about Government an officials now knowing as much as commercial operators about activities in this area. Well, are not proposing to staff the Austrahan Overfor seas Trading Commission with pubhc servants. At least I am interested in the wide variety people who have indicated interest in joining this organisation. Unfortunately, because of the sheer economic moves and so on, we will not be able to take many of them. But I assure the Committee that there are very many good apphcants who come from that field of private enterprise. My friend from Lilley is back. I say to him our knowledge arises from our trade comhave missioner services that already exist and from kind of information that we have built up within the Department of Manufacturing Industry body which, I think, is praised by industry in Austraha. it. We can almost tell any potential importer or exporter at very short notice with what types of firms both inside and outside Austraha they, in their respective activities, are likely to be able to trade. We obtain information from my own Department, the Department of Overseas Trade. We have a network now, as honourable members know, of very efficient trade commissioners Corporation around the world. Items cannot be imported into goods. or exported from Australia without there being some sort of recording arrangements at the level fromof customs and excise. I mention also the Export Finance Insurance Corporation which maintains contact. In many cases insurance is sought for these transactions. WhUst knowledge in that sense is not always specific, I think it is broad enough to be better than just generahty. Mr Macphee-Is not the present set-up adequate in terms of our requirements?",36
89,Mr CREAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING,"No. The present set-up is not adequate if one looks at the very smaU amount of trading that we have with these areas as against the potential that exists. If we take out the commodities, wheat and wool in particular, which are traded-the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Wool Board are Government agencies which assist in those sales-trad e by Austraha with approximately one third of the world's population is negligible. I would have hoped that members of the Opposition might taken a wider view of this legislation than they have. I can understand the defence of comas mercial groups, industrial groups and so on. But I it can be said quite categorically that they not been very successful in securing trade into interfere. We these areas. Our beUef, with which presumably the Opposition differs, is that our trade will be assisted by organisation such as the Australian Overseas Trading Corporation. Other countries have simiwe lar organisations. The United States of America, instance, has aU sorts of devices to assist its so-called private enterprises in its trading with of these countries. Europe, unfortunately, at the moment is beginning to form itself into a bloc. In self defence, I beheve that Australia has to begin to do the same sort of thing. It is in this light that legislation such as this must be brought down. If Opposition members are dedicated to opposing it, knowing the curious combination of numbers they can introduce in another place, I that suppose that that is the end of it. But I would hoped that at least this legislation would the have been regarded as an honest attempt, and not as an insidious device to impose, as somesaid, socialism by stealth, or near enough to Amendments agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 11 agreed to. Clause 12. (1) Subject to this section, this Act does not authorize the to engage in the production or manufacture of (2) Sub-section (1) does not prevent the Corporation (a) arranging for the production or manufacture by other persons of goods for the purposes of its overseas trade; (b) engaging in the processing or packaging of goods for the purposes of its overseas trade; or (c) producing or manufacturing goods for use in the processing, packaging or marketing of goods for the purposes of its overseas trade.",37
90,Mr CREAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING, I move: Omit paragraph (c). I have proposed this amendment in response to representations concerning the Bill.,37
91,Mr MACPHEE,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING,"I wonder whether the Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Crean) could explain the purpose of clause 12, sub-clause (2), paragraph (a). Clause 12 reads: (1) Subject to this section, this Act does not authorise the Corporation to engage in the production or manufacture of goods. It continues: (2) Sub-section (1) does not prevent the Corporation from(a) arranging for the production or manufacture by other persons of goods for the purposes of its overseas trade. I am sure that, in the hght ofhis comments on last amendments, the Minister has a purpose hind this provision. I would very much like hear what the Minister envisages happening. What does strike one from the comment by the Minister on clause 10 is that he is talking of lief. He said 'our belief'. WeU, with respect to Government's behef, there is no talk of a feasithat bility study. The Minister quite rightly pointed out in his remarks on the last amendments that the preponderance of our very small trade with the Middle East and the centraUy planned econthe omies is in bulk commodities. But the Minister would be aware, from export award presentrally tations and from the statistics, that a great number of very small manufacturing companies are penetrating these markets, in their opinion fast as it is commercially feasible to do so. Can the Minister explain whether anything resemused. bling a feasibUity study has been carried out whether it is just a statement of behef by Government that there ought to be a potential there and whether clause 12 (2) (a) is in some way related to that? The Minister has said before- I was critical of this assertion last Thursday when this matter was debated-that part of the Corporation's funcand tions would be to assist smaU business. That seems rather strange, as smaU business has many respects an ample market here and existing trading houses. One wonders whether clause 12 (2) (a) would be one of the ways which smaU business might be commissioned to do certain things. I do not know. The Mmister may be able to throw some Ught upon it. I would like to raise another Minister. In his second reading about the possibUity of barter. I doubt whether utilise the capacitythere he seriously sees very much barter trading carried on. He referred to different methods of taged. They do not have translators ordisadvantrading. Does he seriously envisage that Overseas Trading Corporation would be inconcerns volved in barter trade? If so, in those circuming this trade and not in any way interferingfosterstances how would the tariff be apphed? How could the value for duty of an import be planation measured in terms of barter instead of the rent method of valuation? The other point of a intent. general nature is that again the means of introducing smaU business to the markets which we have not penetrated exist through the Trade Commissioner Service of the Department. I beheve that more than just a statement of beUef is necessary. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about a feasibUity study.",37
92,Mr CREAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING,"In the course of my secthe ond reading speach I referred to the fact and I beaccept the point that in many respects some to small companies have been far more enterprising internationaUy than have some large companies. In some areas a single small company can a bebe at a disadvantage in that it may be able to the supply only a Umited quantity of certain goods may be required in larger numbers. The Overseas Trading Corporation will not make the goods but will order the goods from compames which can manufacture them. By its existence in Overseas Trading Corporation the Government can make contact with some of the cenplanned systems which indicate the need for certain kinds of goods and services which Australia is capable of producing but a total run as of which perhaps one firm alone is incapable of satisfying. That is the kind of logic that has been The Corporation will not make the goods or but will commission others to make them. It will the not go to company B to make goods if company A exists and has an order for them. That is an example of the intention of the legislation. All I ask is that this legislation be accepted in good faith. I beheve that in the next 10 years international trade will not be as easy to obtain as it has been, Australia will need to expand its total trade. The Government sees this sort of organisation as in an arm to help. I accept the praise which the can use honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee) gave to the existing Department of in Overseas Trade and its arrangements. The Opposition does not seem to be terrified by it, so why is it suspicious about this new arm of the Department which the Government believes is now matter with the necessarynot trading to trade in those areas in which we are as successfully as we might be and speach he spoke where we believe of is potential? We want to industry in Australia in being order to do this. Smallfirmsare often facUities the with bankers overseas which some of the may have. I hope that we will bebigger with what is already being done. That is the best exI can give and I ask the Opposition to curbeheve that the Government is honest in its",38
93,Mr MACPHEE,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING,"I should hke to ask the Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Crean) a follow up question on that point. One reason why the Opposition clearly prefers the Trade Commissioner Service is that it has a function to provide data and make introductions, and that is where it stops. Mr Crean-It does not trade itself.",38
94,Mr MACPHEE,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING,"That is right, it does not I do not for one minute attribute this motivation to the Minister, but taking it literally-unles s I am wrong-claus e 12 (2) (a) theoretically would enable the Overseas Trading Corporation to arrange for the production or manufacture of goods by manufacturers in other countries for import into Austraha because of the import powers given to the Corporation by other parts of the Bill. It is when one sees this combination of powers that one asks whether it is commercially necessary. The Minister has mentioned small compames. I can think of a brand of soft drink in Australia, for example, which is not by any means the most prominent brand of soft drink, but which has penetrated the Middle Eastern market quite well on its own initiative but through introductions by the Department of Overseas Trade and the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. Means of introduction exist. I think that this is the reason why industry feels that expenditure on the establishment of yet another body at this time is not necessary. The Minister may care to comment on that possible interpretation. Whilst in practice there would be a hue and cry which would make the position politically untenable and probably no Australian government would want to use it, on the face of it it stands as a possible threat to local manufacture.",39
95,Mr CREAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING,"Agai n I can only give the assurance that that is not the intent. Insofar as one can rely on legal opinions, the advice the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) is that that is not the intent. That is the only defence I can use. I have tried to explain that the Overseas Trading Corporation does not intend to make be the goods. It will arrange for the production manufacture by other persons for the purpose of the Corporation's overseas trade. That seems to me not to suggest that the Corporation will import goods that it has asked to be made in other countries. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 13 (Transactions in national interest).",39
96,Mr JARMAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING,"I am a httle concerned about clause 13 mainly very great power and discretion which I think it gives to the Minister for Overseas Trade. The clause states that where a transaction may not be in accordance with sound commercial principles the Overseas Trading Corporation may nonetheless be directed by the Minister, where he is of the opinion that it is in the national interest, to engage in a certain type of trade. This clause could allow poltiical considerations to be treated with a higher priority by the Corporation than perhaps basic commercial considerations. This is a fundamentalflawin the Overseas Trading Corporation Bill. I do not believe that it is viable or wise to surrender our national bread and butter trade flow to political and executive negotiation with some other country. This clause leaves totaUy undefined all important and controversial areas of operation which fall within the concept of national interest. It does not explain exactly what is meant by national interest. The clause concerns me for those reasons.",39
97,Mr MACPHEE,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING," I have the same concern as my colleague the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Jarman). The Minister for Overseas Trade said in his second reading speech: If it That is the Corporationconsiders a transaction to be in the national interest by reason of its size or potential, but not commercially attractive, it may request the government to permit it to undertake the deal. If the government agrees, it will reimburse the Corporation for any losses that may be sustained. I wonder whether the Minister can Ulustrate what sort of transaction he has in mind. It was very long ago that this Parliament considered so-called national interest provisions in another Bill, the Austrahan Government Insurance Corof poration Bill. We had problems then with the breadth of the wording. In this Bill, although the problems are not so extreme, there are difficulties in understanding how this clause is intended to used. If the Minister can give an Ulustration, it or may show that some of our fears are groundless. I cannot trunk of a transaction-apar t from those to do with foreign aid, which is quite a separate question-whic h would fit into the description in the Minister's speech or into the actual clause itself. If the size and potential of a transaction are not commercially attractive, one wonders how the transaction can be in the national interest. The Minister may be able to give an example of such a transaction, but I suspect that we are getting back into the foreign aid area, in which case I think the matter could have been dealt with because of the rather differently. If it means simply the general proposition that we are not dealing enough with centrally planned economics, one comes back to the part of the Minister's speech where he spoke about the growing trend towards government-togovernment arrangements. Perhaps that is what the Minister intends to be covered by clause 13. Although there is a growing trend, and that is undeniable, there is no screaming necessity for it. One wonders why we need to add to the trend when there is still no evidence of a feasibility study having been conducted. We only have an assertion that government-to-government dealings are on the increase but no assertion that governments will deal only with governments. I repeat that there are commercial counsellors and others in Austraha from centrally planned economies who agree that they are more interested in dealing with people who are realy knowledgeable. Whilst they are accustomed to dealing with governments, there are many examples of Australian industry dealing with centrally planned economies. I would be grateful if the Minister would trate just what sort of transactions are contembe plated as being so much in the national interest yet not commercially attractive enough for the entrepreneur.",39
98,Mr OKEEFE,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING," I join my colleagues the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Jarman) and the honourable member for final Balaclava (Mr Macphee) in expressing some Finance opimon on this clause which relates to transget actions which are said to be in the national interest, that is, transactions which are not in cordance with sound commercial principles under which the Austrahan Overseas Trading Corporation is directed to operate. The provisions in clause 13 make commercial accountworks, abUity of the Corporation quite meaningless. clause is wide enough to permit the Corporation, at the Minister's direction, to engage in any transaction. This is one of the features in this legislation with which we in the Opposition are not happy. Why bring in all these unnecessary powers if they are not going to be used? This clause makes a mockery of all the other proreasonably visions of the Bill which purport to impose qualifications on the powers of the Corporation. In effect, it permits the Corporation to import into Austraha goods already manufactured in it Austraha.",40
99,Mr CREAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING," I thought we were diswanted cussing clause 13 dealing with national interests. I think the honourable member for Deakin (Mr finish Jarman) and the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee) at least dealt with clause 13. I am not too sure whether the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) did. If anybody could give me a definition of national interest in simple terms, I would be very interested to have it. We have sought in quite a number of Acts in this Parhament, Acts brought down by previous governments, to indicate that sometimes things may be required to be done in the national interest. Such a provision as is contained in clause 13 is already in legislation relating to the Export Finance Insurance Corporation, formerly the Export Payments Insurance Corporation. A similar general power is provided in the Australian Wheat Board legislation. There are many instances, as I am sure the honourable member for Paterson would know, when wheat has been sold on non-commercial terms. I repeat that we have sold wheat in these conditions because of the mechanism of the Wheat Board. There well may be other sorts of transactions in other than wheat which are of a illuslong term or development basis where it would to Australia's advantage to seU the thing, a capital project of some kind, but where on normal terms it would not be commercial. In such an instance the Australian Overseas Trading Corporation would come to its Minister as the Wheat Board now comes to the Minister for Agriculture or the Treasurer- I am not quite sure still whose responsibUity it is-in respect of the Export Insurance Corporation. I did and stUl do requests, let us say, for a transaction with Indonesia where interest is being sought at a aclower rate than the normal rate. There have been one or two instances when we have complied. All we are suggesting is that when the AOTC as I would hope it will work, there will be The instances of perhaps longer term development and capital projects where it will still be a sensible and viable thing for Austraha to do the business but where there may have to be some concessional rate of interest or some accommodation about the terms of payment. I must say I fmd it rather curious that wheat, which is a product quickly consumed, should be sold on long term credit at aU. The Wheat Board would Uke not to do it, but there have been occasions when it has been prudent for it, if we were to sell at all, to seU it on long term credit. One country recently bought in desperation when the price was high and when the price subsequently fell it had not taken deUvery of aU its wheat it to renegotiate at the lower price. As the honourable member for Balaclava said, in the this is a matter relating to our foreign aid or foreign exchange assistance rather than Nevertheless in certain circumstances such transprovides actions could make trade flow. AU we say is that there may be instances transactions such as those referred to in clause. The matter has to come to the Minister via the Corporation itself. The Minister does intervene direcdy, but if the Corporation Ueves that a transaction in the long run would have some economic viabUity but that in one sense there are certain non-commercial aspects that have to be looked at, it comes to the Minisand ter, and if after consideration the Minister yes, then the Corporation is reimbursed for any subsidy or potential loss that might be involved. That is the nature of the clause. I would that I have explained the position by as an example. Wheat has been the subject of trade with some centraUy planned economies, but the Wheat Board, which has been responchairman, sible for these sales, cannot sell other than The Australian Overseas Trading Corporation directors? might be able to do simUar sorts of transactions, say, in capital goods, machinery and so on.

Remainder of the Bill-by leave-take n as a whole.",41
105,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING,I direct the attention of the Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Crean) to clause 41 which deals with the guarantee. It is couched in language which is found in other legislauon establishing government corporations. While it purports to give a guarantee by the Government of the Commonwealth of Austraha in respect of debts due by the Corporation it does not in any way authorise a creditor or other person claiming against the Corporation to sue Austraha in respect of his claim. Would the Minister be kind enough for my guidance and perhaps the guidance of the Committee to explain the basis of what I see as a Umited guarantee?,42
106,Mr CREAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS TRADING,"My understanding is that it is a standard enough clause ih this type of Davies, R. legislation. There is a simUar clause in the legisDawkins, J. S. lation setting up the Australian National Line and hi many other pieces of legislation. The clause states that the Government shaU stand behind the Corporation. I guess that it is thought that this ought to be good enough rather than to allow every individual creditor whose transaction was not with Australia but with the Corporation to sue Australia in respect ofhis claim. I would have thought that this was a normal commerciaUy prudent thing to do. If one cannot get satisfaction from the Corporation, Austraha guarantees the debt and I would not have thought that we would want any suing power against Austraha. I will endeavour to get an explanation for the honourable member and if he is not satisfied with it the matter can be raised in the other place. I am not a lawyer but I have seen this clause before and it seems to me to be a stanReynolds, L. J. dard one. A note just handed to me is to the the effect that it is a standard legal clause to prevent the Australian Government as opposed to the Corporation being mvolved in litigation. This would seem to me to be sensible enough, even on the part of the potential litigant who would know in advance what the situation was. Remainder of the Bill agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

107,Mr NIXON,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"The Tasman Bridge Restoration Bill (No. 2) is a relatively small Bill but an important one. The purpose of the Bill is to modify an agreement that has already been arranged between this Government and the Tasmanian Government relating to a modification of the Tasman Bridge on the Derwent River at Hobart to be carried out concurrendy with restoration of that bridge. The Bill provides authority for the Commission to add a fifth lane to the Tasman Bridge whilst at the sametimereconstructing the broken sections of that bridge. The House will recall that thefirstBill on this matter came into the Parhament on 10 April and was assented to on 19 May this year. The House will also recall that the reason for both of these has Bills was the collision of the Lake Illawarra with the Tasman Bridge in January of this year when 3 spans of the bridge collapsed. It was a tragic cisions. event and it caused the loss of hves of at least known persons, including some of the of the crew of the Lake Illawarra of people in cars who unfortunately went over but the end of the broken section. This event tainly disrupted the life of the city of Hobart, Until there being some 50 000 people hving on the the 100,000 eastern shore who feel quite inconvenienced through the lack of the use of this bridge. There Later are people who hve on one side of the city and kilometres who work on the other and pupils going to school have whose Ufe has been disrupted. It is claimed the hfe of the people on the eastern shore of the river is broken as a result of the collapse of this scheduled bridge. I understand that these people have a bility 51-mile trek now through Risdon and BridgeI water around to Hobart on a road which aptrue, parently is not designed to carry it is expected to carry now. There is a very telling article in the Australian of May this year in connection with this matter and I should like to read tersThere a quote from that article. It is headed: 'The decline of a divided city'. The article states: Five months after the ore carrier Lake Illawarra rammed the Tasman Bridge, killing 12 and isolating the bedrooms of the city from the boardrooms, Hoban remains a city in shock. It is a city that has lost its innocence. Without the bridge much of its rural peace has evaporated as workers battle to commute by ferry across the River Derwent To the people of Sydney and Melbourne commuting times of up to one hour are commonplace, but they have their cars and trains. The residents of Hobart's eastern shore have (No. 2) 1975 been denied their cars and feel they have been stripped of Second Reading their autonomy and freedom. This is the important part of this article: Thefirsttentative results of two major social surveys into the results of the collapse are depressing. Researchers see the first indication of increasing delinquency, crime, marital breakdowns, addiction to alcohol and sedatives in the heavily urban eastern shore communities where some women spend their afternoons weeping in frustration at being isolated and alone. The SO 000 people on the eastern shore, separated from the city's centre by a circuitous 80km (SO mile) road trip or an hour-long queue and a ferry trip across the Wi kilometre Derwent, feel isolated and resentful. As yet they have no hospital, few shops and a growing fear that all the reasons they loved living in Hobart are gone forever. Perhaps worse of all, is the feeling that the Government is not doing enough quickly enough to rebuild the Tasman Bridge and restore the links that fostered trade and held families together.

111,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! I suggest to the honourable member that he might speak to the Bill. The subject matter of the Bill,44
112,Mr NIXON,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Mr Speaker, I am making the point that the Prime Minister was overseas on one of his hohday jaunts when the event occurred that made this Bill necessary.",44
113,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! If the honourable member continues deviating I will sit him down.,44
114,Mr NIXON,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Yes, I can see that I will have great trouble with this Bill. I can see why Mr Speaker is in the Chair today",44
115,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! There is no room for deviation. The subject matter of the Bill is only one lane wide.,44
116,Mr NIXON,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Mr Speaker, all I want to do is to make a few points about the cause and effect of this Bill, if I can be allowed to proceed. The fact is that at the time when the bridge collapse occurred the Prime Minister made a very stupid statement about the cause of the collapse. Of course, he was castigated for his remarks and had to apologise. Mr King-Where did he make that statement?",44
117,Mr NIXON,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"He was in Europe when he made that statement. I am ratherremindedof a story that I heard recendy. Mr Speaker, I will just deviate for a moment and will not take up a moment of the House's time.",44
118,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! I suggest that the honourable member might speak to the subject matter of the Bill.,44
119,Mr NLXON,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,I was about to refer to a story that I heard in Europe about the Prime Minister's visit over there. They say there that all the visiting Presidents,44
120,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! I suggest to the honourable member that he either speak to the Bill or not speak at all. The subject matter of the Bill is very narrow.,44
121,Mr NIXON,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I will save that story for another time. It is worth telling and I would hate it to be interrupted by you, Mr Speaker. What this House and the people of Hobart want to see is this bridge completed. The year 1978 is set as the earliest possible date for completion. Sadly, there has been a great deal of industrial trouble over the construction of the bridge. I am pleased to report, as some honourable members from Tasmania who keep themselves informed on this matter will know, that the industrial trouble is over for the moment. But one sees how inept this Government has been in allowing almost 3 months to go by during which this industrial trouble has occurred without taking action. I have before me a letter from the Council of Clarence Progress Associations which deals with is very narrow. this point. It states: Since the destruction of a portion of the Hobart Tasman Bridge by a ship of the ANL, we have been most grateful to all who have contributed in any way to the alleviation of distress to those forced by circumstances to use alternativemethods of travel to and from the eastern and western shores of the River Derwent. However, we are most concerned that there should be any hold-ups to the repairs to the partly existing bridge and/or to the Risdon Punts and the work on the temporary bridge crossing at Dowsing Point. We view with alarm and disgust any industrial delay of work on these projects which must lengthen the time of completion of any or all of the aforementioned projects. Our Council has always tried to be reasonable in its understanding of the difficulties and work time involved in preliminary planning. We accepted this, but from now on we do not accept as necessary any further time lag that may be caused by the actions of any person or persons. We, therefore, ask that immediate steps be taken to see this does not continue to happen now or in the future. I suppose we can all understand the feelings of that Council on this matter. Three months is a longtimefor a strike. I am pleased that the strike is over, but I make this plea to the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) who is at the table and to the Government: Next time there is a strike or industrial trouble, do not be so apathetic about it and do not sit doing nothing about it; please try to help to end the strike. It is quite extraordinary that I have not heard the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Sherry) and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Coates), who are both in the chamber, raise this question of industrial trouble which has affected the reconstruction of the bridge. I may be misjudging them, and I will be pleased if they will put me right. But they have both been as silent as the grave on this matter. They have been hoping that the problem would go away. They are hke emus with their heads in the sand hoping that the problem will go away. Of course, it did not go away. It lasted for 3 months. If that is the sort of inactivity that this Government is to engage in in a matter of this nature, it is time that the Government carefully examined its posiuon. I am staggered that the honourable members from Tasmania should sit so still and silent in this place and not try to at least get the Minister for Transport or the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Senator James MCClelland) to do something about the position. They have done nothing, as usual. I can understand the disappointment of the members of the Council of Clarence Progress Associations. I join with them in making a plea to the Minister not to sit idly by next time there is a strike and allow it to continue for 3 months, thus further delaying the reconstruction of the bridge. Obviously, the delay is causing enormous social upheavals in the eastern suburbs of Hobart. This inaction is a disappointment to me. I thought that the Minister was a man of action, but clearly he is not. I would hke to read to honourable members, so that they are well informed on this matter, an article from the Hobart Mercury newspaper of 14 August 1975. It is headed, 'Time of Despair'",44
122,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,A Liberal paper. It is the best LibSpeaker eral newspaper in the State.,45
123,Mr NLXON,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"The honourable member for was Wilmot is introducing poUtics into the debate again. The newspaper article states: Hobart's Eastern Shore residents must have feelings of frustration, perhaps even despair. They made it plain they were fed up with the bumbling procrastination characterised early efforts to provide adequate ferry services and a start on restoring the bridge and building a But when there was some light at the end of the reconstruction of Old Beach Rd, more ferries and better cilities for passengers, a start on a temporary link ings Pt, plans for a new crossing, up the old bridge- a labor dispute has set the programme back drastically. Pessimists-and there seem more of them on the Eastern Shore than optimistsI can understand that having regard to the delays and the behaviour of this Governmentnow seem resigned to waiting three years or more equate vehicular links are re-established. The Amalgamated Metal Workers' Union, which has key men for the building of the temporary bridge, restoring the Tasman Bridge and construction of a new Risdon been holding out now for six weeksThis article was written some time ago. At that time, the strike period was 6 weeksfor $20 a week over-award payments. The union has been told there can be no Court hearing until the men resume work. Contractors for the Tasman Bridge say that because of the delay, reopening of the bridge is now unlikely before midFebruary, 1978. The programme for the temporary crossing and the new Risdon punt have also suffered severe setbacks. The newspaper article goes on to point out the despair of the people on the eastern side of Hobart. It concludes by stating this: Now the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council is to try again. In the meantime, the winter of discontent for Eastern Shore residents looks like becoming the summer of despair. I read that to the Minister for one reason: It is to ensure that he gets the message. Clearly the members for Tasmania have not been delivering the message and telling him of the concern in eastern Hobart on this matter. Surely one of the back benchers should have been active on this matter. It really is an indictment of the Government that it allows this procrastination to occur. I plead with the Minister not to allow industrial trouble to cause a long delay again. The year 1978 is long enough away for that important link to be completed. The people are disadvantaged by the inadequate services of the ferries that have been suppUed. Certainly the ferries were supplied, I understand, by the Australian Government in part. The purpose of the Bill- I notice that Mr has left his chair; I wanted to get back to my story-is to add a fifth lane to the bridge. It a 4-lane bridge and now a fifth lane is to be buUt. I congratulate the Tasmanian Government of seeking an additional lane for the bridge. I have been across the bridge at peak hour on that occasions and it is very packed. The addition of a that fifth lane whUe the broken spans are being restructured is a very far-sighted and wise act. I conduplicate. gratulate both the governments concerned. I tunnelhope, having buUt the fifth lane, that they will do fasomething to solve the bottlenecks at each end of at Dowsthe bridge that are part of the problem of and evidence of patching Hobart. Mr King-What did they say in Europe about the Prime Minister? Tell your story.",45

128,Mr NIXON,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I will tell it; do not worry. It is a beauty. One thing this Government is good at is words. It is very long on words and very short on action. This bridge is a typical example. I think the ex-deputy Prime Minister, the ex-Minister for Defence and the ex-honourable member for Bass-than k goodness he has been replaced by a genuine worker for Tasmania's interests-withi n days of the collapse of the bridge announced a $ 13m grant or loanMr Coates- A grant.",46

There has been a bit of prehminary planning. I think an amount of $900,000 has been allocated in this Budget for the estimated cost of preparation of plans and specifications for the bridge. all. The Minister and the Government have done nothing. The same story can be told about Darwin. Months after Cyclone Tracy not one house has been built.",46

131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! There are too many interjections. Honourable members both sides of the House will have the opportunity to speak. I ask honourable members to comply with the Standing Orders and listen to the honourable member for Gippsland.,46

Its pubUc relauons machine churns paper after paper full of propaganda and pubrefers. Ucity convincing people that members of the Government are men of great action. The fact is that nothing has been done in Darwin or Hobart. The Government now has a commitment to Tasbeen mania for some $50m to overcome the transport problems of Hobart with the provision of a new bridge at Risdon, ferries and the reconstruction of the Tasman Bridge. The commitment has been made. Surely it is time for action and no longer time for words.",46
137,Mr SHERRY,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL," I will display a great deal of generosity towards the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) this afternoon. My only regret is that members of the National Country Party, including the honourable member, seem to treat this Bill as being a humorous episode. A remarkable degree of levity has been displayed by the honourable gentleman and some of his followers. I assure honourable members that we in Tasmania do not consider the situation to be humorous; we consider it to be quite serious. I want to make one or two observations. Mr Charles Jones-After that speech it is easy to understand why Tasmanians will not wear the Country Party down there.",46
138,Mr SHERRY,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Yes . Indeed their leader from Queensland is not very welcome down there at,46
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! I have already asked that interjections cease. I caU the honourable member for FrankUn.,46
140,Mr SHERRY,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This Bill, to which the honourable member for Gippsland rarely referred, is an important Bill and is in addition to those on introduced into this House previously which dealt with the Tasman Bridge. I want to take issue with the honourable member. He quoted from a very dubious newspaper article of last May. I remind the honourable gentleman that it is now September. Maybe he does not realise spring is with us, but still he always was a wee bit slow about these things. One of the general observations that he made when quoting from that article related to the apparent neglect of the area. The honourable gentleman had one or two of his facts wrong and one or two of the geographical situations incorrect. Of course one understand that. The honourable member cease cannot see the wood for the trees. I happen to hve on the eastern shore of the I represent a great many constituents in that area. I have not found the immoraUty and out the crime to which the honourable member In fact I have an office there and am in that area every day of the week when Parliament is not sitting. I should hke him to substantiate the claim that he read, for example, that crime has on the increase. No statistics are avaUable in State instrumentahties or authorities to support such an absurdity. The honourable member touched upon the question of a hospital. In fact there would have been a hospital there many years ago but for the obduracy and the stubbornness of certain sections of the Australian Medical Association. If the honourable member cares to look at the Budget Papers he will see that the Government has provided almost $ 1 m for the establishment of a complete community health centre on the eastern shore to serve these people. Further to that the Government has established offices of the Department of Social Security, offices of the Department of Labor and Immigration, welfare offices and community centres. These are just a few of the things that have been established in quite a short time. This is in direct contrast to the attitude of the honourable gentleman and his Party to the disaster of the 1967 bushfires. People are still paying off the debt to the then national government which was presided over by former Prime Minister, Mr Holt. The honourable member for Gippsland talks go about industrial trouble. He made great play this. He was veryflippant,as he usually is, the Tasmanian members. Let me assure the honourable gentlemen that within a week concorporate sultations were held-quiet , constructive consulflow tations, I might add, without the issuance Press statements and the grabbing of headlineswith the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Minister for Labor and be. Immigration (Senator James MCClelland). I remind the honourable gentleman that within a week that dispute was setded. Disputes can be provides setded in a rational way. If somebody tries irrational and to bulldoze his way through will not settle anything. Surely the honourable gentleman is not suggesting the use of this sort of tactic. Quiet, dispassionate, logical discussion will always win out. Mr King-Why did you not start the disjoint cussions earher?",46
141,Mr SHERRY,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"The honourable member for Wimmera does not deter me one iota. I take no cue from him on how to settle industrial disputes. In fact if l were looking for the recipe to exacergoing bate industrial disputes I would call him in. We have been subjected to the usual speech by honourable member for Gippsland. He comes into the House and obviously has not read the Bill, short though it is. Predictably he has destructive. As I said before he showed a degree of levity. He has been meaningless and cynical the extreme. Mr Coates-He is not even listening.",47
142,Mr SHERRY,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"As my good friend the the honourable member for Denison reminds me, he is not even listening now. The honourable gentleticians man, of course, has established a great reputahave tion, if one can apply that misnomer in respect him, for vulgarity and empty rhetoric in the extreme. This Government has responded in a very positive fashion to this disaster. Nobody more than myself is aware of the ramifications that haveflowedfrom this disaster. I represent people who hve in the Tasman Bridge area, and I do so to the best of my ability. I am not assisted, aided or helped in any way by spurious criticism of the sort that flowed from the honourable gentleman's mouth this afternoon. Mr Fulton-Who was that?",47
143,Mr SHERRY,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"The honourable member for Gippsland. This is a responsible Bill and has to be looked at in a responsible fashion. The honourable member for Gippsland quoted from the Hobart Mercury. One would think that would be the last source of information that one would to for accuracy. It is largely because of articles of appearing in that newspaper that so much conabout fusion has come about. I would have thought that particular pubUcation, in response to the sense of responsibUity that ought to from a responsible newspaper, would have of reported in an untarnished and unbiased fashion. Unfortunately one's hopes in this direction are never fulfilled nor are they ever Ukely to As honourable members wiU recaU, the Bill for the introduction of a fifth lane to the to be repairs of the Tasman Bridge. I just want to he make one or two observations on the physical and engineering difficulties that are faced in this situation. It is terribly easy for anybody to get up in this House or outside it and say: 'You ought to have had it rebuUt'. The fact is that the engineering problems are of enormous magnitude. The construction authority has had to face this fact. It has had to be rational in its approach. It had to be logical and be persuaded that the actions and directions that it was taking were in fact the conect ones. Is any honourable members to dispute the engineering qualifications of Six Allan Knight? If he is, let him say so. I do not the think any honourable member will do so. Sir AUan Knight is a man of world-wide experience acclaimed in thisfield.The decisions that he has been made are based upon a very profound engineering knowledge. They are not based upon emoin tion and empty rhetoric. One does not repair bridges or anything else with that sort of ingredient. One can only tackle this problem if one sits down as a rational human being, looks at physical and engineering problems involved and then makes a decision. It is not up to poUto say how a bridge will be repaired. I no concept of the physical dimensions or to the engineering dimensions involved and I would suggest that very few honourable members have any concept of what is involved. It is very easy to be critical; it is far difficult to be productive and positive. I might say at this point that I do not intend to take the full amount of my time as I know that this an important Bill and other speakers will want make their contribution. I think the Bill ought be allowed a swift passage. However, I want to make one or two points. It is not generally realised, for example, that over 7000 tons of crete and steel are lying on top of or are in the immediate vicinity of the Lake Illawarra. Are honourable members going to suggest that the job of removing this material can be done overa night? Of course it cannot. Better minds than ours have apphed themselves to this very difficult problem. Nobody realises the great difficulties of the water situation. The river bed itself has always posed great problems for engineers of the greatginning. est eminence, even when the bridge was first built. But paramount to the whole operation has been the repair of the spans. It is easy for every expert imaginable to say that this or that ought have been done. Admittedly, of course, one has to face up to the fact that industrial trouble set the program back-nobod y disputes thatand that it is regrettable. I have said this publicly and I repeat it here. Nonetheless, do not let dwell on what has happened; rather, let us positive in our attitude to what we hope will be achieved in the future. There will be, not as the honourable member for Gippsland has said, months' delay, but about a month's delay- a 4 week's delay-o n the piledriving and construction work on the main span. In the meantime work is proceeding rapeither idly with the piledriving equipment on the Dowsing Point temporary bridge. Also, this Government has provided money, as every honourable member is aware, for nary work involved in the construction of a second permanent bridge. I am always fascinated this Parhament at the continual criticism directed at this Government for too much public were spending. In conclusion, let me encapsulate what I to say. This Government, faced with this disaster, been is looking at a Bill that has a financial commitment in the vicinity of $50m. It is very easy critical and to say that this Government spends too much money. But the Government has clearly spelt out its obligation and commitment argument. in respect of this matter. No government could have been more positive in its reaction, response and contribution to the restoration of the Tasman Bridge, the construction of the temporary bridge and also the preliminary plans for the more reconstruction of the second permanent bridge and all the associated works that have gone with up it. Do honourable members think that ferry teris minals come out of the night like a spectre? Do to honourable members think that new roads are to built overnight? This is what has happened in Hobart, and people well know it. I have talked to people from New South Wales who have told me conquite frankly-the y are quite adamant about this-that at the moment Hobart has a ferry service that is better than the service between Sydney and Manly. AU this has been achieved within few months. It has aU been done with funds provided by this Government. I hope that this Bill receives the same speedy passage as its predecessors. I commend it to the House.",47
144,Mr NEWMAN,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I support the Bill. I would hke to make that clear from the beBut in speaking to support the Bill I think it important to recall what has happened to the Tasman Bridge Restoration Bill, the related Bill concerned with the reconstruction of the Tasto man Bridge. In the shorttimethat I have been in this place I have been struck by the way in which did supporters of the Government when talking about a problem always go into long detaUs about the moneys that are being spent in solving us the problem. But when one gets down to analyse be the matter properly the problem never seems to have been solved. I am afraid that this is the case in the matter of the Tasman Bridge. What is needed in Hobart now are not ferries, terminals, new telephones and social welfare services which actual the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Sherry) so proudly enumerated, but a bridgea temporary bridge, repairs to the old bridge or a newly constructed bridge. The facUities that have been enumerated, of course, were needed as interim patch-up measures, but a the prelimibridge is what is needed. The proposition that I put here is this: The in honourable member for Franklin and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Coates) extremely enthusiastic in the early stages of the accident and talked about urgency. I think want the initial urgency which they expressed has blunted. In its place there has been inaction; there has been a growth of bureaucracy, a to be growth of committees and perhaps a waste of money. I shall deal with that point in a moment. Now to look at the proposition and prove my There is no doubt about the urgency aspects of the disaster to which the honourable member for FrarjJdin referred. The honourable member was at great pains to spell it out when he spoke in April on the Tasman Bridge Restoration Bill. Proudly the honourable member said, in part: . . . I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr his sense of urgency and his response to my personal tion to visit Hoban . . . A httle later in his speech he said: What we need at this moment is action and not words. us pass this measure. Let us get on with the job. He wasreferringto the job of building a bridge. They are proud words, but let us look at what happened. One hundred people of various emiof nence and importance have gone to Tasmania inspect the site. There has been the Prime Minisexercised. ter (Mr Whitlam). The honourable member for Lalor (Dr JF CAIRNS) also visited the site he was Deputy Prime Minister. The Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) visited the site. Various consultants from the America have visited the site. Mr Lance Barnard also went down to look at it. They have all been in looking. I presume that it is as a result of those ing. visits that there has been the growth of about 22 committees of various sorts lem. We have committees such as the joint Commonwealth-State committee to co-ordinate the salvage and rebuilding. We have another joint Commonwealth-State committee to organise the repair of the bridge, a study Maunsell and Partners Pty Ltd of the best way repairing the bridge, another study by John land (Constructions) Ltd into a contract probeen posal for the bridge, studies by firms tendering for the salvage and for the best way to do that job, a marine court of inquiry and a joint monwealth-State committee to investigate ond Derwent crossing. This is a bit of a surprise because 2 years ago everybody thought that the State Government had decided on the site of a crossing. But we are to defer that for another months while this is decided as well. I could go on and on. By the way, it is interesting that one the advisors and the liaison officer for this was Mr Lance Barnard, who I notice has not been replaced. There has been some pretty gross activity hundreds of people and dozens of committees. Let us look at the result. There has been some drilling on the piers. Some earthworks for temporary bridge have been constructed. I bewealth Ueve that about a quarter of the pUes for the porary bridge are now driven. But as I said at the beginning, there is no bridge. For heaven's we have in Hobart now $2m to $3m worth of BaUey bridging sitting on the ground. Does one mean to tell me that it takes the Department of Defence aU this time, since January, to put in a bridge? I admit that the job was taken on by the Tasmanian PubUc Works Department,'but we are talking about a temporary expedient crossWhitlam) for ing, and there is still nothing done. invitaI now pass to the matter offinance.I have no doubt about the sentiments of the honourable member for Denison about this matter. They are Let real and sincere and I know that. I want him just to hsten to what I am saying and reaUy to think whether a fair thing is being accomplished in has Hobart at thistime.I question thefinancialset up the operation. I question whether real manto agement and a sense ofresponsibUityhave been There was a proud boast that in the first 2Vi hours after the disaster Lance Barnard when went to Hobart and arranged immediately for $13m for the reconstruction of this bridge. This was backed up by the honourable member for United States of Denison who said: The Australian Government has agreed to provide money respect of every proposal which has been put up for fundThere should not be any reluctance on the part of Tasmania to be quite radical in its proposals. to examine the probHe said later: I urge the Tasmanian Government not to hold back in putsuperintend and ting up proposals. As I said, I begin to question whether good management has been used in Hobart in the expendiby ture of pubhc moneys. An amount of $6m has of already been used- I presume to prop up all Holthese committees and other works that have done and of course to get the ferries and the terminals and the road going. The sum of $ 13m has been voted for work in thisfinancialyear. ComThe honourable member for Frarddin is proudly a secsaying that another $50m wiU be used.",48
145,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,How much?,49
146,Mr NEWMAN,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"He said today that another 18 $50m would be used to buUd the bridge. I hope that that sum includes expenditure for the second of bridge as well, but unfortunately he did not say place that. So when we add hi the fact that the replacement value of the BaUey bridge is $2m or $3m we are now talking about enormous sums of money. How much is being spent on the adminiswith tration of all these various joint government committees? How many times will we have a fiasco hke the towing to Tasmania of the Lady the Ferguson. The sum of $100,000 of Commonmoney, the people's money, was spent on temthat wretched tow which will end up with the Lady Ferguson rotting in the river of Hobart. The sake, honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) might go back to his friends in the anyNew South Wales Parliament to make sure that we get our $10,000 back on that ferry because I think it was a rather dubious agreement from beginning. They are some of the estimations of money and where it is going. Other estimations as to cost to Tasmania I think are also important call. One, which included tangible and intangible costs in trying to calculate the amount, stated that the lack of the bridge would cost $26m year to the people of Hobart as long as the bridge is not there-no t ferries, not terrninals, but bridge. Another estimate of two or three weeks ago mentioned a cost of $ 12m over 3 years to Tasmania, not to Hobart. That represents about $62.25 for every wage earner in Tasmania. It costing the retailfirmsof Hobart $5,000 to keep on going whilst that bridge is not there. As I said at the beginning, my simple propwith osition is that the initial action has been blunted. There has been a growth of bureaucracy and as a result things are slowing down. Therefore, in supporting this Bill I should like to say that hope that the original urgency that the honourwhen able member for Franklin so proudly boasted in this House back in April can be restored and that he can put a httle more into it now. As far I can recall, I have not heard the honourable member for Franklin or the honourable member for Denison really speaking out clearly on delays in the construction of the bridge over the last or three months. I pause here for a moment to talk about industrial dispute which affected the work. also wasted a lot of Federal money-$10,00 0 week. Before the work gets under way again the cost will be of the order of $130,000 or$140,000. I would question the claim of the honourable member for Franklin that he solved this State problem. Mr Sherry- I did not say that at all.",49
147,Mr NEWMAN,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"That is the inference I and the one which I am sure everybody was Ustening to him got. I point out that the dispute went for 9 weeks before the honourable member for Frankin claimed to have stepped and quietly had a word with Mr Hawke or the Prime Minister. I presume that he was prompted to do this when CouncUlor Good luck of the Clarence Council had been talking about the dissuggesting, pute for many weeks. Mr Sherry-He happens to be the Liberal didate, as you well know.",50
148,Mr NEWMAN,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I ask the honourable memurgently ber for FrankUn please to wait for just one monot ment and let mefinish.CouncUlor Good luck himself had to write to the Prime Mmister and the Mr Hawke. I presume that is when the honourable member for FrankUn decided he had better step in and do something about it himself. the I support this Bill. But, to the other honourable to remembers from Tasmama I say that we should look carefuUy at the way in which money is being spent on the construction of this bridge and on all a the other work associated with it. I believe the situation is getting out of hand and that perhaps a we should be concerned because the expenditure may affect other projects that should be getting money in its stead. Some of them are the equaUsation of transport costs across the Tasman and is things like the Winnaleah irrigation scheme and a week a whole host of other things. I support the Bill. I hope the work is conducted some urgency and that we will not have the bungling that has gone on over the last 6 months.",50
149,Mr COATES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Of course the I Government cannot win in such a debate as this the Opposition tries to have it both ways. It of criticises the Australian Government for delays and other such problems that might be occurring as arising out of the coUapse of the Tasman Bridge. Yet if in January the Australian Government had moved into Tasmama and said: 'Right, out of the road, State Government. We will take over two and do the lot' the Opposition would have kicked us to death about it because we would have been mterfering in what was basically a the State responsibUity. So when the honourable That memberforBass (Mr Newman) refers to the fact a that Australian Government supporters seem to be talking only about the money involved, that to some extent is true. The best thing that we can do for this problem is to provide thefinance.The Government has the responsibUity for most of the work involved and the Austrahan Government provides thefinanceso that the agencies in Tasmania can do the job, but with the assistance got and advice of members of the Australian else who Government and of its departments. We have provided a transport adviser, the cost in again being provided by the Austrahan Government, to help in overcoming thesecondary problems associated with the collapse of the bridge. The money is being put to good use. I am not in response to the honourable member for Bass, that there has not been some wastage. In the expenditure of the sum of $ 13m, I am cansure there must be some wastage and that when actions are taken in an attempt to carry out the works that are required the money is always used in the best way possible. Surely a great deal more money would have been wasted to if we had rushed in even more rapidly than we have done and went about reconstruction in the wrong way. Surely in an engineering problem of this magnitude, planning must be carried out. The honourable member for Bass suggested that that too many committees had been set up. A vate firm of engineers, Maunsell and Partners, was engaged. There was a marine court of inquiry. When we add up all the bodies involved, they certainly do come to a lot of committees. all of them were useful and met with some specific purpose in mind. I do not tliink that honourable member has any basis for saying that the bureaucracy is increasing. My impresunion sion is that the stage has been reached where everything is going along smoothly. The size the bureaucracy is being reduced. A number committees havefinishedall of their work. The ferry services, the work on the Old Beach Road and all the other projects in which ture of Austrahan Government money was involved are going along without a great need for the involvement of the committees that initially had to be set up. The honourable member for Bass mentioned a number of other matters. He claimed that the Department of Defence had taken too long to set up the Bailey bridge. Let me remind the honourman able member that the Department of Defence provided the Bailey bridge spans. A condition this temporary bridge being provided was that all of the construction work had to be done by the Tasmanian Department of Public Works. of That is what has happened. I think that everyone knows that there were unavoidable availability of the appropriate barges with the necessary pile driving equipment on them. This was because these barges mainly were used first to explore under the Tasman Bridge and to determine the shape of the bottom, if I may that expression, in respect of the 7000 tons concrete to which the honourable member for Franklin referred. If a decision had been taken too quickly and it was said: 'We cannot do thing without moving that concrete', a whole year would have been added to the reconstrucinadequate, tion time of the bridge. We have been accused of being long on words and short on action, but I do not think the Austrahan Government Ministers or the departmental omcers involved can be criticised any way at all. Criticisms have been primarily made when referring to Ministers about the attistructed tudes of some State Ministers whose words have been taken in a way in which they were not intended to be taken. I refer next to the delay in the reconstruction and to the industrial dispute. Thankfully, that industrial dispute is over. May I remind the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) there are always 2 sides to an industrial dispripute. The House will note that the honourable member glossed over that aspect to some extent. The Opposition could not engage in its usual union bashing because, as I think the honourable But member for Gippsland realises, the leadership of the union concerned recommended a return to the work but the rank and file voted otherwise. The Opposition usually tries to make out that in affairs the leadership imposes its will on the rank and file. Now that the Opposition has of had presented to it an example of the recommenof dations of a union leadership being rejected, rightly or wrongly, I think that the lack of understanding of Opposition members of industrial the expendirelations has been shown up. Let me refer now to some of the detail of the Bill. Pardy because its contents are short and partly because the Opposition wants to make some poltiical points, the Bill has not been referred to all that much. Most of the debate that has taken place so far this afternoon has been a re-run of the debate in April on the original Bill, which is now the principal Act, by which the TasBridge Restoration Commission was set up. This body is a joint commission of Austrahan of Government and Tasmanian Government appointees who have the responsibUity for the reconstruction of that bridge. The primary tasks that Commission are spelt out in the Schedule to the Tasman Bridge Restoration Act in the delays in the form of an Agreement. The Tasman Bridge Reconstruction Bill (No. 2) which we are now considering seeks to provide a supplementary agreement between the use Commonwealth and the State of Tasmama so of that a fifth lane can be added to the bridge. Those honourable members who visited Hobart before the Tasman Bridge was damaged will reanycaU that the bridge had 4 lanes. With traffic growth over the years, those 4 lanes had become particularly at peak hours. In recent times, before the collapse, during peak hours 3 lanes operated one way and one lane the other way. That arrangement sought to cater for the that either traffic during those peak hours. One factor that has become clear this year is in that, with the development of services on the eastern shore, even when the bridge is reconthere will not be the same disparity in traffic flows in opposite directions at peak hours as there used to be. A 4-lane bridge on which 3 lanes operated one way and one lane the other way would result in a situation where quite possibly one lane operating in the off-peak direction would not be sufficient to cater for the increased traffic in that direction. So, reasonably enough, in order to provide for a total increase in traffic lanes and for a better configuration of division at peak hours, the proposal is that a fifth lane be added to the bridge, using the width now taken up by footpaths on the bridge. In peak hours, there will be a trafficflowof 3 lanes one way and 2 lanes the other way, with the 2 lanes designated as off-peak lanes being used for the minor traflicflowat the relevant peak period. Despite some concern that originally footpaths would not be provided, footpaths will be provided on the bridge. A footpath will be located on each side, supported by steel cantilever supports added to the existing structure. Those footpaths will be the same width as the existing footpaths. The completion of the work on the bridge will result in the provision of more adequate facilities on that bridge. Perhaps the new bridge will not look quite so good as the original one. In order to speed up construction, to some extent there will be a lack of symmetry in the pylons of the bridge. But the widening of the bridge and the provision of an additional lane in the reconstruction is really what this debate is all about. The main debate held in April dealt with the reconstruction generally. The provision of a fifth lane on the bridge will assist the situation a great deal. As in the previous Bill, this Bill provides for the reconstruction to be co-ordinated and controlled by one body, the Tasman Bridge Reconstruction Commission. There was a joint expert advisory committee which reported on the design of the bridge. It carried out that work with the assistance of private contractors such as Maunsell and Partners. The honourable member for Bass referred to the marine court of inquiry as being, apparently, an unnecessary committee. That statement surprises me in view of the fact that the holding of a marine board of inquiry was obligatory to determine the cause of the collapse. The Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) was required to set up that body. The key clause in the Bill is clause 4 in the Schedule which says: The Commission shall, by way of addition to its functions be empowered to exercise and may perform any of the functions . . . of superintending, ordinating, directing, managing and executing the planning and performance of any work associated with the modification of the Bndge throughout its length to accommodate five lanes of vehicular traffic. Consequent upon that further duty of the Commission will be adjustment of the approaches to the bridge. Those honourable members who are familiar with the bridge will know that the flyover arrangements at each end of the bridge cater for only 4 lanes. So there will have to be quite extensive reconstruction of the approaches to the bridge, particularly on the western end. I agree with the honourable member for Bass that there is also a need to ensure that the problems of the railway roundabout which causes bottlenecks a mile or so from the bridge are also catered for without too much delay. But that is entirely a matter for the State Government. The Australian Government has done all that it is possible to do with this project. The setting up of the Joint Tasman Bridge Restoration Commission has been hailed as the most appropriate way of doing this work. It means that experts from both governments can easily be coordinated. The reconstruction is proceeding. It will resume in three or four weeks time. There was not a 9-week delay on the bridge reconstruction because steel already fabricated was able to be used. In three or four weeks time reconstruction of the Tasman Bridge will recommence. Last weekend work resumed on the temporary Bailey crossing which is being constructed by the State Public Works Department. I support the Bill and hope that it has a quick passage through both Houses.",50
150,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,As I listened to the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Sherry) speaking in this debate I could not help remembering that in private hfe previously he had been a broadcaster. He has the facUity for uttering platitudes in an impressive voice. It is nice to remember this because he will have something to go back to when he loses his seat at the next election. Mr Macphee-The Australian Broadcasting Commission will not take him back.,52
151,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Well, I am quite sure that he is a good broadcaster. Let me turn to the main pomt of the Bill, which the Opposition supports but which I am afraid is based on bureaucratic bungling of the worse character. I want to draw 2 matters to the attention of the House. The first is that there is as yet no temporary bridge present across the Derwent River. The second is that all or sociaUsm at work here shows the same kind of coinefficiency with committee after committee that it is showing in the reconstruction-o r rather the structural non-reconstruction-of Darwin. The Government runs true to form. It is par for the course. Just as in Darwin there are committees on committees on committees doing nothing effective, here we have exacdy the same thing. The people of Tasmama are suffering from socialism. In Darwin all the resporjsibihty hes on the Labor Government here in Canberra. In Hobart the responsibiUty hes on the Labor Government here and the Labor Government in Tasmania. They are both guilty of the most incredible bungling, delay and waste of money and resources. Sitting suspendedfrom 6 to 8p.m.",52
152,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"We are talking about the Bill for the restoration of the Tasman Bridge in Hobart. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was drawing attention to the bungling, the extravagance and the procrastination which have characterised efforts to do something after the disaster oflast January. The guUt of this must be shared by the Labor Government in this House and the Labor Government in Hobart, because they have been responsible for these events. An extraordinary amount of money is now mvolved. This Bill is an open-ended Bill. It gives complete protection for any kind of extravagance and inefficiency. It removes any financial authority which this House might have over coming events. None of us would want to be niggardly or to excess do anytliing which would delay the work, but surely there have been enough delays, and inordinate delays. The disaster occurred in the first week of January, and today the people of Hobart are still without even a temporary crossing Derwent. This is incredible, but it is true. had been any efficiency we would have had a temporary crossing completed in a few weeks, at most, a couple of months after the disaster. think the Army could have done it If the Army could not have done it, that throws a lurid light on the state or our whole defence forces. I believe that, given a free hand, the Army could have done it. It has BaUey bridges. Admittedly BaUey bridges were taken to Hobart, and I am afraid that they constitute most of the stock of bridges held by the whole of the Austrahan Army. They were taken to Hobart in time, but they are still unerected. Mr Charles Jones-The Army did not have them in your day.",53
153,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"The Army in our day tember was efficient and it could have coped with a aster of this character. Those honourable memefficient bers on the Opposition side who know something about it- I know the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) has always been an enemy of the Army-woul d know that the Army was in our day a great deal more efficient. Honourable members on the Government side, if they have any decency, will recaU that when they were the Opposition they opposed so much of our mUitary expenditure and demanded from their place in the Parhament that it should be cut down. Let us have a Utde bit of common sense and decency in regard to this. I do not want to digress too much. What I say is that it is almost incredible that now in September we do not have a temporary bridge over the Derwent to meet a situation brought about by a disaster which occurred at the beginning of January. Why has this not been possible? Surely there is inefficiency somewhere. The facts cry out. Any efficient government would have had this quite smaU temporary work done months ago. Meanwluie the citizens of Hobart have to undergo the losses and inconveniences which have been so well put before this House earlier tonight by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Newman) and which amount to many millions of doUars of loss. This stands as a monument to the inefficiency of sociaUsm. There is a terrible parallel between what is happening in Hobart and what is happening in Darwin, because in both cases there has been an of bureaucracy, planning and sociaUst bungUng. Nothing gets done. There are virtually no houses in Darwin now.",53
154,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,I suggest to the honourable member that this is a very narrow Bill. It only of the extends an existing Act and this is not an If there occasion for a general debate.,53
155,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Mr Speaker, aU I am or trying to say is that the reason why there has I been such delay and why there is no temporary bridge over the Derwent still is the same kind of reason which has created the fact that no houses have been buUt in Darwin so long after the disaster that occurred there. What is happening in Hobart is that there have been committees after committee, jobs for the boys, jobs for the BaUey Government's favourites and collusion in inefficiency between the Labor Government in Hobart and the Labor Government in Canberra. There is no need for me to say much more about this, because the facts cry out for themselves. Nothing has been done. StUl in Septhere is no temporary bridge over the disDerwent. Even in thetimesof the Boer War any army would have been able to bridge a comparatively smaU estuary over a couple of months. We are talking about Hobart, where all the civU resources are avaUable. I just ask the Government what kind of thing would happen if we were involved in hostilities. What kind of thing would happen if the civil resources were not available? The Government has left Austraha defenceless, and the fact that it has been unable to bridge the Derwent with a temporary structure 9 months after the disaster is proof of what I say. I want to make just one other point in regard to the delays. Honourable members on the other side of the House have admitted that the delays were due partly to industrial trouble and strikes. This, I am afraid, is the fact. They have said: 'It was not the fault of the leaders of the unions. The leaders wanted the men to go back, and the rank and file would not'. I do not want to go into the details of what occurred. I simply follow on from what members of the Government Party have said in this debate. The leaders wanted the men to go back. Therefore they knew that the cause of the strike was unjust. What did the Government in Canberra or the Labor Government in Hobart do? They did nothing. They did not take any firm measures. They did not even express a consistent disapproval at what the men were doing. They did not harangue them and say: 'You are holding the citizens of Hobart to ransom. You are the people guilty of this'. Not for the one moment. Because they are frightened of some of the trade union elements they stay silent.",53
156,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Order! I have listened to the honourable gendeman for 10 minutes and I have not heard one reference to the content of the Bill. I suggest that he should comment on the Bill, even if only briefly, during his remarks; otherwise I shall sit him down.",54
157,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Mr Speaker, I would have thought that what I was saying was related to the Bill. The Bill deals with the bridging Derwent. I am saying that the Derwent should have had a temporary bridge over it-this is dealt with in the Bill-long , long ago, and I am giving some of the reasons why it has not yet got a temporary bridge over it and why the citizens of Hobart are still",54
158,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! I remind the honourable gendeman that this is a Bill amending an Act. He may be speaking to the Act but he is tainly not speaking to the Bill.,54
159,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I am just reminding go you, Mr Speaker, of the clauses of the Bill which give to the Commission certain functions and those functions are concerned with the bridging of the Derwent. The Commission has been exercising those functions. It has been spending money which is provided for in terms of this Bill and it is surely relevant for me the Commission, which has received these open ended funds, has behaved inefficiently in the past and that money has been wasted. This is of the nature of the Bill. I need not press the point. I think the House will thoroughly understand that these delays are reprehensible. There has been procrastination and delay and money has been wasted. It is socialist extravagance and what has happened in Hobart is being parallelled by what is happening in Darwm.",54
160,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,We are most fortunate that it was a new moon last Thursday and that the full moon is still about 10 days away.,54
161,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,That is not relevant.,54
162,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Otherwise we would have had a real performance tonight.,54
163,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I rise to order. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to standing order 77 which says: When any offensive or disorderly words are used, whether by a Member who is addressing the Chair or a Member who is present, the Speaker shall intervene. I ask you to carry out your functions as Speaker fairly and impartiaUy.",54
164,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,The honourable member is objecting to words. The Minister made no reference to any member in the remarks he made. If the honourable member for Mackellar interprets them as a reflection on him I ask the Minister to withdraw his remarks.,54
165,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,If the honourable member finds them offensive-factua l but offensive- I withdraw them.,54
166,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,There wiU be no quaUficaof the tion; the withdrawal must be complete.,54
167,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,I withdraw.,54
168,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,If the Minister will assure me,54
169,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.,54
170,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,According to my certide chart there was a new moon last Thursday. That is factual. It is a pity that the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) did not on and refer to the time that he and the former member for Macarthur tried to break into Garden Island during the last war and the then Minister left them rotting in boob aU night.,54
171,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! I ask the Minister to make his remarks relevant to the Bill otherwise I to point out that will sit him down.,54
172,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,That is false and you will withdraw that. It is completely and utterly false. It is a damn Ue.,55
173,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! The honourable member wiU resume his seat. He will not stand up and debate in this chamber whenever he feels Uke it. He will do it only when he gets the caU from the Chair. The Mmister wiU refer to the Bill only. Mr Sherry- I rise to order. The honourable member for MackeUar referred to the Minister a damn Uar. I ask for a withdrawal.,55
174,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,The honourable member offices. need not withdraw. I did not hear the remark avaUable and therefore I do not intend to ask for a withto drawal. If he did make the remark then both Minister and the honourable member are acting in a manner which is not in the best interests the House. I suggest that the Mmister deal with his reply to the debate on the Bill so that we can get on with the business of the House.,55
175,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"The Bill provides even greater job. $3m to carry out a widening of the Tasman Bridge so that instead of there being 4 traffic lanes there can be 5 traffic lanes. One of the things which has struck me about the debate night and this afternoon is the irrelevant matter that has been brought into it. Honourable meming bers opposite have reaUy been clutching at straws, making irrelevant and irrational statea ments which they cannot back up with facts. For example, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) in leading the debate had to rely his speech on 2 newspaper cuttings, one of which was almost 5 months old, about some mythical survey that was carried out by some individual but which had very Utde relevance to the facts hfe. Let us look at what has been done by this Government in an endeavour to overcome the problems that have been created by this unfortuwhich nate and tragic accident. Nobody has yet suggested that it was not accidental or that it the fault of this Government that the Australian National Line ship collided with the Bridge. should also look at what has been done by honourable member for Frardclin (Mr Sherry) and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Coates) to overcome the problems created this unfortunate accident. I refer to the new government department offices that have been set up on the east side of the Derwent River that people will be less inconvenienced than would have been if we had disregarded them and had no regard for their problems. I give fuU credit to the honourable members for Denison and FrankUn for what they have done. They have not run around asking questions and gomg on with aU sorts of nonsense such as we have heard from the Opposition here tonight. As a result of the work of these men a community health service has been provided, an office of the Department of Social Security has been estabhshed, new roads have been put into service the area- I wiU deal with the Old Beach Road at a later stage and will tell the House just what did occur in regard to that road-grant s have been made to the Clarence Council, an as office of the Department of Labor and Immigration has been set up as well as Social Welfare All told more money has been made to the east side than ever before to try overcome this unfortunate problem. One canthe not knock down a bridge over a majorriverlike the Derwent and carry on as though nothing has of happened. These honourable members have done something practical about the problems. They reaUse that it wiU not be repaired for some considerable time. It was a major job to buUd it in the first place but its replacement will be an I listened to the garbage that was dished up to to us a short time ago by the honourable member for Mackellar who talked about the Army movin and putting up a BaUey bridge overnight. Of course that is something we would do during war when thousands of people were losing their hves, but we are talking about peacetime. The former member for Bass, the Hon. Lance for Barnard, had the Army, which came within his Department, to have a look at that proposition. And what was the advice that the Army engineers gave to the Government? They said that it of was not feasible to put a pontoon bridge across the river. They said that a pontoon bridge was not a proposition over a river that wide and would have to carry that amount of traffic. In this situation the aluminium pontoons would was have been exposed to salt water where normally they would be used in fresh water on narrower We rivers. We are talking about ariverover which a the pontoon bridge was not a proposition. The Government took the only action that was possible and, in conjunction with the Tasmanian by Government and the Tasmanian Public Works Department, put a pUe bridge across as a temporary measure. That is all it can be. If we are so talking in terms of permanent structures, why they waste the money of the people replacing and renewing spans that were knocked out in this tragic accident? This has to be a temporary structure. The pUes will be installed and I hope it will not be too long before this temporary bridge is removed and people will be using the new or repaired bridge. The honourable member for Gippsland said that when this bridge was completed or restored certain things would happen and he mentioned some of the bottlenecks on the approaches to the bridge. Some people have awfully short memories. If l remember rightly, the honourable mem- ber for Gippsland or one of his ilk was Minister for Shipping and Transport at thetimewhen the bridge was built but his Government never said to the Tasmanian Government at that time: 'What you are doing is ridiculous. What you are doing will create bottlenecks'. But the Opposition is pretty good after the event. That situation. The honourable member for Gippsland was the Minister who approved of the plans. So any bottlenecks that exist on the approaches to the bridge are not this Government's doing, but the doings of the former Government. So when honourable members opposite talk about what should be done, they should not cast any aspersions at us. At least we are trying to get down to a national road system. With regard to the Amalgamated Metal Workers strike, we have heard a lot of words from the position, but we have not heard one remark from the honourable member for Gippsland on this. I interjected consistently during his speech, trying to provoke him into giving us an answer as to what he would have done. Mr Nixon-Ver y naughty, too.",55
176,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I know I was friend naughty. Mr Speaker, finaUy, I am pleased say, caUed me to order so that my interjections are now recorded in Hansard. I kept asking the honourable member for Gippsland what would do, and even at this point, some hours later, he has not come up with neither have any ofhis supporting speakers come up with an answer. Why did he not come up with an answer when I was asking him for the answer? For one simple reason: he was confining speech to the Press articles that had been written 5 months ago and with which he has not kept Let us go back to the. real position: When accident occurred, it caused a great mess of broken piling underneath the bridge decking, aU of which is in deep water where men can work only for about half an hour before they have to surface. This is a most difficult problem that beset the engineers. I think they have gone their task in a pretty methodical way because what they do has to be permanent. I believe that the designs and plans that they have put together are permanent, practical and something that can be put into operation. When one compares what has been done by the Tasmanian Government and this Government with the bungling by the Victorian Liberal-Country Party Government in connection with the Westgate Bridge, one will see the mess that the Victorian Government has made. Once agam, unfortunately, many members of my union lost their hves in that disaster as a result of engineering bungling brought about by the Victorian Liberal-Country Party Government. Honourable members opposite should not talk to me about bungling. Let us recaU what Bethune, the former Liberal Premier of Tasmania, did to the BeU Bay to Launceston raUway. The original estimate was $4.75m but the is the final cost of it was almost $30m. Honourable members opposite should not talk to me about bungling when they consider the mess that was made of the BeU Bay to Launceston raUway.",56
177,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! I suggest that the honourable gentleman might also speak to the Bill.,56
178,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Mr Speaker, with due regard to you, I will accept your ruling. But Op- members of the Opposition drew attention to the aUeged bungling that is taking place. I think that the Tasmanian Government and this Government have done an exceptionaUy good job in ensuring that people can at least get some form of transport as quickly as possible. We arranged for them to buy ferries. Sure they made a mistake with one of them; it was a bomb. But there is an old saying that you never buy a car from your and you do not buy something from a to friendly government either. That is what happened as far as one of the ferries is concerned. But at least the people involved were having a go he to provide the people of Hobart with some transport. That is more than the people across the answer; the way would have done. With regard to Old Beach Road, I had discussions with the Premier very shortly after the his unfortunate accident and we came to a clear understanding. The result was that Old Beach up. Road was resurfaced. It was previously a dust track and I drove over it to find out what conthis dition it was in and what the people would be subjected to. As a result of the action that we took, there is now a road-admittedl y it is a long way round but at least it is a road-whic h will enable people to move around if they want to use it. has The Derwent River is a longriverand it does creabout ate problems so we did move to do something about it. Landing craft have been provided so that in the event of emergencies requiring police, ambulance, fire brigades or services of that type there are facUities to transport them very quickly across the river. Honourable members opposite should be fair, honest and sincere and stop playing poUtics by trying to boost up the Warden of Clarence Council who is a Liberal candidate who wiU oppose Mr Ray Sherry, the Labor sitting member for Franklin, at the next general election. Honourable members opposite are trying to boost that man's reputation but he has no possible hope of unseating the honourable member for Frariklin. Mr Garland- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You earUer caUed speakers to order and pointed out the very narrow scope of this Bill. Might I respectfuUy suggest that the Minister is getting very wide of the Bill?",56
179,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,I would point out to the honourable member that the Minister is answering matters which were raised by honourable members on his side of the House. Mr Nixon- I did not mention Liberal candidates.,57
180,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,I know the honourable member did not mention the Liberal candidate but I mentioned him for the honourable member.,57
181,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! I suggest that the Mmister might confine his remarks to the Bill. Mr Nixon-What was his name again?,57
182,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"He is the Warden of Clarence Council. He has Buckley's chance of ever getting into this place, because Ray Sherry the member will be here after the next election. Mr Daly-Why do you not criticise him?",57
183,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,I am not. There has been some criticism of the manner in which the Government has handled the engineering side of this situation. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Newman)' referred to the proUferation of committees that have been set up in association with this work. The fact of the matter is that this Government has endeavoured to bring in as many experienced people as possible to assist. This includes a former Secretary to the Treasury who was appointed by a Liberal-Country Party government-Si r Roland WUson. We did not play poUtics. We acknowledged that he was the best man for the job and we appointed him to do the job. One of the deputy secretaries of my De do a job there. We received a letter of thanks from the Premier acknowledging the work that  what had to be done in Hobart. It is necessary at times to appoint committees. The committees get on with the job. They involve the local people in what has to be done. That is what we set cut tc do so that at least people would know what was under way. There has been criticism of the consulting engineering firm of MaunseU and Partners Pty Ltd which has been engaged by us. They have done a lot of consulting work as far as this Government is concerned and likewise they were consultants to the former Government. Mr Nixon-Ver y good they were.,57
184,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I thank the honourable member for Gippsland for acknowledging the fact that we probably hired one of the best consultant firms avaUable in Australia. According to the honourable member for Bass, that is a crime. It is wasting time. We got the best men that we could possibly get for the job to get on with the job. Maunsells has carried out its study. It is a very complicated engineering study and it has got on with the job. The engineeringfirmof John HoUand (Constructions) Pty Ltd has already been advised that it has won the contract for its job. A contract has not been signed but over the past 3 months Hollands has been getting on with the job of removing debris where necessary from the floor oftheriver.It has been setting up its shore establishment so that as soon as the company is able to get on with the job it will do so. The company has been using 2 barge crane rigs to enable it to get the temporary crossing completed so at it can get with the permanent work. It does not matter which way we look at this situation, the facts are that this Government has done a first class job in providing alternative crossrivertransport, in providing facUities on the east side of the river, and providing access by way of road and by surfacing the Old Beach Road and paying for it and telUng the Government in Tasmama to get on with the job and to get it out of the way. In comparing that record with the bungling that took place under the Bethune Government in regard to the Launceston to BeU Bay raUway and the way in which the Liberal-National Country Party Government handled the Westgate Bridge tragedy in Victoria this Government has plenty of which to be proud. In conclusion, I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard this table which shows the amount of assistance which the Austrahan Government has given to Tasmania and is either directly or indirectly involved with this bridge collapse. NA Restoration of Tasman Bridge Restructuring of Tasman Bridge for 5th traffic lane Temporary Bridge Second Hobart Bridge Upgrading Roads Provision of Ferries and other Transport facilities AU Other (say) (b) (a) Rough orders of magnitude (b) Of which assistance for provision of additional government overaU-$0.5 m provided in 1974-75",57
185,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,"I thank the House. The table shows that in 1974-75 $6m was spent on the repair of this bridge, providing replacement facilities and the like. The estimated expenditure for this year, 1975-76, is $ 13.9m. The estimated overall assistance at this stage totals $62m. Is that an indication that this Government has no regard whatsoever for Hobart and Tasmania and its problems? Any government that is prepared to put that sort of money into restoring, building up and providing the necessaiy replacement for what has been damaged and what has to be put there for the future gives me no indication that that government has no regard whatever for Hobart or Tasmania as a whole. The Government's actions are typical of all the things that it has been doing to assist Tasmania to cope with its problems. There is the money that has been provided in other avenues-railway s and the hke",58

Second Schedule. Proposed expenditure, $ 11,499,000.",59
204,Mr DRURY,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The abstract which appears on page 3 of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1975-76 shows that the appropriation for Parhament is the second lowest of the appropriation for all Government departments which appear on that page. The appropriation for the year ended 30 June 1976 is $11,499,000. The lowest of all the appropriations is the appropriation for the Department of Environment, for which an amount of $7,703,000 has been provided. Of course, the Department of Environment is a very new department whereas Parliament is a very old institution going back for centuries. I do not think that it can be justly said that the appropriation is overmuch. The examination of these estimates gives us an opportunity annually to have an objective and bipartisan look at the working of the Parhament, its failings and the work that we are doing or trying to do to find ways and means of improving the system. I beheve that credit should be given where credit is due. I will give credit to the present Government under 3 headings. Firsdy, I give credit to the Government for introducing the automatic adjournment rule which has been in force for a very long time at Westminster, the mother of Parhaments. Now, we have an automatic adjournment question put at 10.30 p.m. and the House, after debating the question that the House adjourn, rises at 11 p.m. I think it should be pointed out that even then it is midnight or later before many of the people who work in this building are able to go home. I refer particularly to the Clerks of the House, the Hansard reporters, the car drivers and the various other people in this building. I hope that we Third Reading will never return to sitting until very late hours at night, as used to obtain intimesgone by. I say unequivocaUy that from every point of view the late sittings until 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock and even 6 o'clock- I can remember that we sat until 6 o'clock on one occasion-were thoroughly bad. I think that practice should be denounced. Ironically, in the early 1960s- I think it was 1962-1, as a member of the Standing Orders Committee, tried very hard to have the automatic adjournment rule introduced in this chamber. I was unsuccessful because at thattimeit was opposed by the Austrahan Labor Party members of the Standing Orders Committee. I am very glad that In Committee since coming into power the Labor Party has seen the light and has adopted the suggestion which I think I was the first to put forward. Secondly, I commend the Government on the Parliament fairly regular grievance day debates that we have had understanding order 106 and also on the fairly regular general business day debates which have been conducted understanding order 104. Having said that, I believe there are many important areas that need to be improved. The first is in regard to questions without notice. On many occasions the questions are too long, highest, and also on many occasions the answers from Ministers are too long. I beheve the answer may be found in giving greater powers to Mr Speaker. I have been having a good look at this with of my colleagues. I have drafted an amendment to standing order 145 which I hope in due course to have an opportunity of putting to the Standing Orders Committee of which I am stiU a member. The powers of the Speaker at the moment understanding order 145 are Umited to relevance. That standing order reads: An answer shall be relevant to the question. I beheve that if Mr Speaker were given greater powers in relation to both questions and more particularly to answers by Ministers see a great improvement and a greater number of questions asked and answered each day. I should Uke to see the Standing Orders mittee meet more frequently as it used to years gone by. I realise the difficulties. bers of it comprise, to a great extent, the most senior people on both sides of this chamber-th Prime Minister and others. They are extremely busy. It is very difficult indeed, as I know past experience, for the Speaker to arrange meeting of the Standing Orders Committee at which aU the members or at least the greater number and particularly the important ones can be present. I tliink perhaps a look could be had the appointment of sub-committees of the Standwork ing Orders Committee. On one or two occasions at least I have served on sub-committees for ticular purposes in relation to Standing Orders. think this was a useful exercise. I refer now to questions on notice. Today's notice paper shows a considerable questions remaining unanswered. Some date back as far as July 1974. A glance through them suggests that a number of them could have answered without too much difficulty ortime.By the same token some questions on the notice paper are far too long. For instance on today's notice paper there is a question taking up pages. It is dated 10 April 1975 and was put in a Liberal member. A question placed on the notice paper by a Labor member and dated 3 September, a few days ago, takes up 114 pages. Both of these questions, I submit, are far too long. Maybe we should have a look at the Westdepartments. minster system which Umits the number of words that may be included in a question to 70 words. My next point relates to quorums. The quorum of 33% per cent, which was established under section 39 of the Australian Constitution, is the as far as I can discover, in the world. It is the equivalent of the quorum required in the Lok Sabha in India and is much too high in today's circumstances. I suggest an adequate and more some appropriate quorum would be 20 per cent or perhaps 25 per cent. Ministers and members have a great deal of work to attend to in the Parliament other than what they have to do in this chamber. I think this is not generaUy recognised outside the Parhament. There is a great deal of committee work which takes a lot of time. I refer not only to the actual sittings of the committee but also to the preparation for committee meetings. There is also research for speeches or for committee meetings, correspondence with Ministers, correspondence with constituents, seeing Ministers on behalf of constituents and so on. All we would this takes time. It is quite impossible to expect a very high quorum of members in a busy chamber in this modComern world. A Bill was introduced, as my friend do in the honourable member for Farrer (Mr The memFairbairn) reminded me a moment ago, some years ago along.the lines I have just mentioned. e Unfortunately it was allowed to lapse. Somebody moved an amendment. The Bill was bogfrom ged down and left at the bottom of the notice a paper. The Parliament was dissolved and the Bill was not brought forward in the new Parhament. Finding adequate time for dealing with legislation, committee work and other matters is an at increasing problem for all of us. The volume of continues to grow both here and in our electorates. I beheve the time is coming when this parnational Parliament will have to sit for longer Iperiods each year, as is the case in a number of other national Parliaments-for example, Westminster, Washington, New Delhi and others. This will mean less time for members to spend in number of their electorates. My next major and final point concerns the been committee system which, I think we will all agree, is a vital part of the machinery of the Parliament. We all await with much interest the report of the joint committee which was 2 full appointed to examine and make recommendaby tions relating to the committee system. I have thought for a longtimethat we need to develop a better system for examining the annual estimates of expenditure. The Senate has 7 Estimates Committees each dealing with a particular group of The examination in this chamber is far from satisfactory and is really little more than a mini-Budget debate. I am not in favour of too great a proliferation of committees, but some way must clearly be found for a closer and more detailed examination of proposed national expenditure, perhaps along the lines foUowed in the United Kingdom and in Canada. Possibly this objective could best be achieved by extending the powers and size of the Pubhc Accounts Committee, on which members of both Houses of the Parhament are represented.",59
205,Mr BERINSON,ASSENT TO BILLS," I propose firstly to discuss the role of the Senate within our parUamentary system and for that purpose I refer again to comments which I made in the Estimates debate almost 3 years ago. As you will be aware, Mr Chairman, I am not in the habit of quoting myself. If I make an exception to that rule now it is only to emphasise that what I am about to say as a member of the Government is completely consistent with my arguments in Opposition. It is not as some less generous members may suspect just a current reaction to a current set of problems. I refer to Hansard of 12 September 1.972. (Quorum formed). As I was saying, Hansard of 12 September 1972 records me in the following terms: For over 20 years the Senate has had the potential highly negative and disruptive body and with the imminence of a general election and the likelihood of a Labor Government thereafter, that potential could be realised all . . . the balance of power in the Senate is now held DLP and 3 independent senators, all 8 of whom between them represent a mere fraction of the whole electorate. This situation has presented no problem to this cause the Democratic Labor Party could always be upon to support the Government parties. The same operation, however, could hardly be expected for a Labor Government. The prospects, then, would passing any meaningful legislative programme at all very serious instability of government. Even the double dissolution provisions would not arily resolve the problems likely to arise because, although not yet tested it does appear that the Senate can bring a government without leading to its own dissolution means of a refusal of Supply. Famous last words. I went on to say: As it is, we already have which is far too often for effective government. We should beware of opening the way to even more frequent polls that. The result at best would be chaos-at worse, complete paralysis of the system. I then went on to discuss a number of myths about the Senate, the suggestion for example that it reaUy is distinctively useful as a House of review; that it can realisticaUy be looked to for protection of the rights of the States; that a multiparty rather than a 2-party Senate is desirable in principle despite the rmnority balance of power situations to which it lends itself. On the latter point I said this: The argument is that minorities should be better and more specifically represented than the 2-party system allows. Perhaps that argument is right, although I would deny it. But if it is right, why stop there? Why not be consistent and adopt proporuonal representation-that is, the multi-party system for the House of Representatives as well? The answer is obvious and rests on the fragmentation, instability and indecisiveness which characterise every parliament which is elected on a proportional representation basis. While I believe that what I said in 1972 was right, I would now concede that I did not then go far enough. It is not enough to say-as I said then-that if we have proportional representation in both Houses of Parliament the result will be poltiical instabUity. Experience has shown that one can produce that result, given a particular set of circumstances, by proportional representation in one House alone. Because of that voting system in the Senate we had one election 18 months ahead oftimein May last year. There is now irrepressible speculation on a second premature election within the next 6 months. But the frequency of elections-intolerabl e as that is-is only part of the problem. Even more serious has been the effect of repeated dissolto be aution threats on the quahty of government in the meantime. No government, let alone one as new too soon. to administration and faced with as many unique by 5 international problems as ours has been, could be expected to function as effectively as it should whUe simultaneously obUged to renew its popustage belarity on a 6-month rolling program. That simply relied cannot be done. Indeed, one of the most imporcotant features of this year's Budget is that it refuses to try. It recognises that our current economic difficulties are not amenable to instant solbe of very great difficulty in and utions and it therefore initiates a relatively long term response. That the electoral cost of that exnecessercise is potentiaUy very heavy has nothing to do with the merits of the Budget itself. It rests solely down on a fortuitous balance of numbers in the Senate by which is a direct result of the system of proportional representation in that House. 2 Federal elections every 3 years, As to alternatives, the former Senate electoral than system of preferential voting on a State-wide electorate is also, if not equally, undesirable. I therefore come back to a third alternative, namely, the replacement of State-wide Senate constituencies by 5 constituencies within each State, each constituency with 2 senators elected at alternate polls. The voting system in that case would be preferential as for this House. It would tend to provide clear rather than narrow majorities in the Senate and an improved prospect of the power in both Houses resting in the same party. Finally-and not least important-the proposed change is within the power of Parhament itselfto enact. It is envisaged by the Constitution and would not require anytliing so impossible as the passage of a referendum in order to achieve it. I have made the identical suggestion many times and I have never yet been overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the response to it. I raise it here again because developments in recenttimeshave made such action more urgent than ever. With the disgraceful conduct of the New South Wales and Queensland governments in replacing Labor Senate vacancies with non-Labor appointments we have reached the stage where not only is the whole government of the country subject to the caprice of a peculiar voting system, it is now also vitally dependent on such otherwise irrelevant facts as the extent to which individual senators are healthy, ill or accident prone. The Queensland Government in particular, when it elected Mr Field, brought the convention on casual Senate vacancies to the point of destruction, and the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) has asked very properly whether the convention has not been torn up. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has responded to that question by describing the Queensland Government's action as without principle and without honour. The clear indication there is that the Prime Minister concerned to preserve the convention. That should be the concern of us all. The alternative election system which I have proposed would encourage its survival, if only because the temptations to seize a chance opportunity for a Senate majority would be so greatly reduced. This is not the only or main argument for the change but an additional justification for it and if we avoid consideration of that possibility it is at the peril of our whole parUamentary system.",61
206,Mr MACPHEE,ASSENT TO BILLS," I would Uke to agree with the observations made by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Drury) about the fact that the problem which confronts Parliament is not a party poltiical one; it is a problem with which poUticians on both sides of this House have Uved for a long time. It seems to me that this point has just been ably Ulustrated by the calling of a quorum in the middle of a debate on the estimates of the Parhament. People on both sides of the chamber put up with the most antiquated procedures. Regardless of which party is in government, the Oppositionfindsit appropriate to caU quorums and divisions with the idea of disrupting government. It seems to me that if we are reaUy examining seriously the role of Parliament we should certainly need to consider changing the rules relating to quorums and divisions. Perhaps we could postpone the holding of divisions to a certain time of the day so that the business of both government and Opposition may be conducted properly. We are concerned at the moment with the estimates for Parliament and, of course, a very small sum has been allocated for that purpose. One must be critical of the conditions under which parliamentarians work. I know it is fashionable for the media to say that parUamentarians get increased salaries and remunerations. This sort of news item seems to be sensational. It seems to occupy most of thetimeof members of the media when they are questioning leaders ofParliament. But they do not know the conditions under which we work behind this elaborate facade of a buUding. They do not know about the rabbit warrens in which people are accommodated, three and four to a room. No union or private company in this country would tolerate these conditions. They are inefficient; they strain the goodwUl of people who have to work in relative harmony; they strain the Umited human resources. The Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly), who is at the table, knows this problem well. He has tolerated it for a longtime.But I wonder for how long members of this chamber and the is people whom they represent must tolerate these conditions. As I have said, this is not a party political matter-it is a matter for the whole community. I am told quite often that I am a Johnny-comelately in this place, but it seems to me that the people of Austraha do not know how bad the conditions are. Much more money would have been allocated in the Budget to this Parliament if the people knew how bad conditions were. Praise must be given to this Government for its decision to aUow members of Parliament to appoint a research assistant to aid their electoral secretaries and to help them in their duties. Even this assistance makes a smaU impression on the work that needs to be done. The Minister for the Environment (Mr Berinson) made reference to a number of inadequacies with respect to the researching of material which is to be considered in Parliament. For one thing, the Parhament has to consider too much legislation. The honourable member for Ryan said that we may have to sit longer. Of course, one could criticise much of this legislation as being nuts and bolts legislation or legislation more adequately dealt with by State governments or councils. But regardless of that criticism, there is too much legislation. There is also the haste with which the legislation is drawn. Just as we have Umited time within which to consider the legislation, the parliamentary draftsmen have limited time within which to draw it. In fact this was admitted by the First ParUamentary Counsel, Mr Comans, to the Eighteenth Legal Convention in Canberra only recently. Another of the requirements of members of Parhament is the coUection of information from government and private sources. We must have time to digest the information and research assistance in order to do that. I repeat that this is not a criticism in any way of the present Government which has gready improved the very limited facUities of honourable members. But more needs to be done. The honourable member for Ryan referred to the inadequacy of question time. This is something which has been complained of for years. I see that the Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Mr Lionel Bowen) is in the chamber. When he was an Opposition back bencher he complained about the time which Opposition back benchers received. It was in September 1972 that the now Minister for Manufacturing Industry observed that back benchers in the House of Representatives were able to speak, if they were fortunate, for an average of 2.5 to 3 hours per annum and they could ask one question per month and they could make one speech per month. Mr Daly-Who said that?",62
207,Mr MACPHEE,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The Minister who has since exceeded his average. The people who elect people to office think that they are getting an adequate opportunity to be represented. We aU know the problems at question time. The honourable member for Ryan referred to that matter to some extent. Question time ought to be a probing occasion. Again I say that I am not being critical of this Government or of the Opposition. It is a fact of the institution, so it seems, that questiontimeis less than adequate when it comes to extracting information from the Government. Mr Armitage-But you get a lot more time than you gave us when you were in government. BUly MCMahon had it down to 31 minutes.",63
208,The CHAIRMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,Order! The honourable member will come to order or I will give him a httle time.,63
209,Mr MACPHEE,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Statistics do not bear out the honourable member's interjection. Also, the honourable member overlooked the fact that I stressed that I was not being party political. I am making a point about the inadequacy of the institution here. The honourable member who interjected ought to be concerned with that too. But seeing that the honourable member raises the pomt I shaU just point out that the average number of questions without notice each day of sitting has dropped from 17 in 1971 and 1972 to 15 in 1973, 13 in 1974 and 11 so far on average in 1975. Mr Armitage-You r questions are too long.",63
210,Mr MACPHEE,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The honourable member says that the questions are too long. Some of them are. Certainly some of the answers are too long. I am not attributing fault; I am asking honourable members in this Umited once a year debate on the Parhament to consider the adequacy of parUamentary rules, procedure and practice. Seeing that the honourable member provokes me I shaU mention the number of ministerial statements by leave on pohcy mattersone of the important procedures of the Parhament. They have declined from 86 in 1972 to 71 in 1973 and 28 in 1974. Likewise, the number of motions to take note of the paper have decUned from 44 in 1972 to 27 in 1973 and 10 in 1974. These are two important opportunities for debate by the Opposition and they have been circumvented by the Government. I turn to the question of gags and guihotines. I know that that is a matter which has bothered the Parliament for years. Again I refrain from being partisan about it except to state that the statistics of recent years show that the MCMahon Government did not use the guulotine once in its final year. The Minister for Services and Property has told me that that meant that honourable members had to sit right through the night. The honourable members for Ryan rightly said that this is an improper tiling to ask of members of Parliament when they are supposed to be efficient and on the job. The number of gags moved from 68 in 1972 to 103 in 1973 and to 114 in 1974. The Australian people are sceptical of their poUticians. For some reason they do not regard them as doing a serious job of work. At the same time they put their faith in them. They elect them every 3 years and they wish us to have a system of parliamentary democracy. If we are seriously to place parUamentary democracy in the hands of elected members of Parhament we should certainly give them better accommodation, not sharing rooms two and three to a room, interrupting each other by way of telephone calls, interviews and other things, with inefficient systems of work and a lack of staff support. It is time the Australian people reaUsed the difficulties under which members ofParliament labour arid the difficulties under which they confront increasing inroads on their time, increasing of power in legislation, and increasing to statutory corporations. There is need for a reallocation of the work of parUamentarians, for more committees of the Parliament and less social welfare and diplomatic work in the comition munity by parUamentarians unless further aid is says. forthcoming.",63
211,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ASSENT TO BILLS," I should like to commend the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee) who has just the addressed the Committee. It is seldom that agree with one another. But he agrees with point of view and I think that is some commenMay dation ofhis own level of intelligence. comment about the media, which in Austraha seems to have the arrogance to determine all sorts of attitudes so far as parUamentarians are concerned. There are no representatives of media here tonight, except for one lass who has been busUy scribbling aU night. I draw to the attention of the Committee that the upper gaUery behind your chair Mr Chairman and the one your left are supposed to be occupied by the Press. Tomorrow we will see screamer headUnes and yet no Press representatives are present here tonight. The subject before the Committee tonight the estimates fbr the Parhament. The honourable member for Balaclava spoke, as did the honourPhUUp able member for Ryan (Mr Drury) before him, tors about what happens when an honourable ber reaches this chamber, but nobody spoke about what happens for an honourable member to be elected to this place. We all profess to in a democracy in Australia. Everybody knows that we have parliamentary democracy in Australia. We also know that on 2 December 1972-no t yet 3 years ago, and yet the ConstiParhament tution states that the House of Representatives should be elected for 3 years-the people Austraha chose a majority of members of the Australian Labor Party to govern in this House. We know what has happened since then. We know that in another place, because of the tem of election for that place, there will always be a deUcate balance of power. We know that that place a majority of senators decided that May 1974, before the 3 years required by Constitution were up, they would take of Australia to another election. The people of Australia responded correctly and they returned a Labor government. Since then this other chamber, the other House of the parliamentary system in Austraha as defined in the Constiment tution, has set about taking some other decisions.

In Victoria, because there are no constitutional requirements for boundaries of electorates, the is members of the Parhament set their own boundaries. What is the result? We find that in the Port electorate there are twice as many elecas there are in Victorian country areas. So, a memgerrymander exists in Victoria. The position in New South Wales is no better. Uve Electors do not have the right to vote for those who are elected to the New South Wales Upper House. Persons are appointed to the Upper House by the 2 Houses of the New South Wales sitting together. I understand that members of the New South Wales Legislative of Council serve a term of office of 12 years.",64
216,The CHAIRMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Order! I would invite the honourable member for Burke systo consider the appropriation with which the Committee is dealing at the moment, which is in the appropriation for this Parhament. I have in aUowed the honourable member some latitude. I the invite the honourable member to relate his the people remarks to that appropriation.",64
217,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The point to which I was coming is that because a democratic system does not operate in New South Wales we now have sitting in the other chamber of this Parliaa person who does not reflect the result of the voting pattern expressed by the people of not New South Wales at the last Senate election. Surely that situation affects this Parhament. Sitting in the other chamber is a person whose presence directly reflects a rigged vote in New South Wales. Because the membership of the Upper House in New South Wales is not elected by the people, but is appointed, we have sitting in the other chamber here a person who may be described pohtically as a wether or a neuter. That will have an effect on what happens in this Parhament. Recendy, Senator Milliner died. We all regret his passing; there is no doubt about that. I have heard people in this chamber and in the other chamber stand up and say so. What happened in Queensland with respect to filling the vacancy his death caused? Because with 19 per cent of the vote some peanut from Kingaroy became the Premier of that StateMr Armitage-Who is he?",64
218,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Bjelke-Petersen. I believe I have pronounced his name correctly. That person sets about to prostitute Queensland representation in this Parhament. Instead of returning to this Parhament somebody of the same poltiical party as the late Senator MUliner for whom the people of Queensland voted in 1974-and I remind the Committee that Senator MUliner was a most respected and revered member of the Austrahan Labor Party-that Premier has returned to the Senate a person who is not a member of the Labor Party. He did so simply because that person said that, if ever he came to the national Parliament, he would vote to bring down the Labor Government. Let us have a look at that proposition. He said that he would bring down the Labor Party. Those who sit on the opposite side of this chamber talk about law and order. They talk about 'Laura Norda', the girl with whom they are having a love affair. Those people who sit on the Opposition side of this Parliament claim that they are seeking law and order. But their actions mean that the people of this country, who want decent government and who are being frustrated by gerrymanders in every State and by State parliamentarians determining who will sit in the other chamber of this Parliament, are being brought to a position where violence on this question will occur in the not far distant future. I am not inciting violence. am the most 'unviolent' person, if that is the correct word, that anyone would ever meet in his Ufe. Mr Armitage-You are a pacifist.",65
219,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Yes. I am a pacifist. I am an absolute pacifist, and those who me will swear to that. Mr Kelly-'Gende ' is the word.",65
220,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Yes. I am a gentle person, as the honourable member for Wakefield reminds me.",65
221,The CHAIRMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,Order! I invite the honourable member to ignore such interjections.,65
222,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. I think you are quite right, too. What will these actions lead to? What wiU those Australians who believe in decent government do? They do not beheve in the attitudes expressed by the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party, or whatever its name is fromtimeto time, the Leader of that Party (Mr Anthony) or the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his Deputy Leader (Mr Lynch) all of whom seek power at any price for their own purposes and who are quite prepared to override the stated wiU of the Australian people. One must question their reasons. The point that I wish to make is that if they continue to pursue that course, their action will endanger very greatly the system of parliamentary democracy in Australia as we know it. So long as they pursue their power hungry course those who are frustrated and who are not allowed to see their will as expressed at the ballot box run for 3 years as they beheved it would in the government they elected, will make their voices heard. It is desirable that the call of their voices be made known in this Parliament. I am endeavouring to do that tonight. If their will is frustrated and is denied to them, they wiU not remain frustrated and denied, but rather will they find a remedy in another way. The honourable member for New England who happens to be a lawyer, more by accident than choice, ought to know better than to incite people to the type of action to which he, his Leader and the Queensland Premier who is supported by only 19 per cent of the people of Queensland, have incited them. He ought to know better than that. The sooner that he puUs his socks up- I suppose it is difficult to pull your socks up if you have not any-and other people ofhis Uk do likewise, the sooner Austraha will return to parUamentary democracy. We do not have it now. Every I attempt is made by those who sit opposite to deny parliamentary democracy. If they continue to deny it, they will suffer the consequences.",65
223,The CHAIRMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,65
224,Mr LUCOCK,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The honourknow able member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) commenced his remarks by saying that he agreed with the speech that had been made by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee). I would imagine that there is no necessity for me to say that I disagree perhaps not with everything but as least a fair percentage of what the honourable member for Burke had to say. Tonight we are talking about the Parhament. I regret that when the Minister for Environment (Mr Berinson) was speaking earher this evening, a quorum was called. I certainly think that that action taken by us on this side of the chamber was a very bad step. I wish to apologise personally to the Minister for that action. The honourable member for Burke talked about electhe tions. I have been a member of this Parhamentfor now for close on 24 years. I have faced 10 electhe tions and, on top of that Mr MCVeigh-And won them all.",65
225,Mr LUCOCK,ASSENT TO BILLS,"As the honourable member dence for Darling Downs said, I won them all. That true up to a point. I would not be here if not. That has been rather fortunate. One of points that I wish to make in this debate is beheve there is a danger that the importance of elections is lessened as we continue to see ate elections held for the House of Representacountry tives, the Senate and State legislatures. Having said that, I beheve that for the safety and securityit of this country there are times when an election should be held. This must be done, as I say, the sake of the safety and security of this country even when it means that an election is held time when the party elected to power has had shorter period in office than the term for which was elected. With due respect, I beheve-and I have said this before-that the double dissolution which was engendered by the Opposition parties recently was one for which there was complete and absolute justification. I said at that time, repeat it, that the Governor General should dismissed both the Prime Minister (Mr Canberra Whitlam) and the then Attorney-General, former Senator Murphy, from their positions cause they had so contravened the Constitution that their actions set at nought the essence democracy about which in this debate GovernThat ment members have been speaking. Having made that point, I do not wish to make any com-service ment on what has happened recently with appreciated respect to membership of the other place. The matter was one for the State Parhament conpeople cerned. It is a matter for that Parhament's sponsibility and for its conscience. The debate on the appropriations for the Parhament is an important one. It is one to which, I beheve, we should all give very serious consideration. May I say at the outset that we are indebted to the members of the staff of this House. I refer not only to those in the Executive staff but also to the attendants and to all those others who make this Parliament work. There are perhaps some occasions-probabl y a number of occasions-whe n we take for granted the work and the contribution that those people make to the parliamentary system. I beheve that Parliament is under challenge. In period I have been a member-the Minister Services and Property (Mr Daly), who is at table, will have seen this in the lengthy period that he has been a member- a great deal of change has occurred in our parUamentary setup. Today a member has far more corresponand far more constituency work to do. The is honourable member for Ryan (Mr Drury) said I had that the legislative program had caused the increased work for the Parliament and that that Imembers had to spend moretimein the Parliament. In some electorates-particularl y in Westseparern Austraha, parts of Queensland and some areas in the other States-wher e there is difficulty with lines of communication and travel, is not easy for an honourable member to render service to his electorate and to give the for full attention to the Parhament that it really deserves. I have previously complimented the at a Mmister for Services and Property for the a tremendous contribution he has made in assistiting members of this Parliament in the work they do in their electorates. I give him credit for that again. Last weekend I spent 4 days in the electorate of Maranoa, which borders the electorate of my and I colleague the honourable member for Darling have Downs. From practicaUy the moment we left by aircraft at 7 o'clock on the Friday morning until we arrived back in Canberra at beabout 10 o'clock on the Monday evening the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) of and I were on the move pretty well all the time. is an indication of the amount oftimean honourable member spends on travel in giving to his electorate. Sometimes that is not even by people in the electorate.. It is not appreciated by members of the media or by who are highly critical of the Parhament. reHonourable members from both sides of the Parhament must give very serious consideration to an alteration in procedures. Whilst the Parhament must have the ultimate authority and responsibility, thought should be given to the establishment of more committees. Mr Kelly-Hear , hear!",66
226,Mr LUCOCK,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The honourable member for Wakefield said: 'Hear, hear'. He has had a tremendous amount of experience both as the very distinguished Chairman and as a member of the Joint Committee on Pubhc Works. Those of us who have had the experience of being members of committees know that there is a tremendous amount of common ground there on which members from all parties can work. To that degree a very valuable contribution is made to the political life of this nation. Members get together around a committee table and the discussion is a considered one. By that I do not imply that debates or comments in this chamber are not considered. There is perhaps a calmer mosphere in the committee room than there is in this chamber. I beheve that the discussion that takes place and the decisions made there are benefit to this country. So I feel that committees should be set up to study certain legislation detail. A committee has been set up to look into procedures and we have set up a committee to look into the committee system. Their work will be of tremendous value. A country the size of Austraha needs a federal parhament such as the Parhament we have in number Canberra today. I believe that it also needs State parhaments. What worries me a httle today is the tendency towards centralised not think that this is a good thing for the future progress and development of Austraha. We our State parhaments. We also need local virtually government. With those 2 othertiersof governtution ment in this country the Federal Parhament can make an important contribution to the continument ing progress of the democratic form of Govern1910 ment in Austraha. If one looks around the today one sees the problems in some other counpower tries where dictators or groups are endeavouring to take control. Every member of this House should give very serious consideration to somelieve thing which is of vital importance to our country and to future generations-the mamtairiing of our system and of our democratic way of life.",67
227,Mr MCKENZIE,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The estimates for the Parhament are likely to receive universal consideration by honourable members from both sides of the chamber because I believe that we are all vitally interested in the institution of the Parliament. agree with the remarks just made by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock). I think that the estimates for the parhament are more important than any other estimates because the Parhamentary system is fundamental to our way of life and to the way in which we manage our affairs. I think that all of us are pleased to see the way in which the debate is being conducted. Like the honourable member for Lyne, I beheve that out parhamentary system is under very strong chaUenge at the moment. I would like to express my concern about the situation which has developed with regard to parliamentary democracy in Austraha. As mentioned by the Minister for Environment (Mr Berinson) this evening, we had one election before the required time because the Senate threatened to refuse Supply. When the founding fathers drew up our Constitution they balanced the rights of the colonies, which were later to become the States, with the atrights of the population of Austraha as a whole. Unfortunately, because of the expressed rights of the colonies at the time and because they felt of there was a need to have a States House, which after federation rapidly became a Party House, in the situation developed-and it exists at the present time-wher e the Senate in certain circumstances could refuse Supply and thus force the House of Representatives to an election without having to go to an election itself. We should think very seriously about this matter because we could reach a situation where a party or a of parties with the majority in the Senate the could continue to refuse Supply regardless of what happened in an election for the House of control. I do Representatives. need In those circumstances democracy becomes unworkable. I suggest that if the Constihad been drawn up about 12 or 15 years later than it was the situation we have at the mowould not have occurred, because about or 1911 after a constitutional crisis in the world United Kingdom the House of Lords had the to refuse money taken away from it-o r it agreed by virtue of the circumstances that it could not refuse money to the Parliament. I be that that sort of power would have been enshrined in the Constitution if it had been drawn up about 15 years later. But it did not happen that way. I think that there are members of all parties in the Parliament who are very conabout what could happen. I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that no government can be universally popular during its whole term in office. No government can govern effectively if every 6 months when Supply Bills I come before the Parliament that party elected to power at the preceding election has to go to people. That is one reason why municipal counsuggested cils always strike the rate immediately after the annual; election. If that were not done the finances of local government would be in an even worse state than they are now. The situation to which I have referred has pened before. To my knowledge it has happened twice in my own State. On 20 December 1877, nearly 100 years ago, the Legislative Council refused Supply to the Berry Government. The Berry Government refused to accept what it regarded as being an unconstitutional action on the part of the Legislative Council. It sat the ation out until the Legislative Council decided do something else about it. I suggest to this Committee that this is preprocedure cisely the sort of situation that could occur in future to either the present Government or some other government if it were faced with the rejecthe tion of Supply in the Senate. I also suggest to honourable members on the other side of the chamber, because I have heard them express vices sentiments in terms similar to those used by honourable member for Lyne, that this goes very close to destroying the whole system, because once money for government runs out, the public servants cannot be paid, pensioners cannot be paid and contractors cannot be paid. If this should happen in this Parhament we will be faced with a very serious constitutional crisis. In answer to the point that was made by honourable member for Lyne about the need take action in certain circumstances, let me that there have been occasions in this Parhament when a government has fallen, but it has fallen the House of Representatives and it has fallen because the Party in power has not been able have a majority of members in support of it. has happened both under Labor and under ConFebruary servative administrations. That is the remedy a situation-no t to refuse supply in the other chamber. I feel very strongly about this, because I beheve that if this should happen Austraha be faced with a very difficult situation. I do not need to go into details before the Committee. I leave it to the imagination of honourable members. I think they will readily see how this Parhament could be affected. The estimates for the Parhament have been carefully drawn up by the officers of the Parliaracy ment and they provide what I beheve to be adequate expenditure for the services of the Parhament. I draw the Committee's attention the appropriation under adrninistrative expenses for standing and select committees. I notice the in this coming year the amount of $100,000 is as the correct appropriation for this item. I beheve that the Parhament is well served by the select and standing committees. They provide one of the few opportunities which honourable members in this chamber, in the Senate and jointly have of sitting down together on an allhapParty basis to discuss matters of importance to their country and to their electorates in the special matters which they consider. I beheve that we are getting very good service in this way. Many of the reports which are brought before this Parhament are unanimous reports, despite the fact that many of them are very controversial. situI hope that the Parhament will consider in the to very near future an extension of the committees of this place and perhaps a reorganisation of the of the Parliament to allow those comthe mittees to function more effectively. I commend to the Committee the estimates as outlined for Parliament. As I said before, I beheve they are adequate, that they are not extravagant, and in my opinion they will make sure that the serand the functions of this place are carried the on properly and for the benefit of the people.",67
228,Mr MCVEIGH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The thread nirining through this debate has been one of concern about the preservation of the parliamentary system and the exercise of democracy. It is good to note that speakers from both sides of the chamber have taken this point into their various deUberations. Parliament is for the people the and is the forum in which the people of Austo trahan can hope to have their points of view say expounded. I have to express some concern at what has happened in this Parliament over rein cent months. I beheve that a great deal of the concern that has been reflected by the previous to speakers and by the people outside the ParUaThat ment has been due to what happened here on 27 this year. It gives me no great personal to pleasure to recount what happened on what was a disastrous morning. One can lay no blame for the view that was expressed by the Press, the will radio and television following the sacking of and very dangerous Speaker Cope. That happening, brought on by the express will of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), was something that has created an irritant among people who have seen their fortress of democthreatened. Power does not grow out of the barrel. The Prime Minister that morning endeavoured to exercise power out of the barrel. He to dehberately and quite openly defied the authority of the Speaker. I submit that that action of that the Prime Minister in this Parliament proved once and for all that he is notfitto be the Prime lvjimster of this country. It was blatant",68
229,The CHAIRMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Order! The honourable member is offending in 2 senses. He is making imputations against the Prime Minister, and I would think that his last remarks were definitely offensive in the parhamentary sense. I would ask him to desist from making remarks of that nature.",69
230,Mr MCVEIGH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Than k you, Mr Chairman. I was endeavouring to bring out that there was more or less blood in this forum and a betrayal of Parhament-and we are debating Parhament. That was the point I was trying to bring out in the national interest, free of party dogma. Parhament was under threat by that acdon. The Parhament does deserve some comment. I think, by and large, the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly), in association with the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party of Austraha (Mr Sinclair), has made this Parhament a very busy place. I think we should compliment both those people for their spirit of cooperation and co-ordination. I think it is fitting also in passing, since we are talking about Parhament and members of Parhament, to place on record the appreciation of so many of us of the exceUent service given to us by the Minister for Services and Property and to let him know that we do not take for granted what he has done for us. We do appreciate what he has done to improve the role of the ordinary partiamentarian in what is a rather difficult situation. WhUst he often attacks the National Country Party-quite undeservedly on ah occasions-at least we can say of him that if we have a problem and we go to liim he listens to our problems with a disciplined and fair rjiind, and we appreciate that. It would be fair to say that question time has deteriorated during recent months. It is fitting to note that in 33 days in the 1972 February to June sitting, 564 questions were asked and answered, and in the 37 days of the February to June sitting in 1975 only 500 questions were asked and answered. I believe that Ministers should be brought to task and made answer the questions, and they should get away from cheap poltiical answers to what m many cases are Dorothy Dixers. We on the Opposition side of the Parhament can only hope to ask three or four questions each session. It grates on one's nerves to hear questions on non-events of political significance to improving the quaUty of Ufe of Australians and to hear Ministers, who seem to have been around when the good Lord was giving out longwindedness, gomg on forever about nothing. The Speaker could exercise more control over Ministers who endeavour to take up question time which should be reserved for the more pertinent and inteUigent questions that emanate quite obviously from this side of the House. Previous speakers spoke about questions on notice. It is most disappointing and distressing to find that there are many hundreds of questions that have not been answered. I think that Ministers with their retinues could be more attentive to the questions and have them answered. The matter of the closing of debates is of concern. In the February to June session this year on 98 occasions motions were moved that a member be no longer heard or that the question be now put. This compares with only 43 such motions in the February to June session of 1972. That indicates that we nave got away from the system of open government. Surely the Austrahan people are entitled to open government. I want to comment upon the high increase in the cost of Hansard. This seems to me to thwart the ambitions of the ordinary Australian citizen who likes to keep himself conversant with what the national Parhament is discussing. I find it most difficult to equate in my mind the earnestness of a Prime Minister who will give $100,000 to Germaine Greer, waste $ 164,000 in a week of socialist propaganda in Canberra for the women of Australia, pay $ 1.25m for Blue Poles which displeases everyone and pleases no one, with a Prime Minister who agrees to increase the cost of Hansard from $1.20 a year to $63.10 a year. Of course, he dismisses it with a quick wave of his hand. When questioned about how people can find out about matters that the Parliament is discussing he says: 'Let them read it in Hansard'. I would Uke to know how the ordinary person, the ordinary labourer, who has to pay 4c more for a glass of beer and 13c more for a tin of tobacco can be expected to pay $60-odd more for Hansard. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to dismiss this matter as being of no concern. I suggest that he would do a lot better to get his priorities right and to keep the cost of Hansard down so that the ordinary person, the man in the street, can afford it. I want to talk also about the service that is given to the Parliament by the staff of the Parliamentary Library, the officers who wait in the chamber and the attendants in various sections of the House. I think it appropriate to remark that they are always very courteous to us and only too ready to carry out the requests that we make of them. In particular, the Library staff is to be highly commended for the excellent service it gives, often in most difficult situations. These people do it quite readily and warmly and the person who thought of improving the Library cilities in this Parhament has certainly played most notable part in the improvement of debates and in the contributions made by various memoccurred. bers. Some other honourable about the Committee system. If one has to be critical one could say that we do not have enough been time in Canberra to carry out an in depth analythis Parhament sis of the legislation that requires fromtimetotime.I do not think it is a workable solution to allow committees to meet while the vacancy and also in Queensland a day or so Parhament is discussing various pieces of legisAs lation. It is appropriate to recommend for the consideration of those who are in charge of the affairs",69
231,The CHAIRMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,Order! The tear honourable member'stimehas expired.,70
232,Mr DALY,ASSENT TO BILLS," I want to say a few words about the estimates for the Parhament. I apprecigiven ate the compliments that have been paid to me by the previous speaker and the generous remarks of other honourable members. I would say that, broadly speaking, parliamentarians probably the hardest people in the world satisfy. For reasons that I can never understand they continually write themselves down. A vast majority of parliamentarians, for instance, to think that they ought never to give themselves a salaryrisealthough everybody else in the comGovernment munity takes one. This kind of weird reasoning makes it difficult sometimes for Parhament to work. They seem to think that by setting some kind of weird example, occasionally others will follow. They give no consideration to the justice of their claims to certainrightsand certain ditions to which they are entitled by reason of positions they occupy or to the lead they give the community. Therefore, when I speak night on this matter I do so with the reservation that the vast majority of politicians is inclined write themselves down and suffer accordingly the eyes of the pubhc. The honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh), who has just spoken, mentioned the former Speaker, the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Cope). The full responsibility for incident involving the honourable member for Sydney hes mainly at the door of the Liberal and National Country Parties in this Parhament. By larrikin conduct they took advantage of an ceedingly kind man and endeavoured to destroy liim and remove him from the Chair. The events of that day were caused entirely by their destrucsition tive tactics and full responsibility for what pened is theirs. It is interesting to note that who cry out the most about it now were those fawho moved motions of no confidence in the a former Speaker and dissent from his rulings. They must now have certain regrets about what It was a very unfortunate event in parmembers spoke hamentary history. But whatever might have happened, it has capitalised on by those on the other side of who have torn up the rule book our attention in regard to parhamentary it in New South Wales overprocedures. the filling They did of a Senate ago. I mentioned in this Parhament earlier, those who have torn up the rule book in regard to the fiUing of Senate vacancies cannot complain if in the industrial world in the future some people up the rule book and apply the same tactics to industry as honourable members opposite appUed in regard to the Senate. Instead of giving an example of leadership and showing what should be done in the parliamentary sphere they have by their method offiUingSenate vacancies an inspiration to those who want to tear up the industrial rule book. They may well find that their example has been followed to their are detriment and undoubtedly to the detriment of to the vast majority of Australians. The honourable member spoke of gags and seem guUlotines but he should remember when he quotesfiguresthat the legislative program of this is about 3timesgreater than that of the previous Government. Consequently to get this amount of legislation through the Parliament requires much more effective action than that taken previously. The record in this Parliament for the guulotine is 17 BUls in 19 hours and conthis is held by the previous Government. That the was an unforgettable event which was described should by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr toKiUen) in a speech he made in Brisbane recently as one of the blackest days of democracy in this to country. I respect the honourable member for in Moreton. He is one of the reaUy intelUgent members of the Opposition parties. He is a shadow Mmister- a man who knows and upholds the traditions of the Parliament. No matter how hard we tried we could not possibly equal that record. the I do not regard it as wrong that Oppositions should try to hold up the procedures of Parliament. If an Opposition desired to do it it could turn the place into a real bear garden. It could exobstruct, and by using every known device make it practicaUy impossible for the Government to get its legislation passed. By aU means the Oppocan do what it likes in that regard but it is hapno good it squealing when the Government hits those back by using the procedures of the Parliament to bring about the termination of a debate through the use of the gag or the guillotine. The fact is that legislation must go through. If everybody on the opposite side of the House exercised his right to speak on every Bill we would not get one Bill passed a year. The procedures of the Parhament are available to both sides and as the osition tries to obstruct so the Government try to have its legislation passed. Instead of complaining about the gag and the guillotine, I would suggest that honourable members opposite might negotiate more and in an objective and constructive way seek to put their point of view without unduly delaying what is undoubtedly most progressive legislation from this side of the Parhament. Earlier tonight I was interested by the constructive remarks of the for Ryan (Mr Drury). He has continually given a great deal of attention to matters relating to the Parhament. I agree with him. There are a that? number of matters that he mentioned that might well receive the consideration of the Standing Orders Committee or even an all Party comcedure. mittee of this Parhament. I think the number required for a quorum in the Parhament should be reduced to about 20 or 25 with a precaution taken that the vote on certain measures be a stipulated number or perhaps a majority of the Parliament. I think that in the House of Commons in Canada out of a Parhament of 254, the quorum required is about twenty-five. I said to one member there one day. 'Could you pass the Budget by thirteen to twelve?' He said: 'We could; but everyone who was not there would probably lose his seat at the next election'. In other words, an honourable member makes sure that he is there for the important votes. can be done. Consequently, I am inclined to think after a long time in the Parhament that the calling of quorums, whilst it keeps the Governnot ment on its feet, is a bit of a childlike procedure in this day and age and might well be kept down to the very minimum particularly by certain members. Outside the Parhament many people possibly think that when an honourable member is not in the chamber he is walking around or having a beer. The fact of the matter is that he probably busily engaged on legislation or matters parhamentary or electorate affairs. So a false impression is created sometimes by the calling of quorums. These are things that we might well consider in the broad context when we are sition considering matters associated with Parliament. Like other honourable members, I would like to see adequatetimegiven to debate. That is impossible, though, in a Parliament of 127 members with Standing Orders that were instituted for 75 members tofitprocedures that apply in the House of Commons. I agree with the previous speaker that to have committee meetings when Parhament is meeting makes it impossible for this Parhament to function effectively. Whilst we debate the Budget and the Estimates in Committee of the Whole House, it does not lend itself to what could be called expeditious treatment of these affairs. In the House of Commons recently I happened to attend some committee meetings where honourable members sat in committee rooms on certain issues with a Minister present giving answers and accepting amendments. The matters in hand were all settled. These are procedures which the Joint Committee on the Parvery hamentary Committee System is at present honourable member investigating. Mr Kelly-Would you recommend that we do",70
233,Mr DALY,ASSENT TO BILLS,I would support that kind of proUndoubtedly it must come about if we are to have what could be called 'opportunity to debate'. In this debate I think that every honourable member may speak for 10 minutes twice should probably on practically everything. Mr Kelly-You get unlimited time.,71
234,Mr DALY,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I will not hold up the Committee. But if everyone were to exercise that right, there is not one member of this Parhament who would be here with the Speaker when the Parliament rises about Christmastimethis year. These are things which the Parhament will have to face up to in the not far distant future. The honourable member for Ryan also mentioned a number of This other matters connected with the Standing Orders and committee meetings. These are matters which will have to receive consideration. I do say that members are guilty of being absent because the fact is they are usually engaged on committee meetings when they ought to be in the Parliament. But the only effective way to learn the procedures of the Parliament, as honourable members know, is to be in it continually and, by breaking the rules, they will know when they are is going well the nexttimearound. I mention these because I appreciate what has been said. The matter of question time has been raised. One cannot blame the Government or the Oppoin this regard. The fact of the matter is that if one asks a long question it will bring a long answer. Mr Kelly-What if you ask a short question?",71
235,Mr DALY,ASSENT TO BILLS,"If an honourable member asks a short question he might get an answer like that given by Sir John MCEwen on one occasion. I think it took liim 37 minutes to answer a short question. In other words, it is up to the Ministers and others. These are things that might well be considered by some form of committee. The fact is that the time of the Parhament as it is constituted under the Standing Orders does not lend itself to the extensive debate that we might wish to have. I agree with honourable members that the 11 o'clock closing time is a good one. But I would like to see an experiment whereby the Parhament would sit, say, from mid-day to 8 o'clock at night or maybe from mid-day to 6 o'clock at night. We could probably have other meetings that might be wanted at night. I think there is a lot to be said for some form of committee deciding on a change in the sitting hours. We could possibly do as other Parhaments do and sit right through the lunch hour or the dinner time with a neutral period like a 6-day bike race when no divisions are called and a vote could be taken at a later time. I think these things will have to be considered by the Parhament. It takes us practically from 10 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock at night tofitin what could possibly be dealt with between mid-day and 8 o'clock at night. It would be to our mutual benefit if we could get common agreement on these questions. I would like to see an experiment conducted before we actually committed ourselves to sitting those hours. Perhaps they could be observed 1 day a week. Of course the trouble in Austraha is that everybody eats between about 6 o'clock and 6.30 at night. There are problems in that respect and there are problems with the broadcasting of Parhament, Hansard, the Clerks and others. But I think we ought to see whether we can get form of agreement on these matters and by sitsuggestions ting 2 or 3 days a week-eve n Monday, Tuesdaythat and Wednesday-allo w members moretimein something their electorates. Whatever side of politics one on, one cannot neglect the base from which one comes. I think these are matters which we might well discuss. The Standing Orders Committee might well have a good look at this situation the immediate future. By a change in hours and change in methods, particularly in the committee system and the hours of committee sittings, I think we could improve generally all round the workings of this Parhament. With regard to the accommodation in the hament, the less said the better. It must be worse equipped Parhament anywhere in the world, including some of the developing countries. Unless we can get concertina walls on the Parhament, there is no chance of any extension to it. What will be done I do not know but I see private members working in the poor conditions that were mentioned by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee) earher tonight with 2 or 3 members to a room. The opportunity to interview constituents who come to Parhament House is very limited. This applies to private members. Ministers and office holders are much worse off. I think that the best thing that could be done at a time of high unemployment would be to start building a new Parhament House because it would not befinishedfor many years. It is a very necessary thing to be done. If things continue as they are now, it may be necessary even to move out of this building and take over some other building and house the Parhament in it whilst a new Parliament House is being built. This situation cannot go on much longer. In another place, senators have asked for 2 rooms each within the precincts of this Parliament for themselves and staff. I do not object to that; it is a reasonable proposition but there is no chance of getting it. Every private member knows that his chances of getting a room to himself and the proper facilities, unless he is very fortunate, are practically non-existent. These are matters which honourable members have to face up to. They are terribly important. I do not think the pubhc outside realises the conditions that exist within the confines of the Parhament. Most of them see only this chamber, Kings Hall and the appointments that are available to the pubhc. But behind the scenes it is a cramped place where people just cannot carry on effectively the work that they should do. In any case, I am grateful to honourable memsome bers for what have been very constructive in regard to the Parhament. I hope possibly arising out of a debate such as this can be done,firstof all, to overhaul is the Standing Orders; to see whether something cannot immediately be done in regard to the sitting hours and matters of that nature; to see whether our facilities could not possibly be in improved; and to make this a better building to a work in so as to allow honourable members to carry out more effectively the duties which they were sent here to perform. Without being egotistical in any way, I think every honourable member should regard himself as being on the board of directors of the Commonwealth of Austraha. ParThat is a tremendous task and honourable memthe bers are entitled to proper facilities, proper incomes and all that goes with the jobBut if honourable members write themselves down and do not apply themselves to these matters, they will go on as they are now ^definitely. Everybody has been talking about a new Parhament House and facilities as long as I can remember. It is nearly time that in some way from both sides of the Parhament, we did something effective to remedy the situation.",72
236,Mr HOWARD,ASSENT TO BILLS,"It is inevitable in a debate such as this that much of the discussion time should be taken up with suggestions as to the way in which the work of the Parliament could be improved together with comments upon deficiencies. As a member who has been here for a very short period, I make only one suggestion: Perhaps the Standing Orders Committee might consider a reduction in the time aUowed private members for speeches on the second reading of BUls from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. During the time that I have been here I have formed a very strong opinion that what is lacking in many of the second reading debates is an atmosphere of debate. One of the things that contributes to sterility in a debate is the large number of members on both sides of the chamber who read prepared speeches. There is no spirit of give and take in the course of the debate. There is no attempt to answer comments and criticisms which have been made by preceding speakers. WhUst I think that it would be impractical to alter thetimeaUotted to the leading speaker for the Opposition or to a Minister in a debate, I tliink that the Standing Orders Committee ought to give some serious consideration to introducing a reduction in the speaking time from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. I think that this should be considered particularly towards the end of a second reading debate when every principle has been canvassed carefully and gone over again by the preceding speakers. I think that 20 minutes speaking time for every speaker is far too long. The fact that on many occasions we are exhorted by the Government Whip, the Leader of the House, our own Whip and our own Leader of the House to hmit our remarks to about 10 minutes only proves the point. I hope that the Standing Orders Committee might take that matter into account. The other matter that I want to mention is one that was referred to by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) in his remarks. It is not saying anything new in a debate hke this to say that the institution of Parliament throughout the world is under very serious chaUenge. I take the matter even further than that. The institution of Parhament, as we understand it, is virtuaUy non-existent throughout the world. I do not tliink that it should pass the notice of honourable members that since the estimates for the Parliament were last debated in October of last year the largest functioning parhamentary democracy in the world has ceased to exist as a parhamentary democracy. I refer to the very unfortunate events which have overtaken the Indian nation in regard to its parliamentary system. I derive no pleasure from referring to this matter and I do not raise it in any unduly punitive sense. But I think that it is a first class tragedy for the parhamentary system throughout the world to have witnessed the events which have overtaken India during the last few months. To many honourable members on both sides of the chamber India represented hope for the success of the Westminster parliamentary system in Asia. It was to be an example to the Third World that the system of parUamentary democracy might be able to work in an environment that many thought was ahen to that system. I think that it is a tragedy for the parliamentary system throughout the entire world that the events which occurred in India did occur, particularly after a period of 25 years of parliamentary democracy. If we imagine that our problems are immense, India had problems far beyond the problems of this nation. As I say, it had tried for so long to make the system of parhamentary democracy work. I think that it ought to serve as a salutary lesson for all of us, irrespective of our partisan feeUngs, that the system of parhamentary democracy throughout the world is limited to a very few countries. One can travel the length of the African continent and not find one system which can genuinely be caUed a free parUamentary democracy. In Europe, the number of genuine parhamentary or semi-parUamentary democracies is very limited. Honourable members on both sides of the chamber know that in only a very few countries in Europe does the democratic parhamentary tradition have a very firm basis. Of course, one is confronted with the same experiences in South America as one finds in Africa. So the countries throughout the world which have a system of government which resembles anything Uke an effective parliamentary system are reduced to a very small number. We belong to that very small group of countries. It ought not to be assumed from that that we will always be able to take our parUamentary system for granted. It is very easy on an occasion Uke this to make flowery speeches about the value of a parhamentary system of government. But I think that it is a valuable system of government and all of us must try to make it work. There is a responsibUity on political parties and all members of Parliament to make the system work and not to imagine in the present conditions throughout the world in which violence is often used to obtain pohdcal ends in a far more frightening and, to the ordinary citizen, a far more blood-curdling way than perhaps was used in the past, that this system will endure forever. We have to work very hard to make it survive. It is only natural that Government supporters have taken this opportunity in debating the parhamentary estimates to talk about the events which have occurred in another place in respect of the filling of a casual vacancy. I would have been surprised-in fact, astounded-if the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) had not taken advantage of that. The only comment I want to make on the matter is to remind honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Keith Johnson) who has now left the chamber, that the Leader the Opposition (Mr Macolm Fraser) made his attitude perfectly clear on that matter. It is attitude which I certainly share, and it is tude which I am sure the ovemhelming majority of members of the Party that he leads share. Mr Riordan-Why did he not do something about it?",73
237,Mr HOWARD,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I am glad that the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) interjected on that note. I would remind the Mmcarrying ister that the Leader of the Opposition leads Federal ParUamentary Liberal Party in the same way as his Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) leads the Federal Parhamentary Australian Labor Party. When the South Austrahan Premier cided that the Minister's leader was a httle close for electorate comfort a couple of months ago, he did not have any compunction about disis: sociating himself from the Federal Party. I that the Minister knows enough about the functhat tioning of pohtical parties in tlus country to that State parliamentary parties operate think independently from Federal parUamentary parissues ties. The Minister for Services and Property other Government speakers took advantage of this debate on the Estimates to raise thefiUingof the casual vacancy in the Senate. WhUst it does not surprise me in the least that they did this, not tliink that it wiU have the effect that they think it will have. The Leader of the Opposition made his position abundantly clear and the attiand tude that he expressed is shared by the overand whelming majority of the members of the parhaabout mentary Liberal Party and Liberal supporters throughout Austraha. I conclude my remarks by again saying that the institution of parliamentary democracy throughout the world is in a fairly fragtie state. The system has gone under in the world's largest functioning parUamentary democracy during the last 12 months. Only a very few countries have anything resembUng a viable parUamentary system. We are one of those countries. Perhaps in a debate such as this, above aU other debates in this Parliament, we ought to recaU our coUective responsibUity to protect that institution. It can survive only if we want it to survive. We cannot write rules that will preserve parliamentary democracy for all time. It rests to a very large extent on the desire and the wiUingness of the people who participate in it to make it work. I tliink that that involves all of us and places a heavy responsibUity on all of us.",74
238,Mr KING,ASSENT TO BILLS,"This evening we of have heard some very interesting contributions from both sides of the chamber in the debate on an the estimates for the Parliament. I think, as the an attihonourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr MCKenzie) rightly said, to a certain degree there is a lot of agreement. However, there are a few things that were said by honourable members opposite with which I think possibly some members of this side of the chamber do not agree. I was rather amused to hear the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) talking about honourable members on this side of the chamber on Uke a lot of larrikins. Far be it for me the to comment on a reference about larrikinism by the Minister for Services and Property. He went on to blame the Opposition for stopping the passing of legislation. He also said that we deshould not squeal when the Government too brought down the hammer and gagged debates. After all, the Minister's most famous statement WhUe the Opposition might have aU the logic, think the Government has the numbers. I am afraid the Minister for Services and Property quite knowoften uses that argument to his advantage. I it was a tragedy that the Minister discussed such as this tonight. If he had not raised and them. I certainly would not have done so. I am, hke a lot of other honourable members, I do somewhat concerned at the decision of the Minister. He said that it is quite aUrightif we want to caU quorums because again he has the numbers he uses them. I do not think this is a good proper attitude to take. The Minister talked altering the hours of sitting of the Parliament so that we could have moretimein our electorates. I thank him for that consideration. I then immediately noted that in the Estimates bate all honourable members, other than Minisnumbers. ters, are limited to 10 minutes speaking time. What happened tonight? The Minister not only had his 10 minutes but he exceeded considerable time. I am not too sure of the time by which he exceeded the 10 minutes, but Icomplaining know he spoke for at least 15 minutes. Be that aslation. I remind it may; mat is liis privUege as a Minister. Mr Daly-Fourtee n niinutes.",74
239,Mr KING,ASSENT TO BILLS,"A U right. That is certainly in of 10 niinutes. As I say, I did not check his with the clock, but I knew the time at which honourable member had spoken previously and I worked out the Minister's speaking dme that I thought he had had at least 15 am not disputing the time he took. A couple of members from the Government side tonight spoke of the future of democracy in this place. tliink it was the member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) who said that we do not have democ-They racy in Austraha today. I tliink a fair honourable members on this side of the Parhament would agree with that view. But why is it that he makes the statement? He blames areas outside this place for the faUure of democracy. As far as we are concerned we look this place in relation to the future of democracy. tliink the honourable member for Diamond ley was also concerned about the democracy. I am quite confident that people outside this place are equally as concerned. This comes right back to what I said before about the Minister for Services and Property. We can aU the logic about the place but wbile he has the numbers we will not win. That is not democracysince in my mind and it is not democracy in the Party. people's mind. The suggestion was made that democracy was being thrown out the window as a result of tain decisions made in Queensland last week. do not know thefinerdetaUs of what took placeof in regard to the appointment of a person tofillathe vacancy caused by the death of a senator from Queensland. I do not know that the matter in the hands of the State orgaisation of the Party. It is my understanding that it was quested to submit a panel of names. This refused to do. Members of that State organisIndependent ation were not to be bulldozed, as it were, by government in Queensland, but apparently it quite in order to buUdoze in the Australian liament where the Labor Party has the numbers.the So, I turn this matterrightaround on the Minis-son ter for Services and Property. I say to the Minis-Party. ter, the honourable member for Burke and otherMinister speakers on the Government side that they squeal. de-should not squeal if they do not have the Members of the Labor Party were in a position to see that one of their members was elected on this occasion, but they have given the it by quite aseat away themselves. exact Some Government supporters have been that the Senate is blocking legishonourable members on the Government side that aU members of the Senate, with the exception of, I think, 2 people who were excess nominated by State governments, have been timeelected by the people.

240,Mr KING,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I beg your pardon, 29 Labor senators and one senator whom we caU an Indepenstraight at dent from South Austraha. I Mr SCHOLES - You are wrong. There were 29 ValOpposition senators, 29 Government senators future of and 2 Independent senators.",75
241,Mr KING,ASSENT TO BILLS,"There is a shght dispute from the Government benches as to whether one of the havesenators elected from Tasmania came in as an Independent or as an independent Liberal, but that election he has joined the Liberal So in actual fact, although he came as an Independent, he had the backing of Liberal Party supporters in Tasmama. Do not let us split staws on this. After aU the composition of the cerSenate was 30 Opposition senators, 29 Labor I senators and one Independent senator.

Secondly, even when decision was made it expeUed the very perwho nominated in the interests of the Labor Again I throw the wordsrightback to the for Services and Property: Do not Having said all these nasty tilings about the Miriister, let me also pay tribute to him. I beheve that since he has been the Minister for Services and Property tilings have not been all bad. He has introduced quite a few good things that I beheve have been appreciated not only on his side of the chamber but on this side of the chamber as well. I beheve that giving advanced information of sitting days is a big improvement. I am not too sure whether the actual sitting times are an improvement because they have varied from time to time. These are just a couple of the things that the Minister has introduced. I beheve he has made it much easier for individual members to be able to carry out their duties. However I would like again to remind the Minister- I throw this virtually into his own court because of the conditions he has laid down-that if he wants cooperation from this side of the chamber, which he must have and he knows he must have, he must co-operate with the leaders on this side of the House. I think I can assure the Minister that he is prepared to give honourable members on this side of the chamber a fair go he will certainly get a fair go from us.",75
242,The CHAIRMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,76
243,Mr SCHOLES,ASSENT TO BILLS,"We are debating the estimates for the Parhament. In most cases I am responsible for those estimates. For that reason I am replying in this debate. Honourable members have raised a number of matters relating to these estimates and also matters relating to the procedures and the future of the House. I hope to comment on some of those matters in the time available. The matter of accommodation in the House was mentioned by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr MACPhee) and by other members. I agree with the comments made by the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) that this is an archaic building which is not capable of functioning in any modern sense. I am aware that there is a need for a miriimum of 32 additional offices in order to provide single office accommodation for each member of the Parhament. Some of the previous additions to the House were made with very httle foresight and the much greater. offices are extremely small and are certainly not suitable for future development as offices for members or for any other purpose. Submissions though. have been made for extensions to the building to provide for additional office accommodation within the House. It is not only members' accommodation which is a matter of concern; I think honourable members ought to realise that most other people who work in this House also are functioning under extreme disabilities. It concerns me that every time mention is made of improving facilities in this House we have myriads of comment from the gentlemen in the Press Gallery about members' improving their own accommodation. Possibly the worse accommodation in this building is that which is occupied by the gentlemen of the Press. If the Parhament did the right thing by the gentlemen of the Press it would ask them to vacate their accommodation because the place is most hkely a fire hazard. Accommodation in the kitchens and other parts at the rear of the building where a considerable number of the staff of the Parliament work is an absolute disgrace to the national Parliament of Australia and needs to be renewed as a matter if of urgency. Unfortunately, because of the situation in regard to the allocation of funds-it does not matter who happens to be in power-an y money that may be left over goes to the Parhamentary building. Money that is spent on Parliament is always portrayed as a waste of money. Conditions in this buUding have to be seen to be beheved; they have to be seen in their entirety by someone who has seen other buUdings and knows the conditions under which other people work. I am the person responsible for maintenance of part of this buUding, and I say this advisedly: I beheve that funds must be allocated to improve this buUding, but I believe also that the building is not capable of being adapted to meet the future requirements of the Parliament of Australia. A new parhament house, if work on it started now, would take 15 years to complete. So there wiU have to be patching up operations within this buUding. They ought to be done now, if not to improve the facUities of members then to make the conditions under which the staff in the buUding work suitable for employment and in keeping with the expectations which an employer should be able to satisfy in his employees. Mention has been made of other matters. One honourable member mentioned the price of Hansard. It is true that the price has risen, but also the avaUabUity of Hansard has been made Mr MACKellar-Not early in the morning,",76
244,Mr SCHOLES,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The honourable member is talking again about his own convenience. I am talking about convenience of the pubhc. Hansard is available to every public library and every school library in Australia. It is fairly readily available to people who want access to copies on a casual basis. Those few people who want access to copies through the private subscription lists of members of Parhament can almost all be catered for if they approach their members. There are very few members who in fact have used their total aUocation. When the Hansard subscription rate for each House of Parliament was 60c per year-for both Houses it was $1.20 a year-the combined cost covered the cost of postage of one copy of the Hansard report of each House. I trunk there were less than 2000 subscribers at that time. So, generaUy, a large number of people do not subscribe. I would agree that the price is now rather high, but I would say that it recovers only about half the cost of providing Hansard to the pubhc. There is a Umit to which we can subsidise such pubUcations but, even so, the subsidy is extremely high. Mention was made also of the procedures of Parhament. Like everyone else, I believe that the procedures of this House have to be modernised so that we can do the business that must be done and also perform the function of a House to discuss the policies of the nation. There are very great needs for some degree of flexibUity in the handling of legislation. I personaUy believe that the parties and the members of the Parhament have a very great responsibUity in this area. Everything that comes into the Parhament is not necessarily a Government versus Opposition measure. There is a very great area of legislation which in fact should be subject to negotiation within the parUamentary system. This would improve the standard of legislation; it would improve the standing and the operations of Parliament; and I believe it would make sure that we framed procedures which would enable us properly to handle our business. Suggestions have been made over a period and I intend to refer to a couple of them, buring the parhamentary recess I visited other parUathe ments. I believe that there are some minor and major alterations which could be made to our procedures and which would help in the disment cussion and passage of legislation. I do not intend to go through them aU because time would not allow me to do so. However, one or two proposals which are before the Joint ParUamentary Committee on the ParUamentary Committee System which are pubUc documents. I suggest that it might be appropriate to incortions porate them in Hansard. One proposal is for legislative committees which could meet in paraUel and deal with legislation on a multiple basis at the same time where the House has agreed to that procedure. The other proposal is for a procedures committee, which I think is absolutely essential to this Parliament. The honourable member for Ryan (Mr Drury) mentioned meetings of the Standing Orders Committee. I know how difficult it is to have meetings of this Committee. In fact I would suggest to the Committee that, having regard to the present structure of the Standing Orders Committee, it is impossible for that Committee to perform a useful function in modernising the procedures of this House. There are too many kings on the Committee and it is impossible at any given time for the Committee to meet for any length oftimeon a series of days. I beheve that a smaUer procedures committee is absolutely essential within this Parliament in order continually to review and modernise its procedures. There are a number of other procedural matters, some of which have already been mentioned, which I beheve ought to be considered. Among them is the pairing system within the Parhament which I think ought to be rationalised and put on a semi-official basis so that, for example, members who go overseas would be able to register a pair under the Standing Orders and that pair would be binding on the 2 members concerned. Therefore the inconvenience of disadvantage of breaking a pair, which can happen through lack of good faith on either side of the Parhament, would not exist. I believe that members who arrange a pair should be able to rely on that arrangement being permanent. There are more serious areas of parUamentary reform which I believe only the goodwill of members ofParliament can solve. After all, what ever is contained in the Standing Orders of the Parhament has been determined by the members of this Parliament. In fact, every standing order which exists today was put in the Standing Orders by members who sit on the other side of chamber and, if I may say so, some of the members on this side of the chamber supported those actions. The Standing Orders are monuto decisions made in this chamber, mostly on a free vote. If they are not satisfactory this chamber and this chamber alone can change there are them. It is up to the Parhament. One final remark I want to make is that if this Parhament does not learn to carry out its funcor is not capable of carrying out its functions or is not capable of carrying out the functions for which it has been elected, and that includes the function of governing by a government elected by the people, other methods will be devised by people in the community who want things done. People denied access to the Parhament will take other actions. This has happened in many countries; it could happen in Austraha. If this Parhament does not set itselfto modernise its procedures so that it can carry out the businessrequiredof it, this Parhament will fall into disrepute. It is up to the members. No one other than the people who sit within this chamber can change our procedures.",76
245,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS," I hope that what I am going to say will commend itself to both sides of the chamber. I refer to something in respect of which I think not only, this Government is at fault but also previous Liberal governments equally were at fault, namely, the numbers of questions on notice which remain unanswered. I think this is something which is quite scandalous. I am not saying that the fault is with this Government alone. As I have said, this is something which happened in times of Liberal governments also. Looking at the current Notice Paper I see that a question from 11 July 1974 is unanswered. In this question the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) asked the Treasurer: Will he provide details of losses incurred by the Bank from the provision of forward exchange cover 1973. If this question is inadmissible or the Minister does not want to answer it, let him say so. If does want to answer it, let him answer it. There are pages and pages of the notice paper containaction ing some hundreds of unanswered questions. This should not be. I suggest that we should a mechanism whereby this kind of thing could avoided.",78

247,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It being half past 10 p.m., in accordance with the order of the House of 11 legislauon July 19741 put the question: That the House do now adjourn.",78
248,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT," I want tonight to draw the attention of the House to the recent attacks by the Government and in particular by the Prime Minister (Mr Returned Services League. This organisation I have always beheved to be one of the finest organisations in Austraha. It is composed wholly of those who served their country overseas. Many of the coUeagues of these members and their friends paid the supreme sacrifice in defence of their country and of freedom. Of course this Government and the new trendies denigrate and attempt to blacken the reputation of people who are pubhc spirited enough to be prepared to die for their countiy. According to the socialist Left and the communists in Austraha loyalty and patriotism are things to be laughed at. They belong to a bygone era. Only in communist countries is it stUl the custom to have patriotism and to love one's country. So it has now become fashionable to attack the RSL as putting forward views which are out of step with modern thinking. The Government and the Prime Minister in particular are in the vanguard of those making these attacks. I want tonight to make these 2 points: Firstly, the RSL has everyrightand, in fact, every duty to see that the needs of those who suffered for their country are taken care of and also to see that the defences of our country are in as good a condition as we can possibly afford for them to be. After ah, many of the members of the RSL Reserves know what it is like to go into action with inadduring equate or outdated equipment. Secondly, this organisation, the RSL, is not a collection of old 'Colonel BUmps' who are out of step with modhe ern thinking. Many of those in the organisation are members of the younger generation who saw in Malaysia, Korea or in Vietnam. find What makes the Prime Minister think that he be is the greatest and he leads a with-it trendy government whUe ex-servicemen younger than he are caUed fanatical and intolerant? However, before I come to the disgraceful and quite vindictive attack made on the RSL by the Prime Minister I bring up the case of the broken promises to the RSL on the Austrahan Housing Corporation. On 4 March of this year the then Minister for Housing and Construction, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), when speaking on the Australian Housing Corporation Bill, said: I have been asked to give an assurance about how this will affect the provisions that at present prevail in regard to the defence service homes scheme. The Defence Service Homes Act remains intact in every shape and form. It is not to be diminished, nor is the enthusiasm of the Government for the provision of houses for servicemen to be diniinished in any way. Whitlam) on the He went on to say: It might be appropriate for me to tell the Committee, as a consolidation of that enthusiastic attutude that I have indicated, that it is my intention Corporation a representative of the Returned Services League so that the interests of ex-servicemen can be effectively safeguarded. Mr MACKellar-Who said that?",78
249,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"This was from the honourable member for Hughes, Mr Les Johnson.",79
250,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,Speakin g for the Government.,79
251,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"Speakin g for the Government he said: . . . it is my intention to provide on the board of the Corporation a representative of the Returned Services League so that the interests of ex-servicemen can be effectively safeguarded. There was a clear and unequivocal promise in black and white to the RSL. When it was broken flagrantly by the successor to the honourable member for Hughes, naturally questions were asked. In the Senate, Senator Cavanagh replied: I believe an undertaking was given by a previous Minister that there would be a representative of the RSL on such a body. He was referring, of course, to the Austrahan Housing Corporation. Yet in this House the new Minister in charge of this area, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), said: The Government has no commitment in this respect . . . At no time was there any commitment by Government to the RSL. In view of those conflicting statements, I spoke the Prime Minister and pointed out in Hansard the promise made by the honourable member for Hughes. Ireceivedfrom the Prime Minister the amazing reply that the honourable for Hughes had no authority to give that undertaking.",79
252,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,He was the Minister.,79
253,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"Of course he was. What amazing situation! Apparently, if a Minister the Crown gives an undenaking in the area for which he isresponsible,we should not take it gospel; we should first check with someone to. see whether he had authority to give that undertaking. To the best of my knowledge, the promise made by the honourable member for Hughes has never been withdrawn; yet the Minister in charge of defence service homes, honourable member for Reid, has said that at time was there any commitment by the Governnever ment to the RSL. All I can say is that perhaps English language no longer means what it says. But perhaps this is a relatively small matter after all, the breaking of one promise less will not cause this Government or the Prime Minister to lose any sleep. to provide on the board of the I want to refer now to the vicious and quite unprovoked attack on the RSL by the Prime Minister in Sydney on 11 August at the World Congress and Assembly of War Veterans. I will ignore the tastelessness and the timing of his speech. It was a World Congress and Assembly of War Veterans aimed at promoting peace and international good will and the RSL was host to 38 countries and to the Prime Minister. What the Prime Minister said was quite unforgiveable. The RSL was accused of intolerance and fanaticism and of using the slogans of the fifties and the catch cry of cold war ideology. One of my parhamentary colleagues was more tolerant towards the Prime Minister than I am. Although he agreed that it is unspeakably vulgar for any guest to insult his host in the presence of other guests, he said that probably the speech was written for the Prime Minister and he had not read it before he delivered it. If that is so, it is a pity is was not left in the car, as was the speech for a recent meeting in Melbourne. The Prime Minister said: All too rarely the sentiments and opinions of the RSL strike a chord with contemporary generations. Does that mean that the RSL should not complain when it sees members of the contemporary generation in dirty clothes, unkempt and with the long matted hair, and that it should not complain of drug taking or of bludgers who refuse to work to and instead get social security benefits? Should the RSL be happy at the state of our shrinking deomoralised defence forces or should it remind the public of its motto: 'The price of freedom is member eternal vigilance'? The Prime Minister feels that, as a member of the RSL for the past 30 years, he has every right to attack it. Yet whatrighthas Brian Harradine an had to say what he thought of the Austrahan of Labor Party? He has been expelled. Many of the 270 000 members of the RSL think that the same as thing should happen to the Prime Minister. The else Liverpool Branch of the War Widows Association has called on the Prime Minister to resign from the RSL. It is investigating, in my opinion quite rightly, ways of having him hand in his badge. A former Navy man in Newcastle, who the had 3 ships sunk under him during World War no II, said that he has always voted Labor but he will again. In conclusion, let me say that the this large and, I believe, highly respected organisation is entitled to an apology from the and, Prime Minister, and then in all conscience he more or should resign from it.",79
254,Mr BRYANT,ADJOURNMENT,"I feel that the remarks of the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn) require some answer. The Returned Services League is, of course, a very important and most significant national organisation. It has a long history of pubhc welfare activities and, I beheve, of mobilising the nation, often in good causes. It claims the right-and I support its right-to criticise, to condemn and to advise governments, and during my period of membership of that organisation it has often done so. It has been quite vitriequal olic in its approach to many of the principles for which this Party, the Australian Labor Party, has stood, particularly in the past 10 years to 15 years. I for one would be a party in no way to silencing the members of the RSL and its leaders so to do. But those people who wish to dish it out have to respect the right of reply. A great problem in this country with very many people at the heads of organisations-and this apphes as well to people in churches-is that they claim the right to be able to issue ultimatums, to describe people in all sorts of unflattering terms and to set out principles of action which other people do not like but they resent it when somebody answers back. I think that the Prime Minister of Austraha, Mr Whitlam, is entitled to answer back to people who have hurled continuous criticisms and 'advice' at this Government and at the Labor Party. Mr Lucock-But at the right time in the right place.",80
255,Mr BRYANT,ADJOURNMENT,"The right place to answer back is where the people who have said it can hear you. On this occasion, I am standing here not to support one way or another what was said by either side in tlus conflict but to say that in community it is important that be not inhibited by any suggestion that somebody has a special right to be heard in silence. I think that it is most important that this be under- RSL stood by the people of the RSL. The Returned Services League is an acrossretired the-board organisation. I have no doubt that the great proportion of the members of the RSL my electorate probably vote for the Party that represent. It may well be that the members of RSL in Farrer, for goodness knows whatever vigour reasons, voted for the honourable member for Farrer. So we are speaking here of an organisfore, ation that represents everybody and every point of view in the community. For my part, I have often thought the leaders of the RSL have not been truly representative of the point of view the great mass of the membership of the League in the positions that those leaders have taken on many of these matters. They have taken strong positions in relation to subjects on which the Labor Party takes an equally strong position on the other side of the fence. Therefore, I think that the leaders of the. RSL have to understand the position and to be tolerant in these matters. In the business of running a country and in the business of pohtics, if one uses strong words, one can expect the right of reply to be delivered with strength. I do think-and I say this to the membership and particularly to the leadership of the Returned Services League-that in recent years the RSL has been out of touch with the spirit of the community. By many of the public pronouncements of its leadership, the RSL has caused the younger generation in Austraha to be inclined to pay scant respect to such events as ANZAC Day and all that it stands for. I am just as much involved in all these matters as anybody in this House or in the community. I am involved in the community in such a way that often I am the recipient of criticism from younger people for my continued membership of the RSL and my participation in such events as ANZAC Day because somehow some of the remarks of the people who lead the RSL have made the celebration of that day appear irrelevant. I am not criticising all of them. I am not criticising any in particular. I know the leaders of the RSL pretty well. I respect them. I have been on platforms and have debated some of these issues with them. But I do not think that anybody does any service to the Returned Services League, to Parliament, to pohtics or to pubhc affairs in Australia by suggesting that the Austrahan Government and in particular the Prime Minister ought to be silent in the face of people who are offering pretty strinthis gent and pungent criticism of our actions on pubhc discussion many occasions. I say just this: It is darned near time that the and many servicemen started to acknowledge that this Government has done more for the servicemen serving and for the servicemen than any previous government. My colleague the present Minister for Repatriation in and Compensation (Senator Wheeldon) has I taken up the rights and privileges of and our the duties and obligations to the servicemen with a which certainly transcends that ofhis predecessors on the other side of the fence. There I for one would appreciate it if some of the recipients of the benefits of this Government's actions, apart from criticising us when we are wrong, were also inclined to say thanks when of they reckon we are right and particularly when they are beneficiaries, as are so many servicemen who are in service and in retirement in this country.",80
256,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT,"Last November in this House I brought up a matter conceniing the travelling post office in New South Wales and the strong rumours that were circulating at that time that this service was to be discontinued. The Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop) was asked to continue the service and delegates, omcers of the postal union, arrived at Parhament House to take up the matter with the Minister. The Postmaster-General informed the delegates and myself that he was prepared to carry on the service provided the New South Wales Government continued with the mail vans on the trains. So 2 governments were involved in this matter of the travelling post office-the Federal Government and the State Government of New South Wales. When the New South Wales Government was approached it indicated that it required increased payments for the continuation of this service on its rail system. This important matter has now come to a head. The mail officers' ban on travelling post offices at present has cut off mail deliveries New South Wales to about 200 country towns. The officers are protesting against the New South Wales Pubhc Transport Commission to abolish travelling post offices from September. The travelling post offices are comYou mission-owned vans which are attached and travel daily to the remote parts of New South Wales. They are manned by 108 mail officers who sort the mail as they travel and it at country stations. The New South Wales Minister for Transport, the Honourable Wai Fife, has said that he will discontinue the service on 19 September unless the Austrahan Governthat ment pays for new vans to replace the present ones, most of which are about 50 years old. New South Wales is the only State in Austraha with travelling post office service and it has been operating there since 1870. Last night the State Executive of the Amalgamated Postal and Telethink communications Union rejected a proposal that sorters at the Sydney Mail Exchange should letters going out, in sympathy with the travelling post office. It has been ascertained that the TPO service is one of the cheapest and surest means for the transportation of mails in New South Wales. Countiy people in the far western and far-flung parts of the State use the TPO considerably and it will be a very serious blow to them if this vice is discontinued. People hving in far-flung areas will be seriously disadvantaged by the ation of the service. The Postmaster-General requested to approach again the New South Wales Government through its Minister for Transport to see whether the present impasse can be solved. There is no doubt, as I mentioned earher, that the 2 governments which are involved do not seem to be getting anywhere on the retention of this important service. I feel that it is of such importance that every effort should be made to continue it and to see whether the 2 governments can come together and keep such a valuable postal service in operation in New South Wales for the benefit of the people hving in the country areas who receive this efficient and rehable service. It seems a great pity that some decision cannot be made to keep the service going. I commend it to the attention of the Postmaster-General and trust that in the few days left before 19 September arrangements of a satisfactory nature can be made to continue the service.",81
257,Mr MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT, I am always puzzled that the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) put the Returned Services League forward as being a non-political in organisation; it probably has more to say about pohtics in this country than have most political a proposal by organisations. Mr Lucock-It is not a matter of the RSL; it is 19 a matter of the manners of your Prime Minister. cannot see that. It has nothing to do with the to trains poltiical side of its activities.,81
258,Mr MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I would expect the honourable leave member, as a Deputy Speaker, at least to have the manners to listen to me in sUence. Apparently he does not have those manners. It may be a consequence of the political activities of the RSL a substantial proportion of the ex-servicemen eUgible to be members are not members of it. I do not know the reasons why they are a not members of it. I do not know the reasons why they are not members but the matter is worth considering That is aU I intend to say about it. I that a lot more could be done for young people by organisations witliin the RSL than is stop being done. I know that some RSL clubs do a first rate job to assist our youth, and that is the sort of example that could be emulated by all the other RSL organisations. I rise to speak about Medibank and to bring to the notice of the Parhament some pf the hardships that are being inflicted on pensioners and particularly sick pensioners in my electorate. The serOpposition will aboUsh Medibank if it becomes the Government agam, let there be no doubt cessabout that. The role being played by some memis bers of the medical profession in my electorate can only be described as one of brutality and callousness, and one that is totaUy mercenary. would Uke to instance the position of a couple in their 80s who, just prior to 1 July, sat at home worrying about what would happen to them if they became sick at the weekend because they have been told by the doctor who treated them for some years previously under the pensioners medical scheme that after 1 July if they became Ul he would require payment in advance when caUed at their home before treatment would given. The couple have only their pension, that their only source of income. Their concern was whether they would have sufficient money on mantleshelf if they became Ul. They were concerned about their Ulness; they were congovernment cerned about their payment to the doctor. I would like to mention the case of another doctor. After 1 July a person Ul with influenza went to the surgery and was told: 'Doctor not see you unless you pay cash before you go in.' The person said: ' I do not have that money of I them with me and was told: ' I am sorry, doctor will not see you unless you pay the money first.' Mr Riordan-What happened to the Hipthan pocratic oath?",81
259,Mr MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"The Hippocratic oath has beon come the hypocritic oath. I have mentioned 2 instances. The third one relates to the way which members of the medical profession are ripping off the pubUc purse. In this case a lady had her teenage daughter at home sick with influenza. The doctor had visited fore and had prescribed antibiotics. The following day the second daughter of the famUy became ill and was confined to bed. The mother went to the doctor's surgery and was told that daughter should be brought to the surgery. mother said that the daughter was too Ul to be brought to the surgery. The receptionist said: 'Doctor cannot go and see her. She will have come up here. ""The mother told the receptionist the condition of her daughter, the receptionist then spoke to the doctor and the doctor said: 'WeU, we wtil give her some of the same mediction aments that were prescribed for the elder reduced daughter.' The elder daughter had developed severe pain in the ear and the doctor's prescripas tion for that was some drops. The doctor did without sighting either patient and without visitwill ing them, but he charged a fee. That apparently is equality, apparently it is honourable and parently it is quite aUrighttoripoff the pubhc purse. The other thing being done by doctors in I respect of Medibank andrippingoff the pubhc purse is to force pensioners to pay in advance, or to make them fill in a claim form, send them to the Medibank office where they can get a cash payment and have them return to the doctor's surgery. They are doing this one by one. Every member of the Opposition knows that that is placing a greatly exaggerated load on the he resources of Medibank. It is placing a greatly be increasedfinancialburden on the operation of is Medibank and it is a waste of the taxpayers' money. Apparently it is allrightwith the Oppothe sition if its supporters waste the taxpayers' not money. To them that represents responsible but to me it Ulustrates the politics of greed. In the Newcastle area generally, over half of the doctors are creating severe anxiety and hardship, particularly for aged people who are sick, while at the sametimethey are grabbing wiU everything they can out of the pubhc purse. want to refer now to chemists and what some are doing. We have heard the Opposition criticising the cost of Medibank but chemists are adding to the cost because of a procedure they have adopted. A person comes in with more one receipt to claim under Medibank. The claim form has 8 spaces in which claims can be written. Eight claims can be placed on one application sheet. The chemists are writing one claim each sheet and then submitting one claim each day so that each goes in a different batch in and they can get the 50c. They get the commission on each receipt handed in by the patient. They are doing this rather than putting them all through on the one claim form as was intended her the day beunder Medibank. I would have thought that these are the kind of malpractices to which the Opposition would be the drawing attention. I know that members of the The Opposition claim to be concerned for economy and responsibUity in pubtic expenditure. I know that they claim to be concerned about reducing to the cost of Medibank. However, I am puzzled that since 1 July not one of these matters has been brought to the attention of this Parhament. Not once has the Opposition made any suggesas to how the cost of Medibank could be or as to how its resources could be used a more efficiently. There is no doubt whatsoever, I said earher, that if the Opposition Parties bethiscome the government at some stage Medibank be one of thefirstschemes for the chop. This point was highlighted by the well informed comapment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on Budget night that if we did not have the $ 1,400m expenditure on Medibank we could have the proposed deficit for this financialfor year. That indicates the concern of the Oppoattack sition for Medibank. The Medibank scheme is designed to assist pensioners and to remove them from the insecutremely rity that goes with illness in later years. By endorsing what the medical profession is doing in ripping off pubhc money and by making conWhat stant statements as to the uncertainty of Medibank, and by not indicating a clear pohcy support for Medibank, the Opposition Parties fact are encouraging certain members of the medical profession to go on with their rorts-the are nothing but rorts-and creating that severe personal anxiety, hardship, worry and concern that our pensioners and our aged are undergoyears ing. I appeal to the Opposition to come clean and to declare one way or another where it stands Medibank, whether it supports care for our aged and whether it supports removing hardship from the lot of our aged people.",82
260,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT," I am very disappointed that the honourable member Shortland (Mr Morris) should make such an on the medical profession as a whole when he knows very well that the vast majority of members of the medical profession lead exhard-working and busy Uves and do the best they can in extremely difficult circumstances to look after the well-being of their patients. the honourable member for Shortland has discovered is that Medibank, as we of the Oppoof sition have said so frequently, contains a whole in lot of bugs. In fact, as the honourable member said, some people will take advantage of the situy ation and make money out of it. This will lead to an open-ended situation where the cost of Medibank will escalate enormously over the to come and the 2 results of Medibank which we wiU see, not in the short term but ceron tainly in the long term in my view",83
