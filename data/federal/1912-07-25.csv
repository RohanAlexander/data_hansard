1,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"In view of the statement of the Minister of Home Affairs the other day that certain papers on the file relating to the Chinn case are private, I ask which of those papers he regards as private, and what are his reasons for doing so? Will the honourable gentleman ask for a report from the permanent head of the Department in connection with the matter, and lay it on the table ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I think there has been nonsense enough about this business in the House.",14
2,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"In view of that answer,- I ask the Minister if he thinks it fair to make a serious imputation against some officer or officers in his Department, and to refuse to give-them an opportunity to be heard in their defence? Mr KING O'MALLEY - In reply to the question, I should like to ask the honourable member if he can give-me any evidence as to how private and confidential letters got on to a public file? Too much outside interference with public officials vents the carrying, out of business activities on business lines. LIGHTHOUSES.",14
3,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Will the Minister of Trade and Customs kindly say when the lighthouses now under the control of the Hobart Marine Board are likely to be taken over by the Commonwealth?,14
4,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I hope that when Commander Brewis has visited all the lighthouses, and finished his inquiries concerning their condition, the remuneration of the employees there, and the other matters on which he is reporting, all the lighthouses of Australia will be transferred to Commonwealth control. AUTOMATIC TELEPHONES.",14
5,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I wish to know from . the Postmaster-General if his attention has been drawn to the following statement in the monthly share register of Messrs. Joseph.Palmer and Sons: Automatic telephone shares (5s. paid) arc quoted about 9s. The system has'peen installed at Geelong, we believe with success, though little has yet been published; some good parcelsof shares have been bought on Melbourne account. We regard the shares as a good speculation. Is it true that an automatic installation has been made at Geelong; and, if so, has the installation.had the suCcesS'lascribed to it? . Mr Frazer - My attention has not been drawn to the statement. The Geelong exchange is being subjected to tests by ofBcers of the Department, but their report has not yet been presented to me. AUSTRALIAN NOTES.",14
6,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Is it a fact that the Treasurer is bringing from London a gentleman to control the printing of the Commonwealth notes, and that he is also importing lithographers? Will the right honourable gentleman give consideration to the fact that we have men here who: could do the work ?",14
7,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"A gentleman is to be brought here to take charge of our note printing, and to produce, the plates from which the notes will be printed. He is a qualified man, and a statement of his attainments will be laid on the table. I do not pre- think that he is bringing with him more than one or two minor officials. BOARDS OF REFERENCE.",14
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There has been promulgated today a new statutory rule fixing the fees to be paid to the chairmen of boards of reference at jQz 2s. a day, and the travelling expenses at 1.5s. a day, and it is stated that when a public servant of the Commonwealth acts as chairman of a board of reference, he shall be entitled, if his appointment has been approved by the Minister, to receive the samepayments as chairmen who are not public servants. Does this mean that public servants who act as chairmen of boards of reference will be paid fees in addition to their salaries, and two travelling allowances ?",14
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,If the honourable member will give me a copy of the statutory rule I shall reply to his question tomorrow. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. MILITARY STABLE-VICTORI A,15
10,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"According to today's newspaper it is the intention of the Defence Department to build some stables in my electorate, and I desire to know whether it is not possible to have them erected in the Federal territory?",15
11,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,All buildings associated with the Defence Department are placed just in that locality which will best serve the interests of the Commonwealth.,15
12,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yesterday the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, in reply to a question put by me, said that the information as to the availability of a certain property in Sydney for military barracks was obtained by the Minister of Defence personally from private sources when in Sydney. I desire to know whether the Minister went to the owners or the owners' agents, or whether the owners, through .their agents or some politician, approached the Minister?",15
13,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am not acquainted with, the Minister's movements when in Sydney. He, no doubt, will furnish all the details if notice is given of the question. Later:",15
14,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence a question bearing upon an answer which he gave in the House yesterday to the effect that the Minister himself drew up the memoranda, setting forth the alleged advantages of the Double Bay site for a barracks in Sydney, as the result of his own inquiries when in Sydney. to know whether the Minister drew up, in addition to the memoranda, the plan that accompanied them, showing the water to be reclaimed; and, if so, how he can explain the fact that the plan showing the water to be reclaimed gives a much less depth than is shown in the Admiralty chart accompanying the report?",15
15,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The answers given to questions asked in this House yesterday were fairly full , and were in accordance with the questions put - If the honourable member will place his questions on the notice-paper, he will obtain equally full replies. ELECTOR AL ENROLMENT .  attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to a paragraph in today's Age, in which it is stated that prosecutions are likely to BARRACKS, bs instituted where persons have not had SYDNEY. their names placed on the electoral rolls. In view of the fact that the rolls have not yet been published, and it is not possible for persons to know whether their names are or are not on the rolls, would it not be better to defer all prosecutions until after the publication of the rolls ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Unde r the new, up-to-date system of business inaugurated at the Home Affairs Department, every elector gets a notice telling him that his name is or is not on the roll. An elector who receives such a notice will know whether or not he is on the roll. We have endeavoured in every possible way to persuade certain people to sign the cards, but they say that they are not going to be enrolled, and we propose that the law as set forth in the regulations shall be carried out.",15
16,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs if he thinks it possible for every elector in Australia to communicate with his Department in order to ascertain whether he has been enrolled ?,15
17,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"As I informed the honourable member for Grey, we have sent out to the electors notices intimating that they are or are not on the roll. We do not intend to be harsh, but we are going to see that the compulsory enrolment provisions of the Act are carried out to their full extent.",15
18,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Following up the question put by the honourable member for Grey, I wish to ask the Minister of Home I desire Affairs if the fact that a person's name'is on the roll will be taken as evidence that he has complied with the Act? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes . Tbere will be no prosecutions until every opportunity has been given to secure proper enrolment.",15
19,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I do not think the Minister quite understood my question. In Queensland a number of names are transferred from the old to the new rolls, and the point that I wish to ascertain is whether, if an elector's name is on the newroll, although he has not signed an applica-. cation form, he will be liable to prosecurtion. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Unde r the new system, in order to do away with duplication, we require that every person over twenty-one years of age shall sign his or her name to a card. Cards so signed are placed in a cabinet in the office in the capital city in each State so that the signature of any elector claiming new enrolment may be compared and duplication prevented. Unless these cards are signed we shall not be able to identify, when necessary, the signatures of persons who wish to record their votes while away from their own electorates. Our desire is to see that these cards are signed.  of Home Affairs whether it is correct, as I understood him to say, that the Department is going to prosecute people for nonenrolment "" just for the f u n of the thing Does he think it f u n for a working man or working woman to lose a day's work in order to attend a police court to answer a charge of refusing to be enrolled?",15
20,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"My honourable friend is mistaken. In some cases when the police called on certain persons they declined to sign the printed cards that had been left with them, and they laughed at the police. We propose now to see whether or not the law of the Commonwealth is to be observed.",16
21,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Will the Minister of Home Affairs state what steps he has taken to acquaint the people of Australia of their liability in regard to compulsory enrolment ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - We have done all that can possibly be done. We have issued notices, and have also advertised the newspapers. We now propose to proseare cute a few incorrigibles who will not sign the cards.",16
22,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the my own electorate. Minister of Home Affairs whether proof that an elector has not received a notice, and has not been called on by a police, officer, will be regarded as sufficient fication for his non-enrolment..",16
23,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I ask the honourable member to give notice of his question, SQ that I may have time to look into the Act.",16
24,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Before initiating legal proceedings, will the Minister give a final notice to those whom it is proposed to prosecute, so that they may have a last opportunity to comply with the law before a summons is issued ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes , we shall do that as regards any failure by the person concerned in connection with the electoral canvass.",16
25,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,Will the Minister of Home Affairs be good enough to explain how it is that I have not yet received one of the notices to which he has referred ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - We are not going to prosecute the honourable member.,16
26,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Why not?,16
27,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"We shall prosecute only those who refused to sign the cards sent out to them, and who de"" ? clined to be enrolled. I do not think that the honourable member will come within that category.",16
28,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I do not think that the Minister of Home Affairs quite apprehended the question put by the honourable member for Moreton. Is it not a fact that an elector who moves from one district to another must notify his transfer so as to secure enrolment, and is not an elector who fails to do so liable to a penalty ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes . Every elector who changes his place of living from one subdivision to another must send to the registrar a claim for re-enrolment in due course. Temporary absence does not involve re-enrolment.  well be cleared up, although to me it appears plain enough. The honourable member for Moreton has brought under the in notice of the Minister the fact that there many names on the new roll for Queensland which have been taken from the old roll. That state of things obtains in There are no cards for those names; and the honprable member for Moreton desires to know if those persons so transferred will require to have justisigned cards before they are allowed to vote.",16
29,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,I must ask my honourable friend to give notice of the question.,16
30,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If persons are placed on the rolls without signing cards, what check is there under the absent voting provisions of the Act at the time of polling? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The law is such a complex institution that I desire to make sure before giving an answer; and that is why I asked the honourable member for Maranoa, and now ask the honourable member for Wentworth, to give noiice. I shall give honourable members the law on the matter tomorrow..",16
31,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Is the Electoral Department drawing up a handbook for the information of electors and members of Parliament, and, if so, when will it be ready ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - If the Department is not doing so, I shall see that it does. NA RAILWAY. CAMP SANITATION.",17
32,Mr CANN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I wish to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether it is proposed, in accordance with the practice now being followed in New South Wales, to appoint a sanitary inspector to lay out, and inspect the camps along the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway line while the work of construction is being carried out? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes . Such inspection will be carried out under medical supervision. The camps will be conducted like a military camp. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE.",17
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, as head of the Government, a question in reference to a statement in the newspapers this morning, to the effect that there has been a re-allotment of duties in the Defence Department. Parenthetically I may say that it is quite time that there was a re-allotment of duties the owing to the growing importance of the April, igro : Department. It is stated that the Honorary Minister has been given work to do in the Department, although I understood he had been doing work there all along, ancl otherwise helping the Minister in many the police ways. What fresh step has been taken? son4. found",17
34,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I made a request some he dealt with? time ago that questions without notice should be limited. I ask the honourable member for Parramatta to give notice of than his question, and suggest that leagues should also ask for notice of questions. BENDIGO-LAANECOORIE TELEPHONE LINE .",17
35,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On the 19th July the honourable member for Bendigo asked for certain information regarding the telephone line at Laanecoorie. The answer is as follows :The Deputy Postmaster-General, Melbourne, has furnished the following information on the subject :The principal causes of delay have been(t) Failure on the part of the parties concerned to lodge the required deposit until 6 i montlis after they had been notified (on the 21st January, 1910) of the financial conditions. (2) The Department staying action for three months in connection with the preparation of the Bond and Maintenance Agreement. (This delay was occasioned by its having been considered necessary to ascertain whether an application to connect Laanecoorie with Bridgewater would affect the proposed line from Kangaroo Flat.) (3) The persons who were acting for the residents concerned having failed to properly execute the Maintenance Agreement until a period of ten months had elapsed. The above delays cover the period 21st January, 1910, to the r6th September, 1911. Since the latter date the delays are accounted for by(a) The time required to lay out the work, prepare details, and call tenders for the poles required, (i) Failure on the part of the tenderers to submit offers for other than ironbark timber. [c) The necessity of calling fresh tenders for the cheaper classes of timber only, in order lhat the estimated cost for the poles might not be exceeded. ELECTORAL OFFENCES.",17

42,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Only in respect to water supply. 2. Mr Smail is full y aware of the water supfied. ply available at Liverpool-. The water would require to be pumped, and could not, therefore, 1 be considered "" f r e e "" in the same sense as water run direct to mill tanks free. 3.

TROPICAL AUSTRALIA : DEVELOPMENT. Debate resumed from 18th July (vide page 1013) on motion by Mr MCWIL LIAMSThat a Royal Commission, consisting of Members of this House, be appointed to inquire into and report upon the most prompt and effective methods of developing the natural resources of the tropical portions of Australia, and of establishing therein a permanent population.",19
43,Mr FULLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Illawarra) [2.59] - I had almost concluded my remarks when this matter was last before us; and it is not my intention to occupy much time now. I pointed out that I disagree with the motion, believing that, if the highlyinto paid omcers, whom the Government have for sent into the Northern Territory, are not but able to make inquiries and report full y, back their appointment has been to a large exSince the question was last before us, I have noticed, as I dare say in others have noticed, that one of those steps highly-paid gentlemen has made the great reports discovery that there is a large area of good pastoral country near the MCDonnell That is a fact which has been known to every observant citizen of Australia for the last f if t y years; yet it has been put forward as a wonderful discovery Comon the part of the Government official. The Royal Commission appointed by the Queensland Government in 1886 made the fullest possible inquiry into all the circumstances and conditions of the tropical parts that State, the climate of which is presimilar to that of the Northern Territory. That Commission reported on the Liveradvisability of establishing experimental farms, on the prospects of tropical agriculture, and many other matters of interest of and importance. In view of those facts it will be an absolute waste of public money on to appoint a Commission of the character asked for by the honourable member for Franklin.",19
44,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Barrier-Minister of External Affairs) [ 3 . 1 ] - I may say, on behalf of the Government, that we are not prepared to agree to the motion, as we think it is quite unnecessary and not justiQuestion resolved in the negative. DEFENCE FORCES : PENSIONS .",19
45,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Melbourne Ports) [3.2] - I move That, in the opinion of this House, legislation should be introduced to provide a system of pensions to the members of the Defence Forces, and that the resolution be communicated to the Senate, with a request for its concurrence. I have no desire, and it would not be very pleasant for me, to attempt to make this an annual motion, because that sort of persistence does not always reap the reward that it, perhaps, deserves; nor do I wish in any way to harass the Government by persisting in this matter with a view of getting them to do something in this direction, especially when I feel that their opinions on the matter ought to coincide with mine. I am aware that the Government last year-and I have reason to believe that their opinion is still the same-sai d that they did not intend to take any action to provide pensions for the Defence Forces until a general system of pensions for the whole of those employed by the Commonwealth Government had been considered. That is very good as far as it goes. I am quite in accord with the view that the rest of the Public Service deserve pensions after serving for many years, and that when they reach the age at which they have to retire many of them are not in the position to maintain themselves, and are too old to take up any other occupation. But I am also aware that that principle can be extended much further, and that it can be claimed that the whole of the community deserve pensions much larger than we are giving at present under our old-age pensions scheme. If , therefore, any exception is taken to the fact that I have included only the defence forces in the motion, my reply is that we could go further still in the direction I have just mentioned. I do not wish to go again over the ground I covered last year, or enumerate again the many reasons why pensions should be granted to members of the defence forces, because I think those reasons are still fresh in honourable members' minds, ancl it is patent to everybody that they are unanswerable. The defence forces are on a somewhat different plane from the rest of the community, with the exception of the police force. The members of the defence force and the police are men whose very vocations make their lives altogether different from that of the ordinary citizen. They are liable at any time to be called out in the defence of their country.",20
46,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,So is every man.,20
47,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is so, especially in the case of those who have been trained, but I would draw the attention of the honourable member to the fact that my motion is sufficiently wide to embrace the whole of the Defence Forces, permanent or militia, and that is my desire and intention. They are liable to be called out for the defence of their country at any time, and there is no doubt the permanent men will be the first called out, and constitute the first line of defence. I wish to include also in the motion those who are compulsorily enrolled. I endeavoured last year to describe to the House the pitfalls into which other nations had fallen through not being prepared for cases of this character. The most flagrant case was that of the United States of America. By blundering and not being prepared with a pension scheme, the authorities of that country caused the taxpayer to be mulcted in millions and millions of dollars. A faulty system of pensions was brought about, but if the country had been prepared with a proper scheme it would probably not have been necessary to expend one-third of the money that was expended. I am simply asking the present Government to make the necessary preparations. A private member's Bill will not meet the case at all. It is necessary to induce the Government to bring in a Bill , and I am asking the present Government to do so. We are at the initiatory stage of a proper defence system, and it is very evident that the Government, either because of information received from the Imperial authorities, or through their own far-seeingdiscernment, believe there is a possibility of hostilities in the somewhat near future between the British Empire and some other Power. I think that* our extraordinary preparations for defence warrant me incoming to that conclusion. In fairness to that section of the community who are in the Defence Forces, whether regulars or compulsorily enrolled, we ought to be prepared for the contingencies that always occur^ when hostilities begin. It seems peculiar that, while we are making greatpreparations in enrolling men ancl providing munitions of war, clothing, and horseflesh, we are making none whatever for the men to whom death or injuries mav occur during a war, and I think flesh and blood ought to be considered first. This is all the more peculiar in view of the fact that the military calling is not the means of living of the men who are compulsorily enrolled, or who are volunteers. Their work is in the outside world, and can take advantage of the opportunities which occur to improve their position. The members of our regular forces, whether naval or military, have not these advantages for providing for their old age, and, unfortunately, as I showed in detail last year by placing the list of salaries on record, they are paid at lower rates, comparatively, than are persons of the same rank of life outside the service. They are paid less, and have none of the opportunities for improving their position that occur to persons outside the service, and they are retired at an age earlier than that at which ordinary public servants are retired. A soldier is not much good after he has reached the age of fifty or fifty-five, or, at least, a younger man would probably be more useful in war time. We should be foolish, therefore, to keep in the service men who had reached an age at which they were less useful than younger men would be. I admit the need for retiring the men of the Defence Forces at a certain age. But we must not forget that they have to retire early, and that they are taken into the service before they have been able to learn any trade. During their period of service they are paid at low rates, have no opportunities while serving for improving their position, and must retire early, and, to my mind, it is inhuman for us to make no provision for the period when they will be thrown on their own resources. 1 do not take the attitude that it is only those who support the motion who are capable of humane feelings in this .matter.",20
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable memfjer propose to apply his scheme to all the compulsorv trainees?,21
49,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . Last year, the honourable member was of opinion that my motion did not meet the case, and I agreed to alter it. Having since given the matter further consideration, I am now of the opinion that pensions should be provided for all combatants who are wounded during hostilities in such a way as to make them unfit to afterwards follow their usual occupations.",21
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member mean that every compulsory trainee should be entitled to a pension?,21
51,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , if he be so injured in war time as to be incapacitated from any longer following his usual occupation.  needed to pay for that.",21
52,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think the honourable member agrees with me that men who are disabled in fighting for their country should receive pensions. He and I were reared in a position of life in which the need for such pensions was made very apparent. I have made the motion as comprehensive as possible, so that the whole of the Defence Forces may be covered, but, of course, the permanent men will have to be treated differently from the compulsory trainees and the volunteers or the militia. In respect to casualties received in service, however, I think that every man who is disabled permanently should be pensioned. There seems to be an impression abroad that hostilities are not far off, and it is as important to make provision for alleviating the distress war must cause as to make preparations to resist attack. The foolishness of the United States in not providing a pension fund in advance has cost that country an immense amount of money. Excepting those in the ranks, the non-commissioned officers in our service receive less pay than those of similar grades in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States, and everywhere, except in Australia, some provision such as I suggest is made for the members of the Defence Forces. 1 do not believe in thumping my chest, and saying, "" I am an Australian, and Australia leads the world,"" but I am proud of my country none the less, and wish her to be as civilized as the rest of the world. In this matter she is lagging behind. I . feel strongly that something should be done with a Labour Government in power, because the party with which I am associated has always shown a desire to help those least able to help themselves. Let me now point out another difference between the men of our Defence Forces and the ordinary public servants. Parliament has provided that public servants of the Commonwealth may go before the Arbitration Court, and make such representations as they please in regard to rates of wages, conditions, of employment, skill required of them, dangerous character of their occupation, cost of living, and so forth, with a view to getting their remuneration increased, or their conditions improved. But the members of the Defence Forces cannot do this. They are justified, therefore, in coming toParliament for redress.",21
53,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is this a proposal; for a superannuation scheme?,21
54,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,For a pension pay scheme.,22
55,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is, a free scheme ?",22
56,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am not now conraw cerned with details.,22
57,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is it to be a contrifew butory scheme?,22
58,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is irrelevant to my present argument. So long as I remain a member of this House, I shall impress the country? upon the Ministry in power the need for improving the position of the men of Defence Forces, who are at so great advantage compared with ordinary public servants and those outside. I may be told that our defence system is only in its ception, and that it would be proper to wait until it has been further developed, but I would point out that already some provision has been made for the future ot the men of the Naval Forces by the adopment tion of a system of deferred pay. I should be willing to accept that system if I could not get any other, but I do not consider a good one. I understand that many of the men like the system because it gives them an opportunity to retire after a years, but these retirements are not to advantage of the Commonwealth. We are spending an enormous sum of money training instructors at the Military and are told that the training staff is not yet pay. large enough. In view of the enormous methods only, cost of this training, it is bad economy allow men whom we have been training for five years or more to leave just when have become fit to make a return for the expenditure on their training. Our system should be such as will retain those men whom we train so long as they are fitted do good service.  member build up the reserves?",22
59,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We have two sysing tems. We are building up a reserve with those who are compulsorily trained and then retired; but it is not with them am now concerned. I am dealing with the permanent men. In the Navy a man of is twenty-one or twenty-two signs on for five years. The training of a soldier sailor today is not what it used to be. Defence Forces today are trained now to work like a piece of mechanism rather than as human flesh and blood. A man joins our permanent Defence Forces for five or ten years, and, because he has only signed on for that period, he is then allowed to 'He is retired, and receives the deferred that has accumulated during his period of service. The point that I wish to make is that as soon as a man has become properly trained he has to make room for a recruit, and that raw recruit, having been thoroughly trained, in the course of a years has also to give way to another. And so the system goes on.",22
60,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member suggest that the trained man leaves,22
61,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; I say that the the trained man leaves the service. We must a disnot forget in this connection that the methods of fighting are constantly changing, so that a man who had an up-to-date inknowledge of naval or military tactics five or ten years ago might be quite out of date today. Arms and military and naval evolutions change from time to time, and the trained man, if kept in steady employin the service, will assimilate those changes more readily than will the raw recruit. This is a phase of our defence sysit tem that I view with disfavour from the stand-point, not only of the individual himself, but of .industrialism generally. We few take a man eighteen or nineteen years of the age, and appoint him to a position in the permanent naval or military forces, and at in the end of ten years' service we reCollege, tire him and give him his deferred Trained as he is in defence he is cast on the to world to seek a living amongst men who have been trained in various industries. they How can he hope to succeed? His very training unfits him to compete fairly with such men in his effort to obtain a living, ancl his position is a most unfortunate one !o I remember once saying in this House that there were not enough positions as comWe to go round amongst such men. sometimes see ex-military men,' wearing the uniform of a commissionaire, helpladies in and out of carriages at the doors of big establishments, and practically that is the only position that many of these that I men are fit to occupy. A man who has been in the Military Forces for ten years not fit to work as a navvy; at all events, he suffers many a pain and ache before he and a becomes accustomed to such work. Men Our so cast adrift are a danger to others following various trades and callings, because in order to secure a. living they must take work at any price. I hope that we shall have a statement as to the intentions of the Ministry in this regard. I am, perhaps, go. unfortunate in that this motion has come - n for consideration before the delivery of the Budget statement, but I trust that we shall have some information from the Government. I have heard honourable members on both sides of the House express - apposition to this proposal; and I recognise that they are justified in taking up whatever position they please. I do not think, however, that those who are antagonistic to this scheme have considered it from the point of view of the individuals who are in the service, or thought of what must be the effect upon industrialism of throwing into the ranks of the unemployed men who are quite unfitted by their training to follow ordinary avocations. other civilized nation provides for a pension for the members of its Defence Forces, ancl is enlarging the payments to its soldiers and sailors. Even in a country where the people do not move very quickly - in what we sometimes describe as the dear old Mother Land-it is being recognised that better wages than have hitherto prevailed must be paid. Those who have followed the speeches and actions of Mr . Winston Churchill during the last few years must know that he is determined that something shall be done in this direction; and surely we, too, ought to consider this question, so that men who occupy what is really a unique position shall receive better treatment. I ask ' honourable members on my own side of the House, in conclusion, to bear in mind the fact that the members of our permanent Defence Forces cannot resort, as other men can do, to the Courts to secure the redress of their grievances. The National Parliament is the only Court to which fhey can appeal to redress their wrongs, and to place them' in this regard on a footing with, the permanent Defence Forces of other civilized countries.",22
62,Mr RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"North Sydney) [3.33] I give the honourable member, credit for having submitted this motion, but I certainly do not think that finality will be reached by bringing forward such a proposal again and again in the name of a private member. If the Government are sincere in their desire to grant pensions to the permanent forces of Australia they have only to come down with a measure to give effect to such a scheme. In the absence of any such proposal we must assume that they are opposed to a pension system for the Defence Forces. I hope that they will seriously consider this question, and either submit to the Parliament a pension scheme, or endeavour to propose something in the nature of a contributory superannuation fund. I for one would not agree to a contributory scheme being adopted until the present rates of pay in connection with our permanent forces had been increased. The payment of the men is not sufficient to enable them under existing conditions to contribute to a superannuation f u n d ; but if we cannot secure for them a pension scheme, then some arrangement might be made to increase their pay, and at the same time to bring into operation a contributory superannuation fund. It is absolutely essential to the efficiency of our permanent forces that there should be some encouragement Every for long service ancl some inducement for the best material amongst the young men of Australia to join the Army or the Navy. At present there is none. I know many estimable young men who would like to join the military force, but who say that under existing circumstances "" it is not worth the candle ""-that the life of a man in the permanent forces is wasted. That is practically true.",23
63,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It will be a good job for the world when that time has arrived.,23
64,Mr RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If honourable members opposite think that a man's life is practically wasted in the military forces why have they supported the great scheme of compulsory service, for the introduction of which they take credit?",23
65,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I mean that it will be a good job for the world when the defence forces have nothing to do.,23
66,Mr RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,If we could do away with armaments and live in peace it would be well.,23
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We cannot do that amongst ourselves, must less amongst nations.",23
68,Mr RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Quite so. So long as we are compelled to make provision for our own protection, so long must we make theyery best possible provision, and to do that it is essential that we should give every encouragement to our permanent forces. I think that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, in submitting this motion, suffered from a little confusion of mind. At the commencement of his speech, he stated that his motion was intended also to cover the militia and the compulsory trainees.",23
69,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is quite true.,23
70,Mr RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But the honourable memher said later on that it was to apply only to the members of the militia and to compulsory trainees who were incapacitated o r wounded in the service of their country. As a matter of fact, the niotion simply provides for a scheme of pensions to apply to the permanent forces, so that when members of the permanent forces arrive at the age of retirement they may demand a pension as a right.",23
71,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,1 said that I did not want to go into details. I simply wish the House to affirm the general principle.,24
72,Mr RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think it would be well to deal for the present only with our permanent forces, because'it is necessary that we should make those forces as efficient as possible. It is our desire that they shall be an example to the great citizen army that we hope to build up. We wish them to be the nucleus of our great citizen army, ancl to be able to draw from them thoroughly trained instructors. Unless we have the best material and plenty of it in our permanent forces our defence scheme will fail in this respect; and. therefore, it is essential that they should be kept up to their full strength. At the present time, however, great difficulty is experienced in inducing desirable young men to join, because most of them realise that they can do much better for themselves in civil occupations. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports pointed out, more encouragement should be given to our permanent forces, both officers and men. The pay they receive is less than that in any other part of the world. actual amount paid in England may be less, but living there is cheaper, and there are concessions which make the pay here actually lowerthan it is, not only in England, but in any part of the British Empire or the United States. We pride ourselves in Australia on the fact that the wages paid here are as high as or higher than in any other part of the world. as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports says, that men employed in civil vocations in Australia always have the right of appeal to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court for the settlement of wages and conditions; and that is a privilege not enjoyed by the members of our present permanent, forces, whose only tribunal is Parliament. The Government would be well advised if they were to introduce a pension or a superannuation scheme, with provision for increase in the rates of pay; for, unless the two go together, I could not agree to any proposal made. - case of the trainees for the Navy, there is a - deferred pay scheme; and no doubt our naval men are paid better than are the men in the military branch of the. Defence Forces. The pay given to the lads when they first join is such that they can afford to contribute under the deferred pay scheme; and I , for one, cannot see why better conditions should prevail in the Navy than in the Army. We ought to do everything in our power to make compulsory training a success; and, personally, I have, from the platform in many parts of New South Wales, exhorted both lads and parents to cheerfully put up with any little inconvenience that may be caused by the new system. It would be lamentable if the plan for the creation of our great citizen army should turn out to be a failure; but I can see that there is some danger from the fact that we are unable to secure sufficient qualified instructors. Personally, I prefer a straight out pension scheme to any contributory or superannuation scheme. We know that every other nation in the world has a system of defence pensions; and this is mainly because men who spend their lives in the Army are on a different footing from almost every other section of the community. A member 'of the permanent forces has to devote the whole of his time to his duties; and the training and knowledge he receives are of practically no value in civil life - A man, through no fault of his own, may have to leave the Army when he is practically in the prime The of life, and he finds himself utterly at a loss to know what to do for his own support ; he is outstripped in the race of life owing to his ignorance of everything but military matters. It is true that some of the artillerymen or submarine miners might be able to do pick and shovel work, but the bulk of the military men find themselves utterly at a loss. It is true, A master gunner, for instance, has to undergo .a most severe training, and, in order to pass the many stiff examinations, has to devote much more than eight hours a day to study. I undertake to say that there is not an honourable member, including myself, who would be able to answer a single question on some of the examination papers I have seen; indeed, the stiffest examinations in the world are those in the military service, especially those relating to gunnery. Such a man as I have instanced is, however, absolutely unfitted to compete in commercial or industrial life. Of In the course, it may be asked why civilians, who have to leave their situations, should not also be given pensions; but such men are able to find other situations, whereas a military man is fitted for nothing but a military life. If the Government were to come down with a pension scheme, it would doubtless be passed; and I can only take it that if they do not do so, they are unfavorable to such a proposal.",24
73,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not think the honourable member is fair in making such an assertion.,25
74,Mr RYRIE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There can be no doubt that if a pension scheme were made a Government measure, it would be passed. At all events, I hope something will be done, because encouragement of the kind would have a most beneficial effect on the permanent forces. The cost would not be such a great deal, seeing that we have not many permanent men; at any rate, we can well afford to pay pensions to those on whom we may have to depend to defend our hearths and homes from foreign aggression. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [3.53] - This is no new question. Similar proposals were made last session and the session before; and the question has been fairly well debated by various honourable members, including the honourable member for Maranoa. When the matter was under discussion on a previous occasion, a scheme of pensions was suggested as the result of a conference' representing the forces of all the States. That scheme, I understand, was submitted for the consideration of the Minister of Defence; and the honourable member for Maranoa strongly urged the Government to submit proposals on the lines suggested by the Conference. Nothing so far as I can learn has been done in the matter since that time. This, however, is a question which the House is not in a position to determine in the absence of a definite Bill . It is essentially a question for the Government. Action should lie initiated by the Minister of Defence in die form of a direct proposal to bs submitted to the House. It is all very well for us to occupy even private members' time in discussing more or less academic motions which have no binding force when passed upon the Government of the day, but these opportunities for discussion only allow the Government to know what is in the minds of private members who have no administrative power themselves. Such motions can at most be only taken by the Government as a guide - to the opinions of the members of the House. If honourable members on the Ministerial, as well as on the Opposition, side of the House are favourable to a scheme of pen-, sions such as is proposed in the motion, I can see no obstacle to the Government laying a measure definitely before the House, when it could be discussed with some promise of practical results. If this motion is carried, it will amount to no more than an expression of the opinion of the members of the House. It will not carry the House one jot further forward with regard to a pension scheme.",25
75,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the motion is carried, there will be a moral obligation on the Government to give effect to it. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The "" moral obligation "" part of it is a matter of Ministerial opinion. Ministers often take the view that such a motion in no sense commits the Government to the adoption of a policy. We must remember that the Government of the clay are saddled with the responsibility for financing the scheme, and must, therefore, thresh the matter out in a much more thorough manner among themselves, and with their officers, than we, as private members of the House, can hope to do in the time at our disposal.",25
76,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Hav e you considered the financial aspect of it before helping to commit the House to it? Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON - I realise that the financial aspect of it will assume very large dimensions, but I can see other directions in which expenditure is being lightly undertaken with far less justification. However, that is a matter for Ministerial consultation and action. It rests with them to make it part of their policy if they believe in it, and to bring down some practical measure for the consideration of the House. There may, of course, be some practical outcome from this debate, but none of us can say that there will be, because the Government are dumb upon the motion. They preserve the cold silence of the grave. The subject certainly ought to occupy the serious attention of the Government, and some steps should be taken to investigate the scheme which has been put into the hands of many honourable members, although I do not think it has been laid officially before the House. I have a copy of it among my papers, and it seems to me that, with certain emendations, it is worthy of serious consideration. In fact, at the time it was brought forward it was promised serious consideration by one of the Ministers in this House. I think the House might also, with advantage, hear from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence the views of the Government on the motion.",25
77,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wentworth) [ 4 . 0 ] - I wish to give my most cordial support to the motion. Some years ago the honourable member for Parramatta, when Minister of Defence, informed me in the House, in answer to representations on this very question, that the Government of which he was a member proposed to take the whole question of pensions into their immediate consideration. Unfortunately that Government did not secure a continuance of public confidence, and at the subsequent elections were deprived of the opportunity of f u l filling their promise.",26
78,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,D p you remember the date of the promise of the then Minister?,26
79,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think the Honorary Minister will find it in the debates on the Defence Bill , or at the close of them, during the session of .1909- a few months before the present Government came into office. However, this subject of pensions, like defence itself, is above all party considerations, and I am delighted that the privilege of moving the motion has rested with a .member of the party opposite. I cannot help feeling that a member of the Defence Forces, when he passes out of the employment of the State, is not in the same happy position as an ordinary member of the general public with regard to his capacity to earn his own living. The whole secret of the discipline of the Defence Forces is to combine a certain amount- I am afraid, perhaps, too small an amount, although I speak as a layman with great humility-of initiative with a vast amount of subordination of individual will to the general idea, i'n the subordinate ranks this demands an almost absolute and entire suppression of self for the benefit of what I may term "" the show."" That, suppression of self year or two practically unfits a man to earn his living in the. ordinary battle of life, though during ail those years it has been of enormous benefit to the State. There is also the wider question of pensions affecting the families of those in our Defence Forces. We prorough pose to spend enormous sums in makcan ing safe the bases of our tralian Fleet, so that the Fleet can about its business of finding the enemy, world. secure in the knowledge that it leaves behind it its own haven safe. The same principle applies to members of the Defence Forces in time of war. If a man can feel that if he falls those who are near and dear to him will be looked after by the State, he will do this duty, to some extent, more cheerfully and readily than he would if he could not help thinking that they might starve through his self-sacrifice for his country.",26
80,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Surely that would not happen in a British community ?,26
81,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"1 hope not; and that is why I am confident that the House, when it considers the matter, will pass the motion. At the present juncture it might happen. No provision is made against it, and the whole question of pensions ought to be comprehensively gone into.",26
82,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Surely if a man lost his life, or was permanently injured, his relatives would be compensated.",26
83,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is no provision for it, and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is asking that provision in that direction should be made, as well as provision for an ordinary pension for the man who has practically surrendered his capacity to earn his own living by subordinating self to his regiment and regimental idea, when he passes out of his sphere of physical usefulness into the declining period of his days. On both these grounds there are serious reasons why the Australian Defence Forces should immediately be given ordinary pension rights such as obtain in every other country of the world of which I have any cognisance. I should like this question to go to a vote this afternoon. I shall give the Honorary Minister time to look up the quotation; but even if no previous Government in Australia had ever thought of this matter, it would be all the more honour to the existing Government after a that would carry it through. I hope that the Government, urged on by their own al- supporters, and, in fact, by every man in the House who has the interests of the Australian Defence Forces at heart, will proceed, even at this late hour, to deal with this question of pensions, in Order that our Forces may be given a chance of thoefficiency in peace and in war.

85,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is so.

104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Quite so. That, however, is an argument, riot against pensions per se, but against a defective system. It is an argument in favour of a wise and intelligently thought-out scheme. The more I think of this matter, the more it seems to me that an insurance scheme would be better than a free pension scheme.",30
105,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member mean that the members of the forces should pay the insurance?,30
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , and that their pay should be so adjusted as to enable them to do so. I know what is at the back of such a question as that just 'put by the honourable member.",30
107,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Do I understand from the reply that the honourable member suggests an increase in salaries to meet tribution: to a pension fund ?,30
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"My reply is that the Permanent Forces should be paid sufficient to provide for a reasonable wage or salary for the work they do, plus their retiring allowance. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has eloquently pointed out this afternoon, the case of the military or naval officer is not on all-fours with that of the ordinary employ^ outside. He has to devote himself to a particular class of work, and the more he specializes the more he becomes unfitted, in some respects, to betake himself to other duties.",30
109,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member wants to treat him as other men are treated ?,30
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I wish him to be sure that when he has given his best services to the defence of his country he will not be turned out to the cold mercies of a cold world. I want him to have something substantial on leaving the Service. When I put that view of the case to the honourable member another member of his party says "" Why should not every one be treated in the same way? """,30
111,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why not?,30
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And I say "" Why not ? "" I have already stated that I am in favour of every one receiving a reasonable retiring allowance after it has been provided for, and my desire is that a scheme shall be evolved to enable that to be done. But the moment the honourable member for Melbourne began to frame a scheme of that sort he would find the nimble little gentleman beside him denouncing him as being opposed to the present old-age pension scheme.",30
113,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No .,30
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member, perhaps, would not denounce a member of his own party for doing something to which he would take exception if it were done by an honourable member on this side of the House. Honourable members opposite cannot attach much importance to this question, or they would not allow the Government to refrain from saying one word, good, bad, or indifferent, in regard to it . Had I not risen to rpeak. the consideration of this motion would have been adjourned in the usual way; the people would have thrown up their hats for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and there the matter would have ended.",30
115,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And now, according to the honourable member, the people will the conthrow up their hats for him.",30
116,Mr TOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No : I try to do my duty, and if the people choose to throw up their hats for the honourable member they are at liberty to do so. Whenever this proposal has been brought before the House during the last two years I have endeavoured to obtain from the Government a definite statement as to their intention.",30
117,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why did not the honourable member make a definite statement of his intentions regarding this matter when he was in office?,30
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No doubt honourable members opposite have learned their little lesson very well in caucus. Every one of them, as soon as he enters the Chamber, asks, "" What did the honourable member do when he was in office? "" l t is really time that they stopped trifling with the matter in this way. What we did is immaterial to the issue. We did not have an opportunity to carry out the Kitchener scheme. We secured it for this Government, and they are. not carrying it through in this particular , as well as in other particulars, which could be mentioned if they were relevant to the motion before the Chair. The obligation is upon the Government to do something in regard to this proposal, rather than to talk about it, as they have done during the last two years. It is true, as has been stated, that there is a disinclination to turn men out of the Service to beggary. Only last year, specially created billets were found for three retired officers; and, in my opinion, the position is degrading 16 those men. There are other officers, however, of equal status and ability, and longer service, for whom no positions have been f o u n d ; and I should like to know why there should be this discrimination. Of the three officers, one was from ""Victoria, one from South Australia, and one from Queensland ; and the positions they were given enable tliem to earn about ^£300 a year; but, as I say, there are others with equal claims who have not been treated even in this belated way. favouritism ought not to be attributable to a Government who profess to deal out even-handed justice; but they are trying to escape from their obligation to bring down a pensions scheme. I do not blame the Government for looking after the three officers, for such a step was only humane.",30
119,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What were the positions created for them?,31
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not remember the technical designations, but one of them is Inspector of Ordnance.",31
121,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who are the men?,31
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Colone l Stanley, Colonel Lee, and Colonel Lyster. In my opinion, it is not proper that these men, who have been years in command, should be taken from their high positions, and placed in subordinate posts in their own Department. Had I to provide a haven of useful occupation for the declining years of these gentlemen, I should try to secure positions for them in some other Department, and not make them submit to the present rather degrading arrangement. I know that these officers do not like the position in which they are placed; and none of us would.",31
123,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member not think that the Government are to be commended for giving the officers these positions ?,31
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I said it was only humane to find them positions; my complaint is that the same has not been done in other cases. There is an officer in New South Wales who retired about the same time with longer service, and not a farthing, nor a position, has been found for him.",31
125,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the honourable member mention his name?,31
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall tell the honourable member privately; he knows the officer very well. Something must be done to get rid of those anomalies, even as a matter of practical administration. We never can have an efficient force, either military or naval, until a system of retiring allowances is provided; and I think the firmer basis would be that of a superannuation allowance. This was a point on which Lord Kitchener laid special emphasis. I often discussed the matter with him when he was here; and his idea was that there should be a system of compulsory deductions, or, in other words, a system of insurance or superannuation.",31
127,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,On increased rates of Such pay?,31
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should adjust pay in order to enable the men to make this provision, and let the schemework itself out in the future.",31
129,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member means a readjustment of pay in all ranks to meet the extra expenditure?,31
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It all depends. Having no particulars before me, I can only lay down the principle. The pay to officers and men of all ranks should be such as to adequately remunerate them for their services, and give them something to retire on. The details must be left to those who work out the scheme; but the principle is a sound one, and the more it is extended, as a matter of Government policy and administration, the better it will be for all concerned. In a matter which is supreme and vital to the nation's safety, it is above all, necessary that some such scheme as that suggested should be carried out at the earliest possible moment; and the proper time would appear to me to be when the new defence policy, both naval and military, is being put into operation. When I am taunted, as I have been a dozen times by honourable members opposite, about what I did do or did not do as Minister of Defence, I reply that it was my intention, had I been permitted to carry out the scheme, which, with the aid of my Government, I succeeded in getting formulated, to adopt the recommendations of Lord K it chener in their entirety, so far as concerns the allowances to men of all ranks. Even now, the men are not being paid according to Lord Kitchener's recommendations. I believe that the rankers are not being so paid; and there is no more pressing subject of inquiry than the pay of our Army and Navy, as compared with the pay of the forces in other parts of the Empire. I believe that many of the men in the Service are now underpaid; and I may say that, as Minister, I tried to adjust some of the cases which came under my notice. I increased the pay of a number of men, and, in the case of others, I re, arranged the classification, with the result of providing increased pay. That, however, was only desultory or tentative action; something more scientific and thorough is needed, and it should surely have been done at this time of day, after two more years of this so-called up-to-date Administration. As a matter of fact, however, the treatment of this question is becoming more casual in the House. Honourable members opposite now take very little interest in the matter; and this motion would have gone through today without one word from the Minister, had I not risen. I do not know whether the Minister will say anything here, or what he will say in caucus; but the least he can do is to favour honourable members on this side with some statement as to the mind of the Government on this important question.",31
131,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Melbourne) [4.49] - I am absolutely against any system of pensions other than the old-age pension, die invalid pension, and, possibly, a child pension in the future. The State of Victoria affords one of the most infamous pages in the history of pensions that the world can show. Some years ago I had a return prepared, which can now be consulted in the Library, showing that this little State of Victoria paid more in Public Service pensions than all the rest of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. New South Wales, with 300,000 more in population at that time, paid infinitely to its retired public servants. Nothing should be decided as to military and naval pensions until the question has been submitted to the people by way of referendum. I am far from feeling any enmity to the soldier; but if I am asked which troops I most admire, I point to those of the Emperor Hadrian, who not only led the disciplined legions of Rome, but taught them trades, and caused them, in their spare time, to cover the earth with palaces, and with temples to every religion, the remains of some of which are today the admiratiion of the artist. If this motion is persisted in I shall certainly submit an amendment that any scheme of pensions shall not come into force until it has been made the subject of a referendum. In Australia we have the most munificent of all pension systems for the old people, and if it is desired to increase those pensions, by all means let us do so; but our soldiers are paid more per unit than are the soldiers of any nation in the world. Adams, in his book on Switzerland, in dealing with the cost per unit of the European soldiers, shows that England heads the list with £ 6 4 , while in Switzerland the cost is only £7. At the same time, that great authority states that England, with all her vast expenditure, could riot do what the small federated States of Switzerland, with their three different languages, can do-namely , mobilize 250,000 men within seven days. England might be able to effect such a mobilization now, but she could not do so when that statement was made by a man who had been a soldier, and knew what he was writing about. Then, again, our officers are highly paid. The Commanderin-Chief of the Swiss army, in time of actual warfare, when lie commands 250,000 men, receives only £ 2 a day; and yet one officer who was sent from England to command the Forces of Victoria alone, received £ 1 , 5 0 0 per annum.",32
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Our Chief of Staff receives .£1,250 per annum.",32
133,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The great Von Moltke, when in command of over 500,000 German soldiers, received only £ 1 , 5 0 0 per annum, though, of course, we know that attached to the salary there was a. retiring allowance. The honourable member who introduced the motion must have sympathy with the soldier, because, if I am not mistaken, he, in his early years in England, heard the tap of the drum; but we must not forget that such a. scheme will add conless siderably to our defence expenditure. Would any honourable member care to go outside and advocate a pension or a retiring allowance for any special section of the community? It may be said that soldiers follow a very unhealthy and dangerous occupation; but the history of the world shows that the occupations of those in the great army of labour are 50 per cent, more dangerous. For instance, a shunter on the railways follows one of the most dangerous of employments. Let honourable members read Oliver's Diseases of Occupation, and compare the death rates given there with those of a soldier's calling. A soldier's life, after all , is a healthy one, because on his health depends the efficiency of the regiment or the army to do the necessary work. Is it not possible for members of the Permanent Forces, who put in so many hours of training, to learn a trade or calling? It would not take them as many hours as the Emperor Hadrian made his soldiers put in. I shall vote against any pension for a class or a party. I hope that some day we may raise the old-age pensions; but I cherish still more the hope that the childlife which cannot help itself will have a pension. Let honourable members consider the terrible death-rate among children. I one district alone outside of Manchester as of every 1,000 children born, 700 odd greatest died in their first year. What is the county, death-rate of the most deadly battle ever fought compared with that? I will the assist the mover to have this motion put into to the people of Australia, and if the people what is it? say that there shall be a special pension with for the Defence Forces, they have the right to decide, because they have to find the large money; but I shall do my best to persuade never them against it.

Many a man has burst a the blood-vessel in the brain through trying ten little to do work .that he was not lhat is my answer to those who say that war when a soldier is retired from the Forces he is not able to do anything else.

There is only one twopennyniotion, halfpenny httle fountain in Park Lane. So far the soldiers and sailors have had all the honour, but when the victories of England have been forgotten in the abyss of time, the names of other leaders of men will still live. Personally, I should like to see the names of the great inventors [47] 1289 membered. I speak as one who hates war I hate hell, because behind every soldier n I see the woman and the child. I give the honour to those who defend our like the Citizen Forces who defend Swiss Confederation, but soldier goes a the battle with the blare of trumpet and beat of drum; he loses his life, but Is what he does comparable the daily heroism of the mother of a family, who has only a small income, who feeds and clothes her children, and one life that has been born to She has to meet daily the claims of and the tradesmen's bills, and that the little feet are all shod, and limbs warmly clothed, and she is fitted to do. man who riskstimes thousand more a hero than the his life in the glamour of I say, therefore, "" Give pensions to vide beds of large families, who cannot profor each of their children, and to do the give a special to the man who forces to work when he is not fit, who cannot provide sufficient to keep children I tell honourable memare littered today like in our cities.

134,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parkes) [5.4] I have not had the advantage of hearing the discussion that has taken place on the and ami therefore unable to enter into the controversial part of the debate. Perhaps that is an advantage. I did not hear the speech of the mover of the motion, but I commend him for making it purely abstract, leaving the question of the amount and the conditions to be debated in the reHouse. I have always favoured the idea of giving a pension to our soldiers and sailors, not on any grounds of sentiment, but because the soldier and the sailor enter a service which may at any time involve great risks to life, or bodily injury, although that might not occur to them for years, and also because it is a recognised principle that die payment of the soldier and sailor can never be equal to that of an ordinary worker in the usual occupations of life. The strongest fact that can be cited with regard to the motion is the following paragraph in Lord Kitchener's report upon our Military ForcesI f men of the right stamp are to be attracted to the corps, the pay of each rank must be good; and in this connection it must be remembered that the circumstances of an officer's services prevent, and rightly so, his participation in commercial ventures. For the Staff Corps to be successful, its officers, must concentrate energies on their profession, and their pay should, therefore, be sufficient, not only for their keep while serving, but also to insure to them a competence when retired. In view of these conditions, I recommend rates of pay shown in Table IV., with the proviso that in each rank a compulsory deduction should be made sufficient to assure an adequate provision for maintenance on retirement. I know from my experience of the debates in this House, and in the New South Wales Parliament, that there is, and always has been on the part of the Labour party, a strong prejudice .against anything in the .shape of pensions; but I think that if that were analyzed carefully it .would be found that there was a sort of general belief that the pension was something in addition to the pay. Honourable members will notice that Lord Kitchener points out that the soldier, whether an oflicer or a man-and the same thing applies to the sailor-As precluded from taking part in any other occupation. I am referring only to those who give their services to the country for purely military and naval purposes, so that they cannot, as an area officer can sometimes do, proceed' with their ordinary occupations and treat their military service as an addition. I am assuming that the pensions which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports proposes are intended for the regular permanent soldiers and sailors. If , as Lord Kitchener points out, the precaution were taken, after fixing on a reasonable remuneration for their services, of making a compulsory deduction, enabling the Government to invest that money in an insurance fund in order to give the members of the Forces a pension, they would practically be paying the pensions themselves. It would be merely putting into practice that system of compulsory insurance which, I believe, the Labour party Mr Bruce Smith. favour, following the lines of the law which has been placed on the statute-book of the Mother Country by Mr LLOYD - George.",33
135,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is not that grandmotherly legislation ?,34
136,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not think that that which I am advocating is so.,34
137,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I thought you were an individualist.,34
138,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall be happy to discuss other questions with the honourable member in the Library at any time. The members of the Labour party may not like to be reminded of an inconsistency in their policy, but it is fair to state that, whereas they are in favour of an insurance a.11 their system, guaranteeing each man against poverty, want, and various other vicissitudes of life, they are here opposing, and always have opposed, a system of pensions, which is practically identical with a system of insurance, as recommended by the great officer whose advice we are endeavouring to carry out to the letter in other respects. I could quite understand the Labour party laying down the rule that they were against pensions, if the pensions were to be in addition to the pay; but, as proposed by Lord Kitchener, the pay is to be "" good,"" and the pensions are to be the result of a compulsory deduction from that regular ""good"" pay. Surely it is a fair thing that the Government should adopt that advice. Lord Kitchener was invited to make a complete set of proposals for the constitution of an army, and we cannot do better than adopt the scheme he gave us. The honourable member for Melbourne claimed that many other classes of this community are as much entitled to pensions as are soldiers. I agree with him-. Here, as in other countries, there are cases of women, who have brought up their families respectably against the most adverse circumstances - against terrible "" o d d s "" ; no one knows what their sufferings have been. Such women are often morally better entitled to the Victoria Cross than are soldiers who have accidentally fallen into circumstances, as some of them have admitted, in which their human nature drove them to the performance of deeds which were afterwards recognised as "" acts of bravery."" However, we are not now on that subject. The honourable member referred to the Red Sea, to the Emperor Hadrian, and to the payment of soldiers hundreds of years ago.",34
139,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I spoke of the present rates of pay, and quoted Adams' book on Switzerland, which is recent literature. - Mr Bruce SMITH - There is great danger in going away from the circumstances of your own country in regard to a proposal affecting it. The conditions of life, money values, and services of other places may differ so greatly from ours as to have no value by way of comparison. The honourable member was wrong in speaking of soldiers and sailors as well paid, it ing notorious that their pay is considerably less than that of other persons in their walk of life.",35
140,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who said that they were well paid?,35
141,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I understood the honourable member to say so. I am basing my remark on a note which I took when he was speaking.,35
142,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is wrong again.,35
143,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I certainly heard the statement made. I contend, however, that soldiers and sailors are not so well paid as those who follow the trades which they would probably follow were they not in the Defence Forces. It may be objected that they do not work hard, but, on the other hand, it must be remembered that they give the whole of their time to the service of the Government, and engage not to enter upon any other occupation; that is,, of course, the permanent men. I am not dealing with the area officers, who are in the nature of militia men. Lord Kitchener advised us to give "" good "" pay in order to get good men. A few months ago it was very difficult to obtain men for these services, because wages were so much higher outside. How can we get men if we do not make the services attractive ?",35
144,Mr HOWE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Do without them.,35
145,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is a paltry observation. The honourable member may be so philosophical that he would dispense with war, but fortunately the people of the country, who read the signs of the times, recognise that in order to be»safe they must, however peaceably disposed, be prepared for war. I do not think the honourable member would be wise if he tried to put his views into practice, seeing that all the world is of an opposite opinion. The onus is thrown on us, if we ignore Lord Kitchener's sound advice, of giving good reasons for doing so. He counselled the giving of "" good^' pay, and the making of a deduction for a fund to [47]- 2 provide against retirement. I do not see that we can take part of his advice and reject another part. Of course, if the Government are luke-warm, evasion can be understood; but if we intend to seriously provide for the defence of Australia, and of the Empire, we must make these services attractive. At the present time they are not attractive. Most of us recognise that to be healthy and to enjoy long life we must be continually active, mentally be- and bodily. Action, enterprise, and energy are the sources of vitality. An occupation which, in times of peace, at least, is not strenuous, lacks attraction for many men, and we must make it attractive to secure the men we need. The honourable member for Melbourne, with his usual philanthropic feeling, drifted into a discussion of the dangers that beset child-life. I sympathize with many of his views, though I do not regard them as apropos of the subjects to which he applies them. He spoke of the large number of children who die at early ages, but I would remind him that those who die cannot need 'pensions, while the survivors come lo be able to look after themselves. I hope that we shall not blow hot and cold in this matter. To obtain a strong service we should adopt, not only Lord Kitchener's methods of administration and training, but also his advice in regard to pay and pensions, making the pay ""good"" and deducting from it sums which will create a fund to provide for their retirement.",35
146,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"South Sydney) [5.21] While I have the best feeling for those in our defence services, I would point out that no party has a right to pledge the country to a pension system without consulting the people, and this question was not raised at the elections. I shall, therefore, support the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne. Since this Government took office, the pay of the rank and file has been increased by is. a day, namely, from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. These men are fed, clothed, and sheltered, it being estimated that they receive the equivalent of 8s. a day. Outside the service there are many working men who, after paying the expense of maintaining their families, have nothing like 24s. 6d. a week clear, and Parliament must consider them. We have been told that the men of the Defence Forces follow a risky occupation, and there is some risk in handling ammunition j but when the sewerage of Sydney was under construction, strong, able-bodied men died rapidly because of the dangerous nature of the work on which they were employed. They contracted what was known as sewer consumption, and died when quite young. They were really greater heroes than soldiers are, because they were fighting against disease, and engaged on work which has made the city healthier. But - there was no outcry for a pension for them, or for their wives and children, although hundreds of families lost their breadwinners. The coal miners, too, take their lives in their hands every day, to supply the coal which keeps our industrial machinery in operation. Their work is not clean, easy, safe, or regular, but they do not receive pensions. Soldiers have a clean job, are not hard worked, and in some cases lead a gentleman's life. If this pension scheme is to be inaugurated there must be some discrimination. availed myself of an opportunity to look at a return placed upon the table of the House on the motion of the honourable member for North Sydney, and was astounded at the number of large salaries which it showed were being paid to military omcers in this country. At the M i l i tary College at Duntroon, where we have eighty-four cadets, there are no less than twelve men receiving salaries ranging from £ 9 0 0 to £ 3 5 0 per annum. One receives a salary of £ 4 5 0 per annum as a professor of physical culture, and three or four others receive £ 3 5 0 a year for giving instruction in physical culture in different parts of the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, every school teacher in our public schools is compelled to give such instruction in the ordinary course of his every-day work. I am sure that the people will be surprised to learn the great expense which our military system involves, and that they will not tolerate an all-round pensions scheme.",35
147,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Eve n if certain salaries are excessive, that fact has nothing to do with the claim of others for consideration.",36
148,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I recognise that.,36
149,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And the cadets at the Military College are to increase enormously in numbers.,36
150,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We must recollect that the cost of our military system has been enormously increased. At the present time our cost of defence is about 23s. per head of the population. In this respect we are third on the list of the nations the world. Our naval and military expenago, diture per head of the population exceeds that of Germany and England, and it is still growing; so that we have a right to be very careful in dealing with this matter.",36
151,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But not at the expense of men who are already in the service.,36
152,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do.not think that the honourable member was present when I mentioned that since the present Government came into office the rank and file have received an increase of is. per day, so that their pay is now equivalent, having regard to the standard of .living, to about 8s. per day. They receive 24s. 6d. per week, in addition to food, shelter, and clothing. I do not say that that is too high a rate of pay, or that it is enough. My contention is that we should pay the members of our Defence Forces a sufficient salary, and allow them to provide for their own pensions, the same as all other workers have I to do. We have already declared, and properly so, I think, that pensions shall not be payable to our Judges, and we have no system of pensions for the Public Service. It seems to me that the adoption of this proposal would be the thin edge of the wedge to the introduction of a system of Public Service pensions, which, I believe, the people would not tolerate. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne is a democratic one. He says, in effect, "" Let the people decide this matter."" Let us submit the question to a referendum, and let the people determine whether or not there shall be a pensions system in connection with our permanent Defence Forces. The policy of the British Empire today is that of short service, and I believe that that is the best system. Why should a man be called upon to make sacrifices by spending most of his life either on board ship or in barracks, where he can have none of the comforts of domestic or home life ? As a Parliament, we ought not to encourage that sort of life. A man who is compelled to spend years in barracks, or on board ship, is not in a position to perform the proper functions of citizenship. Men should not be required to undergo long periods of service. We should adopt the system of short service, and allow our men, at the expiration of that service, to go out into the world and assist in increasing the industrial wealth of. the country.",36
153,Mr MATHHWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We cannot do that. Mr RILEV"" - We are doing today of many things that we were told, a few years we could not do. I should like to remind the House that we have inaugurated a system of compulsory training, which, if it means anything at all, is going to displace the present system.",36
154,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We shall never be able to displace certain men in the Permanent Forces.,37
155,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know that we shall never be able to displace all the good things, in the way of military matters, in the honourable member's electorate; but the compulsory service system is designed to secure the training of our lads over a certain number of years, and with such a system it ought not to be necessary to have a permanent force and to provide pensions for that force. I hope that every man in the community will be trained and drilled, so that we shall never have a standing army. We ought all to be trained to defend our country, and then we shall never be afraid of any military caste or power controlling us on any particular occasion. I should hesitate to vote to bring about a system of pensions for the Defence Forces, because I believe the people have not been consulted. We shall do right in referring the matter to the people, and if they decide that such a system ought to be inaugurated, then, undoubtedly, we must give effect to their will.",37
156,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Richmond) [5.31] The reasons that have been put forward by - honourable members opposite against the humanitarian scheme which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports desires this House to recognise have occasioned me considerable surprise. We have had the honourable member for Melbourne, in the first place, holding out as a fit example for this country to follow the slave-driving methods of a Roman Emperor, concerning whom history has told us sumcient, I think, to make us desire not to pursue the lines f o l lowed by him in getting his work carried out. The honourable member has also given us the example of certain European countries, which pay their officers a miserable tance, and the rank and file of their defence forces practically nothing whatever. told us that these were the examples which we ought to follow in endeavouring to build up our Permanent Forces, and to secure the fullest measure of efficiency. It is certainly not possible to secure the necessary efficiency in certain branches of the Service by the methods which the honourable member for South Sydney has just suggested. The honourable member has stated that one reason why he is opposed to the payment of pensions to'Ihe members of our permanent Defence Forces is that he believes in a system of short service, and thinks that we should never have a standing army. Surely the honourable member knows that the short service conditions of which he spoke do not apply in the Old Country to the particular branches of the service in which we have permanent men.",37
157,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They are trying to instal it .,37
158,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It cannot be installed in certain branches of the service. It takes many years to train men in certain branches in which only highly-trained men are of any use. This scheme is designed to benefit, not only the rank and file, but officers whom it is absolutely necessary that we should have-highly-traine d men on whose education we are now spending large sums of money in order to give them that grounding in military science which is abso-, Iutely necessary if we are to have any efficiency in our Forces. The honourable member for South Sydney also declared that this question had never been before the country. I submit .that it has been. Honourable members of the Opposition, and also, I believe, honourable members 'opposite, went to the country pledged to carry out Lord Kitchener's scheme AN Honorable MEMBER - No ! Mr MASSYGREENE"" - I think honourable members opposite did. I have Heard it stated a good many times that they were pledged to it, and I maintain that a system of pensions for our Permanent Forces is an integral part of Lord Kitchener's scheme. It is one of the matters on which that great soldier expressed a very decided opinion. He declared that it was absolutely necessary that we should have some definite scheme of retiring allowances for our Permanent Forces if we were to secure the right class of men. Honourable members opposite have sought to draw comparisons between the members of our Permanent Force and people who are working pitoutside; but I hold that no such comparison can. be made. I fully admit that there . He are many walks of life in which men are exposed to great dangers, and that it is possible that greater sacrifices for the country are often made by persons outside than are made by men in the Military Forces. That, liowever, has nothing to do with this case. Each case must be considered on its own peculiar merits. The members of our Permanent Forces, whether they are called upon to do active service or not, are always liable to active service, and to all the risks that it entails. We ask a certain number of men in this country to give up the best years of their life to the service of AusCompany! tralia, and they are deserving of the fullest measure of consideration. We insist that they shall retire from active service they reach a certain age, and when that time comes, Australia should be in a posihard things. tion to say to them, "" You do not leave the service penniless."" The position I take up is that we desire to obtain thoroughly efficient men, and that we must therefore hold out a sufficient attraction. I do believe in a system of pensions in the sense suggested by some honourable members this a single case of the kind. afternoon. I do not believe in the old there style of pensions such as have prevailed in Victoria, but I do believe that it is essenby tial to have in connection with our Peremployes; manent Forces-and I would extend it to every branch of the Public Service-a properly drawn up system of contributory pensions; so that, on retiring from the service, men would have something to fall back upon in their declining years. There are several reasons why this should be done; and, first, I desire to emphasize the position that our soldiers may be placed in at any time, particularly if they are ried men. They may be called on for tive service, and, in consequence of wounds, lose their lives, - and leave their wives children utterly unprovided for. I have in my mind the case of an officer who was left for dead on the field in South Africa, something like eight or nine bullets in him. Although one of these wounds was in the lungs, he recovered sufficiently to return Australia, grow quite strong, and able continue to perform active duties as ber of the Permanent Forces, and marry. When he had been married eight or nine months, a cold which he received through getting wet in camp, settled on his lungs; and, though he is not, perhaps, in a dying condition, it is very doubtful whether will live for any length of time; at any rate, his wife is left without a single so far as he is concerned. This is only one case of which I happen to know. We call on these men for a special kind of vice, which, at times, exposes them special danger; and it is the duty of this Parliament to make special provision them. Whatever we may do should not be in the way of a dole by the State. Parliament has the right and the duty to make provision for its servants in their old age, or, in the case of death through accident, for those, whom they may leave behind. This is what is done in many commercial institutions. Mr Greene.",37
159,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Eve n by the Sugar,38
160,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Eve n by the muckabused Sugar Company, and also by bankwhen ing companies, of whom honourable members opposite can scarcely say sufficiently",38
161,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Thos e institutions terrorize their men in this connection.,38
162,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have had more ex- ' not perience than has the honourable member,, and I have never, in all my time, heard of But even if . were such a case, that does not affect' the fact that provision is made in this way' firms to provide for the old age of their and the Government might wel> have a scheme prepared by the GovernmentStatistician, or any competent actuary, notonly for the Defence Forces, but for themembers of the Civil Branch of the Public Service. As I say, any assistance of thiskind should not be in the form of a dole, but rather something in the nature of a contributory pension, and the salaries paid' - should be sufficient to enable proper contrimarbutions to be made. So far as I can see,,' aconly about 2 per cent, of the salaries ' 1 would be required to enable members of our and Defence Forces, when compulsorily retired^ to live at all events in comfort. There is a great difference between the position of with members of the Defence Forces, and the! position of people outside those Forces. lathe ordinary walks of life, a man may en-> to gage in many occupations, and invest money to in ways from which military men are dea membarred under the regulations. A man at fifty or fifty-five years of age may be hale and hearty, and, indeed, may be in the very prime of life; and yet, as in the case of the three officers referred to by the honourable member for Parramatta, he must retire from, he the service. Two of these officers I know: very well; and I am sure they are strong,cent, and would be well able, in an ordinary vocation, to continue to earn their own living. Instead of creating special billets toserenable them to keep the wolf from the door, to they should have been able to retire and live in comfort for the rest of their daysfor under some contributory pension scheme.  bate, so far as I can gather, discloses a con- ; sensus of opinion, not in favour of a scheme 1 for any particular class of men, but in favour of a scheme to cover all kinds of' risky occupations. That being so, I can put in a strong claim for the miners of Broken Hill, who suffer greatly from the pernicious effects of lead poisoning. Of course, it may be said that these men undertake this work voluntarily - but, at the same time, they are doing an important part of the work of production hi this country. The same may be said of coal miners, who, .on occasion, are exposed to dreadful disaster while doing good service to the community. A vast number of gold miners are incapacitated by miners' complaint; and it is difficult to see why they ought not to be taken into consideration in any pension scheme. In fact, the whole discussion opens up something like a Lloyd-George insurance scheme.",38
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does George's scheme apply to the Military and Navy ? ,39
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It does not.  rated ought not to apply to only one particular class of risky occupations. A walk through the Broken Hill Cemetery would show at what a very early age many miners died some years ago. I admit that greater sanitary precautions are now taken, and that improvements have been made in the working of the mines; but there were per-sonal friends of my own, all fine types of men, who, after a short time in the mines, became physical wrecks. Many of them died, some of them, incapacitated for any exertion, lingering long before their release. Then, again, we have the smelters ..at Port Pirie, as fine a set of men as could be found anywhere; they, in a few years, '-become paralyzed and absolute wrecks as a . Tesult of lead poisoning. My sympathy goes out towards men such as I have mentioned ; and we must remember that a man, in whatever industry he may engage, is doing something for the good of the country. I am not prepared to vote for the motion on the present evidence; but I trust - that the Government will inaugurate some scheme covering all dangerous occupations. ' Mr CARR (Macquarie) [5.52] - The arguments against the motion appear to be entirely of a negative nature. that there are numbers of men who follow dangerous occupations, and to whom no - consideration is given in their later years, and that, therefore, no consideration should the given to the members of our Defence Forces. That argument does not appeal to me. Outside employee's should, of course, receive proper consideration, and that can be obtained by means of some scheme of national insurance to which they could contribute out of wages decreed by the industrial Courts. Members of the Defence Forces, however, are on different ground; they are the Government's own employees, and to pay them a higher wage to enable them to contribute to an annuity appears to me to be a round-about method. They are the particular servants of the Government, and they ought to be paid a wage to enable them to live decently and comfortably, and then given a pension as part of the contract. These men are our first line of defence, and they practically devote their lives to the country; and, under the circumstances, they Lloyd- deserve special consideration, or, at any rate, as much consideration as is claimed for those who follow other dangerous occupations. There is something of the heroic about the members of our Military and Naval Forces, and that fact probably tends to mould public opinion, though I am not particularly affected by that aspect of the question. Regarding the motion as a practical business proposal, I think the Government have an obligation cast upon them to secure a competence in their old age to the men who give the best of their lives to the service and defence of the country. When they are retired they are practically disqualified for other forms of occupation. They know practically nothing of the world, for it has taken almost a lifetime for them to become effective soldiers. These special facts demand special attention, and I intend to vote for the motion.",39
165,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Franklin) [5.56] . - Howeve r much some of us may be inclined to support a national system of insurance, on which our old-age pensions scheme might be engrafted, and which would make the old-age pension a much larger amount than it is now, and to urge that it should be introduced at the earliest possible opportunity, if we attempt now to merge the motion of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports into such a system, it will be tantamount to shelving it altogether. I make that reference without saying a word to interfere with the old-age It is said pension system as it exists now. I know that, whenever one mentions any way of improving the old-age pension system, he always run the risk of being charged with a desire to abolish it. I do not think there is a man in the Federal Parliament who has the slightest idea of interfering - with the old-age pension system as it exists today, or of depriving a single person of the ios. a week which we now give him. T agree with the honourable member for Macquarie that the members of the Defence Forces ought to be, and must be, treated as a special body, apart altogether from the general mass of workers. I hope to see introduced a system of compulsory national insurance, not only for old-age, but for unemployment also, and covering every person in the community, but the proposal ot the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is for something entirely different. It applies to a body of men who are prohibited by their very occupation from taking part in any other work which would give them a sufficient remuneration to make proper provision for their old-age. Tf we are io make our Defence Forces a reality, we can only do it by telling our young men that, if they enter the Army or Navy, and give the best years of their lives to their country's service, hold themselves in readiness to be called out when necessary, and always to form the first line of our defence, the Government and the people of Australia will not allow them to be turned out to starve like worn-out bullocks, or to go to the workhouse, or receive an old-age pension. I have always advocated the establishment of a general system of compulsory national insurance for the whole of the people of Australia, hut it is our duty now to make special provision for our Defence Forces. We ought to have done it when we introduced our first Defence Bill. was one of those who said then that a pension system should be inaugurated with it. I agree with the honourable member for Macquarie that to increase the pay and stop the increase to form a pensions fund is only a round-about way of doing the thing. It is simply hypocrisy to say "" We are not prepared to introduce a system of pensions, but we will grant you a pension by giving you an increased wage, taking the increase from you, and returning it to you afterwards."" This is a matter in which the Government ought to take the lead. It is impossible for any private member to bring in a scheme and carry it into operation. The Government, who are responsible for the finances of the country and for the management of the Defence Forces, have it as their duty, and it should be their privilege, as it certainly is their responsithe debate. bility, to take the lead. I shall vote for the motion, because I believe the Government should take the question into consideration at the earliest opportunity. Those Hr. MCWilliams. who enter our Army and Navy should know that, after giving the best years of their lives to the service, they will not be left to the mercy of a cold world in their old age. With the Navy this is especially necessary, because we note, with regret, a considerable hesitancy on the part of the young men of Australia to enter it. A large proportion of the men on our warships are not Australian born, and there is not a great desire among Australians generally to take to a seafaring life. It will be found that a considerable proportion of those who work around our coasts are British born, and that a large percentage of the remainder are foreigners. We shall never have a real Australian Navy until it is manned by Australians, and if it is to be manned by Australians they must be given some encouragement, such as is proposed in the motion. That there is a difficulty in manning the few ships we now have with our own people is not a very hopeful sign, but when we remember that there is a much easier and more remunerative life ashore, it is scarcely to be wondered at that the young men of Australia do not rush for berths in our Navy. In addition to that, they know that no provision is made for our sailors in their old age, and that the rates of pay are not sufficient to enable them to make proper provision for themselves. I ask those honourable members who favour pensions for the Defence Forces not to cloud I the project with a general system, of national insurance, because, by so doing, they will only be shelving the matter once more. This is a line of life that is totally apart from that of the ordinary worker, and, therefore, should receive special consideration from Parliament. I hope the Government will accept the motion, and at the earliest opportunity submit to the House a proposal on the lines laid down by the mover.

169,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Richmond) [6.14] - I move That a Royal Commission be appointed forthwith to inquire into the operations of the To'bacco Trust in the Commonwealth. I have always understood that it is the desire of honourable members opposite to "" down"" the trusts, and to endeavour in every way to prevent the exploitation of the Australian people by combinations in restraint of trade, and monopolies. . They rprofess to be ready to prosecute with the full rigour of the law all combines; trusts, AYES. and monopolies. There is no combination so well organized as the Tobacco Trusf, and none lays a greater tribute on the community. I propose to put before the House only a few facts to show that no time should be lost in authorizing an investigation of the most searching character into the methods of this Trust, and if honourable members opposite are in earnest, they will support my proposal. If there is any subject in regard to which an investigation should be made by a Commission, armed with the Foster, Frank Watkins, D. powers which the Attorney-General Iast""night asked us to vest in all Royal ComNOES. missions, it is that to which I now call attention. Those who control the operations of the Tobacco Trust in Australia put into the business a few years ago a capital of between £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 ancl £ 4 0 , 0 0 0, and today their profits exceed £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year.

170,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That I propose to show presently. I ask honourable members to agree to a searching inquiry into the methods of the Trust. Is it possible for any corporation which trades on right lines to make a profit of £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year on a capital of between £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 and £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 ? No other trading concern in Australia makes such a profit, and I doubt if in any other part, of the world have such results been obtained. I admit the good business methods of the Trust, but those who control it have used power obtained in other parts of the world to crush all competition. The shares in this concern are almost all held out of Australia, most of them being held in Germany and in London.",41

175,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have already explained it.,41
176,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Trust is a foreign corporation, and its methods have been cunningly hidden.

188,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Angas) [7.46] - This clause raises a fairly important matter concerning which I desire to ascertain the view of the Attorney-General. I take it that this amendment of the principal Act is proposed because, in the case that is now pending, one of the pleas entered is said to be that the matter on which the witness has been summoned is not material to the issue* The question is whether, if we make this amendment, a witness will be able to refuse to attend on a summons on the ground that the evidence he is asked to give is not material to the matter being inquired into. I am convinced that under clause 6 of this Bill a witness arrested could not set up, as a defence, that the matter on which he was summoned had no relation to the subject matter of the inquiry, or was not material to the issue. It seems to me, however, to be an extraordinary proposal that a police magistrate shall have power to issue a war : rant to arrest a man who has not been tendered his expenses, who may be 200 or 300 miles away from the place of inquiry, and may be unable to give any evidence material to the inquiry. Proposed new section 6 (B) provides that if any person served with a summons to attend a Royal Commission fails to attend, the President or Chairman may issue a summons for his apprehension, and he is also' to be liable to the penalties for non-attendance upon the summons. The arrest of the witness is not to purge any offence that he has committed. The .effect of this provision is that such a man may plead, if he is not arrested, and does not attend, that the matter upon which ""Ihe was summoned was not relevant to the inquiry. Section 5 of the principal Act is retained. That section provides - that if any person is served with a - summons to attend before a Commission .and fails, without reasonable excuse to - do so, he shall be subject to a penalty 'which is increased under this Bill to £500. Are we to understand that, although we strike out these words in section 2 of the principal Act "" material to - the subject-matter of the inquiry,"" a witness may plead that he has a reasonable excuse for non-attendance ? I think he would 'be able to do so under section 5, but he -'would not be able to raise the defence that - the matter on which he was asked to give Evidence was not material to the inquiry. . He would simply be able to plead inability to attend, because of want of funds, illness, - or some like cause. If that is so we are - proposing to allow a witness to plead any - of the ordinary excuses for non-attendance ibefore a penalty can be imposed, but not to allow him to plead that the matter on which he is asked to give evidence is not imaterial to the inquiry. A witness, however, may say, uncier section 6 of the Act, when ""'he is called on to give evidence, that the - particular question he is asked to answer - does not touch the subject-matter of the inquiry. The position, I think, will be that he may plead a reasonable excuse if 'he does not attend; that he cannot plead - that he did not attend in obedience to the - summons because the matter did not touch the subject of the inquiry; but that if he - does attend he may say that a question - asked of him does not touch the subject matter of the inquiry. The same witness, however, will not be able to plead any ex'Cuse whatever if a warrant is issued against him, because, under section 6 of the Act, 'together with proposed new section 6 (B ) , if he does not attend on the summons of a Royal Commission he may be arrested and kept in prison at the will of the President - or Chairman of the Commission.",42
189,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [7.52] - Last evening I said that, in my opinion, the only effect of striking out the words "" material to the subject-matter of the inquiry "" was to throw upon a witness the onus of proving that the 'books or documents were not material to the subject-matter of the inquiry. - honourable and learned member for Angas has called attention to the wording of section 6 of the Act, under which it appears that any person who declines to answer a question touching the subject-matter of the inquiry shall be liable upon conviction to the increased penalty of £ 5 0 0 . What I said last night, and what I hold now, is that no Commission is entitled to put a question outside the subject-matter of the inquiry. When we come to clause 4 of the Bil l I shall be prepared to move an amendment which will, I think, meet the honourable member's objection, although I do not think it will make any alteration in the liability of a witness. It will set forth in a kind of declaratory way what the effect of the amendment in the Act will be.",43
190,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Darling Downs) [7 54]. - I ask the Attorney-General to consider the full effect of this clause. The Governor General has power to appoint a Commission and the Chairman of that Commissionhas power, under the present Act, by writing under his hand, to summon any person to produce any books, documents, or writings in his custody or control material to the subject-matter of the inquiry. Under proposed new section 6 (F ) a Royal Commission will have power to inspect any documents, books, or writings produced before it, and may retain them for such reasonable period as it thinks fit. It may also make copies of or take extracts from them. To some extent, under the Act as it stands, a Commission may have that power now by implication. When a summons goes out it will , under the Bill , be in a general form asking the witness to produce any books, documents, and so forth, and these may be inspected and extracts taken. At present, a witness is asked to produce only such documents as are material to the subject-matter of the issue. When the witness produces the books and documents under the general summons, they will be in the custody of the Commission, who will have full power over them; and we must remember that the witness will not be represented by a solicitor or counsel to advise him as to his particular rights and duties. T would remind honourable members opposite that, when we give an extreme power like this, it may some time get into the hands of an enemy, and be used against them. Let us suppose for a moment that a Commission were appointed by a Government or party hostile The to trade unionism, and that a summons was sent out requiring a union to produce all its books and documents, including minutes and accounts.",43
191,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That can be done now.,43
192,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But the documents have to be material. A similar position might arise in regard to the private affairs merchant or trader; and, seeing that the power of the Commission is being widened, the Attorney-General ought to see whether would not be possible to limit the disclosure of private affairs, as in the Conciliation Arbitration Court.",44
193,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The amendment I intend io propose will, I think, meet the honourable - member's objections, excepting that onus will be on the witness.",44
194,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The object, then, is throw the onus on the private individual who declines to let the Commission see tain books and documents, because he does not think that they are material.",44
195,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That point has actually been taken. I think the amendment I have just mentioned will be quite satisfactory,",44
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parramatta) to [8.0] - If the Attorney-General is quite cere when he says that this clause will make no change in the working of mission, what is the object of amending the phraseology ?",44

201,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have said all along that the clause throws on the witness the onus . that is now on the Crown; but only the same kind of questions can be asked, and material only the same kind of documents are askable l S and producible. When we come to the clause I shall explain the matter. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - We are now on the clause which concerns the materiality of the documents to be produced. Attorney-General desires by this clause to considerably enlarge the scope of a Royal Commission; that is to say, he desires to make a man produce books and give information which could not be asked for be-fore. That, surely, is a great difference, For instance, a Royal Commission can, under the clause, ask the witness . . 1 , ,.1 1 .1 any private books, although they may have ; , nothing to do with the question.",44
202,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney-Attorney General) [8.2] - What has been said by honourable members opposite really bears all on the one point-wha t alteration does the striking out of thesewords make? Under the Act, the President, Chairman, or Cornof a missioners are empowered to summon a person to produce books, documents, and other papers, which must be "" material to the subit ject-matter of the inquiry."" The order may be general or specific, and the witness with and twenty or thirty books may say, "" I shall not produce these, because they are not material to the inquiry."" In such a case, under the law as it stands, a Royal Comthe mission has no means of knowing whether such books are or are not material. The to simple statement by the witness that they are not material ends the matter. Surely cerno one will contend for a moment that a Royal Commission ought to be placed in such a position. Again, it may be that two of the. twenty books called for are material, while the others are not, but until the Commission is able to examine them, how is it be ascertained whether they are or are sin- ° t material ? A Royal Commission has n no power to issue a search warrant and take a Royal Comthe books into custody,",44

206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parramatta) [8.9] - The trouble which I see arises from the distinction between a Court of law and a Royal Commission. The Attorney-General desires that the witness shall prove that what he does not produce is not material to the inquiry, and the onus of proof is thrown on the witness. But the proof can only be ascertained by investigation; and by whom? By every member of the Royal Commission.",45

See section 2 of the Act.",45

212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is no discretion left to him here. Every member of the Royal Commission is equal, so far as the right to get information is concerned.",45
213,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He can do it only with the permission of the Chairman under the Act. No witness need produce anything unless the Chairman puts the question or asks for the production of the document.,45
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Otherwis e a man must produce anything that any member of a Royal Commission asks him for?,45
215,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Certainly , but thinks that what the Commission are asking for is not relevant to the inquiry he may decline, and he has a good defence.",45
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It seems to me that the Attorney-General is asking powers for a Royal Commission which are now confined to a Judge, and the Judge always treats them as confidential.",45
217,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This relates to a Commission of inquiry, whose very nature precludes the idea of the information being confidential.",45
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Therefore , it ought to be an inquiry concerning the matter to be inquired into, and not an inquiry into all the details of a man's private business and undertakings. The honourable member is giving these huge inquisitorial powers into the keeping of a member of Parliament who may be full of prejudice and preconceived notions, and who may be trying his best to make a case for a particular policy. Such allegations cannot be made against a Judge, but they can be made concerning a Royal Commissioner without the slightest derogation of him as a man. Is it right to allow six men, who are trying to make a case upon which to found a policy",45

220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am slandering nobody. I will give the honourable member some facts, and he can call them slander if he likes. I heard a Royal Commission at work the other day and any man with eyes to see and ears to hear knew that many of the questions were directed to one particular point of policy alone. That is not slandering the Comniission; it is simply stating a fact.",45

224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am using this as an illustration of the advisableness of safeguarding these powers of inquiry. Here is a Commission already at work. It is intended to investigate the details of a certain business. Certain honourable members have been appointed Chairman of different Commissions, not because they are the ablest members of the House-n o man by any stretch of imagination would think that if he and not because of any special ability, but because they are members of a particular party.",45
225,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is not in order in discussing the personnel of a Commission in that wav.,45
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am trying to show the difference between a Royal Commission such as is frequently appointed, and a Court of law. A man is appointed Chairman by the Government because he happens to belong to a particular party.",46
227,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is not in order in referring to any member of an existing Commission.,46
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The question of Royal Commissions is relevant to the Bill . An authority quoted last night lays it down that they are fair subjects for parliamentary criticism. Here are two Commissions already at work, consisting of members from both sides, but with a majority from one side, and a Chairman in each case from one side.",46
229,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I rise to a point of order as to the line of argument the honourable member is now following. He is referring to Commissions which have been appointed, and his remarks, I submit, are not relevant to the clause under discussion.",46
230,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member f o i East Sydney has not realized that the measure deals with the powers of Royal Commissions, and the honourable member for Parramatta was using, to illustrate his argument, the undoubted fact that inquiries instituted by Parliament in the shape of Commissions are often of a political nature. The honourable member for Parramatta is quite in order in referring to Royal Commissions and their composition on a measure which relates to the powers of Royal Commissions generally.",46
231,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I submit, in support of the point of order raised by the honourable member for East Sydney, that the matter introduced by the honourable member for Parramatta is quite extraneous to the discussion of clause 2. If he were to say that he knew at one time of a Royal Commission which had been appointed, perhaps no exception could be taken; but his references to Royal Commissions now in existence are, to say the least of it, uncalled for. There are occasions when Royal Commissions have a preponderance of members from one side of the House, but that preponderance is from the side which is numerically the strongei. In one particular instance, it is no fault of the Government that the Opposition side of the House is not more strongly represented, because there was a difficulty in finding any member of another place who would accept a seat on the Commission. 1I have my own ideas of the reasons that actuated honourable senators in refusing to act. The honourable member for Parramatta, in casting reflections on the constitution of a Royal Commission",46
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I was casting no reflection on the personnel. I was simply describing the composition of Royal Commissions.,46
233,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I submit that their composition is quite justified by the strength of parties on either side of the House.,46
234,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Todd' s Parliamentary Government in England lays it down that ""The composition of a Royal Commission is a fair subject for parliamentary criticism."" The honourable member for Parramatta was discussing the composition of Royal Commissions. The question raised by this clause is-What power ought to be given to Royal Commissions? and the honourable member for Parramatta submits that the amount of power that we give to a Commission must be considered in connection with the personnel of that Commission. Surely that is relevant to the issue. The honourable member for Herbert may not agree with the criticism of the honourable member for Parramatta, but his right to offer that criticism is clear and undoubted.",46
235,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,At the proper time and place.,46
236,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This is the proper time and place.,46
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I submit that all I am doing is to show the kind of tribunal that we are clothing with these extraordinary powers. I cast no reflection upon any Royal Commission. I believe they are all doing their best according to their lights.,46
238,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,You said they were asking improper questions.,46
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I made no such statement. I said that party considerations entered into their composition, and in proof of it I point to all the Commissions that have been appointed in recent years. Two members of the Government party are at present presiding over two Royal Commissions. A while ago we had the Navigation Commission, presided over by the present Attorney-General. It has been the rule ever since I have been here, and I am not reflecting on it, that whatever Government have been in power have generally appointed the Chai rman of the Commission. I therefore say that party elements enter into the make-up of these bodies. Keith's Responsible Government in tke Dominions has just been put into my hand. It contains this passageThe same question was hotly discussed in 1910 in Western Australia, when the Government, as a result of attacks on the Lands Department, set up a commission of inauiry. It was protested by the Opposition that this was a flagrant violation of the freedom of parliamentary .discussion, and an abrogation of the responsibility of Ministers for parliamentary criticism. It was pointed out that the powers given by the Act of 1902 would enable the Commissioners to call upon the members of the House to give evidence, under penalty, and that such action, logically, was a denial of the privilege of speech. Honourable members are wrong when they accuse me of attacking Royal Commissions. All I have done is to show that party considerations almost invariably enter into the appointment of these bodies.",46
240,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"B y whatever party they are appointed? - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Of course. That is a reason why we should not, without safeguards, entrust inquisitorial powers to their keeping. Powers that it would be proper to give to a Judge possessing a legal training and free from' party bias cannot safely be placed in the hands of Commissions appointed for party reasons.",47
241,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I rule that as this is a Bill to amend the' Royal Commissions Act, a reference for the purpose of illustration without dealing with the personnel of any particular Commission will be in order.",47
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A very satisfactory ruling, and one in accordance with all the authorities.",47
243,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [8.30] - I wish to direct my remarks to one point only. Honourable members urge that these powers should not be given to persons who have no legal training, and who have been appointed for party considerations, because they are likely to be abused. In answer to this, I repeat what I said last night about the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill introduced by the honourable member for Darling Downs in 1:908. That Bill provided that any person who did not answer a question, or did not produce books or documents when called upon to do so by any Select Committee, would be liable to two years' imprisonment. The criticism directed against his Bill was almost identical with that used against the present Bill. The honourable member for Wentworth, speaking upon the Bill, made practically the same objections as he has against this Bill, and repeated what the honourable member for Parramatta has just said I do not know that an unoffending and innocent person who has been dragged before a Parliamentary Committee- "" to the bull-ring,"" the Treasurer would say-woul d regard it as unimportant to be sentenced to two years' imprisonment for refusing to answer a question. The honourable member for Flinders saidIt gives to a Committee responsible only in a political sense to this House, larger powers than are intrusted to the ordinary legal tribunals appointed to try criminals charged with free definite offences against the laws of the country. Those were the criticisms directed against the measure introduced by the honourable member who, to-night, is leading the attack against a provision of an exactly similar character, though the penalties in this case are not half so drastic as those in his Bill. It must be remembered, too, that the drastic penalties of the honourable member's Bill related to proceedings by Select Committees. I ask honourable members, "" Whicli is the more responsible and reliable body, a Select Committee or a Royal Commission ? "" I have had eighteen years' parliamentary experience, and have never known inquiries of first importance intrusted to, and completed by, a Select Committee. However an inquiry may have originated, when it has become important the Committee has been made a Royal Commission. Therefore, the arguments against the proposal to entrust Royal Commissions with these powers apply with ten times as much force to a proposal to entrust them to Select Committees. I cannot understand the present attitude of the honourable member for Darling Downs and the honourable member for Bendigo. On the former occasion the honourable member for Bendigo saidA joint committee of both Houses has reported today that, in conducting inquiries intended to vindicate the honour of Parliament, its action has been absolutely paralyzed by the absence of power to administer oaths and compel witnesses to answer questions.",47
244,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Relevan t to the inquiry.,47
245,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course, questions, must be relevant. Tbis is the definition of relevance given by the honourable member for Darling Downs when in charge of the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill",47
246,Mr IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What is the meaning of "" l a w f u l "" in this connection? Does it mean anything more than ""relevant""?",47
247,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A Select Committee having been appointed to make a certain inquiry, questions within the scope of that inquiry would be lawful.",48
248,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We stated that we were piepared to amend the Bill to limit its provisions to relevant questions.,48
249,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"All Commissions are limited in the scope of their inquiries by the terms of their commissions. A Commission to inquire into a harvester case would be limited to that subject; a Tariff Commission would be similarly limited. And to use the honourable member's own wordsQuestions within the scope of that inquiry would be lawful. Let us apply this to the present case. This is a proposal to compel witnesses before a Royal Commission of inquiry to answer questions that are relevant and lawful . Witnesses need not answer questions that are irrelevant and unlawful. I have offered to move an amendment which makes that clear. When the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill was under discussion, part of the present Opposition was supporting the Government of the day, and that section supported the measure, while the other section denounced it. To-night we have a similar state of affairs-honorabl e members who formerly supported the proposal are now denouncing it , for no better reason than for which the Opposition of that day denounced the Bill of the Deakin Government-that it is brought in by the Government of the dav. Nothing that honourable gentlemen have said touches the point, which is this: that Commissioners are limited by the nature and terms of their commission. They cannot ask unlawful or irrelevant questions. Witnesses are safeguarded by section 6 of the Act. The questions asked must touch the subject-matter of the inquiry, and the same safeguard will be given in regard to demands for the production of books and documents by the amendment which I propose to make. Under these circumstances, opposition becomes factious, and I hope it will cease.",48
250,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wilmot) [8.40] The Attorney-General argues that we should not object to this clause because there was a similar provision in the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill . Apnarently he would have it thought that Parliament has already enacted a provision such as the Government now asks us to consent to. As a matter of fact, the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill never became law, and no proposition such as that of the Attorney-General has ever been affirmed by this House. In my opinion, clause 2 goes altogether too far. The Royal Commissions Act empowers the Chairman of a Commission to summon a person to give evidence, and to produce books which are material to the subject-matter of the inquiry. It is proposed to amend the Act by substituting for this provision the words "" which he is required by the summons to produce."" That means that a Royal Commission may require a witness to produce any books for which it calls. Under a later clause, a Commission will have power to make such extracts as it thinks fit from those books, whether they are material to the inquiry or not. That is an unnecessary power to give to any body of men, especially a scratch lot such as usually constitute a Royal Commission. Commissions are selected in a haphazard fashion, and whilst those acting upon them, may do their best, according to their lights, they may be very fallible. They are interested in the subject of their inquiry, and some of them may be tempted to unduly press a witness so that, instead of confining their questions to matters material to the issue, they may elicit private information that ought never to be disclosed. A witness might be compelled to disclose private matters concernthat ing his business, which ought to remain secret, and such a disclosure might result in his. financial ruin. We have today industries which a few years ago were in a very critical condition, and if those conducting them had been called upon at that time to make public their actual financial position they might not have been able to secure that assistance by means of which they have succeeded in building up what are now substantial enterprises. It is altogether wrong that we should empower men, who may not be capable of judging what they really require as evidence, to draw from a witness all sorts of information merely because they think, perhaps, that he is hedging. Why does not the Attorney-General so amend the clause as to provide that nothing shall be taken from books produced before a Commission that is not material to the issue, and that irrelevant questions shall not be asked.",48
251,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member has not heard the amendment which the Attorney-General proposes to move.,48
252,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He has not read it while I have been in the Chamber; but I am glad to learn that he does propose to ' submit an amendment that will be in accord with my views. If such an amendment is moved, I trust that it will be carried.",48
253,Mr FRANK FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"New England) [8.47] - This clause is vital to the measure, and I hope that it will be agreed to. I am astonished at the attitude taken up by those who oppose it. They seem to think that since the Chairman of a Royal Commission is always appointed by the Government of the day, he will naturally be in sympathy with that Government. Are we to assume that they object to this clause because they see the writing on the wall, and believe that all future Commissions are going to be appointed by their opponents? It seems to me that, in the near future, in order that justice may be done in connection with many of our industries and commercial undertakings, it will be necessary to appoint Royal Commissions to inquire into them, and that, unless some such power as this is given, the object of such Commissions will be frustrated. It is interesting to hear honourable members opposite talk about legal training. If there is one profession more than another in which men are trained with a bias, it is that of the law. Throughout the whole of his professional career, a lawyer or barrister has to take sides. Then, again, it has been urged that Royal Commissions are likely to put irrelevant questions to witnesses. Surely politicians who are required by Mr Speaker, or the Chairman of Committees, to observe relevancy when speaking in this Chamber, ought to be competent, as members of Royal Commissions, to determine what is relevant to their inquiry. I cannot conceive of a Royal Commission prying into matters that are irrelevant to its inquiry. I would ask the Opposition whether it is not a fact that the proceedings of Commissions are usually open to the press. I do not object to the pleasantries in which the honourable member for Parramatta has indulged in regard to his visit to a Commission over which I have the honour to - preside; but if any grossly irrelevant tions had been put to any one, I think that the honourable member would have had the right to castigate us in this House.",49
254,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If a Commission proposed to examine private books, could it not direct that that examination should take place in private?",49
255,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes .,49
256,Mr FRANK FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is nothing to prevent the Chairman of a Royal - Commission from acting as a Judge would do in obtaining evidence in a Court of law. The Chairman of a Commission is supposed to possess a little common sense. The fact that a man is a Judge does not necessarily mean that he has a monopoly of common sense. Surely honourable members, after fighting for years on the floor of this House, or in any other Parliament, ought to have some knowledge of the due fitness of things, especially when they, are making inquiries. Too much stress has been laid on the contention that politicians do not properly appreciate the meaning of relevancy. A member of a Royal Commission would hesitate to do anything that would subject him to hostile criticism either in Parliament or in the press. I repeat that this clause is vital to the measure, but I admit at the same time that the amendment foreshadowed by the Attorney-General is a reasonable one, and I think that it should be regarded as a sufficient safeguard by those - who fear that the clause as it stands is too drastic.",49
257,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parkes) [8.52]. - - I am willing to admit that the amendment which the Attorney-General has intimated his willingness to move cuts away at least half the-ground from the objections that were raised last night. Our complaint last night was that the Attorney General proposed under this clause to omit from section 2 of the principal Act words limiting the President or Chairman of a Royal Commission to questions material to the subject-matter of the inquiry, and to insert in their stead words which provided that if the Chairman or President merely ""required"" a question to be answered, it must be answered. The legal members on this side of the House pointed out that in every Court of law materiality, or, in other words, the fact of a question put to a witness being material to the issue, is a sine qua non. I have never heard of a Court in a British community in which materiality was not inques- dispensable. I am bound to say that half of the fight I put up last night was against the proposal to substitute the requirements of the Commission for the materiality of questions asked. If the Attorney-General is prepared now to require that all questions must be material to the issue laid down in the Commission itself, a large part of my objections is gone. But the proposal of the Attorney-General to insert the words he has indicated seems to me to lead us into greater difficulty. Clause 2 of the Bill provides that the words "" material to the subject-matter of the inquiry"" shall be omitted from section 2 of the Act. These words are the safeguard, the bulwark, by which witnesses could resist a question and take a Commission before the Court, as is being done now; and it is now proposed to provide that all that is necessary is that the Chairman shall "" require"" the question to be answered. It has been pointed out that if all that is necessary is that the Chairman shall require a question to be answered, whether material or not, it will open the door to endless trouble and endless irregularities on the part of a possibly partisan Chairmen. The Attorney-General says he is now willing to impose the condition that questions shall be "" material;"" but, if that be so, why is he not prepared to leave in the principal Act the words ""material to the subject-matter of the inquiry "" ?",49
258,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have already explained that.,50
259,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I quite admit that the principle the Attorney-General placed before the Committee is a perfectly good one; but if he is willing that all questions shall be material, why not leave in the words ? The Attorney-General has told us that in the case of prosecutions he shall do so, but he knows as well as I do that one of the objects of this alteration is to prevent witnesses from raising, as a point before a magistrate or a Judge, the admissibility of a question because it is not material. If he introduces this qualification, and is going to make it general in its application, he will, by-and-by, have the same difficulty that faces him now. Attorney-General propose to make this qualification of materiality a general one, or is he going to limit it to a particular kind of offence under the Act? intend to apply the qualification of materiality to one part of the Act, or to the whole of the Act? If he proposes to apply it to the whole, why cannot he leave in those words? A weak point in the Attorney-General's argument was the analogy he drew between a Select Committee of this House and a Royal Commission. A Royal Commission may be appointed, which is not made up of members of Parliament, to inquire into some trade, calling, or industry, and it may be presided over by a stranger outside who is supposed to be an expert on the subject of inquiry. Chairman would not have the same liability to subsequent criticism as to his conduct in the management of the Commission as would a member of Parliament. A member of. a Select Committee of this House would know very well that if he misconducted himself as Chairman of the Committee, he would have afterwards to face his fellow members, and subject himself to the criticism of this House; and this would be a very considerable check. If , on the other hand, a Royal Commission is made up of people who are interested in a particular industry, the Chairman might very easily abuse his power to ask questions which were not relevant, and thus obtain the information he desired, trusting to the forgetfulness of the public in regard to his misconduct. I do not wish to elaborate' the point; but if the Attorney-General recognises the right of a witness to refuse to answer a question which is not material, why not, I repeat, leave in the words "" material to the subject-matter of the inquiry "" ? It is of no use taking them out of the original Act and putting them into a new Bill .",50
260,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member not think that the Attorney-General's amendment will cover that objection ?,50
261,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I quite admit that the suggested amendment cuts away a great deal of the criticism offered last night; but, so far as I understand, the Attorney General proposes to leave the clause as it stands, while introducing words to provide that questions must be material as a basis for a prosecution. The honourable member for Riverina made some observations which led me to suppose that he thought we could trust to the President of a Royal CommisDoes the sion to limit himself to material questions.",50
262,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is the President not bound by his oath to limit the scope of the inquiry ? Does he Mr Bruce SMITH - Certainl y not; he may, under this clause, ask questions that are not material, seeing that the qualification is being struck out of the Act.",50
263,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The object is to obtain all the things mentioned in the summons.,50
264,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is a very important point. The summons may require a witness to produce books; but, under clause 2, he has to produce everything, whether material or not. Let us suppose that a witness showed on the back page of his ledger that he had a big overdraft at the Such a bank; in such case, the Royal Commission might be entitled to look at the ledger, but not at the page disclosing the overdraft, unless it was material to the issue. If the question was whether the witness was carrying on a business while insolvent, such information would be material; but, if the inquiry were merely into the nature of a particular industry, it would net be material.",50
265,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney-Attorney General) [9.7'J - The honourable member for - Parkes has put forward two points. honourable member appears to be under the impression that, by omitting the words "" material to the subject-matter of the inquiry,"" from section 2, and making the amendment in clause 4 of the Bill, we apply to a part of the Bill a restriction which at present governs the whole Acthe is under the impression that the amendment I propose will qualify only a particular part of the Bill , the qualification applies to the whole of the Act. The honourable member is in error. The amendment proposed will have exactly the same effect, so far as the scope of the inquiry and the position of the - witness are concerned, as have the words proposed to be omitted in the Act at present. A witness now, under section 2 of the Act, if he is called upon"" to produce any books material to the inquiry, may decline to do so; and, under the Bill , he will also be able to decline. The only difference is that, whereas now, under such circumstances, the Crown has to prove that the books are material, the witness under the Bill will have to prove that they are not material. That applies equally through the Act.",51
266,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am quite satisfied.,51
267,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then the honourable member, referring to my analogy between the Parliamentaiy Witnesses Bill and this Bill, drew a distinction to the disadvantage of Royal Commissions by pointing out that members of Parliament are responsible persons, while those outside who might be appointed to Royal Commissions are not responsible. While that is very true, it to me entirely destructive of the line of .argument resorted to this evening, by which it was sought to show that politicians, of all men, are the least reliable or fit lo take - responsible positions. But on the merits - of the objection I submit it is not sound. Nothing can remove a Royal Commission away from the cognisance and power of Parliament. A Royal Commission has to be issued by the Crown, and the Crown has its representatives in this House, who must stand or f all , not - only by the report, but by every act of the Commissions. Ministers have, at any moment, at their command the power to dissolve a Royal Commission, and if they decline to exercise that power in a proper case, they are responsible and can be punished.",51
268,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Angas) [9.10] - When I read the clause first, I thought the difficulty of the Attorney-General was this-and I The believe it was his difficulty, but he is attempting now to cure things which are not difficult-that when a witness is summoned he ought to come. If he has an objection on the ground that his evidence is not material, he ought to put that objection in Court. That is the practice in Courts of justice, and I think it is fair. It is not"" for the witness to pre-judge whether what he has to say is relevant or not. It is whereas right enough for the Attorney-General to cure that difficulty. The amendment which the Attorney-General foreshadows in clause 4 has already been brought in under our criticism, which, therefore, has been perfectly justified. The position now is this : If the person summoned does not attend to give evidence, he can, if sued, plead some reasonable excuse. That reasonable excuse is no longer as to the materiality of the matter upon which he is asked to give evidence, but he may say that the train broke down, or offer some other excuse which would be acceptable to the simple people who sit in Courts of justice. If he does attend, and is asked a question under section 6 of the Act, that question must touch the subject-matter of the inquiry; but if he brings in his books, he can no longer object to allowing them to go in as evidence.",51
269,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , he can.",51
270,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He cannot decline unless the amendment which the Attorney General foreshadows is made. The qualification of "" touching the subject-matter of seems the inquiry "" applies only to questions; but if he is in Court, and the books are there, he can no longer plead that the books are not material, because that qualification is taken out, and there is nothing in section 6 to say that the books themselves must touch the subject-matter of the inquiry. That is the point of our criticism, and the justification for our criticism is that the amendment which the Attorney-General has proposed will remove that imperfection from the Bill . The Attorney-General, who is a very clever debater in addition to his other abilities, tried to turn the tables on members on this side of the House by saying that the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill when before the House was in the hands of the honourable member for Darling Downs. He did not mention that a good many members on this side of the House attacked that Bill. VVe did so, not because we were in opposition, but, in the first place, because it was littered with penalWhat ties ; and, by the way, no Government yet had the pluck to put it through as stood. It has hung fire in this House four or five years. When Attorney-General, I set to work to cut down the penalties seemed to me rather staggering. Under criticism of those days, the Bill was back by the honourable member for Darling Downs for improvement. We also said the Bill was not necessary, because an Act had been passed in England to enable the House of Commons, on the report of a ComAustralia mittee, to call recalcitrant witnesses before the bar of the House. Until then, it was questionable whether the House of Commons could do that, because it like the House of Lords, a judicial tribunal. The trend of our criticism was that, as we had under our Constitution the powers of the House of Commons, it was not cessary to pass the Bill. In any case, it has was too severe in its penalties to put upon to which the statute-book; but how the history of that Bill turns the tables on the honourable member for Darling Downs, I do not know I hope the Attorney-General's amendment of clause 4 will be ample; if it is, it will largely discount the objections to the Bill. Clause agreed to. Clause 3After section i of the Principal Act the f lowing sections are inserted :- "" IA. Without in any way prejudicing, limiting, or derogating from the power of the it.

Mr Glynn.",51
271,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Darling Downs) [9.16] Will the Attorney-General explain the reason for including proposed new section IA? Is it because {here is any doubt as to our powers to appoint a Royal Commission? is the reason for using the phrase "" or have any public purpose or any power of the it first Commonwealth "" ? Is it intended that for "" public purpose "" should mean only a public purpose of the Commonwealth ? If so, it which would be better to make the phrase read the "" or any public purpose or power of the kept Commonwealth."" I should be glad if the Attorney-General would give the Committee a few illustrations of what the "" reasonable excuse "" is that is going to be recognised as an excuse in a Court of law. We have in six different States, with their different Courts sitting. Will the Attorney General explain exactly what he means by "" a Court of law "" in the definition ot was not, "" reasonable excuse "" ?",52
272,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [9.18] - Sectio n IA is inneserted, not because we were in any doubt as to our powers, but because some doubt been expressed lately as to the extent ancient Statutes limit the power of the Crown, or interfere with its exercise. I quoted last night two Statutes that have - been held to refer to this matter-4 3 Edward III . , Ch. 7, and 16 Charles I . , Ch. 6. Both of these start with the recital of some of the provisions of Magna Charta, and both aim at the dissolution or limitation of the power of unlawful CourtsCourts acting under the King's authority o i - to try and punish misdemeanours, instead of allowing the ordinary Courts of law to do It has been held in New Zealand, in or Cock v. The Attorney-General, that the preof the Crown is limited by these To remove any doubt-and no doubt ought to exist, in the face of the very or clear statement of the principles of the law in Clough v. Leahy-w e have put in statutory form the prerogative power of the With regard to the last words of the section, '' or any public purpose or any power of the Commonwealth,"" I take it that a "" public purpose "" may not have direct reference, to a power of the Commonwealth. We are a Government quite apart from the powers enumerated in section 51 of the Constitution. We have the executive powers of all Governments. We are concerned with the interests' of the nation. And, in any case, we are not limited to the enunciated powers of the Commonwealth, because, under the Constitution, we may not only exercise those powers which we now have, but we may, under section 126, take steps to enlarge them. Strictly speaking, therefore, it would not be proper to describe as an inquiry into any power of the Commonwealth what, as a matter of fact, might be an inquiry into some question the solution of which might lead to the enlargement of our powers. So f ar as the meaning of "" reasonable excuse"" is concerned, we know that the only reasonable excuse to which a Court of law listens is physical disability. If a man is prevented by some accident or illness, or physical detention by another person, from attending the Court, he has a reasonable excuse; but it is not a reasonable excuse to say that the tribunal is not to one's liking. If any orable member desires to question my interpretation of the phrase, let him disobey the first summons directed to him, and he will find how f ar those excuses which have served before Royal Commissions will hold good in a Court of law.",52
273,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Angas) [9.25] - It is scarcely of any use to discuss the power of Parliament to create Royal Commissions, because that has been decided by the case of Clough v. Leahy. I simply wish to draw attention to one constitutional matter connected with the clause. There is the express declaration that the Crown may do certain things. There is a sort of implied recognition of a practice that has been objected to at Home, namely, the appointment of Commissions without a resolution of Parliament. Parliament ought to control the appointment of Commissions. In many cases, in the Old Country, a Commission has been appointed by the Executive, and in Western Australia, as recently as 1910, one was appointed by the Executive for its own purposes. Such appointments have been challenged as practically a usurpation of the privilege of Parliament. Keith, in his Responsible Government in the Dominions, draws attention to some of these cases. He mentions that, in a Canadian case, a Commission was objected to on the ground that its issue was an improper interference with the privileges of Parliament. I ask the Attorney-General to think over the question whether we should not insert a provision to the effect that the Executive shall not appoint _ a Commission merely on an Order in Council, but that Commissions shall be appointed as machinery for carrying into effect a resolution of Parliament. It is generally on an Address to the Crown that a Commission should be appointed. The Commission should deal with a matter of public interest, and the expediency of its appointment should be discussed on the floor of the House. I am afraid that the proper etiquette may not be altogether respected, and that the obligation on the Executive, that Commissions should not be appointed except on the suggestion of a House of Parliament, may be ignored by reason of the terms of this provision.",53
274,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member mean that Commissions may be appointed without consulting the Executive?,53
275,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No ; the Governor General takes his powers In this matter from the Constitution. Under i the exerhoncises such powers as the King may choose to give him. I shall be satisfied if the Attorney-General can show that my fears are groundless.,53
276,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No Governor General would attempt to issue a Royal Commission without the advice of his Executive Council.,53
277,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not assert the contrary. Under the Acts Interpretation Act, the Governor General means the Governor General in Council, and one of the questions at issue in the Court case to which reference has been made is whether a Commission was issued by the Governor General in Council.",53
278,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The power to issue Royal Commissions is independent of the Statute.,53
279,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not deny that, neither have I asserted it . The matter is at present sub judice. The powers of the Governor General are exercised under the Constitution, and that being so, it may not be necessary for the appointment to be by Order in Council. It is the English Acts Interpretation Act of 1889 which must be applied to the interpretation of the Constitution. If the Governor General alone can make an appointment under the terms of the Constitution, it would not be necessary for the appointment to be by Order in Council. The point to which I am directing attention is that we may be giving sanction to an objectionable practice which is growing up in the Old Country, and in Canada, and has been resorted to in Western Australia, and, perhaps, in some of the other States, namely, that of issuing Commissions without a resolution of a House of Parliament. I ask the Attorney-General to consider whether we should not pass some such provision as thisI t is hereby enacted and declared - Governor General may on a resolution of House of the Parliament and so forth. The resolution would deterthe mine the matter of the inquiry. mission might be appointed by a Governexcuse,"" ment to inquire into the doings of the - opposed to it ; there might be an inquisiattend torial investigation, under the stress tical passions, into the workings of political - societies, and so on. My contention is the appointment of a Commission should be for the investigation of a matter of public interest, and should follow on a resolution of either House of the Parliament. would also direct attention fo the fact - under the definition clause, the word ""Comguards mission "" includes the members of the Commission. Therefore, for the purposes of the measure, any one member of the - Commission would be equal to the whole Gommission. For example, there might ten members forming a Commission, and ""reasonable excuse."" - whatever penalty was attached to contempt - or criticism of the Commission would attach to contempt or criticism of one member it, unless the wording of the clause the contrary. I do not say that the wordhad ing of each clause may not show some trary intention. There are other matters to which attention might be drawn, such the need for appointing Commissions only for some public purpose. I suppose that - no Commission will be appointed to inquire into some matter altogether outside our - powers. In this matter, it is hard to where a line could be drawn, so many - things being relevant to our executive legislative powers, and to powers that be asked for under an amendment of the Constitution. I would suggest that the language of section 51 of the Constitution should be followed, and line 5 should made to read-and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to any public purpose or any power of the Commonwealth. That would confine the appointment to legislative powers, or things ancillary to them, or to our executive powers. As they stand, the words are disjunctive, and not mean what the Attorney-General desires. from - Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [9.36] -- I was interested to hear the Attorney-General define the meaning of the second"" part of definition clause. He said that the only "" reasonable excuse"" for not attending fore a Commission would be physical in a firmity making attendance impossible. But 'there may be other reasonable excuses. Owing to some sudden bereavement, a man might be mentally unfit to afford the Commission the assistance it desired from him. that the This provision, however, would drag a either witness from the death-bed of his wife or his child. The Attorney-General said that fact that a witness did not like a ComA Commission would not be a "" reasonable but who has ever suggested such party a reason for disobeying a summons to ? On the other hand, it would be a of polireasonable excusej from the point of view of a witness, that he believed that he would, that not get a fair trial from the Commission.",53
280,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is what they say.,54
281,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It has. been said only once is the history of Commonwealth Royal I Commissions, and it is greatly to be rethat, gretted that it can be said. Unless safeare inserted in the Bill guaranteeing that in future the Commissions that are appointed will be such that the public generally will have as much faith in them as in Courts of law, we should be very carebe ful not to abolish this safeguard of Suppose a Commission were appointed to inquire into the business of the honourable member for East of Sydney, and he knew that it was intended shows to attack him. Suppose he knew that it been furnishing to his opponents copies conof its secret records, to enable them to bring their charges against him, and that as it had contradicted itself in public upon an absolute matter of fact on that very point. In other words, suppose that he knew, as any sane man would know, that he would not get a fair trial from the Commission, see might he not reasonably say to himself, "" If I go before the Commission, I shall and not be given a chance to put my views and might position fairly; the Commission may refuse to hear anything more from me when it has got replies to one or two catch questions "" ? That would be a reasonable ground, be from his point of view, for the honourable memher absenting himself. The fact that he disliked the appearance of the Commissioners, or distrusted them, would not be a reasonable excuse. But it is because he our has a profound conviction that that Commission, inquiring into his affairs, has been appointed for the special purpose of "" getmay ting to windward of him,"" and because, his knowledge of what it has done, that he believes that it will not give his the case a fair trial or himself a fair opportunity, that he absents himself. That is be the position with regard to the question of reasonable excuse. T have paralleled the position of one of our great industries with that of the honourable member for East Sydney. That is the argument upon which that particular interest has based its claim for absenting itself on the ground of reasonable excuse. I do not canvass its claims. I do not know how far its claims are accurate, but I do know that that was the reason it urged. I have learned that from the public press, and the Attorney General was also aware of it from the public press when he tried to pass over this matter with an idle joke. Indeed, this Bill, with this particular clause in it, has been introduced in order that the verdict that he anticipates from a Court of justice shall be made valueless for the protection of people who may have to appear in the future before a Royal Commission.",54
282,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is not this Bill to be retrospective?,55
283,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I thought at the outset that clause 8 would make it retrospective, but the Attorney-General says that it will not, and on some matters I am prepared to believe him.",55
284,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But it applies the present Commission.,55
285,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It seems to be intended to nullify the verdict of a Court which Attorney-General obviously anticipatesthat the unfairness of a Commission appointed by this House has justified the attendance of an Australian citizen before lished. that Commission.,55
286,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is not in order in reflecting on doings of that Commission.,55
287,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not reflecting on any Commission, and should be the last wish to do so. I am simply pointing to this Committee what is happening at present. In considering a measure of this kind we ought to make it practically impossible for any person to refuse evidence before a Royal Commission appointed for purposes for which this House sees fit to ask that it be appointed. in order to enable us reasonably and rationcised ally to do that we ought, in other parts of the Bill, so to regulate the matter of the appointment of Commissions, and the conduct of their business, that it would be possible for any person to say that would not get a fair deal before a monwealth Royal Commission. I should have no objection to this clause in itself, provided that we laid down rules of court for the governance of Royal Commissions, and provided the Government showed a little greater sense of its responsibility in concerned. the matter of the appointment of these bodies-than it has done. A good deal been said about the difference between a Royal Commission and the Judges in a Court.",55
288,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And a Court of justice.,55
289,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I will not say "" a Court of justice,"" because a Court of law, with the best intentions in the world, is occasionally not that. The danger, to my mind, of these provisions placed in the hands of a Royal Commissioner is that the moment his Commission lapses this Parliament ceases to have any control over the actions of that erstwhile Royal Commissioner. A man is appointed on a Commission-and we have known of instances where this is suspected to have occurred-and deliberately tries to find out information that will be valuable to some interest with which he is connected after the inquiry has terminated. If we are going to pass this clause this Bill ought to contain provisions making to it penal for a Royal Commissioner to use for any purpose other than that for which he took his Commission, any information the he had obtained, under all the penalties that may be imposed in this measure.",55
290,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The information obnontained by a Royal Commission is pub,55
291,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Some of it is published. A member of a Royal Commission, howthe ever, has a right of search. He finds out what documents'he requires to see, but he does not necessarily enclose them all in his to report. Books are produced from time to out time before a Commission on the understanding that their contents are not to be made public, and that they are purely for the information of the Commissioners.",55
292,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not know of any to give where that is done.,55
293,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,If the honourable member reads the records of the Sugar Commission But he will find that the Chairman has exerthat discretion in a number of cases.,55
294,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Ver y improper.,55
295,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And that from an honourable member who criticised me just now for not traversing the actions of the Commission 1 he I do not think it is improper that such a Comdiscretion should be exercised. A Royal Commission should have power to refrain from divulging information which it may require in order that it may arrive at a reasonable conclusion, but the publication of which would not be just to the parties",55
296,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What I wished to conhas vey was that whatever information a 1312 Royal Commissions [REPRESENTATIVES.] Commission obtains belongs to the public, and that a Commission has no more right to it than the public has.",55
297,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A Royal Commissioner, when all is said and done, is a servant the High Court of Parliament appointed to inquire. He has every right to do everywitnesses thing which this Parliament gives to do.",56
298,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,All the documents cepted by a Commission are recorded.,56
299,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They are recorded for example, "" Ledger A , "" "" Ledger B or "" Ledger C,"" and so forth, but the conmerely tents are not. My point is that since is no excuse short of absolute physical firmity to enable a man to decline to pear before a Royal Commission and to produce all his secret information-information which may bankrupt him if improhonest per use is made of it- a be empowered to exercise a discretion and to refuse to divulge information so obtained. I heard only today from a gentleman known to honourable members, of a case in Australia where information obconviction, tained with regard to an industry, been published at the time, would have bankrupted that industry. The mere fact that it was not in a financially solvent state, if published to the world, would have led to its bankruptcy. The main creditor, realizing the dangerous footing upon which that industry was, forewent interest on his mortgage in order to tide foreshadowed it over its difficulties. It was tided over its difficulties and is now one of the most flourishing industries in Australia. In case an industry was labouring under a porary difficulty and the publication of that clause. difficulty would have led to its bankruptcy. Appointing Royal Commissioners as criminally carelessly or, as, in one instance, criminally carefully, as some recent Commissions have been appointed, we might have a Commissioner who"" might find it very read. much to his advantage to be possessed of trade secrets after his Commission had lapsed. This is not a slight matter; it afthis fects every one, whether a man be big or cuse whether he be small.

300,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Darling Downs) [9.52] There is one matter which I wish to bring under the notice of the Attorney-General which arises in connection with this penal provision. Taking into consideration the the amendment to this clause which he has .,56
301,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , a new clause",56
302,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I thought that the honthat orable and learned member intended to temmove his amendment as a proviso to this,56
303,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It will follow clause 4.,56
304,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It ought to be moved as as a proviso to this clause.,56
305,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Her e is the proposed new clause, which the honourable member can",56
306,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It reads as followsIt shall be a defence to a prosecution under section for failing without reasonable exto produce any documents, books, or writings if the defendant proves that the documents, books, or writings were not relevant to the inSuppose that, in response to a summons, a man produces his books before a Commisbesion, and then, when the Chairman asks that he may be permitted to look at the the witness raises the objection that are not relevant to the inquiry, and the conChairman says that they are. There we have a conflict at once, and if the witness persists inraising what he believes to be an honest objection, the only way in which he can test its legality is by allowing himself to be prosecuted, and if he is found wrong he will be convicted, and there will be a record against him. There ought to be a method by which an honest objection of a legal nature could be tested without having a conviction recorded against a witness. I would call the attention of the Attorney-General to the procedure which is laid down in section 10 of the New Zealand Act of 1908(1.) The Commission may refer any disputed point of law arising in the course of an inquiry to the Supreme Court for decision, and for this purpose may either conclude the inquiry subject to such decision, or may at any stage of the inquiry adjourn it until after such decision has been given. (2.) The question shall be in the form of a special case to be drawn up by the parties (if any) to the inquiry, and, if the parties do not agree, or if there are no parties, to be settled not. by the Commission. (3.) The decision of the Supreme Court shall be final and binding upon all parties to the inquiry and upon the Commission. If we had some procedure by which any disputed point of law which the Chairman of a Commission felt was honestly raised could be referred for summary decision by a Supreme Court or High Court Judge who happened to be near at hand, the whole difficulty would be settled.* At the same time, I recognise that ultimately there must be power to deal with a witness who, after a decision has been given by a Court, persists in refusing to produce his books to the Commission. I believe that the Attorney General desires these Commissions to be simply Commissions for the investigation of truth, and generally for the investigation of public matters. As a rule, most persons are willing and eager to go before a Commission and give all the evidence they can on a matter of public interest. Cases of resistance are not very frequent. If there is a persistent refusal without a question of law being raised, there must be some procedure laid down, and some penalty fixed; but I ask the Attorney-General to seriously consider the advisability of having an intermediate method of getting a summary decision on a bond fide dispute. I also ask him to consider whether £500 is not an excessive penalty. It will apply to the rich and - the poor alike. In Queensland and New South Wales the fine is £ 2 0 , while in New Zealand the penalty is a fine not exceeding £ 2 0 . I ask the Attorney General to consider whether, in making this heavy penalty to apply to every case, he is not really altering the scope and purpose of the executive acts of a Commission. The Government are, by this Bill, practically establishing new tribunals, and safeguarding them by all sorts of exceptionally heavy penalties. The tendency in barbaric times was towards the infliction of extreme penalty; but the whole tendency of modern legislation is towards the imposition of moderate penalties, for the purpose of deterring persons from the commission of crime, rather than with the object of inflicting vindictive punishment. I think the Attorney-General would enable justice to be done under this clause if he adopted an amendment on the lines of the New Zealand precedent to which I have referred.",56
307,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10.1] - Firs t of all, the honourable gentleman complains that the penalty is too high. I say that it is A magistrate or Judge may make the penalty just what he pleases. It is a reflection upon our Courts to say that, because a maximum penalty of £500 is provided, that penalty will, in every case, be imposed. I take the case of the innocent struggling farmer referred to, and suppose that he has committed, quite inadvertently, a very mild and venial offence. He is taken before a magistrate, and, if he shows clearly that his offence was inadvertent, no one will suggest that any magistrate would impose the maximum penalty. Honourable members may tell me of the many powers the Commission has, and how these may be abused. Judges have great power, too; but we all know very well that Judges do not do unreasonable things. I submit that Judges will not do anything but justice, even under this Bill, and so will not impose heavy penalties for trivial or inadvertent offences. The honourable member for Darling Downs has suggested that a point of law might arise, but I do not know how that could be. A witness, for instance, raises a perfectly bond fide objection to produce certain evidence. He says to the Chairman of the Commission, "" I do not agree with you that the evidence is relevant."" The Chairman says that it ris, and there is an honest difference of opinion. But it is not a difference of opinion on a point of law. Surely a question of relevancy is a question of fact ? What else is it ? If a question of law could arise, I should be quite willing that the Chairman should state a case, if he is capable of doing so, or that the matter should be referred to the Attorney-General for him to state a case; but the question of the relevance of evidence is merely a question of fact, and, so, I think the clause should be allowed to pass. Clause agreed to. Clause 5 agreed to. Clause 66. After section 6 of the Principal Act the in advance. following sections are inserted :"" 6A. Every witness who has been summoned to attend a Royal Commission shall continue attendance from day to day until he is released from further attendance by the President Chairman of the Commission.

308,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Angas) [10.4] - I shall only suggest amendments to these proposed new sections included in clause 6, but shall not move an amendment. Provision made that a witness must attend, and be arrested if he does not do so; but there is no provision for the payment of his reaalties sonable expenses in advance. ' In one Act which I have seen, provision is made that if a person asks for a witness to be moned, he must deposit sufficient to cover his reasonable travelling expenses; whilst if the Chairman asks a witness to Licensing attend, provision is made for his expenses penalty from Government funds. A witness need ment to magistrates not attend unless reasonable travelling penses are tendered to him. That is the practice followed in all Courts of Justice, and it would be a reasonable excuse for the non-attendance of a witness in a Court Justice if he could show that he was tendered the prescribed expenses. I think that travelling expenses, at least, ought be provided for witnesses who may asked to attend the Commission from a disthat being tance of 200 or 300 miles.",58
309,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has the honourable gen-, tleman looked at the proposed new section 6G?",58
310,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; but that does not make provision for a tender of expenses Under the Act to which I have referred, a witness must be tendered in travelling expenses in advance, or he may not be arrested. I am not going to move or any amendment, but I hope the Attorney General will consider the suggestion.",58
311,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall look into the,58
312,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does not the honourable gentleman think that the proposed new seccontion 6G means a payment of expenses in,58
313,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It does not say so.,58
314,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is the usual practice, a penalty of not less is it not?",58
315,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is the usual practice for in ordinary Courts of Justice. But there is no power, for instance, to compel the any payment of witnesses' expenses in the ArIn ordinary Courts of Justice it is ii sufficient answer to an inforof mation for non-attendance that a witness In arbitration proceedings a witness may be ^accalled upon to attend a conference, though he may have to travel 300 or 400 miles the to do so. I find that in the Queensland Act there is a provision preventing the arrest of a person summoned as a witness, except in the case of an indictable offence, it a reasonable sum has not been tendered for his attendance. I am sorry that, in regard to the penalties, the Attoris ney-General did not see his way to reduce may some of them. Lawyers are aware of the discrepancy that often appears in the penmeted out in different Courts. Where a maximum line of £ 5 0 0 is provided for, some Courts will impose a line of £ 2 0 , and sumothers a fine as high as £250. In a recent case I was almost shocked to learn that an extremely severe penalty was imposed for a trifling offence under the Act. If we fix the maximum at £500, there will be some induceto impose a penalty exof nearly that amount.",58
316,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parkes) [10.9] - I should like to ask the Attorney-General of to consider whether the words "" continue not in attendance "" in the proposed new section 6A should not be altered, because they to seem to suggest that a witness should rebe main the whole day about the Court. I was going to propose the substitution of the words "" appear and report himself from day to day."" The words "" continue in attendance "" in the case of a very busy man might mean that he would have to wait for days and days until he was required as a witness. It seems to me to be sufficient if the person summoned reports himself to the Chairman.",58
317,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ver y well, I have no objection. Where does the honourable member want the amendment to come in?",59
318,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I move That the words "" continue in attendance,"" lines 4 and 5, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof, the words "" appear and report himself."" Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr HUGHES) posedThat after proposed new section 6 D the following new section be inserted :(DD) A statement or disclosure made by any witness in answer lo any question put to him by a Royal Commission, or any of the Commissioners, shall not (except in proceedings for an offence against this Act), be admissible in evidence against him in any civil or criminal proceedings in any Commonwealth or State Court, or any Court of any Territory of the Commonwealth.",59
319,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Darling Downs) [10.15]. - Has the Attorney-General considered the advisableness of inserting another clause to enable confidential information to be protected ?,59
320,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The proposed new section that I have just moved does that. I inserted the word "" disclosure "" for the purpose of making it cover extracts from books or documents.",59
321,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; that would only mean that if a witness gave an answer to a question that answer could not be used against him subsequently in any criminal or civil proceedings. But a witness might say to a Commission, "" I am bound to give you this evidence, but it is of a peculiarly confidential nature, and I ask you not to make it public. You may use it in coming to your findings on matters of fact, but as it is confidential, I ask you to protect me, and not allow it to go out to the public."" think there ought to be some procedure to protect confidential information wherever necessary. That is done in connection with the Arbitration Court, and the Attorney General himself said last night that he had no objection to its being clone.",59
322,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has it been done any where else? Is there such a provision in any other Royal Commissions Act? - Mr GROOM - No ; because in other Royal Commissions Acts, the clauses axe different from these. But, irrespective of that consideration, I am asking the Attorney-General to deal with this suggestion on its merits. Not long ago, the Attorney General told us that we were to lead the world in our legislation.",59
323,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Quite so; but I am getting tired !,59
324,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The most confidential matters may be inquired into, and under this Bill there will be no protection for witnesses. I again remind honourable members that this provision, when once placed on the statute-book, may be used against those to whom they might not desire to see it applied.",59
325,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Chairman of a pro- Royal Commission can now decline to allow evidence to be published.,59
326,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What I am seeking now is protection for the witness.,59
327,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,In what way would the honourable member suggest further protection ?,59
328,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I suggest such a provision as there is in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.,59
329,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney-Attorney General) [10.21] - Is it suggested that on the request of a witness, the Chairman or President of a Royal Commission shall at once direct that the evidence must be private? Such a suggestion is, in my opinion, absurd. If it is not proposed that we should go to that length, then the Act as it stands is amply sufficient, because, as I have already said, the President or Chairman may now, if he chooses, prevent the publication of any evidence. I have said over and over again that this Bill does not increase the scope of inquiry, but merely enables Royal Commissions to be made effective, so that when there is anything to inquire into, a Commission may be able to make the inquiry, and not sit down and look at it. We are all reasonable men here; and we are not to suppose that the Chairman of a Royal Commission will be other than prepared to I listen to any suggestions put forward.",59
330,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Gippsland) [10.23] - I suggest that in proposed section 6 there should be inserted after the word ""summons"" the words "" after having been paid, or tendered, a reasonable sum for expenses."" No witness can be compelled to attend a Court of law unless he is paid or tendered reasonable expenses; ancl the suggestion I have made would meet objections that have been raised by honourable members on both sides.",59
331,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney-Attorney General) [10.25] - B y section 8 of the Act the Governor General is empowered to make regulations prescribing a scale of payments to witnesses as travelling expenses and maintenance while absent from their usual place of abode. The suggestion is that the payment shall be made in advance; and, while there are circumstances in which that might properly be done, it would, in my opinion, be fatal to the usefulness and effectiveness of the measure if it were compulsory in every case. If a man lives in Carlton, and is summoned to appear at the Court in Lonsdale-street, is it suggested that, before we can expect him to attend, he must be given a 3d. tram ticket? That, of course, is carrying the argument to an absurdity ; but nevertheless a witness would be legally entitled to the tram ticket or to refuse to attend, and there are many persons who would take all sorts of points of this kind. I assure the honourable member that section 8 of the Act will. be given effect to j and that is as far as we ought to be asked to go.",60
332,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Gippsland) [10.27] - The provisions in the Act and in the Bill are all right, so far as they go, but we may have the case of a witness who is not possessed of means to reach the place where a Royal Commission is sitting. The Attorney-General has referred to the fact that a witness may require to be handed a tram fare; but I may tell him, as a matter of practice, that I never heard of a subpoena being served unaccompanied by the payment of at least is., and no one connected with a Court would think of handing a subpoena without tendering sufficient to bring the witness to the hearing. I do not press the matter, but I think the suggestion a reasonable one. If a witness is entitled to be paid the money afterwards, he might as well be paid or tendered it before he starts.",60
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parramatta) [10.28] - I hope the honourable member for Gippsland will press his very reasonable amendment. The Attorney-General is going, to extremes when he cites the case of a man who lives up the street and requires a tram fare. Why does the honourable gentleman not take a reasonable view, and have tegard to the man without means who has to travel a considerable distance? In any case there is nothing derogatory in the Department offering a tram fare, which would safeguard a man who is bond fide in want of money.",60
334,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Sectio n 8 of the Act and the proposed section 6G are sufficient.,60

337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not see how the honourable member can guarantee it unless it is put in the Bill.,60
338,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney-Attorney General) [10.31] - Unde r section 8 of the Act the Governor General may make regulations "" prescribing the scale of allowances to be paid to any witness summoned under this Act for his travelling expenses and maintenance while absent from his usual place of abode."" I say that in cases where witnesses at a distance are called to appear before a Royal Commission, when they so desire they shall have their travelling expenses tendered to them before they come.",60
339,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And maintenance.,60
340,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Witnesse s in such cases will not be punished because they do not attend on subpoena if their travelling expenses are not tendered. We have power to provide for that, and I make that statement publicly; but I am not going to make a general rule with regard to all witnesses. As a general rule witnesses do not come from great distances to the Commission. The Commission goes to them. A Commission travels from place to place. The Navigation Commission went to the witnesses all round Australia; the witnesses did not come to us. If we summoned a man from Perth to Melbourne, it would be most unfair not to give him his fare before he started; but when I go to Perth to examine him, it would be absurd to tender him his expenses just because he lived at the other end of the city, and had to travel a few hundred yards.",60
341,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Batman) [10.33] - As the honourable member for Gippsland says, the universal practice in regard to the service of subpoenas of all kinds is to tender the conduct-money with the subpoena. It is immaterial whether it is a very large or very small sum. I cannot agree with the Attorney-General that in cases where the witness is close at hand he ought not to have his conduct-money in the usual way. We generally give a witness a shilling with his subpoena. Honourable members opposite seem to think that sub-clause 1 of clause 6G is not sufficient to insure the tendering of conduct-money, but I should have thought it was ample to insure it. I cannot imagine any penalty being imposed on a man who can say, "" I was not tendered my expenses, and therefore I could not attend.""",60
342,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He may be arrested under clause 6A, and you cannot cancel an arrest.",61
343,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He may possibly be arrested. The Attorney-General, apparently, has no objection to giving the witnesses this protection, but he thinks they are already sufficiently protected.",61
344,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They are not.,61
345,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should have thought they were; but if they are not, there ought to be no objection on the part of the Attorney-General to making that slight variation of the Bill, because in spirit it is the same as he is offering. He has told us that he wishes witnesses to be paid their expenses of attendance, and 1 think he expects those expenses to be tendered when the summons is served. If there is a danger of any one being penalized for not attending before a Royal Commission when his expenses have not been paid in advance to enable him to attend, I hope the risk will be removed.",61
346,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parkes) [10.36]. --The honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Batman have said that there is an implied undertaking that a witness shall have his expenses given to him as a matter of course; but if the amendment is a desirable one it ought to go in, because, otherwise, the Chairman can issue his warrant and have the witness arrested, and break into his house for the purpose. It is all very well to tell a man, after a warrant has been issued, and he has sustained the ignominy of practically being taken prisoner by the Chairman, that he is entitled to his expenses when he gives his evidence. I understand that the honourable member for Gippsland wants to imppse upon the Commission the obligation to tender the witness his expenses when he is subpoenaed to attend, and that otherwise he shall not be bound to give his evidence. Amendment agreed to.",61
347,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney-Attorney General) [10.38] - I move That after the word "" convicted,"" in proposed new section 6E, the words "" on information by the Attorney-General"" be inserted. That will have the effect of making the penalties between £500 and £1,000 payable only in proceedings instituted by the Attorney-General, who, we have to assume, will not institute proceedings unnecessarily or without sufficient thought. Amendment agreed to.",61
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parramatta) [10.41] - I move That the words "" Five hundred pounds and not more than One thousand pounds"" be left out of the proposed new section 6E. Apparently, not only may a person, convicted of an offence, be fined in this manner, but he may also be imprisoned for a period not exceeding three months.",61
349,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A fine and imprisonment may be imposed, or merely a fine.",61
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It seems to me that a man who has been already punished for an offence should, on committing a second offence, be sent to gaol. The Attorney-General has his eye on the big corporations ; I am thinking of the small man who may be recalcitrant, and for whom these penalties are altogether too severe. It would not injure a big corporation to fine it a sum exceeding £500 and not more than £1,000, though its members would not like to go to gaol, but to a small man such a fine would mean the taking away of all his worldly possessions, although the offence might be due to a sheer fit of wrong-headedness in an otherwise worthy citizen. The penalties should be fixed to meet the ordinary normal case. It is the small men, traders, and others, who, because of the want of legal training, are most likely to offend.",61
351,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [10.45] - The introduction of the small, struggling man, overwhelmed with difficulties, who will get into trouble under the Bill, is becoming monotonous, and I protest against it. The honourable member has been on Select Committees and on Royal Commissions, and knows that it is only rarely that persons treat these bodies contumaciously. But occasionally, persons do so act, and this ought not to be allowed. If they offend against sections 5 or 6 of the Act, they may be fined is., or any amount up to £500, at the discretion of the Court. A second offence would be a deliberate flouting of the law, and the community's efforts - to obtain information cannot thus be made impotent. I do not think that these offences will be committed a second time. No Court is likely to impose a heavy penalty for the first offence. We know that there are rich men in this country who would sooner pay £ 5 0 a day than attend before a Royal Commission, but a fine ranging up to £1,000 is calculated to give the boldest pause. For the first offence there is a maximum penalty, but no minimum, and for the second and subsequent offences the penalty is properly much more severe.",61
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parramatta) of [10.48] - The Attorney-General knows that it is the small men, often men working for wages, who have time and again set the law at defiance in vindication of what they believe to be a principle. „ It is not a inaginary case that I have put. It is the men living out back on the land, or who work for their living, and not those who are familiar with the procedure law Courts, who, .in vindication they believe to be their rights, are most likely to prove contumacious, and thus to offend ",62
353,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A man who commits a second offence must know what he is doing.,62
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In the honourable member's experience, men have offended, not once or twice, but even sider oftener, and he has pleaded for mercy for them. I shall not press my amendment if the Attorney-General is determined that these penalties shall remain, because it cases of hardship. would be useless, in view of the support behind him. I must be content to enter my protest against this proposal.",62
355,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Batman) [10.50] Throughout this Bill a very wide discretion lieu is given, and given very properly, I think, to Commissions; but, in regard to this penalty, the powers of the Court are limited in a very strict and arbitrary manner. minimum penalty is fixed at £500 and the maximum at £1,000. A Commission, being familiar with all the circumstances, and anxious, as an honourable body of to preserve its dignity, might be of opinion that the offence committed was not so seriinto ous as to warrant a penalty of £ 5 0 0 ; the discretionary power given under this clause is limited in the most arbitrary ner.",62
356,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is the Couit, and not a Commission, that is given the discretion in this case.",62
357,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Quite so; but my what, point that the discretionary power given limited in the most arbitrary way remains good. I do not put this matter before the Attorney-General from the point of view of the poor man or the rich man, but I of this law in the. simplest way. think it is a pity to limit the discretion the Court in this arbitrary manner.",62
358,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Darling Downs) [10.53]. - I think that the point made by the honto orable member for Parramatta is exactly that which has been put before the Committee by the honourable member for Batfoi. man. The honourable member for Parramatta says that a heavy penalty might be imposed in a serious case, but that the is so arbitrary 111 its limitations that a fine amendment. not less than £500 could be imposed for a second offence, even if the Commis-sion in question thought that the offence' was a comparatively trivial one, and de-_ sired that the offender should be let down mere lightly. Assuming the penalties are disjunctive, the only alternative is imprisonmen ment. The honourable member for Parramatta has pointed Out that - a rich man of could pay such a fine, but a poor man of what would be unable to do so. ",62
359,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have always done that,' even if honourable members opposite have not done so. Surely the case of the poor man is entitled to some consideration. The Attorney-General has been trying to conit, and I ask him,' if not now, at all events, before the Bill is sent on to the Senate, to endeavour to provide for some elasticity in this provision, so as to meet Amendment negatived.",62
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Pairamatta) t -55]-IO I move That the word "" three,"" is proposed new section 6E, be left out, with a view to insert in thereof the word "" two."" 1I have heard jeering references to -' the pooi man,"" and I wish to say that I am The not here advocating the interests of the poor man as such. I am only pointing out that the man who is likely to get into trouble under a provision of this kind is men, one who has not much of this world's goods. Such a man is more likely to get trouble than is a man who has plenty but of money. The fact lhat a Court is to impose these penalties makes the position manworse than it would be if Royal Commissions were to be empowered to exercise a discretion in regard to them. The Court will not be aware of all the circumstances. It will not know what has given rise to in many cases, may be a mere fit of is wrong-headedness. A man appearing before a Commission may feel that some principle for which he contends is being assailed, and he may come under the lash The of Attorney-General laughs, but he knows that my statement is correct. He knows that there are men who would sooner go gaol than compromise on what they believe to be a matter of high principle.",62
361,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That has been provided!,62
362,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It has not; but, as the fates are against me, I shall have Bill to submit, and ask leave to withdraw my, Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",62
363,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Moreton) [10.57] Proposed new section (F), which is embodied in. this clause, empowers a Royal Commission to inspect documents, books, or writings produced before it, and to take extracts from them. Whilst we should empower Royal Commissions to obtain all necessary information, we should also endeavour to give those who may be summoned before them an assurance that they will be protected, as far as possible, so that they will have confidence in the conduct of inquiries. I move That after the words "" copies of "" in posed new section 6F the words "" such matter is relevant to the inquiry"" be inserted.",63
364,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,- I have no objection to that amendment. Amendment agreed to.,63
365,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parramatta) [10.58] - I move That the word "" appearing,"" in proposed new section 60, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" summoned to appear."" If this amendment be agreed to, a man who has been summoned to appear before a Royal Commission will be paid a reasonable sum for the expenses of his attendance; whereas, under the clause as it stands, a man might not receive his expenses for some time.",63
366,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"- I have already explained what I am prepared to do, and I think my proposal is perfectly fair.",63
367,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable gentleman is prepared to do what he says he is, why should he not agree to this amendment ?",63
368,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Because I wish it to apply to those cases which I have mentioned, and not to all others.",63
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There can be no case that is not genuine.,63
370,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This limits the number of persons who may appear.,63
371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No .,63
372,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Practicall y it would reduce the proceedings to a farce.,63
373,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The money ought to be tendered if it is only 5d.,63
374,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member say that a man who travels on a penny section should have a penny sent to him ?,63
375,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The summons has to be' sent to the man. We are told by practising attorneys, that it is the rule to send a' shilling to a person when he is served with a subpoena.",63
376,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have been very unlucky then. I have been served with many subpoenas, but not once have I received anything with them.",63
377,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parkes) [ n . 2 ] . - I think that there is a middle course which can be followed. I understand that the Attorney-General wants, when a summons is issued, to compel the witness to come, and that the honourable member for Parramatta wants to justify the witness in not coming until he gets his expenses paid. When I heard the honourable member for Gippsland put his contention beprofore the Committee some time ago I framed as an amendment which reads as followsAny witness appearing before a Royal Commission shall be entitled to be paid a reasonable sum for the expenses of his attendance before giving evidence, in accordance with the prescribed scale.",63
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Suppos e that he has to come a distance; he wants his conduct money.,63
379,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am quite ready to meet that case. If this amendment were adopted a man could go to the Commission with the most perfect confidence that he would not be called upon to give evidence until his expenses had been tendered to him. It is a middle course. It recognises the force of the summons, and when he attended he need not give his evidence until his expensps were tendered. I submit the suggestion as an alternative.",63
380,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wilmot) [ n . 5 ] - I would point out to the - Attorney-General that a witness may be a man without sufficient money to pay his travelling fare. Pie may, for instance, have to come hundreds of miles. In such a case a. man should be tendered his travelling expenses.",63
381,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Attorney-General hag publicly promised that the man shall have his travelling expenses.,63
382,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Why does not the Attorney-General put a provision to that effect in the Bill ? What is the good of a public promise in a Court of law? A Court cannot take notice of what he said here, but must be governed by the Act. Again, suppose that a man is summoned to attend from a great distance, and his evidence is not wanted. Is he to net nothing simply because he was not called as a witness? This matter deserves better treatment than it is receiving. The Attorney-General ought to pay a little more attention to the wants of the witnesses who will be summoned to appear before Royal Commissions, because in many cases they will be in necessitous circumstances. A little more consideration from a professed humanitarian like the honourable gentleman would be more to the credit of the House. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [ n . 6 ] - I hope that the Attorney-General include both. will see the force of the argument which has been put forward. It must be patent to everybody that many witnesses will be summoned to attend before Royal Commissions whose evidence may not be taken, and who really may not have the wherewithal to come from any great distance.",63
383,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Attorney-General has already explained that their expenses will be paid. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The Attorney-General has essayed to explain many things to his own satisfaction, but those explanations, unfortunately, do not coincide with the facts and provisions of the Bill. There is no getting away from the clause itself. If it is passed a witness will have to appear before the Commission before he can claim any expenses. What the amendment proposes is that he shall be tendered his expenses before he comes, because in many cases men of insufficient means may be summoned to attend. Are persons whose evidence is not wanted when they appear to go without their expenses? What the amendment seeks to provide for is that any person who is summoned to appear before a Royal Commission shall be tendered his expenses before he appears. That is surely a reasonable proposal. The amendment would be but a very slight alteration of the clause, but it would mean a great deal to a man who may not have the means to attend the Commission after he has been subpoenaed.",64
384,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think that «the amendment would secure a witness being tendered his expenses with the subpoena. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Thoug h that might be so, he would be entitled subsequently to receive his expenses, and as the clause stands he would not. This point must have escaped the notice of the Attorney-General. Surely the honourable gentleman does not desire to inflict such an injustice upon a man who may not have the means to attend a Royal Commission from a distance at his own expense.",64
385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parramatta) [n.12] - I ask leave to amend my amendment by inserting the words proposed before the word "" appearing,"" so that the clause will read, "" Any witness summoned to appear or appearing before a Royal Commission,"" and so on. If only the words "" summoned to appear "" were used there would be no provision made for the tendering of expenses to those who appeared when summoned, and I wish to Amendment amended accordingly.
