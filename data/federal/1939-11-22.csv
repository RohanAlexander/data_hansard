1,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Barker Leader of the Country party) [5.48] The impassioned statement just made 'by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) might carry some weight with honourable members if history had been abolished before he began his speech. The words we heard were the words of the honourable member for Fremantle, but the thoughts, in many instances, were those of the very notorious Major Douglas, a gentleman represented in the Commonwealth by a party which is active in the honourable member's own State, and also in other States,, but with which the Leader of the Opposition does not desire his party to be associated. He wants to reap every political advantage that can be gained from the use of the jargon of Major Douglas, though he does not want to touch the wretched policy itself. Let honourable members recall, the history of the efforts made in the last few months to assist the wheat industry. I ask honourable members to search the Hansard reports and they will find that only last week a discussion occurred in this House on this subject. At that time honourable members of the Labour party were as silent as the tomb. Hislory is eloquent on the part that the Labour party has played in the efforts to assist the wbea.fc industry.",44
2,Mr MAHONEV,Unknown,We have always sought to assist the wheat industry. The Leader of the Country party should tell the truth.,44
3,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, The interjection of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Mahoney) was most disorderly.,44
4,Mr SHEEHAN,Unknown,The honourable member for Barker ought to stick to the truth.,44
5,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I am always happy to do so. If honourable members will go back to the period of the 1929 elections they will recollect that the then honourable member for Calare (Mr. Gibbons) stated on the hustings that he hadthe authority of his party to say that, if returned to power, it could and would pay 6s. 6d. a busbel for wheat. I ask honourable members to say whether that promise was ever fulfilled. What was the result? The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) has, I think, disappeared. Well may he disappear when questions of the failure of the Labour Government to stand up to its promises in regard to wheat are raised.",44
6,Mr MCHUGH,Unknown,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, so far I have not heard the honourable member mention the motion before the House.",44
7,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown,They can't take their medicine.,44
8,Unknown,Unknown,"Opposition members interjecting,",44
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! Honourable members are distinctly disorderly in interjecting in this fashion. With regard to the point of order, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) was permitted by Mr Speaker, beiore I took the chair, to refer to the fixing of an unduly low price for wheat. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) is following the same course.",44
10,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"If it comes to a question of squibbing on the wheat industry, one would think the Labour party was a perpetual Guy Fawkes day. I notice that the honourable member for Capricornia has returned to the chamber. I was referring, during his absence, to the famous Calare election when 6s. 6d. a bushel was promised to the farmers, and to Labour's election promises of 1929. I now give honourable members the fulfilment of those promises in the words of the honourable member for Capricornia himself.",44
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must refer to wheat prices.,44
12,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I am dealing with the question of prices of wheat referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. According to Hansard of the 12th December, 1930, the honourable member for Capricornia, who was then gracing the Treasury bench as Minister for Trade and Customs, in dealing with the wheat situation, said It has decided, after very careful and serious consideration, to guarantee the grower",44
13,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"On a point of order, the matter for discussion before the House is the statement of the Prime Minister on price-fixing to prevent profiteering. I submit that what was said regarding the price of wheat in 1929, like the flowers that bloom .in the spring, has nothing to do with the case.",44
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The Chair has already given a ruling on the point.,45
15,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I am quoting the prices of wheat which were determined by the then Government of which the honourable member for Capricornia was Minister for Trade and Customs. After having promised that the Labour Government would fix the price of wheat at a certain figure, the then Minister said It has decided, after very careful and serious consideration, to guarantee the grower 3s. a bushel f.o.b., equivalent on the average to about 2s. Gd. at country sidings of the 1930-31 crop. As a wheat-grower, I say that the guarantee given by him was not worth the breath with which it was spoken. I did not receive the guaranteed price; the ionorable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. Green) did not get it, nor did the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. MCHugh). Honourable members opposite know as well as I do that if they were returned to power tomorrow the guaranteed price of 3s. 10^d. a bushel for wheat, promised by the Leader of the Opposition in Perth, could not be found by a Labour Government. There is a difference, I can assure an honourable member who is interjecting, between asking for a thing and giving it. There are many aspects of the question which have to be considered.",45
16,Mr JAMES,Unknown,It was with the approval of the Country party that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) moved an amendment yesterday that would have had the effect of fixing a price for wheat.,45
17,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I have nothing to hide, nor has my party anything to hide, in respect of what took place. between representatives of the Country party and the Prime Minister this afternoon. The country is entitled to know the facts. They are these: The Country party, in the ordinary course of events, met this morning and discussed the question of wheat. It believes, as honourable members opposite have claimed to believe many times, that things should be got by negotiation. Eive members of my party, the honourable members for Swan .(IvLrGregory), Riverina (Mr. Nook), Indi (Mr MCEwen), Calare (Mr. Thorby), and myself, representative of the whole of the party, waited as a deputation on the Prime Minister. We put a certain proposition before the right honourable gentleman. The members of this Parliament have a perfect right to put propositions to the Prime Minister if they desire to do so, and the Opposition has no right to question them. The Prime Minister replied that he required time to consider our proposition and that he would put it before Cabinet on Monday.",45
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Hon. G. J. Bell) It does not apear to the Chair that the honourable member is discussing the motion for f.a.q. wheat before the House.,45
19,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I am only replying, Mr Speaker, to a debate which took place during your absence from the chair.",45
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member has no right to reply to anything that was said if it was out of order.,45
21,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"If I may say so, sir, a most extraordinary attack was made during the last half hour or so upon my party and myself. Surely, in all fairness, I am entitled to reply in a way that suits me best.",45
22,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to discuss the motion.,45
23,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,The Leader of the Opposition did not discuss the motion.,45
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,45
25,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,I say most definitely that he did not do so.,45
26,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! This defiance of the Chair must not continue. The honourable member must discuss the motion.,45
27,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"The question that we are discussing is the fixing of a price for wheat following a statement- I am not going to call it what perhaps I might have called it-of the Minister for Trade and Customs. In discussing that statement, the Leader of the Opposition has seen fit to launch an attack on. my party in relation to the fixing of the price of wheat - I am now endeavouring to reply to his remarks. It is a-fact that'the members of my party waited on the Prime Minister* this afternoon with , regard to the fixing of the price of wheat and the methods under which the Government",45
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It appears that the honourable member is still not discussing the motion.,46
29,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"We put a certain proposition to the Prime Minister this afternoon while the House was sitting on behalf of the Country party in this chamber. The Prime Minister promised that he would place it before Cabinet on Monday, and that afrter he had discussed it with his Cabinet colleagues he. would make a statement, on the wheat position.",46
30,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"What , another one?",46
31,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I hope fihat the Leader of the Opposition, during the resit of his life, will never again make a statement such as that which he made in the Sydney town hall last Monday night.",46
32,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must realise that he is not discussing the motion. I ask ihim to do so.,46
33,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Subjec t to your ruling, Mr Speaker, in debating that question, I think I am entitled to discuss the fixing of the price of wheat.",46
34,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Chair has not ruled otherwise.,46
35,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Then J am all right. What is the position with wlhioh we are faced with regard to the fixing of a price for wheat? Honourable members opposite, as I have pointed out, have many times in the past had a "" go "" at fixing the price of wheat. Leader of the Opposition said that it should be a just price to the producer. I feel sure that the honourable gentleman, on second thoughts, will qualify that statement. If he is unfortunate enougih to assume power in the very near future, will he go to the farmers of Australia and say, "" | shall fix the price of wheat; I shall put no limit on the quantity of wheat you may grow. You can produce as many bushels of wheat as you like, and I and my Government, will stand up to the fixed price of 3s. I 0 | d . a bushel "" ?",46
36,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It is quite clear that the - honourable member is discussing tihe production of wheat and the ramifications of the wheat industry--matter s which have already been discussed on other motions.,46
37,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"In view of what took place a little while agO, it is difficult for me to carry On. In fixing the price of wheat any government must sfee. that a fair price depends to a very large degree on the market possibilities with which the industry is faced. Honourable members opposite must concede that there is a vital distinction between the fixing of prices for secondary products in a country like Australia, where we have no export surplus of secondary products, and the fixing of prices for certain primary products which are not easily marketed under present world conditions.",46
38,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"Does the honourable member think that the Government price is a just price under these conditions? Mr Archie CAMERON:-The Government has not fixed any final price for wheat. Up to this stage the Government has not said, ""We shall or we shall not ftate at present what the fixed price is "". If the Leader of the Opposition were clothed with the responsibility of government at present he Would be a little less enthusiastic about fixing the price of. wheat than he was this afternoon.",46
39,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), apparently with his leader's approval, named a certain figure in his amendment yesterday.",46
40,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,".Order 1 These constant interjections, which are obs>truoting the debate, must cease. The",46
41,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,All that the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) asked for yesterday was the reconsideration,46
42,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order 1 The honourable member is obviously referring to the wheat question as debated upon another motion yesterday. The Chair is able to discriminate sufficiently to know that he is not now in order, particularly in discussing an amendment which was moved yesterday to another motion.",46
43,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"At any rnte the question of prices for any exportable commodity may now be discussed, although I doubt whether the present is the best-time to discuss it ; but it has been raised by the Leader of the Opposition and honourable members are entitled to express their opinions. We must look fairly and squarely at the position which faces certain export industries, particularly in relation to price fixation. The farming community would be in an excellent position if the Government could say: "" We shall quote a price which some of us have in mind, and we shall guarantee that price for the whole of the crop which is purchased "". That would provide a fixed price throughout Australia. If the principle of a fixed price is to be accepted the Commonwealth Government, the farming community, and the wheat growers in particular, must be prepared to accept a limitation of production. At this stage we cannot discuss the limitation of production; I merely mention it in passing. I do not wish to advocate the one without recognizing the necessity for the other.",46
44,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,The honourable member did not recognize the other in the amendment moved yesterday.,47
45,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,The two things must go hand in hand if price fixation is to be effective. I recognize - the limitations imposed on honourable members in this discussion; I recognize also that grave difficulties will confront wheat-growers in the near future. Those of us who are engaged in the industry speak most feelingly on the matter because our feelings are centred on our pockets.,47
46,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member is not discussing the statement before the Chair. Mr Archie "" CAMERON - The question of fixing a price for wheat could best he discussed under another motion; apparently members of the Opposition agree with me on this point. Mr BEAST.EY - That is what wanted to do.",47
47,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"The Country party will be prepared to do that at the proper time. Obviously, while negotiations are in progress between the Government and the Country party on this question, the time is not opportune to force an issue in this chamber; the Country party is not to be trapped by the Labour party into an attempt to do so. Another matter affecting primary industries which I wish to bring before the Minister for Trade and Customs concerns not only the matter of price fixation, hut also the very interesting subject of profiteering. I am not well acquainted with conditions in the fat lamb industry in other States, but I am well aware of what happened in South Australia when the Government decided to enter into a contract with the United Kingdom for the purchase of fat lambs",47
48,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member is again discussing a matter by that is not relevant to the statement before the House, but which was included in another statement. The Chair cannot allow him to continue along those lines. It is quite clear that honourable members wish to discuss other statements, but the statement now before the Chair is one that can properly be discussed apart from any others.",47
49,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"In explanation, I point out that I wish to refer to what I believe to be absolutely unjustified profiteering, which, if I understand the situation correctly, was dealt with very extensively by the Minister for Trade and Customs in his statement last week.",47
50,Mr WHITE,Unknown,The statement also dealt with prices generally.,47
51,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,The question of prices and profiteering must be linked together.,47
52,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The sale of these goods to the United Kingdom cannot possibly have anything to do with the statement now under discussion.,47
53,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I mentioned it in order to show what I am trying to discuss. When war broke out, a certain arrangement was entered into with the United Kingdom and thereupon we the question of the prevention of profiteering became dependent upon the action taken by the Government to ensure the carrying on of primary industries as in normal times. Instead of appointing certain people as its agents, with a view to obtaining the best available price for the producers, the Government apparently allowed people to go out on their own account and make the greatest possible amount of profit out of the producers. Information which was available to the people who were acting to tlieir own advantage was not available to the producers of fat lambs. Obviously, from the point of view of the average stock-raiser the position was not very satisfactory. Even if the producers had been aware of the price being paid for fat lambs at Smithfield market in London, they would not have been able to calculate from that the price on hooks at the abattoirs at the nearest point to themselves. The prices paid for fat lambs by certain people acting in their own interests and the prices which they realized on the re-sale of the lambs were such that the Government should institute an inquiry. The difference between the prices they paid for the lambs and the prices they received on re-sale constitutes profiteering. This profiteering continued for some weeks until the State Government published in the press information received from the Agent-General in London, stating the London prices, together with a statement of the prices ruling at the abattoirs in Adelaide as calculated by experts in the Department of Agriculture. An official statement has been supplied to the Parliament of South Australia showing the values of first, second and third grade lambs of every weight. I have received information from a member of the South Australian Parliament, who is a fat lamb raiser, giving the names of many of his neighbours, together with the prices that they realized for their lambs. These prices were as low as 7s. 9d. apiece for first grade lambs.",47
54,Mr MCHUGH,Unknown,Something is wrong there.,48
55,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"The names of those persons would be familiar to the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr MCHugh). Prices of 7s. 9d., 8s. 6d., and 9s. 9d. were paid to the producers for best-quality lambs, which were worth anything from 15s. to 18s. or 19s. apiece. If that does not constitute one of the worse kinds of profiteering, I fail to understand the meaning of the word "" profiteering "". As I understand it, profiteering may be carried out in two ways. According to the general acceptance of the term, it refers to cases of traders in wholesale and retail lines who take unfair advantages of conditions arising from war or other occurrences in the sale of certain commodities which they have in stock.",48
56,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. [Quorum formed.],48
57,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"On e or two principles are involved in the matter of profiteering. The first thing that this House can lay down as a principle which cannot be questioned in any circumstances is that production, trade, and industry are carried on for two purposes, the one being - to secure a payable price to the producer, and the other, to sell at a tolerable price to the consumer. All merchants, all middlemen, all marketing organizations, function in order that those two objects may be achieved; they constitute a balance. But under some of the present practices this balance is not arrived at. I shall not delve further into the lamb question, but shall pass on to other matters, one of which, relating to chemicals, I have already raised with the Minister by correspondence. I shall cite my own experience. Walking into a chemist's shop in Adelaide and asking for a certain well-known proprietary article, I was told that the price had been increased from Is. 6d. to 2s. That was a Nyal product. I do not think that since the outbreak of war there has been any increase of the cost of raw materials which would justify a 33-^ per cent, increase of the price of that article. Other cases have been brought by me to the notice of the Minister in correspondence that I have addressed to him.",48
58,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,What was his reply?,48
59,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I 'have not yet received one. I have to give him time, quite realizing that he has a fairly tough job in watching developments in these matters. Allegations have been made in regard to the cost of certain chemicals which come from even a partly Government-owned institution-Imperia l Chemical Industries. These matters must be watched. If the costs of commodities are to be increased, those increases must be iustified. The press has forecast an increase of the price of petrol. Petrol is . a very important commodity in' this community. The suggestion is that out of an increase of 6d. a gallon, 3d. is to go towards the increased cost, the distributor is to get Id., and the Government is to get 2d. I should be extremely interested to know by what new set of circumstances retailers of petrol in Australia are entitled to another Id. a gallon on the sales that they make. This affects every transport system in Australia in which petrol and its cognate fuels are used. There is a good deal which could be said concerning the development of producer gas as an alternative to petrol, but that obviously cannot be debated under this motion unless the question of profiteering be involved.",48
60,Mr CONELAN,Unknown,Will not the increase of the price of petrol bring that about more quickly?,49
61,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Certainl y the increase will act as an incentive to owners of heavy freight lorries especially, to change over to some cheaper fuel. If any restrictions on the use of petrol are imposed, I believe that action in that direction will be taken by means of. customs regulations. Any restrictions imposed on the use of petrol should be based not on the quantity which the purchaser is in the habit of using, but on the function to which its use is devoted. A person who is engaged in, say, freight haulage operations, passenger services, and the like, in country districts, is very much more entitled to the ful l ration than would be a person who, for purely social reasons, runs a car in a country town or suburban area. There is also the interesting case of cornsacks, in which another very important principle is involved. It became a matter of government policy that the whole of the produce of certain primary industries should be taken over under war legislation. If it were right for the Government to take over the whole of the wheat and barley industries, and to control the wjiole of the flour output of the community, common sense obviously dictates that the receptacles in which the wheat has to be marketed, namely, cornsacks, should also be taken over by the Government. We should not have had thestate of affairs to which my attention has been directed in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne, under which, it is reported, a very heavy increase of the price of cornsacks, which were in store at the outbreak of war, followed that event, not only in Australia, but also in Calcutta. It is the belief of many men who are closely associated with the industry that those cornsacks which were in store were sold almost immediately back to Calcutta at a profit by the merchants who held them, and were then repurchased by those same merchants a week or so afterwards, the cornsacks not having changed their location.",49
62,Mr JOHN LAWSON,Unknown,Does the honourable member consider that that can be substantiated ?,49
63,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,Has the Minister made investigations?,49
64,Mr JOHN LAWSON,Unknown,I have.,49
65,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member's time has expired. Motion (by Mr. Curtin) agreed toThat the honourable member be given leave to continue.,49
66,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The Leader of the Opposition will listen to the honourable member now, will he?",49
67,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"I have listened to him all the afternoon. He refused me leave to make a statement today, and this is how I retaliate.",49
68,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I express my deep appreciation of the action of the Leader of the Opposition, an appreciation that is all the moresincere in view of the interesting fight that we had before dinner to-night. This matter of cornsacks is very interesting from the point of view of many primary industries. I am not so sure that everything that could be done was done to see that those industries were protected. There has been quite a lot of talk and correspondence in connection with the matter. The honourable member for Grey (Mr Badman) is interested in a good deal of what is occurring in South Australia with respect to the handling of second-hand cornsacks, and the enormous increase of price that has taken place in connection with that commodity as the result of the outbreak of war. No man can tell me that there should, have been any increased cost in relation to second-hand) cornsacks, because they have not to be brought from overseas; they are already in the country. Any increase was made not on account of increased costs but purely to bring unearned increment to those who happened to be the holders of them at the time. If the question of profiteering is to be tackled, it must be tackled from two aspects: First, from the aspect of those who are the purchasers of goodswhich are held by other people; and, secondly, from the aspect of those who are the sellers of commodities which they are producing. It is well-known-the Minister, being the representative of a country area, will know as well as I do - that in 99 cases out of 100 a producer has practically no voice in the disposal of his product. There is a market, and he must take what it offers when his product is ready for disposal. The Government will have to take a very serious view of one or two of the things that I have pointed out to-night. The' Minister for Trade and Customs also controls the wine industry in this country. That, industry will next year afford an excellent example of the points that I am malting. The honourable gentleman will be told that certain people in the wine industry will not be able to purchase any more grap.es. There is going to be a terrific fight over that. The producers will almost certainly be told by some makers that a fair proportion of their crops should rot on the vines. If there is one industry among the primary industries of Australia which is more helpless than another, it is the wine grape industry, because, as soon as the fruit is ripe, the grower must find a buyer for it ; if he cannot, the fruit simply rots on the vine. There alternative. He cannot dry it, because it is not a drying grape, and he cannot crush prices. it and store it on his own premises because that would involve him in a very 'considerable outlay of capital, as well as cause him to have difficulties with the Excise Department. Therefore this producer is in a particularly helpless position. I plead with the Minister, who I know is trying to do a good job under difficult circumstances, that, when the necessity arises, he will take hold of this wine grape industry in both hands and sit in their places one or two gentlemen who for some time past have had a pretty good "" g o "" at the expense of the producer. There are other points to which one could refer, but I think that I have had a very fair innings. I have even had a second innings, at the wish of the Leader of the Opposition. I can only say in closing, reverting once again to the wheat argument on which we started, that if there is to be any debate in respect of the fixation of the price of wheat in this coinmunity, then, so far as I am concerned, I am prepared to meet the Opposition at any time. In days gone by I fought a Parliament on my own. I am not alone on this occasion; there are sixteen others here who will render me assistance. If the Opposition wants it hot and rough', then the Opposition can so have it.",49
69,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Swan) [8.14] - I sk a for your consideration this evening, Mr. Speaker, on account of an incident that occurred this afternoon while you were in the chair; you left the chair shortly afterwards. An attack was made upon me and my colleagues by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin). I regard it as strange that some persons should judge others according to their own standards. The impression that the Leader of the Opposition tried to leave, not in the House, because he could not do that, but among the people, was that I had brought forward in this House an amendment in connection with the prices of certain articles, and hadthen, when there was a possibility of its being discussed, dodged away for the purpose of assisting the Government.",50
70,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,This matter may not is no other be discussed now.,50
71,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I am talking about Why was the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) allowed to make a personal attack on myself and others this afternoon on a motion relating to prices and profiteers. If you permitted the Leader of the Opposition to make that attack,50
72,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The matter arose when the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) was speaking. I did not allow it. The honourable member is referring to a debate which took place yesterday, and that is not in. order.",50
73,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Then I ask that the record of that speech, be expunged from Hansard.",50
74,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That cannot clone.,51
75,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,It is very discreditable,51
76,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I cannot allow the honourable member to continue on those lines.,51
77,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"It is very discreditable- I am not referring to your action,",51
78,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"that such an attack should have been made. I am not much used to political tricks, or to the methods employed to evade the ruling of the Chair. I have no desire to do that, but I want something in the nature of justice when discussing matters before the House. I moved an amendment calling on the Government to take certain action in regard to wheat prices. The objective I had in view was to achieve something by negotiation, if possible and to claim the most favourable terms possible for the wheat growers. I had previously taken part in deputations to memibers of the Government on this matter, and would have been only too pleased to have joined a deputation to press the issue further. I had put a certain proposition before the House, and it was debated. When the matter was being debated, I noticed how carefully it was avoided by every honourable member on the other side of the House ;.not one showed a disposition to support it. To-day I took part in a deputation to the Prime Minister in connection with the price of wheat. I want to achieve something by means of negotiation for the people I represent-no t simply to play political tricks. With other members of my party I waited on the Prime Minister in an effort to obtain better conditions for the wheat-growers. We were told that certain proposals that we had put forward would be considered at a meeting of Cabinet on Monday. Therefore, the question had to be considered whether we should await the decision of Cabinet. As a member of that deputation I am prepared to postpone discussion until Cabinet deals with the matter. If honourable members opposite are in earnest, they know that there is nothing to prevent them from bringing the matter forward again with the aid of those who desire that something definite should be done. be Mr EOKDE - We tried to do it today, and the honourable member voted against us.",51
79,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"If honourable members opposite desire to obtain better prices for the wheat-growers they will have every opportunity to do so, and they can rely upon the assistance of members of this party. I 'do not intend to allow the debate on wheat prices to lapse. It is desirable that the Government should watch the position very carefully in order to prevent profiteering. Only to-night I received two telegrams dealing with this matter. I do not know what the Government proposes to do in the way of instituting a War Times Profits Tax, but I submit that this session should not be allowed to close before something is done. Unless the position is watched very carefully, it is possible for traders to evade such taxation. I remember that, during the last war, practically the whole of the Australian trade in a certain commodity was divided between two firms in the proportion of two-thirds and one-third, respectively. The company which handled two-thirds of the business was not able to show any profit, while the company which handled only one-third was able to pay income tax, and also a very large sum in war-time profits tax. There is room for a great deal of dodging by the smart division in matters of this kind. I know of one business man in Sydney who sold his Australian stocks to a company which he established in Hong Kong, and all profit made by trading went to the Hong Kong company. Steps should be taken to ensure that, if undue profits are made, either by cleverness or good luck, a big proportion of them should go back to the national revenue. Prices are steadily rising, and this makes^ it very difficult for the primary producers who are compelled to accept such low prices for their products. The Government, instead of placing the entire control in the hands of a professor of economics, should appoint as his assistant a sound business man who could watch the operations of those engaged in industry.",51
80,Mr JOHN LAWSON,Unknown,We have very well qualified business consultants.,51
81,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,There should be A business man as well.,51
82,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [8.25] The discomfiture of members of the Country party has been all too evident during this debate, and it was particularly apparent when we listened to the outburst of the Leader of the Country party (Mr Archie Cameron). The country is indebted to 'the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) for throwing the spotlight on these gentlemen so that we may know just where they stand when it comes to a matter involving the welfare of the primary producers. This afternoon, we were able to prove once again to the people of Australia that members of the Country party are merely sham fighters.",52
83,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is out of order in referring to matters which the House has decided by its vote earlier in the sitting.,52
84,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"This has been a most illuminating experience. It is evident that members of the Country party have no real desire to ensure to the primary producers a fair return for what they produce. They are not prepared to support action that would safeguard the primary producers. This debate affords an opportunity to review one of the most important aspects of wartime administration. It has to do with the domestic economy of the nation which vitally affects the living conditions of every man, woman and child in the country. The Government evidently recognized the urgency of the matter because, within 48 hours of the declaration of war, it set up machinery designed to give the impression, at least, that it intended to protect the public against the exorbitant demands of the merchants. Unfortunately, sufficient evidence has already accumulated to prove that all of the endeavours of the Government in this direction have failed to check the rapaciousness of those who are prepared to reap rich profits from the sufferings a war-wracked community. Just as was the case during the last war, the merchants will once again endeavour to levy toll upon the Australian public. The archives of this Parliament are filled with records which prove that those engaged in commerce were not moved by the needs of their country during the last war, but were prepared to make high profits whenever the opportunity offered. The Inter-State Commission, which inquired into prices during the last war, issued a most illuminating report which showed how certain traders mercilessly exploited the public. This should have been sufficient warning to the Government to take immediate action to prevent a repetition of such occurrences. It is true that the Government has challenged the action of certain large commercial interests in raising prices, and that prosecutions have been launched in the courts. Unfortunately however, so ineffective is . the machinery provided by the Government to deal with cases such as this, that the courts have refused to convict the persons charged. The merchants have triumphed once again. What does the Minister intend to do to correct the position and to require those people who have evaded the regulations to make retribution to the Australian public?",52
85,Mr JOHN LAWSON,Unknown,"Eve n in those instances, there was certainly no profiteering.",52
86,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"The people to whom I am referring disregarded the price that should have ruled for their commodity, and it was only because the Minister was unable to prove that the price fixed in the proclamation, under which the prosecutions were made, was in fact the price ruling on the 31st August, that the magistrate dismissed the cases.",52
87,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,What does the Minister call profiteering?,52
88,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,I do not know. But I do know that he would go a long way farther on the road than would the Opposition to justify the actions of these people.,52
89,Mr JOHN LAWSON,Unknown,The fact that I prosecuted them proves how wrong the honourable gentleman is.,52
90,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"That is questionable; when the prosecution was launched it was evident that the defendants «.>f knew that there would be no penalty for their misdeeds. They knew there was a way of escape by reason of the imperfection of the regulations. If there be anything worthwhile in the profession of the Minister that he wished to bring those people to the bar of justice to answer for their actions, he should have made some effort to correct what was obviously a mistake by the Executive in the regulations. Investigations in the last war disclosed that rents, groceries, clothing, boots and shoes and every other item within the range of necessaries of life, were at an unduly high level. Every precaution must be taken to see that there is no repetition of that in this war. Far more preferable to theexcess profits tax of the last war is a more rigid system of price-fixing. We should make it impossible for excess profits to be made. The Government in office during the last war was of the same political complexion as this Government, and it was not even ready to take 100 per cent, of the excess profits. Instead, it diyided the loot with the pirates. Merchants use devious methods to escape the law. For instance, normally, warehouses have two or three different price lists, the prices charged varying according to your grading as a customer. When war breaks out and profit fixing takes place, warehousemen claim the highest range of prices as the prices ruling on the prescribed date. The other price lists are scrapped, notwithstanding that the warehouses thereby no longer conform to their own commercial rules. To cite a further example of how the wholesalers evade their obligations, I know of a wholesale drug firm in Adelaide which, before the war, sold its products by the ounce and by the pound, the price by the pound being the smaller. When the price-fixing regulations came into operation, the per-lb. price list was suspended and the per-oz. list produced as evidence of the prices ruling on the 31st August. Thenceforth, the firm charged its customers, who formerly bought on the per-lb. basis, the peroz. prices. Even for 50 lb. of a product, the price is computed on a peroz. basis, whereas, of course, formerly, the basis was the per-lb. rate. That sort of thing makes it possible for wholesale firms to escape the effect of the fixing regulations. That position must be corrected. One of the most glaring instances of the leniency which this Government is showing to the people who are making a big ""rake-off"" as the result of this war also occurred in Adelaide. At the outbreak of war, certain agencies which dealt in cornsacks increased the price to Mr Makin. the primary producers of South Australia. Protests were made to the Deputy Prices Commissioner, and he found many instances of deliberate evasion of the price fixed for cornsacks. But, instead of taking speedy action against the offenders, who knew that they were committing a breach of the law, he invited them to communicate with him so that he could inform them of the price that they could properly charge, as if they were not already aware of the price that they should charge! As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) rightly said, these people gamble with excess profits as against the penalties that they may be required to pay if they are brought before the court. In this country there are many commercial people who are ready to - take the risk of prosecution in order to gain excessive profits, because they know that they have the most lenient of all governments with which to deal. Tender solicitude to people who take that attitude to the public welfare is something that the public will not tolerate and will put an end to at the first opportunity. It is not the retailers, the small business men, who are responsible for profiteering and exploitation. It is the rich merchants. We have the evidence of the secretary of the Retail Traders Association of New South Wales about the increases that were made of the prices of certain commodities, particularly groceries. That touches the living conditions of the Australian people. The Housewives Association, which is well equipped to know whether profiteering is occurring, has produced evidence of such exploitation requiring immediate attention and action by this Government. As an indication of what has happened, I have been informed by the Housewives Association that on the Monday after the outbreak of war, wholesale firms and agents for manufacturers met with a view to determining pricewhat should be the price of women's hosiery. The meeting resolved to increase the price by Is. a pair. That is profiteering at the expense of Australian womanhood. The Prime Minister indicated in his speech on this subject that necessity existed to protect the interests of the people in wartime.. I siibmit that necessity also exists to do so in peacetime. We should not wait until peace is restored before we take action in this direction. We have an immediate and definite responsibility to act now. In my opinion the time is opportune for this Parliament to overhaul its constitutional powers in respect of trade and commerce. It is doubtful whether the Parliament could constitutionally do many of the things in peacetime that are being done at present; but' if the situation were put the public clearly, while they are face to face with the problems of the day, I believe that they would approve of the clothing of this Parliament with much greater constitutional power.",52
91,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I must ask the honourable member not to pursue that subject.,54
92,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,I was merely emphasizing the need for the exercise of similar powers in peacetime to those how being exercised. We should be just as watchful for profiteering in peacetime as we are in wartime.,54
93,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member .may not, on this motion, discuss proposals for the alteration of the Constitution.",54
94,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"I shall abide by your ruling, sir. Whenever we talk about the necessity to expand the credit resources of the nation we are told that it will lead to an increase of prices. If increased prices are likely to lead to credit difficulties there is all the more reason why the Government should be very watchful to protect the public. An undue increase of commodity price-levels should be prevented, even if the most drastic action is necessary. The opinion of the Labour party is that the national credit could be expanded to assist in the financing of our defence expenditure. The action that the Government has taken in regard to price fixation and profiteering is a step in the right direction, but we should like to see it display more determination""'and resolution. The time will come', no doubt, when the electors will place a more effective government upon the treasury bench, but in the meantime the general community should be invited to'assist in-the maintenance of prices at a proper level. We do not desire'anything in the form of a bureaucracy to be developed, but we need adequate evidence to be furnished of the earnestness of the Administration to safeguard the interests of the public. The Minister for Trade and Customs told us that prices had been fixed for 160 items. That is a very small number compared with the vast variety of commodities to which attention should be devoted. The Minister ought to give a great deal more to of his time than he is giving to this aspect of his administrative responsibilities. Unscrupulous merchants should not be permitted to exploit the public, and the Government should take every opportunity to act promptly and effectively against those who commit breaches of the regulations. The utmost severity of the law should be brought to bear upon those who disregard the best interests of the community. While I appreciate what is being done, I urge the Government to be more watchful than it has been.",54
95,Mr LANE,Unknown,"Barton) [8.54] - I should not have risen to participate in this debate except for the absurdity of some of the remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin). The sooner the honourable member can reach some understanding of the rudiments of price-fixing, the better it will be for him, and the more ready we shall be to listen to what he may have to say. I confess to disappointment at his speech as I understood that he had been rather active in trying to discover the so-called robbers of the public. He mentioned a certain firm of druggists in Adelaide and told us that it was invoicing certain of its goods at so much per oz. in preference to so much per lb. in order to evade the detection of its alleged profiteering activities. That, absurd observation revealed clearly the honourable gentleman's ignorance of commercial practice. In any case, I ask why he did not make these remarks in Adelaide? I imagine it was because he is afraid of his political skin. The honourable gentleman also had something to say about the Housewives Association. He should not attempt to hide himself behind the skirts of the women in the community. Altogether, his observations showed a lamentable ignorance of commercial affairs, which is surprising in one who has been Speaker of this House and who is the representative of an industrial constituency. The honourable member must realise that it would be impossible to perfect a price-fixing organization within a month or two. In my opinion, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr John Lawson) has acted effectively in the time at his disposal. He is to be commended for having given such prompt attention to the operations of the timber merchants. The morning after certain representations were made to him on this subject, officers of his department embarked upon an inquiry into the prices of timber. We might have expected the honourable member for Hindmarsh to commend the Government for this action, but he did not see fit to do so. So far as I can gather from his remarks, lie did not even bring directly under the notice of the Minister the case of the Adelaide drug firm to which he made reference. When honourable members of the Labour party occupied the Government bench some years ago, they made certain promises, not in respect of profiteering, but in respect of bribery. Mr MAHONEY,-Cu t that out!",54
96,Mr LANE,Unknown,"I withdraw the remark. There are ways in which the Government, as well as the private individual, may profiteer at the expense of the community. Honourable members know that when some time ago a battle was being fought in Calare, the members of a certain party promised the wheat-growers a guarantee of 6s. 6M. a bushel. They were merely raising the price in an attempt to get a representative of their party into this Parliament. Another gentleman- I think it was Jack Lang-wen t even further and said "" If you return us to power we will give you 7s. 6d. a bushel"".",55
97,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not discussing the bill.,55
98,Mr LANE,Unknown,I was merely endeavouring to show the inverse reasoning of honourable members opposite.,55
99,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is out of order.,55
100,Mr LANE,Unknown,"I am impelled to make these remarks by the charges levelled by the honourable member for Hindmarsh against a Minister who has assumed the responsibilities of his office only within the last few months. When we consider the ramifications of trade and commerce and the wide range of subjects with which he has to deal we must realise the tremendous difficulties which must have confronted him. In his criticism of the Minister the honourable member was, to say the least of it, decidedly unfair and I feel sure that he, on reflection, will realise that it was unworthy of him. During the course of his speech he did not make one constructive suggestion to the Government. He said that he discovered a lady who told him that when she went into a shop to purchase a pair of stockings just after the outbreak' of war she was forced to pay an extra Is. for them.",55
101,Mr GANDER,Unknown,The honourable member ought to know something about stockings.,55
102,Mr LANE,Unknown,"At all events I know more about them than does the honourable member for Hindmarsh, and, moreover, I would not use the statement of the lady regarding the high price of stockings as the basis on which to frame a charge against a responsible Minister of State. At least the honourable member should have sent his own wife into the shop to buy the stockings.",55
103,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,I would not send somebody else's wife.,55
104,Mr LANE,Unknown,"No , but the honourable member would use the evidence of somebody else's wife as the basis on which to lay a charge in this House. I would not have spoken during this debate but for the stupidities uttered by the honourable member. He said that the Australian people are looking to this Parliament to protect them during these difficult times. I am glad that a United Australia party government is in power today, and if Labour were offered the reins of government in this country, I feel sure that the honourable member would be the first to say that he would prefer that the honour should be left to another party. If we offered the government benches to the Labour party tomorrow, the honourable member for Hindmarsb would be the first to advise his leader not to accept them, because the partyto which he belongs does not know where it stands in regard to this war and the measures that should he taken to prevent profiteering. The members of the Labour party claim that they stand behind the Government up to the hilt in its attempt to prosecute those dreadful men who, taking advantage of these difficult times, ing at the expense of the community. The honourable gentleman advocated the utilization of the national credit of this country in an attempt to solve the price fixing problem. I do not know how he would do it other than by increasing the purchasing power of the people. I have always said that price-fixing is the first door to socialization. I do not believe in it. If we fix prices, we must also fix wages.",55
105,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,That already been done.,56
106,Mr LANE,Unknown,"Not throughout Australia. A large number of people in Australia do not work on fixed wages. Price-fixing must mean fixed wages for a number of men in industry. If you fix profits you must also fix wages, and any attempt to fix prices must inevitably lead to State socialism. When I came into this House eight years ago, the honourable members opposite claimed that there was a man in Sydney greater even than Lenin.",56
107,Mr MAHONEY,Unknown,Who was that?,56
108,Mr LANE,Unknown,"Jac k Lang. Price-fixing must inevitably lead to the establishment of the socialistic state as conceived by Lenin. The aims of the Labour party are professedly socialistic. As one of the planks of its platform, Labour boldly declares that it seeks control of the means of production, distribution and exchange. If Labour were in control of this country at the present time, we should have a system of government not unlike that which obtains in Bussia where the Government found that the only way to deal with capitalists was to shoot them.",56
109,Mr MAHONEY,Unknown,Has not the British Government fixed prices in England?,56
110,Mr LANE,Unknown,No .,56
111,Mr JAMES,Unknown,Ge t to the motion before the Chair.,56
112,Mr LANE,Unknown,"I knew that honourable members opposite would not relish my remarks about Bussia. They have no wish to be tabbed in the group to which they really belong. Every time they face their masters they endeavour to delude the people into thinking that somebody else supports the principle of communism; but, fortunately, their efforts to side-track the electors so far have not are profiteerbeen successful.",56
113,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member must discuss the motion. Mr LANE.'- I was endeavouring to give a little information concerning what price-fixing really means. I believe that in times of emergency, such as this, the Government should endeavour to restrain any profiteering which it knows exists.",56
114,Mr RIORDAN,Unknown,Restrai n ?,56
115,Mr LANE,Unknown,"Yes , we have often had to restrain even Labour Premiers in the has past because of their great desire to retain what does not belong to them. At a time like this, we should endeavour to develop among business people a high standard of ethics. In this time of stress people should realise that unduly high » profits should not be made to advance the position of individual members of the community, but that, on the contrary, profits should be kept as low as possible in order that those on the lowest rung of the ladder may be afforded the highest standard of living. What militates against the achievement of this desirable state of affairs is that dishonest men, in order to live in luxury and ease, are prepared to gamble away the rights of their fellow men. .1I have not fought against socialism for the last 35 years without learning that honourable members opposite are in their hearts false to their expressed convictions. The greatmisfortune, however, is that the working men whom they profess to lead are misled because they never tell the truth about the goal towards which they are leading. The honourable member for Hindmarsh said that the Government condoned offences of price inflation for food, clothing, and other necessaries of life. Apparently the honourable member is not aware that honourable members on this side of the chamber have a keener conscience and a higher sense of morality than he has. That is proved by the fact that at each election over the last nine years the Labour party has failed to secure control of the. Government. It has even been unable to capture, with its very best men, the electorate which I represent and which was once held by the Labour party with a majority of 22,000. That is clear evidence that honest men prefer a man who tells them the truth to one who tells them false stories of what the Labour movement represents. The electors know what the Labour party stands for. When the honourable member for Hindmarsh charged the Government with condoning price inflation .and encouraging dishonest men to be unfair to their fellows, he misrepresented the position. The honourable gentleman must know that all men cannot be made honest. Moses framed the commandment, "" Thou shalt not steal"", but men. of his creed have, been known to steal. Huinan nature is such that it is impossible to obtain a uniform standard of morality and a uniform standard of living. Until men understand the principles of brotherhood",56
116,Mr RIORDAN,Unknown,How does the honourable member connect his remarks with price-fixing?,57
117,Mr LANE,Unknown,"Unti l the honourable memher can understand that the true ideal of government in this country is not to seek place and position but to foster brotherhood, he cannot understand how price-fixing is related to dealings amongst the people of the nation. repeat that price-fixing has its use in cases of emergency, and so far the Government has done a good job in this connection. It has warned the commercial community that it will not permit abuses that were permitted during the last war by a Labour government, which failed in many cases to prevent men from amassing wealth out of the misfortunes of war. One of the first things that this Government set out to do after the outbreak of war was to institute a system of price fixing. Honourable members are aware that not more than three weeks ago, I ' drew the attention of the Government to the fact that timber merchants had increased prices. Unless the Government follows the methods of Stalin and decides out of-hand without fair trial that men : are commit/tina* offences and must be, punished, it will find that some men will take advantage, of our laws to evade, as far as possible, the control of prices. Before the war. timber merchants allowed a discount of 33^ per cent, to certain of their reliable cash customers, but immediately war broke out and a price-fixing authority was formed, they decided to discontinue those allowances, while their price lists remained nominally the same. Recently a man who had built one cottage shortly before the outbreak of* war told me that when he built a similar one some months later he found that for the same quantity of timber he had to pay an extra £16 10s. I told him that it was useless to tell me of the case unless he was prepared to make his name public and give evidence; but he said that he was afraid to do so because he would not be able to get any more timber from the merchants. The Government is opposed to that sort of thing. The mud-slinging of honourable members opposite will not have any effect on the community. Whenever they sling mud at the Government and try to show that there is a way into Parliament through some peculiar method of condemning the actions of other parties, without proving themselves that they have ability to govern the country properly, - they will only discredit themselves in the eyes of the people. The Government has given evidence of its intention to control prices, but an organization of I the dimensions of a price-dixing authority cannot be built up in a few weeks, or even months. Any man with business experience knows that it will take a longtime to cope with the methods adopted in business. I advise honourable members to try to inform big business men and small' traders that the future of this country depends largely on a system of price control involving honest dealing. They should disseminate the doctrine of brotherhood, which is not to take unfair advantages of men, but to give service to the community.  has donned the cloak of an unctuous saint..",57
118,Mr LANE,Unknown,"I should not think that if the honourable member were regarded as a standard. If honourable members opposite wish to do their best for the country, they must emulate the Government, and tackle the avaricious profiteers, the men who want wealth only for themselves, in their own dens. When a man is able to make a profit, sufficient tosatisfy his own needs, that profit should be returned to the public in the formof"" lower prices or handed back to the State in order that social services may be rendered to those who most need them.",57
119,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,"Bass) [9.25] - I have listened with patience to the honourable member for Barton .(Mr Lane) and I wonder whether he would have us believe that his standard of morality is higher than the standard of others who have the honour to represent constituencies in this Parliament. In reply to references made by the honourable member to the ability of the Labour party to govern this country, I point out that we on this side of the House are willing to take our place when the people are prepared to entrust us with the reins of government. We are prepared to deal not only with price fixing but also with other matters which are in need of attention, but we shall never accept a position on the treasury benches as a minority party and stay there on the sufferance of those who occupy the cross benches. Some aspects of prices control affectparticularly the State of Tasmania; probably the most important is that question of shipping freights. A State occupying the insular position of Tasmania depends very largely for its prosperity on shipping freight rates. Obviously it is affected to a greater degree than any other State. Immediately on the outbreak of war, business men in Tasmania were informed by the interstate shipping - combine that freight rates would be increased by 20 per cent. The Government, through the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, gave immediate attention to the question, and its prompt action is worthy of commendation. I wish to be fair and give it credit where credit is due. We in Tasmania, however, are not satisfied that everything possible has been done to prevent unfair price increases that are now operating. I am indebted to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. John Lawson) for informing me of what has actually been done by the Government, and particularly by himself and the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, in regard to shipping freight rates. But, I am not satisfied that the increase of 10 per cent, now operating is justifiable, and I hope that the Commissioner will follow the matter up through the regulations now in force, in an endeavour to bring down freights to the lowest level consistent with allowing the shipping companies to make a reasonable profit. The immediate effect on prices in Tasmania has been fairly substantial, because most of the commodities come from the mainland, and therefore an increase of even 10 per cent, is considerably greater when the commodities reach the consuming public. In any event, those who desire to - exploit the community are given the opportunity to say that the increase of shipping freights is responsible for the additional charges imposed. That, I know, is being done. I direct attention to what happened as the result of increased freights during the last war. The value of the shares of the Adelaide Steamship Company rose from 21s. in August, 1914, to 46s. 6d. in August, 1919. The improvement in respect of the shares of Huddart Parker was 26s. 4-^d., the rise being from 22s. to 4Ss. 4^. Glancing down the dividends list, I find that in August, 1914, the dividend of the Adelaide Steamship Company was 6 per cent, and that of Huddart Parker o-J per cent. In 1915 the dividend rates were respectively 6 per cent, and 5 per cent.; in 1916 they were 8 per cent, and 7 per cent.; in 1917, 10 per cent, in each case; \a 1918, still 10 per cent, in each case; whilst in 1919, they reached the tremendous figures of 17£ per cent, and 11 per cent., respectively. I hope that the Government will take cognizance ;of what happened in those days, and will profit by that experience. There is no doubt that the shipping combine is. a very powerful one. The shipping companies do not act as separate units, but speak with one voice. It is said that trade unions speak with one voice. Even if they do, their voice is not nearly so effective as that which speaks for the combine to which I have referred. These facts are probably better known to the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner than they are to me. I hope that he is keeping a careful check on these very illuminating figures. It appears that the existing contracts for war risk insurance, at a rate of 2 per cent, for 91 days, will expire at the end of this month, and that new contracts will then be entered into. That information has been furnished to me by the Minister. I. am glad to know that snch is the case, because it seems that there is some possibility of a re-examination of the position, with a likely reduction of the 10 per cent, that is now operating. Immediately the war broke out, an increase of 20 per cent, was imposed, out of which the shipping companies obtained 10 per cent. The workers had not a similar experience in regard to their wages. So far as I know, applications for an increase of wages because of additional war risk, by sailors and ""others, have not yet been dealt with. Every fair-minded person will admit that some additional risk is run by seamen and others in the operation of the ships. The shipping companies have not a monopoly of the risks that are run; the men who work the ships are subject to the same risks. Then there is the matter of housing. I know that action has been taken by the Government for the fixing of house rents. Whilst that may have deterred certain landlords, we know that there are some who are ever ready to exploit the community in respect of house rents. Probably no section of the community is exploited to a greater degree than are tenants of houses. I could cite quite a number of cases in which this has been done, but shall content myself by mentioning only one case. It is that of a man who said to one who had been a good tenant of his for a number of years, that as from the 1st November his rent was to be raised by 5s. a week. That having been reported to me, I immediately made inquiry of the Deputy Prices Commissioner, who advised me that rents were fixed as at the level of the 31st August, and that they could not be interfered with until the 31st December. I do not think that the Government has given this matter as much publicity as might have been given to it. When this particular landlord was made acquainted with the position, he refrained from taking the action he had contemplated taking. That was only one case which came under my notice. The fact is, that there is a disposition on the part of landlords to exploit their tenants. "" Business as usual"" is their slogan, and they endeavour to get as much rent as they can from the tenants who occupy their houses. Mr Rama/rd. The Minister indicated to-night, by way of interjection during the speech of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), that up to date 160 items had been covered by price-fixing regulations. Although that is a fairly substantial list, I am yet inclined to think that the pace at which prices are being fixed has not been as rapid as it might have been. After all, 160 is not a tremendous number of commodities in view of the whole range of commodities that are sold to the public. I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that it is not so much the small storekeeper, as the warehouses and big businesses, that are responsible for exploitation. Information in this respect has been furnished to me by business men who have made purchases from warehouses in Flinders-lane, Melbourne. One man in particular informed me that he had no doubt that the goods were available, but he was told that they were not, and that he could have only a limited proportion of his requirements, and even those at an advanced price. Whilst I realise that it is difficult for the Government to obtain definite facts in relation to these matters, I consider that, when there is evidence of profiteering, an example should be made of the culprit, so that there might be a deterrent effect on others who might be similarly inclined. I believe that the Government is quite sincere in its efforts to tackle this problem; but it is a tremendously big problem, and must be tackled resolutely if the end desired is to be achieved. The Minister has said that it is important to control any increase of the cost of a basic service such as transport in Australia, because of the effect of such an increase on costs of production generally. I entirely agree with that; but the same principle applies, not only to that particular aspect, important though it is, but also to other aspects. Although the Minister takes some pride in the fact that 160 commodities have been covered, I urge him to press on with the task of covering the whole range of items in respect of which exploitation is possible and probable.",58
120,Mr JOHN LAWSON,Unknown,I point out that those 160 items may cover several thousand different lines.,59
121,Mr JENNINGS,Unknown,"They may relate 100,000 different lines.",60
122,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,"That puts a diiferent complexion on the matter. I cannot imagine, however, that the number would be 100,000"".",60
123,Mr JENNINGS,Unknown,"On e item alone covers 10,000 lines.",60
124,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,"If that be so, the Government is doing a better job than I had imagined. In regard to housing, I suggest to the Minister that wider publicity be given to what the Government has done and what the law provides, because I do not think that the people are aware that house rents have been fixed as at the level of the 31st August. I feel certain that there are cases in which exploitation is being practised. If the facts were more generally known, those landlords who desire to exploit might be deterred from doing so.",60
125,Mr JOHN LAWSON,Unknown,Powe r has been delegated to the States.,60
126,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,"I realise that. It was. the State Deputy Commissioner whom I approached with a view to obtaining information, when the matter was first raised. I believe that the Deputy Commissioner in Tasmania is doing a very good job. He is traversing the State, and endeavouring to place the position on - a satisfactory basis, with as little inconvenience as possible to the business community. Unlike the honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane), I consider that price fixing has to be tackled on broad lines, such as are advocated by the party to which I belong. That would be for the good of the community, and it certainly would be bad for certain persons who arc members of that state of society from which the honourable member for Barton obtains his support. Idealism, as it affects price-fixing, could be translated into actual reality by the party to which I belong, if it were given the opportunity to put its policy into operation. We should have no hesitation in dealing with these matters, not only during a state of emergency, but also in normal times This party considers it necessary so to extend the ramifications of government that life would be made happier and more prosperous for the people generally. to While giving the Government credit for what it has done, I have no hesitation in saying that if we were given the opportunity we would do better.",60
127,Mr RIORDAN,Unknown,"Kennedy) [9.45] --In common with other honourable members on this side of the House I anxiously awaited the statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr John Lawson) on the price-fixing regulations and their administration. We were told in September last that it was the intention of the Government to peg prices as from the 31st of August, and that the Government would ensure that no excess profits were made by traders, either wholesale or retail. On the 5th October regulations were issued for the purpose of carrying out the Government's proclaimed intention. It was obvious from the start that the regulations fell far short of the ideal, not so much in their wording, as in the arrangements made for their administration. The Government wanted to be able to say to the people that it would prevent the* making of excess profits; that it would avoid a repetition of what occurred during the period 1914-18. It is true that a price-fixing commissioner was appointed who was vested with certain powers, but, at the same time, there was instituted the averaging system for the regulation of prices, a system which has the effect, not of stabilizing prices, but of forcing them up. The Government conferred powers on the commissioner, and then took them away by instituting the system of averaging in regard to most commodities. The Minister made much of the fact that he had placed on the list 160 items. That is true, and the items may be seen in the various issues of the Commonwealth Gazette. There is, however, no mention in the Gazette of the price at which the commodities are to be sold in any particular place, but merely a bald statement to the effect that the Commissioner has decided that the prices ruling on a particular date should apply. In the Gazette published on Friday, the Sth September, there was a list of items, but only two or three of them had any bearing. on the cost of - living. The others concerned commodities used in the heavy industries, and were of interest to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, but not to the general public. Even now more than half of the items on the list do not affect the cost of living. The basic principle of price fixation is that it should benefit the greatest possible number of people. Apparently, however, the cost of living is a matter of secondary consideration to the Government. The Minister said that there had been unavoidable price increases. But we were told that prices would be pegged as from a certain date, namely the 31st of August. To-day, the Leader of the Country party (Mr Archie Cameron) said that second-hand cornsacks had risen enormously in price. That is a matter which does not directly affect the cost of living, but it is proof that the price-fixing regulations are not having the effect of stabilizing prices. Apparently the regulations do not provide a deterrent sufficiently powerful to prevent the charging of higher prices in respect of cornsacks, and what applies to cornsacks applies also to other things. The Minister said that it was the intention of the Government to protect the Australian consumers. That is the desire of the Opposition also. The consumers must be protected. In one statement the Minister said that there had been unavoidable price increases due to higher freights, &c. If freight charges are a determining factor in price, one would expect that commodities manufactured in Sydney or Melbourne, and transported to Brisbane by rail or sea, would sell in Brisbane at a higher price than in the place of their manufacture, but is not so. Queensland has for long enjoyed a lower cost of living than any other place in the Commonwealth, because, for the last 20 years, there has been a price fixing authority functioning in that, State. The Minister said that the price of kerosene, bicycles and paper had increased. Witb the exception of kerosene, these articles do not affect the cost of living. I am not concerned with the price of paper or bicycles, but I am concerned to keep down the cost of living. I shall be honest with the Minister. Before coming to Canberra recently, I consulted certain traders in Queensland, men whom I know personally, and asked them how the Commonwealth regulations would affect their prices. One man said in answer to my Mr Riordan. question, "" They'll do me. They have given me what I always wanted, an opportunity to fix my own prices without governmental interference."" That is what has happened as a result of the institution of this system of averaging. I know that price-fixing is a new departure as far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned, and I do not wish to be unduly critical I say to the Minister, however: if we are to have price-ifixing, let it be established on a proper basis from the beginning. . I do not know who drafted the regulations, but it appears obvious to me that he must have bad very little experience of price-fixing, otherwise he would not have provided for the discredited system of averaging. In 1920, when the Profiteering Prevention Act was passed in Queensland, a suggestion was made to the then price-fixing commissioner by interested traders that the averaging system should be adopted. He said to them, "" I have been empowered by the legislature to fix prices. That is my job, not yours."" It would appear that the regulations have been drafted in the interests of the traders, rather than of the general public. If that be so, it must be admitted that they are achieving their purpose. The Department of Trade and Customs in "" Prices Circular No. 2 ' r explains the operation of the Prices Regulations Order No. 2,. and it contains the following example of how the averaging system will work in respect of imported goods:STEP 1 Cost of old stock imported that prior to 31st August, 1939Quantity-1,20 0 dozen articlesInvoice value C.I.F. $1350.00 £ ,s. d.

Taking the old stock and the new stock, adding the two together, and dividing by two, we arrive at .the new selling price. f t is a vicious circle because, if this war continues, the prices will rise with every new arrival of stock. The process of averaging will go on and on and ever on until we find wage-fixing tribunals raising wages with wages chasing prices ever higher, not that wages will catch prices, because they never do. Thus the circumstances which the Government iseeking to obviate will inevitably come into being-the destruction of stable prices. There is no escape. There is a special provision for the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner to take action, but he will not do so, because the averaging system will be operating and he will say, "" That is the price which has been automatically arrived at through the system of averaging"". The system will permit of the exploitation of the whole of the populace. Then again, instead of there being a fixed price for a commodity throughout the trade, the price will vary from trader to trader, and the general public will be in no better position than it is at present. In Queensland one can go from shop to shop and find the same prices ruling in all because the State Commissioner of Prices fixes a maximum. Occasionally, you will find some traders selling articles £ s. d. at prices slightly lower than those charged .. 387 10 0 by their rivals, but there is a definite maximum. Under the averaging system 96 17 6 there is no fixed maximum; most of the .. 120 0 0 42 15 6 prices under the Commonwealth scheme 5 19 7 will be fixed, at the mere wish and whim of the trade, as a maximum price by the 2 8 5 commissioner. 635 11 0 If you are to have a Prices Commissioner, let him do the job. These existing 10s. 11.lid. regulations will inevitably smash stability of prices. It is only ten years since the economic depression, and if these £ e. d. regulations continue to operate we shall find ourselves in an even worse morass = 119 10 0 than that of 1929. = 655 11 0 Paragraph 11 of the Commonwealth regulations provides that776 1 0 Where the Commissioner is satisfiedla) that a body recognized by him as being representative of traders in or manufacturers of any particular goods has conducted an inquiry as to a reasonable price for those goods, and (6) that the price recommended by the body is a reasonable price for the sale of goods by wholesale or retail, as the case may be, the Commissioner may so declare, and thereupon, until the Commissioner otherwise orders, that price shall continue to be the maximum price for the sale of those goods by wholesale or retail, as the case may be. That provision is contrary to the provisions contained in section 7 of the Commonwealth Industries Preservation Act and Part III . of - the Queensland Profiteering Prevention Act of 1920. We have had experience of traders fixing prices, the oil companies for instance. It is reported in the press now that there is to be a rise by 6d. a gallon of the price of petrol, but we are told that the Government knows nothing whatever about it. The Brisbane Courier Mail of the 13th September, 1939, contained the following article:PETROL BACK TO OLD PRICE. RETAIL RISE STOPPED. From 4 p.m. on Monday until 11.15 a.m. yesterday motorists had to pay I d . a gallon more for their petrol. Prices are now back to their old level, following an order by the Commissioner of Prices (Mr E. E. Lindsey) thaj the retail rates must remain at those ruling on August 31. His order says that when wholesale prices are advanced retail prices will be increased automatically to the same extent. There is the Queensland Commissioner of Prices pegging prices at the level on the 31st August, under the State act. The article proceedsOil companies in Brisbane have not yet received advice of a rise in prices following the increase of Id. a gallon in the Customs duty. It was stated that two or three days might elapse before wholesale prices were changed. The president of the Garage and Service Stations' Association (Mr Luton J. White) said, yesterday that the price had been increased on Monday afternoon because the association received information from the Customs Department that an increase was authorized. Garage owners understood that they would be liable to pay the extra Id. a gallon duty immediately, and that it might be made retrospective to Saturday, when the Minister for Customs (Mr Lawson) signed the order authorizing the increase in Customs duty. There had been a misunderstanding Mr. White added and garage owners were pleased that the Commissioner of Prices had made the matter plain. They had no desire to increase prices unnecessarily. The honourable member for Barton Lane) said, "" I do not believe in price fixing. It is socialism"". me inform him that prevents exploitation. The Queensland commissioner prevented exploitation that occasion. The difficulty is, however, that the Commonwealth regulations override those of the State. I 'that the authority of the land commissioner will be gone in respect of all commodities in the Commonwealth Gazette. fixing of prices will be placed in the hands of the traders through the averaging system. What is the reason for this averaging system? It may be suggested by those who favour that system the Commonwealth cannot do what is done in Queensland because the Queensland legislation affects only retail prices. That is so, but that is because of the operation of section 92 of the Commonwealth institution. Even if the Queensland Commissioner wanted to fix the prices of wholesale commodities, he would have difficulty in doing so, because he 3lr. Riordan. could not fix the wholesale.price of any commodity that was brought from another State. That has been established by the High Court in the MCA r t h ur ease. In Queensland the wholesaler knows what the retailer will receive and he charges accordingly. Section 92 of the Constitution would not prevent the Commonwealth from 'fixing wholesale prices. To cite an instance of a commodity the prices for which cover a wide range, I instance electric light globes. The wattage of electric light globes covers a wide range and there is a great variety of brands. Perhaps the Commonwealth authorities will say that it is difficult to fix the price of electric light globes, because of that great variety of powers and makes. The result will be different prices in different towns. The Commonwealth price fixer has fixed the price of bread and sugar in two centres. Why not fix all prices in all centres ? Why not empower the Deputy Prices Commissioner in each State to fix the price for each State just as the Commissioner of Prices in Queensland fixes prices in Queensland and, by preventing exploitation, gives to the people of that State the lowest cost of (Mr living of all States. The fact that the Commonwealth regulations will overBut let ride the State price-fixing law in respect price-fixing of at least certain - commodities will mean that the Queensland people will on find their cost of livin g rising steeply. My suggestion is that the price-fixing authority in each State should be given foresee full power. Give the Queensland ComQueens- missioner of Prices the same powers that he had before these regulations and let proclaimed him do the price-fixing for QueensThe land. He is doing a good job and has the respect of the public and the traders. Why should his powers be overridden and the people of Queensland thrown to the wolves? I that have briefly referred to the Queensland Act. I commend it as the model which should be used for the Commonwealth. The act has been in operation for 20 years and has given general satisfaction. Under it the Commissioner of Prices has the widest possible powers. He can do what he likes, and from his decision there is no appeal. It may be autocratic power, but up to the present it has been exercised in the interests of the general public. Part III . of the Profiteering Prevention Act of Queensland prohibits the making of agreements for the fixation of prices. Prices may be fixed only by the Commissioner. The policing of the fixed prices is effective. The work is done, first of all, by the general public. Keen shoppers know what they should pay for particular articles j and if higher prices are charged, they naturally report the matter to the Commissioner of Prices. In distant towns, members of the Police Force, at the request of the Commissioner, supply lists of commodities and the prices charged for them at the local stores. These are examined by the Commissioner, and any necessary action is taken by him. In addition, shop and factory inspectors are employed to police the fixed prices. If the Commonwealth price-fixing legislation is to be policed like the awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, it will be a poor look-out for the general community. The Queensland Commissioner of Prices has been able to prevent abuses. Possibly the people of Queensland have been fortunate in the appointments to this office. At any rate, the act has been administered sympathetically and it has worked smoothly. It has prevented profiteering and the exploitation of the public, and has given the people of Queensland the lowest cost of living. The chief objective of the Commissioner at all times has been to control retail prices. He has been particularly concerned with the price of such staple articles as bread, meat and milk, and has maintained a continuous check on them. Moreover, nothing has been attempted by the Commissioner which has been against the interests of the primary producers. Bread distributors and also the distributors of other commodities have from time to time applied to the Commissioner for increases of prices, but their applications have been rejected when the Commissioner has ascertained, by investigation, that increases of prices have not been justified. Undoubtedly the cost of living has been kept in check in Queensland. The annual report of the Commissioner of Prices for Queensland for the year ended the 30th June, 1939, states that;Investigations were also made during the year respecting the charges for firewood, ice, chemists' dispensing fees, funeral charges, bricks, cement, galvanised iron, building materials, timber, fruit cases, coke, and various other commodities. These items are all of vital importance to the general public. Another matter of consequence is that the cost of administering the act for the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1939, was only £1,539 14s. l i d . So that for the expenditure of a little more than £1,500 the general public of Queensland was saved many thousands of pounds. I commend the Queensland Act to the Minister and his advisers and suggest that it be adopted for Commonwealth purposes. The success of this legislation in Queensland has been due in no small measure, perhaps, to the fortunate selection of the officers who have administered it . The fullest legal power is given to the officers of the department to carry to a successful conclusion whatever they put their hand to, and the department has never over-realshed itself. The act has clipped the wings of the profiteers. The prestige and authority of the Commissioner are high. I consider that the Commonwealth could not do better than apply the Queensland system, with suitable minor variations, to Commonwealth needs. If this be done, stability will be achieved, confusion will be avoided, the prices of commodities will be effectively controlled, and the brake will be applied to those whose actions might otherwise increase 'the army of unemployed in this country.",60
128,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Richmond) [10.21]. - Fro m the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) it might 'be assumed that Queensland is a modern Utopia, and a "" haven of the blest"". The moving story which the honourable member told us, however, does not square with the facts, as indicated by the Commonwealth Statistician's figures. According to the Year-Booh for 1937, the index figure for Brisbane for the December quarter of 1936 was 1431, while that for Broken Hill, which is regarded as a fairly expensive place in which to live, was 1423.",64
129,Mr RIORDAN,Unknown,What was the figure for Sydney?,65
130,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"It is 1542, which, it is true, is higher than Brisbane; but as one who lives near the border of Queensland in northern New South Wales, I am well aware that the traders in my area buy the bulk of their requirements from Sydney. Although this involves several hundred miles of additional transportation as against purchases in Queensland, the traders prefer.to buy in Sydney as it is a better market. However, I did not rise merely to refute the view of the honourable member for Kennedy that all the virtues of the world reside in the government led iby the Honourable W. Eorgan Smith. My main purpose was to commend the Commonwealth Government for what it has done to control prices. how effective this work will ultimately prove to be remains to be seen, but the necessity for action along these lines must be apparent to everybody. It is essential, from the point of view of primary industries, that the cost of living shall not be permitted to rise beyond the limit of the increased price of imported commodities. The prices of butter,, wool, meat, cheese and other Australian export commodities has been fixed for twelve months. It cannot be varied from day to day, or month to month. If the internal cost of living rises within the twelve-months period for which the price of our export commodities has been fixed, it will be very greatly to the disadvantage of the primary producers and will undoubtedly lead to an agitation for an increase of the price of their commodities-payable by the Government of the United Kingdom. The last thing that the primary producers of Australia wish to do is to make it harder than necessary for the British Government to carry on the war. Britain is fighting this war with all its resources of men and money, and possibly the best contribution Australia can make is to bleed Great Britain as little as possible. If the Government's price-fixing machinery works well, we ought not to encounter very great difficulties in the maintenance of our own economic status. I feel sure that the primary producers of my own district, and in fact, throughout Australia, will not press for higher prices than are absolutely necessary to enable them to meet thpir own difficulties in consequence of the inoi eased prices of the things they need. Despite everything that we may do, some increases of price are certain when the warehouses dispose of the stocks they at present hold and have to replace their goods at higher prices. The Government should, however, do its utmost to see that nobody profits unduly through the war. One matter that may possibly be overlooked by the Government should be brought under notice. I refer to fertilizers, which are used in very great quantities in Australia. According to the Year-Booh to which I have already referred, Australia fertilized 18,000,000 acres of land in 1936, and used 820,000 tons of artificial manures for the purpose. Just It is consequently of great importance that the price of fertilizers should be carefully watched, and that prices should be fixed for the next twelve months. A point that requires particular attention is the price of potash. This is an important product and it is very difficult to ascertain, at present, whether the fertilizers companies intend to charge for it on the basis of present or new supplies. I direct the Minister's attention to this matter because it is of great importance in view of the large quantity of fertilizers used and the vast acreage to which they are applied. Another matter with which I propose to deal briefly is 'the establishment of a board to control the prices of hides and skins. I have been at some pains to ascertain the full facts in relation to the establishment of this board, and I am not satisfied that justice has been done. I have ascertained from the Minister for Commerce (Senator MCLeay) that the personnel of the board consists of seven gentlemen, three of whom come from Sydney, three from Melbourne, and one from Brisbane. The last-mentioned has been appointed to act merely in an advisory capacity and has no vote. Although Australia produces for export about 1,000,000 cattle skins valued at over £1,000,000, and about 750,000 calf skins, only one representative of the producers has been appointed to the board. This is one of the Victorian representatives about whom I do not know very much other than that I understand he is a well-qualified man. But Victoria is not one of the great hides-exporting States. No representative of the producing interests has been appointed from New South Wales, which is a large producing State, nor are the Queensland producers represented, although that State is also a large producer of hides. In fairness I must say that a representative of Queensland in the person of Mr Burke was offered a position on the board, but found it impracticable to accept it. Mr Armstrong, the sole Queensland representative, is to act purely in an advisory capacity, and, as I have already said, is to have no vote. Western Australia and South Australia have no representatives at all, although it must be admitted that they are comparatively small exporters of hides and skins. Practically the whole of the representation on this board, which I regard as one of the most important from theprimary producers' point of view, is centred in hidebrokers, merchants and exporters, master tanners, leather manufacturers and leather and footwear manufacturers. Four of the members of the board are of the designations I have mentioned. I raised this matter before the appointment of the board in the hope that the claims of a representative of the producers' organizations in Queensland would have received consideration. I understand that consideration was given to the claims of one gentleman, but he was not appointed. That was the very courteous official reply which I received. The question has been raised as to whether it is necessary to have this board at all, because the price of hides and skins is determined, not by the local market, but by the markets of the United States of America, Great Britain, and the Continent, if there is any market there now, and Great Britain alone has been in the habit of taking straight-out a half-million cattle skins. I feel that the Government could have controlled the prices of hides and skins without setting up such a board as this. I trust that the Minister will look into some of the matters which I have mentioned in order to ascertain for himself what the actual position is. I do not intend to deal with any other subject; I realise that) the ground has been fully covered by other speakers. I conclude by saying that I endorse the action of the Government in endeavouring to control prices. I believe that it is making a sincere effort to do something in this regard. I believe also that great control of prices will he exercised by the moral effect on traders and retailers throughout Australia of the knowledge that the Government possesses the power to take disciplinary action should it be called for. This will, I think, achieve more than the board's actual work; but notwithstanding that, there are many avenues in which the board could do good work. I believe that it is doing its work conscientiously. Debate (on motion by Mr JAMES) adjourned. PAPERS.

Is it a fact that the surrender value of a life assurance policy is considered, under the Invalid and Old-ago Pensions Act, as property, and deducted from the pension rate of an old age pensioner who holds a policy? 2. If so, is it a fax on the t h r if t of a pensioner who gains no monetary assistance from such a provision, and makes regular premium payments on his policy out of his depleted allowance? ; i . Will he therefore consider the advisability of amending the act so that pensioners holding life policies shall not have deductions made from their allowances on that account?",66
132,Sir FREDERICKSTEWART,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are fully as f o l l o w s : 1. The surrender value of an insurance is regarded, for the purposes of the Invalid und Old-age Pensions Act as property and is subject to the provisions of the act relating thereto. 2. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions provides that all real and personal property owned by any person shall be deemed to be his accumulated property. An insurance policy bility. may be realized at will or used as security for obtaining a loan and the person insured is therefore practically in the same position as if lie owned real estate, bonds or shares. 3.

141,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"On the 1 6 t h No v e m be r , the honourable member for G r if f it h (Mr . Conelan) asked the following question, without notice:On the 24th October bust, the Commonwealth Public Service authorities held Examination No. 2232 for clerks in the Third Division. Two hours were allowed for the arithmetic paper. Problem (c) in part 1 was impossible of solution. Can the Prime Minister state whether it is the intention of the Public Service Commissioner to disallow that problem, or to allocate marks to those who attempted a solution? I am advised by the Public Service Board that question No. 1 of the arithmetic paper for Commonwealth Public Service Examination No. 2232 was in three parts, one part of which was stated as"" (c) Find three consecutive numbers whose product is 21,914."" The product should have been shown in the question as 21,924. The examiner (who is not an officer of the Commonwealth Service) intends to give for parts (a) and (&) of question No. 1 the credit which he would normally have given for the three parts. Consequently no candidate will fail who would have passed but for the error which occurred in the setting of part (c) of the question. ROYA L AUSTRALIA NAIR FORCE: STA FF HOUSING ARRANGEMENTS - INSTRUCTORS' RATES OF PAY - RECRUITS .",68
142,Mr STREET,Unknown,"On the 16th November, the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) asked the following question, without notice:Cun the Minister for the Army inform the House of the reason why the most fashionable part of Sydney, where property is the most costly, has been acquired for the housing of the heads of the Royal Australian Air Force? What reason actuated the choice, which will mean extra cost? I am now in a position to. in f o rm the honourable member that the property was not selected on account of its location, but because of its general suitability for the temporary housing of a head-quarters unit as regards floor area and facilities for guarding the important documents which will be held there. Many properties were inspected in other parts of Sydney, but the Point Piper property was considered the most suitable. The rental to be paid compares favourably with that of other less satisfactory properties.",69
143,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"On the 16th November, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr . Conelan) asked the following question, without notice:Ts it a fact that the rate of pay of the recently-appointed instructors of the Royal Australian Air Force has been reduced to 14s. a day from 23s. Od. a day, which rate is paid to members of - the permanent Royal Australian Air Force, many of whom will be trained by these instructors? I am now.in a position to inform the honourable member that the 45 instructors undergoing the instructors' course, which commenced on the 16th October, 1939, were appointed to the rank of pilot officer and are paid at permanent A i r Force rates, viz., 18s. I d . per diem active pay plus lodging, fuel, light and ration allowance (or issues in k in d ), totalling 6s. 3d. per diem if married and 4s. 9d. per diem if single. All instructors appointed subsequent to the 16th October, 1939, will receive the special force rates of pay, & c , of a pilot officer, viz., active pay 16s. per diem, and free single quarters, fuel, light and rations. In addition, separation allowances of 3s. per diem for wife and Is. for each child under sixteen years of age are payable in the case of those married. At the outbreak of war 50 cadets were undergoing training for commissions in the Royal Australian A i r Force. Those cadets on graduation will receive shortservice commissions in the permanent A i r Force. Some of them will probably undergo certain intermediate or advanced training by the instructors receiving special force rates. All other cadets trained during the war will, however, be paid special force rates on graduation and appointment to officer ranks. On the 16th November, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Frost) asked whether residents of New Guinea were debarred from entering the A i r Force, and also whether persons were debarred because they have bad malaria. I have ascertained that the position is as follows:1. Residents of Now Guinea are eligible for enlistment in the Air Force. 2. (a) Flying Ranks - Chroni c malaria is a eau.se of rejection, aud in other cases of malaria there sliould be a history of freedom from attacks for six months before acceptance, blood films must be negative to malaria! parasites and there must be no splenic enlargement or evidence of anaemia. (6) Other Ranks - A recruit who has becu free from any suspicion of un attack ot malaria for twelve months, and is otherwise lit, may he accepted, provided that there is no evidence of enlargement of the liver or spleen or sign of anaemia.

If not, will such a dote be fixed as to ensure that university students will be able to carry out their Militia training during the university vacation? I am now in a position to in for m the honourable member that these camps are being carried out in two series, the first commencing about the middle of January and the second about the 1st A p r i l , 1940. The exact dates for the commencement of the various unit and formation camps a re being arranged by commands and will shortly be promulgated to all units.

146,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"On the 17th November the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . James) asked the following question, without notice I ask the Prime Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Defence Co-ordination, whether ho docs not think that it would tend to stimulate patriotic effort, if the defence expenditure of the Commonwealth were more generally spread over the whole of Australia, instead of being concentrated largely in Victoria; and whether he docs not think that some of the expenditure should be allocated to devastated areas where unemployment has prevailed for a groat number of years, particularly those areas which the right honourable gentleman visited recently and concerning which he indicated that he would attempt to do something to'relievo the prevailing distress? As promised, I have discussed the honourable member's suggestion with my colleagues and now desire to inform him that the locations of the Defence Forces and establishments are governed by strategical considerations, by the distribution of population, which is the source of man.. 73 power for the forces, and in the case of .. 30 munitions factories, by their proximity .. 52 to supplies of labour and raw materials. .. 33 The defence of any part of Australia must .. 27 be considered an integral part of the gene1 ral scheme of defence for the whole of Australia, and in developing the framework of the genera] defence scheme, the organization and disposition of the forces Novem- must be carried out with due regard to strategy and the necessity for defending vital centres from attack. The statistical record of the expenditure by States does not necessarily represent the distribution of the economic benefits of such expenditure. For example, payments in Victoria for metal supplies may originally have been largely disbursed in South Australia, Tasmania and New South ""Wales. The factors I have mentioned should be taken into account in making any comparison of the expenditure in the various States, for the Government's efforts must be directed towards providing the most effective defence possible with the funds aud. t'^jSi'oee, available. As regards the allocation of funds to the areas mentioned by the honourable member, it is pointed out that with a view to alleviating distress in the Newcastle area the following proposals have recently been approved:Railways- £ JJotween Tocuniwal-NcwcastJc via Griffith-Stm-kiiigbal ParkesDubbo-Wenis Creek .. 42,080 between WallttngHrra-Nencastle .. 10,180 Hoads, drainage, Si* Allandale 00,000 Stockton .. 35,000 West Maitland ] Waratah [approx. 4,000 East Maitland J AerodromesRathmines 20,000 RAAF. Station, KatliminesWorks to be carried out by day labour 40,000 The-expenditure of money on the works mentioned should do much to relievo the position, and the claims of the affected areas will he borne in .mind if and when further defence proposals are being considered. AIB ACCIDENT.",71
147,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"On the 17th November, the honourable member for Eichmond (Mr. Anthony) asked for information concerning an accident to a Douglas aircraft.
