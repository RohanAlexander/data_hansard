3,Mr HAWKE ,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"Wills-Prime Minister) (8.02)- Mr Chairman, I propose Robert Francis MCMullan as the choice of the Senate and the House of Representatives sitting together to be the person to hold the place in the Senate rendered vacant by the resignation of Senator the Hon. Susan Maree Ryan. Mr MCMullan has indicated that he is willing to hold the vacant place if chosen. That is the last of my surprises for the evening. I am informed that Mr MCMullan is eligible to be chosen for the Senate-that has its own significance-and that the nomination is in accordance with sub-section 44 (3) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Bob MCMullan has been endorsed by the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) to fill the vacancy created by Susan Ryan's retirement. He is particularly well qualified for the task as Susan Ryan's successor. He is a person of demonstrated capacity, integrity and energy. Bob has given many years of service to the Australian Labor Party, being a member since 1969. In his youth, Bob was prominent in his native State of Western Australia in the campaign against conscription and the Vietnam war. He was, in fact, the first person in Western Australia to establish through the courts his conscientious objection to conscription on the basis of political principle rather than religious principle. Bob MCMullan is well known to all in this Parliament for his long and professional service to the Australian Labor Party, most notably as National Secretary for the last eight years. His tenure has coincided with the unfolding of the period of the ALP's greatest political and electoral success. Bob's contribution to this success has been invaluable-in his role as national campaign director, in modernising the machinery of our great Party, and in his advice in the development of relevant and progressive policies. A monument to Bob's tenure as National Secretary is the substantially enhanced status and role of women in the forums of the ALP. Bob MCMullan has been a resident of the Australian Capital Territory since 1980 and has been as active in local community affairs as his heavy party responsibilities would allow. The great respect which Bob is held in my Party and in the community at large was demonstrated by his endorsement for this vacancy by the members of the ACT branch. I have no doubt that Bob MCMullan will undertake his duties as a senator for the ACT with the same professionalism, dedication and enthusiasm as he brought to his work as National Secretary. Mr Chairman, I wholeheartedly commend to this Joint Sitting of Parliament Bob MCMullan's nomination as ACT senator and I look forward to the valuable contributions he will undoubtedly make to the Parliament and to my Government.",65
4,The CHAIRMAN,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,Is the proposal seconded?,66
5,Senator BUTTON ,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"Victoria-Leader of the Government in the Senate) (8.05)-I am privileged to second the nomination of Mr Robert MCMullan. I am very confident that he will bring to the Senate considerable experience and talent, and he is a valuable addition to the Government in the Senate. As to Mr MCMullan's history and career, I fully endorse the remarks of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke). I have nothing to add because, as is 'Yell known, we always agree. In those circumstances, Mr Chairman, I am happy to commend Mr MCMullan to the Joint Sitting.",66
6,The CHAIRMAN,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,Is there any further proposal of a person to hold the vacant place in the Senate?,66
7,Mr HOWARD ,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"Bennelong-Leader of the Opposition) (8.07)- Mr Chairman, the Liberal and National parties will not be proposing a candidate to fill this vacancy. As the vacancy arises in terms of section 15 of the Constitution and the person whose vacancy is being filled was a member of the Australian Labor Party and the person proposed by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) is also a member of the Australian Labor Party, it is appropriate that that person be elected by this Joint Sitting to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Senator Ryan. I would like to take the opportunity to say one or two things about Mr MCMullan, as he is the only nomination. I listened with great interest to what the Prime Minister said about the person who until recently was National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. I think it is fair to say on behalf of everybody in this chamber that, whatever our political leanings may be, Mr MCMullan brought very special professional skills to the job that he discharged. I was interested to hear the Prime Minister talk about the contribution that Mr MCMullan has made to the with Australian Labor Party and the views that he holds on a variety of subjects. I must say I was disappointed that the Prime Minister omitted reference to one or two of Mr MCMullan's undoubted capacities. The first of those is his capacity to know the right account in which to put a campaign donation. There is no doubt that he would know the difference between a campaign donation and a maintenance donation. He would know that better than anybody else. I was also very disappointed that the Prime Minister failed to make any reference at all to the very considerable contribution that Mr MCMullan has made to the intellectual debate in Australian politics about the damage done to political parties by factionalism. He has made a very interesting contribution. We had a perfect example of this, an absolutely exquisite demonstration, in the Caucus room yesterday. We had a contest between the honourable member for Kingston ( Mr Bilney) and Senator Bolkus. On every criterion, the person who now seeks to interject, the Prime Minister, should have been supporting the honourable member for Kingston. If he had been following the advice of the man whom he has now proposed to the Senate he would have supported the honourable member for Kingston, but instead of that he went ahead and supported somebody who has opposed just about every position the Prime Minister has taken on major foreign policy issues in his Government and he supported a person whom, according to the dictates of his own principles, he should have opposed. I think it is poetic justice indeed that the very warning that Mr MCMullan sounded about factionalism in the Australian Labor Party was perfectly played out yesterday with the Prime Minister putting up his hand because of a factional deal for the left wing Senator Bolkus against the far more responsible and far more praiseworthy honourable member for Kingston, Mr Gordon Bilney. I say it is absolutely disgraceful that that is the case. We do welcome Mr MCMullan and we hope that when he comes to this Parliament he will carry that same independence and fervour of conviction to the debates that he brings to the Caucus meetings.",66
8,Mr SINCLAIR ,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"New England-Leader of the EmptyHere dent, Madam Speaker, senators and colleagues, those of us who sit within the conservative parties in the Parliament regard the Senate as the States House. We see within this chamber an opportunity for protecting and preserving the quality of administration that is necessary in governing a highly indebted country such as Australia. We see in this place an opportunity for the smaller States to be able to present their point of view and articulate their concerns. It is on the basis of our concern, therefore, for the traditions of the place and our intention to maintain the quality of the Parliament that neither the National Party of Australia nor the Liberal Party of Australia will be nominating for the vacancy which is about to be filled. However, I EmptyHere Madam Speaker, to advise honourable members and senators that when the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) first spoke to the House of Representatives on the changes to administrative arrangements he told it that he was intent upon increasing the responsiveness of the bureaucracy to the Government's wishes and upon increasing democratic accountability through Ministers to Parliament and the community. He then continued: Portfolio Ministers are ultimately responsible for the administration of their entire portfolios and will be accountable to the Parliament for the overall operation of their portfolios. EmptyHere me that in the administration of the Parliament the Australian Labor Party-certainly under Bob Hawke-is no longer following those principles. We trust that with the appointment of an apparatchik such as Senator-to-be MCMullan, who comes from the organisation, who has demonstrated a skill that I am quite sure would never have led the former member for Port Adelaide into the problems that have beset him, there might well be in this place henceforward a tendency to accept the responsibilities that there should be from a government that is no longer divided. We all recall the election policy pledge of the Prime Minister on 23 June. He said, 'We come before you as one united team-the one united team in which there will be in the Ministry three Queenslanders, three women and a Tasmanian'. It was a united team in which the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) said, 'I am not going to be shuffled aside just so they can dispense patronage to their mates'; within which the honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Gayler) said, 'There is a very simple flaw in the whole equation and that is that ability and accomplishment are just disregarded, in some cases almost totally disregarded'. EmptyHere Madam Speaker, that in the course of the last little while we have seen an acceleration of ministerial resignations. Senator Gietzelt, the former Senator Grimes, Mr Hurford, the honourable member for Robertson, the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown), the former Leader of the House and Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and member for Port Adelaide, the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes), Senator Ryan and, of course, the father of the House, Mr Tom Uren, the honourable member for Reid, have resigned from the Ministry. A number of other Ministers should have gone-Senator Gareth Evans, Senator Walsh, the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), the former Minister for Transport and Infrastructure Support and the former Minister for Transport. Of course, today the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) demonstrated that he no longer is entitled to hold a portfolio. The point is that today's Labor Caucus is a constant grubby and greedy factional battleground. It is a contest of crude ambition, steeled by the knives of the Party piranhas. Government members fight amongst themselves to stay in power. Their policies are the figments of muzzled backroom deals and currying Favour with the unions. There is no doubt that the currying for favour with the unions and their powerful mates is symptomatic of where the Government is today. Unfortunately, the losers are the Australian people. Within this chamber we wish the about-to-be senator well but we say to him that his responsibilities in this chamber will be onerous indeed in that little time Labor remains in government.",67
9,Senator CHANEY ,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"Western AustraliaLeader of the Opposition in the Senate) (8.17)Mr Chairman, senators and members, I wish to strike a slightly discordant note in supporting my Leader, Mr Howard, and the Leader of the National Party of Australia in the House of Representatives, Mr Sinclair, by welcoming Bob MCMullan to the Senate. I do that because he is a fellow Western Australian. Whilst to the people of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) he may be a carpetbagger, to me he is one of ours. As far as I am concerned, a good Western Australian is the best option if we have to have a Labor senator. This induction of a new senator is taking place on a day when we woke up and listened to Mr Unsworth on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation making what sounded like a speech written by Barrie Unsworth rather than a speech written by somebody called Freudenberg. I am quite sure that many of the honourable senators and members opposite were listening to Mr Unsworth and his statements about the state of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the attitude that the New South Wales Labor Party will be taking in the lead-up to the election. This is a day on which the criticisms which have been made by the Opposition of the Hawke Labor Government are as nothing when compared with the criticisms which have been made by members of the Australian Labor Party and Mr Unsworth in particular. I remind honourable senators and members that Mr Unsworth last night-it was broadcast today-was saying that there was a clear message that the ALP had to work for the people again. I quote: The Labor Party, at all levels, must be perceived just as the true government of the people but the true voice of the people . . . And we can only be their voice if we . . . listen to their voice. I think the significance of the nomination of Mr Bob MCMullan to this Senate place for the ACT is that he is just the latest in a series of ALP bureaucrats who have been put into the Senate as if it is some form of retirement home. 1I have to say that when we copped Graham Richardson we thought that was pretty tough but then we got Michael Beahan and Senator Schacht. He actually wore a tie on television the other day before the selection of a Minister. I remind the chamber that we have had four Labor Party apparatchiks coming into this place to match the 27 trade union leaders who have been put into the Parliament over recent years. If the people of Australia are wondering why the Australian Labor Party is out of touch with them they should look at the composition of the Labor side of this Parliament, because it is made up of union bureaucrats and trade union leaders who, on recent surveys, are the least trusted people in Australia. That is the sad statistical fact that it must put up with. All I can say is that, whilst it continues to make this Parliament unrepresentative by filling it with such a disproportionate number of trade union and Labor Party apparatchiks, it will continue to lose touch with the men and women of Australia, who know that it does not represent their interests. It represents the interests of its own bureaucracies and its own narrow membership. We have just had a by-election in South Australia. In that by-election Labor tried to put another trade unionist into Parliament. It was defeated in that by-election. That, I believe, is the pattern which demonstrates the unwisdom of the Labor Party closing off this Parliament from the people of Australia in the way that it has. Whilst I acknowledge the very considerable professional achievements of Mr MCMullan and whilst I, as a Western Australian, welcome him to this place to represent the Australian Capital Territory, I also say that I think it is time that the Labor Party realised that its failure to do other than look after its own is one of the reasons why it is widely being despised by its own. There is no suggestion that these people are making Australia safer for democracy, but they are making it very safe for themselves.",67
10,The CHAIRMAN,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"Order! The honourable senator's time has expired. EmptyHere as Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I cannot not but follow the temptation of the theme that was put down by Senator Chaney, particularly as I see opposite, together, those two graphic blobs of protoplasm who are the functional operatives, to be joined in this House by yet another kneecapper. If Senator Chaney is right in striking the theme that these operators are being brought into control the mendacious lot that sit opposite, 1 can also strike the theme that he struck before when he talked about Mick's by-election. It is an auspicious day for Senator MCMullan, as he will be, to come into this chamber-the day on which we have sworn in the Liberal member for Adelaide. Senator Richardson-Do you think you will win over the waverers, Andrew? EmptyHere tor Richardson to interject. He really was oneupped. He travelled around the country saying that he had a vision for conservation, but Mick one-upped him with his $10,000 vision. As for attending the Press conference to help his little mate because he felt sorry for him, God knows what will happen to the rest of them. The third theme that Senator Chaney struck was that of battling Barrie Unsworth in New South Wales. On the day that we see Senatorelect MCMullan come into this chamber-to pick up Senator Chaney's theme of battling Barrie-I note that Unsworth actually asked, on this historic day, for a fair go. I thought we would meet him halfway: we will be fair to him and he can go. The reality is that the Opposition not opposing Senator MCMullan's nomination but it is pointing out, as Senator Chaney so correctly nailed, the increasing number of paid operators, the movers of the pawns in the chess game, who are coming into this chamber and, indeed, the trade union officials-for example, the one nominated in the Adelaide by-election. I wish Senator MCMullan well, but we are sworn and duty bound to seek his removal at the next election. That may well be sooner than many think. Where is Paul? Is he here? Leaving that to one side, we have no opposition to MCMullan, but give a reminder of the way in which the Australian Labor Party is changing. I will not go over what Kim Beazley Snr said, but a few members ought to look around to see the changing nature of this once great Party at the commencement of its demise.",68

I hope he does not think that the behaviour exhibited here tonight is any indication of the normal proceedfrom ings of the Senate. The attendance of members from the House of Representatives has turned it into much more of a zoo than it normally is. I assure him that under normal circumstances the place operates in a much more decorous fashion. Senator Chaney commented that it is unfortunate that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) is putting in so many trade union officials because this particular group of people is not well garded in the community.

19,Senator HAINES,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"In the main, when the electorate is asked what it thinks of certain professions and occupations, it tends to place is politicians somewhere between pimps and purse snatchers. So I suspect that in any event trade unionists are not treated much worse, in the community's estimate, than we are. Mr MCMullan is following a very competent and tough senator who represented the Australian Capital Territory. As a Minister she was exemplary in the attention that she paid to her portfolio-often, and ultimately, to her cost. Sue Ryan was tough enough, honest enough and concerned enough about the portfolio of education to do herself a great deal of damage by bucking the party system. Senator Wood- Mr Chairman, I raise a point of order.",69
20,The CHAIRMAN,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"Order! Senator Haines, there is a point of order from Senator Wood. Senator WoodWould you, Mr Chairman, call the right honourable member for New England to order. I cannot hear Senator Haines's speech.",69
21,The CHAIRMAN,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,Order! I call for silence on both sides so that Senator Haines can be heard.,69
22,Senator HAINES,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"I must say that Senator Wood-if indeed that is what he still is-is gamer than I in taking a point of order. I had contemplated doing so when the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) was reading his speech of nomination. Of course, that is against Standing Orders in the Senate. In any event, I chose to be somewhat more diplomatic. As I was saying, Senator Ryan was a tough and competent Minister who lost a lot of points in the Labor Party by bucking the system with regard to tertiary fees in a portfolio that she held dear. More importantly, her toughness is made apparent by the fact that of all members and senators who have recently retired this place she was the only one with the capacity, the ability and the guts to find herself another job-and in the private sector. Everybody else who has recently left this place, from either side of the chamber, has had to be placed in a government position. The former member for Boothby, Mr MCLeay, was sent by the Liberal· Party as Consul-General to Los Anre- geles-which makes something of a mockery of the Liberal Party's criticisms of Chris Hurford, who went as Consul-General to New York. He is soon to be followed by Mr MCVeigh, as Queensland's Agent-General to London, and was preceded by two eminent ex-senators, Doug MCClelland and Don Grimes, who were given ambassadorial positions. So I say to Sue Ryan what I used to say to her here: You did a good job, you will continue to do a good job, and good luck.",69

In accordance with the rules, I now declare the Joint Sitting closed. Joint Sitting concluded at 8.31 p.m. House of Representatives sitting resumed at NA NA Madam SPEAKER,--I inform the House that, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, at a joint sitting held in the Senate chamber at 8 p.m. today, Robert Francis MCMullan was chosen to hold the place in the Senate rendered vacant by the resignation of the Hon. Susan Maree Ryan, a senator for the Australian Capital Territory. CHILD SUPPORT BILL 1987 Second Reading Debate resumed.",70
25,Mr BLANCHARD ,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Moore) (8.41)-I rise in support of the Child Support Bill 1987. There is undoubtedly a fairly wide degree of agreement in this House that Australia's current system of child maintenance is in need of reform. It is a sensitive area which should be dealt with in a sensitive way. There were a number of excellent speeches in this House earlier today from both sides. The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Connolly), for example, made what I felt to be a constructive contribution to the debate. Whilst I can understand his and the Opposition's concern about voluntary maintenance agreements, I refer him and the Opposition to sub-clause 23 (3) of the Bill, which goes to the heart of the problems the Opposition has in respect of the Bill. It is possible for certain payees effectively to opt out of the collection of their registerable maintenance liabilities. It seems to be of concern to the Opposition that there is no way to opt out. Sub-clause 23 (3) provides the technical mechanism by which a payee may opt out of the scheme. Basically, a payee need not complete the form required by sub-clause 23 (2) if the payee elects within the 14-day period mentioned in that sub-clause to have the liability enforced under the Bill. However, one proviso attaches to this opting out arrangement. It relates to those in receipt of an income-tested pension, allowance or benefit. So I say to the Opposition that its amendment is not worth the paper it is printed on. We are trying to get to the heart of the matter and to deal with the Opposition's concern. In 1980 the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act recommended that an agency to collect and enforce maintenance payments be set up along the lines of agencies already operating in South Australia and my own State of Western Australia. Four years later a report of the Attorney-General's 8.40 p.m. Department made detailed recommendations for a national maintenance agency to assist parties to obtain maintenance, to collect it and to take action against defaulters. Unfortunately, neither the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee nor those of the Attorney-General's Department addressed the inadequacy of the current levels of maintenance. The Government, in examining these reports, concluded that it was not cost-effective to set up an independent agency to collect and enforce maintenance payments unless there was some change in how those payments were assessed in the first place. In the meantime, in 1985 the Family Law Council recognised that increasing the amount of maintenance needs to go hand in hand with a more effective collection system. The Council, in its submissions to the Attorney-General, argued that the amount of maintenance should be determined by administrative rather than judicial means by reference to a formula. The Family Law Council also argued for a right of appeal against administrative decisions, that a child maintenance authority should be established in the Australian Taxation Office, and that maintenance should be collected on pay as you earn lines. As a result of that, a Cabinet subcommittee on maintenance under the chairmanship of the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe) was formed. In October 1986 that subcommittee issued its report titled Child Support: A discussion paper on child maintenance. It examined the growing incidence of single-parent families. Between 1974 and 1985 the number of such families increased by 73 per cent to 316,000 and the proportion of sole parents on a pension or benefit rose from 65 per cent to 85 per cent. I mention those figures because it is important to realise the depth of the problem in this country today. Further, the report, not surprisingly, found that the major cause of single-parent families was the breakdown of marriages and de facto relationships. Less than 20 per cent involve births to mothers who have never lived with the father. In other words, in the case of most single-parent families another parent has in the past shared responsibility for child expenses and the care of children. The report also noted the effect of the growth of such families on government payments, expenditure on supporting parents and widow beneficiaries rising by some 245 per cent in the period 1973-74 to 1985-86. We have already heard in the debate today that supporting parent benefits and allowances are estimated to cost the community $1,509.8m in 1987-88, which happens to be an increase of 10.5 per cent over the previous year. The report also noted that there were two major problems with the current maintenance system. The first is the non-payment of maintenance. Recent figures suggest that less than 30 per cent of custodial parents receive regular cash payments from the other parent. This means, as we have heard in the debate, that 70 per cent are not in receipt of such benefit. Only 10 per cent of unmarried sole parents and 36 per cent of divorced parents receive such payments. It was also estimated that less than half of the court orders were complied with. Secondly, the low level of payments was noted. The taking into account of social security benefits available and the desire to fix payments at a level which would encourage payment were also noted. In other words, there was a subterfuge in the process of awarding such payments. Department of Social Security data show that most payments received by sole parents on pensions or benefits are between $10 and $30 a week-I think all members of the House agree that that is an abysmally low figure-with two-thirds of the payments being less than $31 a week. These payments are so low that they are under the point at which the income testing arrangements begin to apply and therefore do not reduce the maximum rate of pension. In other words, the state is picking up the responsibilities which should fairly be thrown on to the shoulders of the non-custodial parent. It should be noted that the low level of periodic payment may, in some cases, hide the true level of support provided by non-custodial parents-for example, payment of mortgages, school fees and other items does occur, although unfortunately there is little available evidence as to its prevalence. However, a study by the Institute of Family Studies found that there was an arrangement for infrequent payments for health, education and other child expenses in only 17 per cent of cases. In 80 per cent of these cases this was additional to a regular arrangement to pay maintenance. It is against this background that the present Bill was evolved. The major change is the recognition that noncustodial parents have a responsibility to support their children. I do not think any member on either side of this House would disagree with that proposition. This Bill will establish the Commissioner of Taxation as the Child Support Registrar, who will be responsible for the register of maintenance liabilities and the Child Support Register. I think it is important to say that the registers are an important aspect of the scheme in that they will be the basis on which the Registrar will be able automatically to deduct payments from wages or salaries. This will occur where the non-custodial parents fails to make timely maintenance payments. If we look at the reasons why the Government chose the Australian Taxation Office to perform this important and necessary task-and this has been mentioned by honourable members from both sides of the House-we find, firstly, that the Tax Office, through the pay as you earn system, has an existing relationship with employers; secondly, that the Tax Office can best trace those persons who seek to evade their obligations under the Bill; and finally, that the Tax Office has substantial experience in the enforcement of financial obligations, as most of us as taxpayers well and truly know. This Bill will succeed if it provides an adequate level of support for children who do not live with both parents. It will ensure the optimal development of the children. This important point has come out in this debate. Everyone who has contributed to the debate realises that the interests of the child are paramount and this is what we are seeking to achieve. In addition, the legislation must ensure equity as between parents in contributing to the financial support of their children. I would like to conclude with the words of Bishop Hollingworth, which I think sum up the nub of the argument: . . . the real challenge is to collect maintenance in order to make significant net improvements to the living standards of single parents and their children. It would be a pyrrhic victory to reform the maintenance collection system purely to offset existing government expenditure while at the same time leaving the acute poverty problem untouched. I support the Bill before the House.",70
26,Mr DONALD CAMERON ,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Moreton) (8.55)-The Opposition has moved this amendment in relation to the motion for the second reading of the Child Support Bill: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House wishes to ensure the protection of the rights of non-custodial parents who have entered into maintenance arrangements to share in the cost of supporting their children at no extra cost to the Commonwealth, by not requiring these agreements to be registered with the Child Support Agency, except in the event that maintenance arrangements are not honoured'. In supporting the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Connolly), I suggest that this is a most reasonable amendment on our part and I hope that the Government considers it in that light. The subject that we are discussing in relation to this Child Support Bill is one that has to be viewed in the context of changes. Until the mid-1960s, a little under 6 per cent of children were born outside wedlock. Today about 16 per cent of all births are outside wedlock. That information comes from the Department of Social Security statistics section. It indicates that the number of never married mothers in receipt of a supporting parent's benefit has increased from 13,500 in 1974 to 45,000 in 1987. This is a trebling of the number which existed in 1974 at the time of the introduction of this benefit. Those figures speak volumes about the way in which the supporting parent's benefit took the worry out of not only being close but also being cautious while close. There is no disputing that in more recent times Australians have been more sexually active outside marriage than previously. When we consider that the benefit has provided an alternative to abortion for many yet the number of abortions carried out continues to rise, it suggests that people are carefree in their approach or that contraceptives are not in fact the preventative they are supposed to be. While what people do with their lives, as long as it is within the law, is very much their own business, it does become the community's business and the business of government when the cost of these activities reaches hundreds of millions of dollars. Never-married mothers received more than $400m of the $1.5 billion paid out under this benefit. The message from this legislation is simple: people are free to do as they wish but if the result of that freedom is a child it will become much more the financial responsibility of those people than it has been for a long time. The financial resources of Australia can no longer carry such people. Another area of the supporting parent's benefit that has taken off like a bushfire is that relative to those who have simply been living together, have had children and are no longer together. In 1974 there were 3,100 women in this group. In 13 short years that number has grown to 17,700. In fact, there has been a downturn in that particular area-that is about the only area in which there has been an actual downturn but that is still a six-fold increase. Once more, this legislation shows that while the Government is not moralising on living together, it is saying that if children are born as a result of that relationship people will, in future, have to bear the financial responsibility of that relationship and not leave it to the taxpayer. I now move to the arena where the 1974 advent of the supporting parent's benefit, in conjunction with the 1975 changes to the Family Law Act, has had such a devastating effect upon attitudes. I refer specifically to the breakdown of marriage. I guess that until 1975 there were hundreds of thousands of families across Australia who had never seen a divorce within their ranks. Today that situation is vastly different. Until 1975 it was not easy to divorce and it took longer. Pre-1975 many couples worked out those problems because it was easier than heading for the divorce courts. Today, sadly, divorce is rampant and it reaches across all socio-economic strata within the Australian community. Today there are tens of thousands of men and women totally bewildered as to the reasons behind their divorce. There are hundreds of thousands of children who are living either in a single parent situation or as part of a new family structure. All that the vast majority of those children really want is for their real parents to still be living together. I make a plea in this place to all colleagues-members of the Australian Labor Party, the National Party of Australia and the Liberal Party of Australia-to recognise that we have an obligation to society to amend the Family Law Act to make the 'quickie' divorce just that much more difficult when children are involved. If a marriage is childless, one year's separation is ample. If there are children the law, as it stands, is reckless. Tonight we are legislating in a bid to put a cap on the financial aspects of a runaway situation. If we look at the results of broken marriages in 1974, we see that the taxpayer carried 9,400 separated wives. The 1987 figure for this category is 106,000. I will read the year to year figures from 1974 up to the present. In 1975 the figure grew from 9,000 to 14,000. In 1976, after the introduction of family law, it went to 20,000; in 1977 it was 23,000; in 1978, 24,000; in 1979, 25,000; in 1980,28,000; in 1981, 53,000; in 1982, 64,000; in 1983, 73,000; in 1984, 83,000; in 1985, 94,000 and in 1986, 102,000. Last year we kept up our great performance as a nation and 106,000 women were left to battle it out on their own. We have a situation where it is so easy for a marriage to be eclipsed. If it was the male speaking he could say, 'Bye bye darling, I'm off. The Government can look after you'. That really meant that the people could look after her. If something grabbed her fancy she might say, 'Bye bye, sucker; I'm off. I don't need your support. I'll apply for a benefit and you're not going to see the kids'. I believe that this combination of the introduction of the supporting parent's benefit and the changes to the Family Law Act has done more to break down the structure of this nation than anything else other than perhaps the scourge of continuing high unemployment. There was a touch of irony in the fact that in 1986 the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade ( Mr Hayden), in an interview on his 25 years in Parliament, claimed the introduction of supporting parent's benefit as one of the great achievements of his parliamentary career. I was in this place when that legislation was introduced. I must say that the only person who sounded a warning bell about the possibility that this could happen was the then honourable member for Mackellar, Billy Wentworth. His protests were fairly muted because nobody was quite sure what the effect would be, but we have seen the effect on those 106,000 people. The breakdown of marriage is costing the Australian taxpayer over $1 billion. I have said before that the effects of divorce have probably now reached into the majority of Australian families. It is not just the immediate families that are affected. The grandparents and relations are also affected, as are the kids who grow up hardly knowing who their cousins are. Those who have been through it-thankfully, I have not been-well know the experience and can relate it better than I can as a bystander. I have said before that I make a plea to the Government to go to the core of the problem, which is easy divorce. The Family Law Act needs to be changed. It is too easy for all of us to push the problem under the carpet, forget it and go on to other arenas and other areas of legislation. What the Government is saying is what the people are saying: Australia can no longer afford to pay over $1 billion for the products of broken marriages and can no longer afford in excess of $lt billion to pick up the cost of the activities of those who have never married, those who have lived in a de facto relationship and those whose marriages have gone on the rocks. One of the great tragedies, to which I have already alluded, was the emergence of an attitude in this country of letting government pick up the bill. Speaking from a male point of view, I agree with what the Government is doing. Men have to be brought to heel and made to recognise that, if they father children, they have to pay for them. They cannot bring children into the world after one night's activity, move on to the golf course next day and forget about the previous night. If one is not careful, a child is born; that is the risk of the game. What the Government is rightfully saying is, 'If you are not careful with your packet, we will get into your pocket'. I do not argue with that theory being applied. But when we talk about the 30odd per cent of fathers who have met their responsibilities for maintenance and we cite the 60 to 70 per cent who have not, we must recognise that many within that group who have not, men particularly, have been denied access to the children and have adopted the view that, if they are not going to see their child or children, they are not going to put up the money. I fully recognise that in the male species there are some brutal men wh,o have not only brutalised their former spouses but also given their children an experience that those children would rather forget. But I guess there is a great number of women who for reasons best known to themselves have adopted the view of 'To hell with him; I am off to the other side of Australia. He will not find me. He is not going to see the children, and that is that. I will live off the Government'. When the Attorney-General ( Mr Lionel Bowen) brought in amendments to the Family Law Act in the latter part of last year, I asked that he take this very important area into consideration. Whilst I recognise that in some instances the courts may rightly rule that one of the parents be denied access for the sake of the children, where access is granted the Government should be prepared to enforce that access through the courts. If the courts need restructuring to assist in the enforcement of this right, that should be done. If a person has been granted access, bitchiness and an unco-operative approach should not be allowed to flourish because the problem is too hard to solve. I believe that the percentage, particularly of males, who support their children would have increased if in years gone by the Parliament-and I blame both the Opposition and the Government because we are both at fault-had been prepared to recognise that there are grave problems in the area of access and that a lot of the maintenance costs are a result of our ignoring those problems. As I have said, the Opposition is not endeavouring to deny the passage of this legislation. Ostensibly, we support it. Perhaps we are all entitled to wonder why it took so long to be introduced. I am not just reflecting on the government of the day because I remember ringing the bell in my party room in the late 1970s about the growth that was going on in this area. We were then the government of the day and I am not saying that we shrugged our shoulders, but we seemed to be inadequate in coming to grips with the problem, which has now become more rampant. I hold the view that, if the Family Law Act had been amended, the number of broken families and marriages that we now see would not be as great. As I said earlier, I am not particularly concerned about the breakdown of childless marriages and, sad though it may be to see older couples go their own way when their children have grown up, at least the children are no longer affected because they are making their own lives. Such marriage break-ups do not have quite the same impact. I know that the Government is - aying that its reason for introducing this legislation is a bid to eliminate poverty. That could \y,ell be a justification if it leads to that and increases the income of sqme of those people trying to raise children. I have here a chart showing the cost of raising children. I have four children and I was quite amazed to look at this chart. The ages of my children are almost exactly the same as those in the chart. The chart mentions four children aged two, five, eight and II; mine are aged two, five, seven and 12. the chart shows the costs for four children of those ages for someone in the middle income bracket as about $8,000 to $9,000 a year. n is absolutely beyond me how some women can raise their children on the supporting parent's benefit. Of course, some of them are assisted in other ways, such as cheap housing provided by government, but one can then argue that, if we have 100,000 single mums vying for housing commission accommodation, they are really displacing many of the families who in bygone eras received those homes just because they were low income earners. Today we have a new poverty group existing in the community and something has to be done to put the brakes on and put an end to the problem.",72
27,Mrs HARVEY ,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Hawker) (9.15)-1t is a pleasure to support the Child Support Bill, which is the latest in a long line of Labor Government reforms and programs aimed at assisting families. I must say that I have been very interested in the Opposition's argument this afternoon and this evening in relation to this Bill. One thread that has been common to all the Opposition contributions has been support of this' Bill. Honourable members opposite see it as responsible, good and overdue and some of them have even congratulated this Government for having finally done something about the burgeoning supporting parents payments and the abrogation of responsibility by non-custodial parents. Even though honourable members opposite of course agree with this Bill they are not going to stand up here for 20 minutes and say how good we are. What has the Opposition done? It has moved an amendment which not one Opposition member has spoken to. Not one member of the Opposition has explained or rationalised the amendment or told us why they want it. Honourable members opposite, in order to use up their 20 minutes, have indulged in the usual knee-jerk ramblings in which they indulge every time the words 'marriage', 'separation', 'children' or 'family' are mentioned. Honourable members opposite stand up and indulge in phoney and patronising-Mr Blunt-It is better than empty rhetoric.",74
28,Mrs HARVEY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Wait a minute, I am getting to the point. Mr Blunt-You are stuck with your empty rhetoric now.",74
29,Mrs HARVEY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"I am getting to the point. Honourable members opposite have used phoney and patronising arguments about mothers, motherhood, separation, marriage and so on. I find it rather bizarre that the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Connolly), in his opening contribution, somehow sought to supposedly illustrate by way of this Bill some perceived discrepancy between Government rhetoric and Government action in this area. I would have thought that this Bill more than any other is concrete proof that there is no discrepancy between rhetoric and action on this side of the House and that we actually do something about what we believe in and the things that need to be redressed. There are many people in this country, particularly in the Opposition, who feel a warm inner glow when talking about the family and its sanity. However, what policies does the Opposition have to assist families? Let us look at the Opposition's policies. I presume that it still has policies that it had at the last election. I do not believe that there are any new policies. What about the $11 billion spending cut the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) is advocating? What effect will that have on families and on services such as child care, community health and education which are so vital to young families? What effect will that have on equal opportunity for the children of those families? Does the Opposition health policy still involve families paying for the first $250 of their health costs? I have not heard any contradiction of that policy, so I assume that it is still part of the Opposition's health policy. That too is damaging to young families. Does the Opposition still d-ny certain women equal employment opportunIty? If the Opposition does,·it is denying mothers the opportunity to gain employment and to earn an income to support their families. What has this Government done for families? Certainly in the last couple of weeks there seems to have been a myth around that it is out of touch with its constituency and that it is doing nothing or has done nothing to look after the interests of the low income families which are supposed to be its base. Let us look what we have done in the last five years. We have created one million jobs. What better thing can a government do for a family than to create a full time income for a member of that family? As has been pointed out many times, the one greatest cause of poverty in this country is unemployment. We have created one million new jobs. As the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) has pointed out, that is twice the job creation rate of the rest of the world and four times the job creation rate under the Fraser Liberal Government. As far as health is concerned, we have introduced Medicare so that two million children are now covered.",74
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,Mr Mountford)Order! I remind the honourable member for Hawker that the terms of this Bill are fairly narrow. I ask her to come back to the Bill.,75
31,Mrs HARVEY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I was just pointing out the difference between this side of the House and the other side of the House when it comes to implementing policies about families. I could go on to talk about the family assistance supplement whereby one million children of low income families are getting real cash assistance. I could talk about our equal opportunity legislation for education and employment for women and children. Today we are discussing the Child Support the Bill which, as I said earlier, is the latest in a long line of Labor Government reforms and programs aimed at assisting children. There has been a feeling in the community over the last few years, with which I agree to a certain extent, that it has been too easy to get a government pension or benefit, that unemployed people could get a benefit without seriously looking for work and that single parents could get a benefit without seriously pursuing other sources of income. In other words, the social security system and the support of the taxpayer have been taken for granted. The generosity of the taxpayer has been abused. Inevitably, over the last few years this has led to an intolerable blow-out in welfare spending. One of the great achievements of this Government has been the whittling down of the welfare bill. The number of unemployment benefit recipients has fallen demonstrably, largely due to this Government's highly successful job creation strategies and also to the application of strict eligibility criteria as regards collection of the unemployment benefit. The age pension bill has been reduced because of the assets test. Now the Child Support Bill and the proposal that noncustodial parents will be obliged to pay financial support for their children will lead to a huge reduction in government expenditure on support of those children. It has been estimated that $7.6m will be saved in 1987-88 and $120m in 1988-89, going up to $193m in 1989-90. The moral rationale behind this Bill was, I think, very capably presented by my colleague the honourable member for MCEwen ( Mr Cleeland) when he pointed out that separating parents will not now be able to assume that the Government or the taxpayer has prime responsibility for supporting children. Family law judges will not be able to take the availability of the supporting parents benefit into account when determining maintenance. As the honourable member for Moore ( Mr Blanchard) pointed out, this move restores equity to the burden of both parents to support those children. Also, of course, it will lead to an improvement in the emotional relationship among supporting parents so that a lot of the resentment that is caused by an unequal sharing of the support burden will be lessened. I would like to address some remarks to the comments made by members of the Opposition. I said earlier that the honourable member for Bradfield used this Bill as an example of some perceived discrepancy between our rhetoric and our actions. As I think I have proven, we are the ones who are acting on principles. Honourable members opposite simply are the ones who are full of empty rhetoric. When my colleague the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) was speaking earlier in the debate she used the words 'social justice' and said how this Bill was an integral part of our social justice strategy. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran), who sits opposite, called out at the time, 'Social justice is a cliche. You don't understand what it means'. I would like the honourable member for Gippsland some time to tell us his definition of social justice. Perhaps in this context his definition of social justice is the attitude expressed by some of his National Party colleagues in Queensland who are on record as having said that there should not be any sort of supporting benefit and that the children of single mothers should not get any benefit because, supposedly, it encourages immorality or promiscuity or whatever. In other words, it is an example of the attitude that the sins of the fathers and mothers should be visited on the children. Is that the definition of social justice of the honourable member for Gippsland? The honourable member for Gippsland and, more recently in this debate, the honourable member for Moreton ( Mr Donald Cameron) referred to much overdue reforms needed to the Family Law Act. I remind the honourable member for Moreton and the honourable member for Gippsland that there are two Bills dealing with amendments to the Family Law Act sitting on the table in the Senate at the moment. They are being held up by members of the Opposition on technicalities and trivialities. These are Bills which would enable family law matters to progress more expeditiously through the family courts. For example, it would enable magistrates to hear undefended cases in the family law area. Those two Bills are being held up in the Senate at the moment by the Opposition. So let us have no more of this nonsense from the Opposition that reforms in the family law area are moving too slowly. It is the Opposition that is holding up what we are trying to do at the moment. The honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) told us that his main concern was children-little children, he called them. But did he go on to address the question of children, which is what this Bill is all about? No, he used the opportunity to indulge again in cheap, maudlin moralising about marriage and family law and how we are, allegedly, destroying marriage. In terms of the legislation, it is taken as read that the parents have separated, that there is a single supporting parent. We are not here to moralise about marriage breakups or anything like that. We accept that these things happen and that there are children who are in need of support. That is what we should be addressing in this debate, not using the occasion to come out with tired old cliches and to mora lise. The honourable member for O'Connor and to some extent the honourable member for Moreton stooped to blaming the Labor Government for the breakdown of marriage. What this Government has done, what the Labor Party has done in the area of family law over the last 12 years is to drag family law out of the nineteenth century. We are not encouraging people to separate. We are saying to people that if their marriage is intolerable they do not have to stay in it, they do not have to put up with a miserable situation in which the children are suffering, they can separate with dignity, without trumped-up charges. That is what we are saying. We are not encouraging people to separate. We are saying that they can separate if they want to with a bit of dignity and civility. As other members on this side of the House have said, this Bill is an integral part of our plan to eradicate child poverty. It is an integral part of our plan to reduce government expenditure, and I would have thought that at least the Opposition would be in favour of that. As the honourable member for Forde pointed out earlier, it is an integral part of our social justice strategy.",75
32,Mr BLUNT ,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Richmond) (9.28)-The last contribution to which the House was treated this evening was lamentable, and it was lamentable because it was political. What we are talking about tonight should be non-party political. As my colleague the honourable member for Moreton ( Mr Donald Cameron), who has now left the chamber said, the initial vote on the Family Law Bill was non-party; it was a free vote. I firmly believe and I am sure that most of my colleagues on this side of the House believe-I think if honourable members on the other side of the House were allowed to express an opinion on this they would also believe it-that questions of family law should be given a conscience vote and that it is not uplifting for this Parliament to indulge in the politicisation of the trauma that affects Australian families. Unfortunately, whenever a divorce takes place there is a lot of sadness, pain and suffering, and it is not appropriate for members of parliament from any party to try to score political points on it. We have a responsibility to ensure that the legal framework that operates in our society for marriage and for the dissolution of marriage operates in the most efficient manner and minimises the suffering and trauma visited upon the partners to that marriage and their children. I for one lament every time. I hear a politician try to score cheap party political points from someone else's suffering. The honourable member for Hawker ( Mrs Harvey) tonight commented that some honourable members on this side of the House have not spoken to the amendment. If the honourable member for Hawker is truly interested in the amendment I invite her to stay in the chamber for a while and I will talk to her and other honourable members about what that amendment seeks to address. It is a very important question of philosophy. The Australian Labor Party, regrettably, because it has chosen to politicise this matter, has also extended its party philosophy into this question. It has introduced into this House the Child Support Bill, which in many areas is worthy of support, but it is not worthy of support in so far as it seeks to interfere in the lives of people who have resolved their differences amicably, equitably and with dignity and who have come to a financial arrangement that is fair to both parties. The Bill before the House tonight purports to involve everybody, irrespective of the arrangements people may have entered into with their partners, irrespective of the degree of satisfaction the former partners may have had. They may have sat down amicably at a table and agreed to the financial arrangements that will pertain after the dissolution of that marriage. They may be equitable, they may be fair, they may be quite generous, but under the provisions of this Bill Big Brother gets involved. There is no choice. The obligation to pay the maintenance is an obligation to the child support agency and the agency will remit to the other partner and that will be entered in the register. As I have said, I do not believe that we should politicise this debate. I also do not believe that government has any business sticking its nose, and bureaucrats certainly have no business poking their sticky fingers, into people's affairs there is no need. After the dissolution of a marriage, if there is no claim on the social security system, if there is no dispute between the former partners, if the children are being looked after well, if the maintenance payments are being made, why do we want a bureaucrat involved? That is the question that I am expecting the Government to answer. The answer is that the Labor Party wants to involve the bureaucracy in everything. Other members have spoken in this debate tonight about the default figures. I have seen the default figures showing that 70 per cent of maintenance orders are not complied with. There is some question as to the accuracy of those figures, and I invite any honourable member on the other side of the House who is genuinely interested in this issue to read some of the information that is available and not just take the hand-outs from people who have a vested interest in this matter. The default rate is very high, I am not denying that, but there is some question about the often touted figure of 70 per cent. The thing that must be acknowledged when we consider this is that if we change the circumstances, if we create an agency and facilitate a mechanism for the collection of maintenance, perhaps people will have a different attitude to its payment. Maybe historical figures are not necessarily appropriate for judging what will happen in the future. Of course, the Bill does not address the question of civil liberties, but what could I expect from a party that knuckled under to Caucus pressure and voted for an identification card. I do not think there are terribly many.people on the other side of the chamber these days who have minds of their own. They are part of a machine, a machine which increasingly is run by party bureaucrats and political operatives-we inducted another one into the Senate tonight-a machine which is determining that the decisions of the machine will be paramount and damn the views of Caucus. I say, 'More power to Caucus'. It is about time Caucus started to flex its muscles. The doomed Premier of New South Wales said one thing that is very true. The Labor Party ought not only listen to the voice of the people but it also ought to pay attention to the people and implement their views. The question we are considering tonight is fundamentally very important. The Labor Party is . saying that it is another piece of its social legislation. the reality is that, if it is so important. to the Labor Party, why did it wait five years? In 1983 there was a proposal to establish where a maintenance collection agency. Mr Connolly-In 1980.",76
33,Mr BLUNT,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"I am told by the honourable member for Bradfield that it was 1980. That was eight years ago. There was a proposal-it was not a perfect proposal-in 1983 which it could have acted upon. It could have acted on that in 1984, 1985, 1986 or 1987. But it is 1988, almost into the sixth year of the Hawke Labor Government and we have this piece of legislation that the Labor Party professes to hold dear. It comes in here masquerading on the basis that its entire motive for introducing the legislation is its concern about the poverty of Australian children. I suggest that honourable members on the Government side examine the Bill and the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe) and the rationale behind the Bill. They will see that what it is really designed to do is minimise social security costs. If the Government were genuinely concerned about this whole area it would bring to this House a package that was not just concerned with the payments of maintenance but which would address the problems of the Family Law Act. If ever there was a piece of law that had problems and was desperately in need of reform the Family Law Act is it. Reference was made by the honourable member for Hawker earlier tonight to changes that were made to the Family Law Act to ensure that parents accepted responsibility for their children. Hallelujah! In 1983 Senator Durack, in another place, sought to amend the Family Law Act along those lines, and several times - jnce 1983 we have sought to introduce a private senator's Bill in the Senate to make those appropriate changes to the Family Law Act-changes that are important in terms of equity, that will reduce demand on the social security system and that will require consideration of parents' means before resort is made to the social security system. This Government, which now attaches so much importance to ,the changes, would not accept them. It knocked them out. The changes never came before the House of Representatives. The changes could have been made years ago with bipartisan support, but they were not, because the Labor Party, contrary to its rhetoric, decided that this was a political issue and it would not wear the changes. The Government may not have liked our words precisely, but we are not difficult to deal with. All we were aiming to do was to change a problem that existed in the Family Law Act, to introduce a bit of equity relative to the Australian taxpayer and parents. We would have accepted changed words as long as the impact of the changes was what we wanted-what the Government has introduced recently in the last sittings of Parliament. But, no, that was not done. That is an indication of the Labor Party's priority and its determination to use the whole issue for scoring political points. The way in which the Labor Party has handled this issue has been nothing short of disgraceful. In 1986 there was the rhetoric associated with the Budget Speech about how certain things would be done to improve the lot of supporting parents and to ensure that maintenance was collected. In my office we started to get caUs from custodial parents who said, 'Oh, good, something is going to be done. We will not have to pursue this issue through the courts'. They stopped the legal action that they had initiated on the basis of the Minister's statements in this chamber. Unfortunately, the Minister was not fair dinkum, or perhaps he had a totally unrealistic expectation of how long it would take to bring the legislation before the chamber. The legislation was first talked about in 1986 and 1987 came and went. If my memory serves me correctly, the legislation was supposed to start on 1 July 1987. Here we are in February 1988 and the Bill is before the House. It was talked about in 1986, expectations were raised, there was rhetoric after rhetoric, statement after statement and politicisation of the whole issue and, in 1988, we finally see a Bill-a Bill which is really preoccupied with the social security aspects of this question and not the total picture as it is affected by the Family Law Act. We have moved an amendment. It is an important amendment because it deals with the rights of the individual. There is one thing that we cannot accept and I do not believe that there is any difference between any significant numbers of honourable members, no matter on which side of the chamber they sit, about the obligations of parents, be they married or non-married, in terms of their children. The reality is that the primary obligation of a parent in terms of his or her children is to provide support to his or her capacity. There is no way, on moral or economic grounds, that a parent can justify walking away from that responsibility and placing it on the Australian taxpayer through the social security system. As I have said, it is lamentable that the Labor Party did not choose to amend the Family Law Act some five years ago to stop that. We would have had five fewer years of cases had the Government done so. How many cases does the Government think went through in those five years when it sat around on its hands playing politics? As I have said before, it is important, when parents do the right thing by themselves, their children and the taxpayer, that they preserve the dignity about which the honourable member for Hawker spoke and that they not have a bureaucrat sticking his nose into their private affairs; that they not be required to have their employer know all about their private affairs; and that they not have their name listed on some register; they have a right to come to a private arrangement. That is what our amendment is designed to do. We recognise that there is a need to ensure that people make maintenance payments. If the payments are not made, if one former partner does not agree to a private arrangement or if there is a claim on the social security system, all bets are off and the agency should be involved. But if there are none of those things-if the partners agree, if the maintenance is being paid and if there is no claim on the social security system-what is the business of the Government's bureaucracy getting involved in their private affairs? That is the trouble with this country and the Australian Labor Party today. The Labor Party is too ready to stick its nose into the private business of Australian people. Let me tell the Labor Party that the Australian people are very concerned about this. If the Government goes along this track as it has intimated in terms of child support and if stage 2 o( this package comes in and follows the same philosophies, it will have a massive backlash. The Government thinks that it had backlash over timed telephone charges. Wait until it sees the backlash it gets over sticking its nose into the private marital affairs of Australians. Literally hundreds of thousands of families are affected by this and literally millions of people are prepared to vote on it. The Government should think about that the next time Caucus considers a bit of legislation. There is no issue that raises greater passion than the question of the dissolution of marriage and the obligation of partners to pay maintenance. It is not just a question of partners to a first marriage; it is a question of second families, their rights and equities and the attitudes of the second partner. I will give the Government one bit of advice which I hope it takes. I do so most sincerely. The Government should get politics out of the question of family law. Every time we have a question in this Parliament which relates to family law and the support of children, we should have a free conscience vote. It is only then that we will start to get down to an honest, non-political treatment of what is essentially a very personal, sensitive and important subject. We have a problem in this country with the rate of marriage breakdown and the rate of partnership breakdown. I am not about to stand here tonight in judgment of anybody's domestic or private arrangements, but I will say-I say this categorically and again, because I believe it most fervently-political parties have no business in those arrangements. If the Caucus had any guts it - ould insist on a free vote on these issues, because then we would start to get people in here talking reasonably and rationally and not scoring political points on this issue. To come in here and talk about family assistance packages and equal opportunity legislation in this context is a sheer nonsense and demonstrates a degree of insincerity that I find amazing, astounding and, as I have said, lamentable. This issue is very important. I hope that the Government recognises the validity of our amendment. It is moved conscientiously and with a desire to protect the rights of individuals who come to a satisfactory arrangement-satisfactory to all the parties involved, including the taxpayer. I would hope that, if not in this place, in the Senate we would have support for it because it is important in terms of where we go next regarding changes to the Family Law Act. Many other issues should be addressed. I note the injunction of the former Deputy Speaker to stay on the subject, but there are many issues that need to be canvassed, including amendments to the Family Law Act, resources available to the Family Court of Australia and related issues. It is a great pity that we do not have the opportunity to discuss those issues on a non-partisan basis. 1 support the amendment. As I have said, I hope that the Caucus has some guts and genuine concern for the whole issue of child support, will reconsider its position and will support our amendment.",77
34,Mr LAVARCH ,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Fisher) (9.43)-1 doubt whether there is a family law practitioner in Australia who has not been affected by the hardship, the desperation and the feeling of hopelessness which accompany separation and the breakdown of marriage. The failure of a marriage is an emotional trauma for the parties of the marriage. Unfortunately, as well as the emotional fallout, many parents are thrown into financial hardship. It was my experience as a family law practitioner that many non-custodial parents had no idea of the cost involved in raising children. Often the parent had little to do with the day-today care of the children and certainly nothing to do with the purchasing of the basic necessities of food and clothing. Further, there is a general linking in most parents' minds of the access rights to children and maintenance, the custodial parent often believing that a failure to pay maintenance removed the right of access. Conversely, non-custodial parents who do not have or exercise access rights contend that there is no obligation to maintain their children. As a result of these two perceptions, as well as an inflated misunderstanding of the' level of supporting parent benefits, the percentage of noncustodial parents paying maintenance is very low. The Bill before this House is part of a package of legislation designed to ensure that the legal right of maintenance is converted into an enforceable duty of both parents. Parties to a marriage have always been liable to maintain their children. Currently there exists a system of enforcement which, unfortunately, has not resulted in a large number of custodial parents receiving adequate maintenance, if any maintenance at all is received. The current situation in Queensland, I believe, would be typical of the rest of Australia. In Queensland a custodial parent must seek a court order before any enforceable obligation is imposed upon the other party. That, however, is the easy part. After a court order is made, either by consent or by determination of the court, the enforcement is placed in the hands of the clerk of the court of the Magistrates Court having territorial jurisdiction over the matter. For many reasons the enforcement procedures are not effective. Alarmingly few orders are complied with and seemingly few defaulters are successfully pursued by the court registries. Further, if the non-custodial party takes proceedings for collection of arrears, the general practice is for an order to capitalise the arrears for a period of no greater than one year and, of course, enforcing even a second order remains a problem. The new scheme proposes to remove the collection function from the State agencies and give it to a newly created child support agency. The agency will be a section of the Australian Taxation Office. For non-custodial parents paying pay as you earn tax, the deduction of maintenance will be compUlsory and automatic. For other cases enforcement powers will be given to the agency and payments will be required to be remitted on a monthly basis. Maintenance payments will then be passed on to the custodial parents by means of the social security system in conjunction with the family allowance payments. The scheme will cover people who separate after the enactment of the Bill: social security pensioners and beneficiaries; and parents of children of de facto relationships where the child is born after the scheme is introduced-except in the State of Queensland. The Queensland Government has refused to refer power to the Commonwealth over children not deemed to be children of a marriage pursuant to the Family Law Act. The effect of this action is that only in Queensland will there remain a confusing and complicated situation of courts competing for jurisdiction over custody and maintenance matters. The most serious consequence of the Queensland Government's action remains in the field of custody disputes involving children of de facto relationships and disputes involving children of a first marriage who are living within a family of a second marriage. In these cases the Family Court, the Supreme Court of Queensland, and the Magistrates Court all have jurisdiction in certain circumstances. I fail to see the logic of retaining a complicated system when all other States have now adopted a one court approach to the problem. As well as the custody disputes maintenance questions will remain unnecessarily complicated for Queenslanders. Although the scope for confusion will be reduced by the fact that a majority of single parents arising from a de facto relationship will be social security beneficiaries some will not and will have to take maintenance action under the Queensland Maintenance Act. Court orders under this Act made by the Magistrates Court or the Supreme Court may not be able to be collected by the child support agency unless the Queensland Government displays a more co-operative attitude. We have heard a lot in Queensland since the election to the premiership of Mr Ahern; we were going to have a new era of co-operation and consensus and the inevitable conflict between the Queensland State Government and the Federal Government, as a matter of course and regardless of merit, would be a thing of the past. I can think of no finer example of a ludicrous situation than the Queensland Government standing alone for no logical reason and refusing to co-operate with the Federal Government. It would be a perfect example of how the Queensland Premier and the so-called new Queensland Government could show that they were willing to co-operate with the Federal Government in order to benefit Queenslanders. Mr Sciacca-It is no different from the previous Government.",79
35,Mr LAVARCH,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"That is quite so, as the honourable member for Bowman correctly points out. For the remainder of my time. I wish to turn to the general principles on which the Bill and the amendments to the Family Law Act and social security Acts are based. There has been some community debate about the wisdom of enforcing maintenance obligations far more vigorously than at present. Some groups, such as the Lone Fathers Association, contend that strict enforcement will lead to increased tensions and possible violent reactions by non-custodial parents, especially when coupled with access difficulties. Others submit that it is unrealistic to expect teenage fathers of children from a casual affair to pay maintenance for a child with whom they have no social contact. I shall answer those criticisms by saying that the existing division between custody, access, and maintenance is a correct one. Children are the responsibility of their parents. They have the right to be properly maintained and parents have a right to be part of their children's lives, even if a marriage or a relationship goes wrong. But the concepts are separate as financial disability should never be a bar to a parent being part of a child's upbringing. Equally, lack of interest in a child should not excuse a parent from having responsibility for the life which he or she has created. In my view, the role of government should be to ensure that, as a society, we do not allow children to be victims of the follies or difficulties of their parents. This does not mean that government replaces the parent or the parent's responsibilities. The end result of this package will be that government support can be more adequate and the level of child poverty will be reduced. That is the aim-not to aggravate noncustodial parents but to ensure that those who have the ability to pay maintain their own children, and they should do so. The next stage of this package concerns the determination of a formula to apply in calculating the amount of maintenance. I will be interested to see how such a formula can be developed as from my experience it might be difficult to develop a catch-all approach. Nonetheless, the reforms already encompassed will immeasurably improve the system. I do not agree with those who argue that deductions should occur only when the non-custodial parent has defaulted or has refused to pay maintenance voluntarily. This seems to be the particular point at which the Opposition amendment is directed and the concern of a Q.umber of Opposition speakers who say that there is a large number of defaulters but there is always a group of responsible parents who have made legitimate agreements between themselves and they are working, the payments are being made. The argument goes on: why should the bureaucrats get their sticky fingers in this situation and become part of a situation that is clearly working? Mrs Sullivan-It's expensive.",80
36,Mr LAVARCH,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"From my experience very few cases fall within that category. Generally, over time, even if there is an initial willingness to pay maintenance, it seems to dissipate as time goes on. As a result of that we must put into place a system that basically will cover the field rather than try to pick out individual cases at this stage. Of course, some parents are responsible and comply with their obligations, but the question is: Will people in that position be in some way disadvantaged by this particular Bill in the form of legislation which is encompassed? I do not believe they will. Firstly, the payment by deduction is necessary for co-ordination with the social security system. Everyone, including the non-custodial parent, the responsible parent, will benefit if our social security system is properly targeted. Everyone will benefit if their taxes are spent properly. Hopefully, that will reduce the burden on the entire community, including the responsible noncustodial parent. Secondly, within the legislation there exist very strict privacy protections in relation to the information which an employer receives and which an employer can give out. Therefore, that aspect is also covered. Thirdly-and this point seemed very much lost on the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt), who asked: if there is no social security element in it, if they are not receiving a benefit and the system is working well, why should the bureaucrats become involved?-there is included in the Bill a clause which expressly allows the parties to opt out in exactly that situation. That situation is, in fact, covered. In the situation where the parties to this agreement have sat down. worked it out and said, 'Okay, everything is working fine; the level of maintenance payments being made is adequate', the custodial parent can agree to opt out of the system. That is in clause 23 (4) of the Bill. That particular point, at which the honourable member for Richmond took great umbrage, is cover¢ by the proposed legislation. I suggest he might, as a good starting point, actually read the Bill on which he is proposing to speak. Mr Sciacca-He has not read the Bill.",81
37,Mr LAVARCH,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"As the honourable member said, it looks as though the honourable member for Richmond has not read the Bill. A responsible party not affecting the Government in terms of payments will not have to be involved in the system. That is catered for. That is the great point upon which this amendment is based. If that is the great concern of the Opposition, it has absolutely been covered already by the Bill. It must be remembered that children are the beneficiaries of this scheme, not the parents as such. In my opinion, the balance must favour a certain system rather than an honour system, which simply has not operated effectively here and has not operated effectively overseas. Finally, it is useful to view this scheme in the overall context of the Government's commitment to fight poverty. Marriage break-up is a significant cause of poverty, with some 450,000 children within single parent families living below the poverty line. This package will increase the resources to these particular families. It will maintain the incentive for such families to become more self-supporting by not affecting current income tests. It will make parents financially responsible for their children. In conclusion, I believe that this Bill, in relation to the amendments to the Family Law Act and the social security Acts, is a viable and vital part of the Government's package towards the problem of child poverty. I commend the Bill to the House, and I ask the House to support it.",81
38,Mrs SULLIVAN ,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Moncrieff) (9.58)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I recognise the sincerity of the honourable member for Fisher ( Mr Lavarch) in the point he was making. I must say that nothing he said persuaded me that it is not desirable that there be an option in this maintenance arrangement. I accept the point he has made-that, whilst people may enter into satisfactory maintenance agreements, over time they may become less satisfactory. I do not take that as a rebuttal of the Opposition's amendment. I believe the right should always be there, if a maintenance arrangement became unsatisfactory or there was good reason to believe it would become unsatisfactory, to have resort to the government agency that this Child Support Bill provides. In many cases there are many advantages in having the government agency. For one thing, it removes the notion of dependency and a notion that has grown up of an almost optional favour element in paying maintenance. It forces people to face the reality of parenthood and their responsibility to their children and it certainly would protect a lot of people who at the moment live in a parlous state in this country because of the disinclination of a very large number of parents to face the financial responsibilities they have to the children they parented. The supporting parent's benefit was introduced just prior to my initial election to this Parliament. However, from the time of its introduction it has attracted a great deal of public comment, the most noisy of it being unfavourable comment. The critics of the supporting parent's benefit have basically concentrated on the female nature of the recipients of it. It was, of course, the Fraser Government that extended the supporting parent's benefit to fathers who were full-time carers for children. It has, nevertheless, had an overwhelmingly female clientele. Criticism that has flowed to the female recipients of the supporting parent's benefit has rarely flowed to the unmarried fathers of those children. I think it is worth noting that 85 per cent of recipients of the sole parent's benefit are divorced or separated. It is also worth noting in the context in which so many people choose to put it-a context of immoral young femalesthat only 4 per cent of all supporting parents are teenagers and that they are not exclusively female; there are some male teenagers who are on supporting parent's benefits. Although I was not here when the supporting parent's benefit was introduced-as I said, I came into Parliament shortly afterwards-I was here when we debated the Family Law Bill and I do remember some aspects of that debate that I think are relevant to this matter. In the course of this debate there have been some attempts to re-canvass the Family Law Act. That is not my intent; that is an occasion for another day. When we inserted into that Act a requirement that the Family Court take note of other income or benefits that were payable, the clear intention was to alleviate an injustice which then existed. The overall intention of the Family Law Act was to alleviate injustice and the hypocrisy of the previous situation. The debate on that particular aspect which has created a lot of the difficulties that we are debating tonight centred on an unfairness to men, which was that the forerunner of the family allowance, the child endowment, was not taken into account by any courts in any maintenance arrangements and that, if a maintenance arrangement was made, it could on occasions cause hardship to the father, whereas a woman could be receiving child endowment, which of course was tax free, and the courts ignored that sort of payment. Our intention was to get the Court to take account of all the sources of income or benefit to make fair maintenance arrangements. It was not our intention that the Court should shovel off onto the social security bill a whole lot of parents. That was never our intention. It was an unintended consequence, if you like. It was the Family Court's marrying of that section of the Family Law Act and the supporting parent's benefit that has had far-reaching effects well beyond the financial aspect. This magnification of a different concept of marriage and marital breakdown has led in this society, I believe, to a different concept of marital and parental responsibilities. It has all become just a little too easy. I am not one who wants to turn back time on that and I would hate to see the reintroduction of fault as either a ground for divorce or for the awarding of custody or maintenance. The beneficial role of the supporting parent's benefit in a desperate marital situation, I believe, is an important safety net. I am aware of many women with young children who are subject to violent marital situations. It may be emotional violence; it may be physical; it may be a combination of both. I believe it is important in that situation for the dependent partners to the marriage, the mother and the young children, to have that safety net-a bolthole, if you like. However, the drawback is that it makes it all a little too easy. There is no pressure on the mother and father to try to sort things out. In a situation of violence there is no immediate pressure on the father to take stock of himself. From cases that I have observed, it is some time before the father starts to miss his children and to suffer the emotional trauma that so many young fathers do when their marriages break up, much to their surprise, as a rule. The situation has gone too far down the track by then. The supporting parent's benefit, being used in the way it has been, has become too easy an out from sorting out marital problems. Marriage is, we say, a relationship or contract voluntarily entered into and ideally for life, but our birth is involuntary and the parent-child relationship is inevitably for life. Our great concern ought to be what is happening to children in this country. I have made many speeches on this subject over the past decade. The statistics on the number of children being reared in single parent families on social security, or just families on social security, are alarming as far as I am concerned. We here both reflect and set standards for our society through our laws. In this specific case the Family Court's action took the intent of the Family Law Act far beyond our intent, and the reform that has led to it has been too slow. It alarms me that there are so many children growing up believing that the wherewithal for life comes out of the letterbox-the cheque that is delivered by the mailman. There are so many children-half a million or more-who see the act that puts a roof over their heads, food on their plates and clothes on their backs as a payment from government. They are not learning the basic lesson of life, which I know both sides would want them to be learning; that is, that one survives in our society essentially by one's own efforts but that we have social security for those who are put in an unfortunate situation. The other dimension of this problem is that we have an enormous number of children who, being reared in one-parent families, are growing up without a concept of the joint parental responsibilities that come with marriage. It is my belief, from my own experience in my days as a teacher, that those children are better off in that situation than in a very unhappy family situation. But the best situation of all, of course, is the ideal role model of two parents with the children, both male and female, seeing mothers and fathers playing their role in relation to the mutual support of the other parent and the vital support of the children. This is overwhelmingly a female problem. As I have said, the figures show-I quote from the Women's Budget Statement, last year's Budget Paper No.6-that in the category of widows' and sole parents' programs there were 419,303 children in this country being reared by women on their own; that is, widows as well as sole parents. In total, 556,616 children were being reared by women who were the income recipients, whether from an inva.lid pension, a supporting parent's pension or whatever. That is an enormous number. We do not need to debate this, and I do not need to elaborate at length; we know that families in that situation-one parent, social security dependent-are living in poverty, and that they get locked into it. The child who is being reared by a mother in a sole parent situation is almost inevitably in a worse position than the child being reared by a father. We have here an historic situation relating to the education and training of girls and the expectations they have of adult life. In the 1970s we had a sudden legacy of the undereducation, undertraining and underaccess of women to employment opportunities in this country when we had a rapidly escalating rate of divorce. It was in the 1983 Federal election campaign that former Senator Ryan so successfully used her slogan referring to the feminisation of poverty. She did not invent it, but she certainly made it very effective. It is rather regrettable that it has taken five years for us to face the full extent of it. I want to relate some very stark and pretty brutal figures on what this amounts to in the context of what we are discussing tonight. In 1985 less than 30 per cent of sole parent pension recipients-remember that 90 per cent of them are women-had extra income and two-thirds of them were receiving less than $31 per week. More than 70 per cent, in other words, had only a pension. Statistics provided by the Australian Institute of Family Studies in 1986 showed that in the average case where the woman was a sole parent and the man was living alone, the manthat is, the father-was $175 a week better off than the woman after payment of tax and after maintenance. An Australian Bureau of Statistics survey found that the mean income of a female sole parent was less than 35 per cent of that of a married couple who were parents and that the mean income where the man was the sole parent was nearly 64 per cent of the married couple's income. The dramatically worse position of mothers rearing children compared with either men or married couples is very stark. It has also been demonstrated that 56 per cent of female sole parent incomes are in the lowest 10 per cent of income units, whereas only 3t per cent of married couples' incomes fall into that category. A survey on the economic consequences of marriage breakdown showed that 77 per cent of female sole parents were worse off than they had been at the time of separation by a factor of $78 per week. In contrast, 75 per cent of unrepartnered men who were living alone were better off financially than they had been prior to separation by $72 per week. Those figures have been around for a long time and have been quoted over and over again. Former Senator Ryan had them at her disposal in 1983 when she referred to the feminisation of poverty. We cannot separate from a debate on this subject the general subject of the situation of women in society today. Some progress has been made in the education of girls, but the general subject of access to education for women as distinct from girls has not improved very much at all. I believe that we have made virtually no progress in the education of girls and boys about responsible adult behaviour and responsible parenting, and our progress in child-care is too slow because the Government refuses to look at all the options available. The worse effect of this is that single parent women have an extended dependence on social security so that they are even less employable when they are older and their children are less dependent on them. I welcome the progress that has been made through this Bill, but I believe that a very wide range of other issues has to be addressed before we will truly alleviate the problem. Debate interrupted.

39,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.15 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",84
40,Mr COBB ,ADJOURNMENT,"Parkes) (1O.l5)-Last year the Kingsgrove Returned Services League Club decided to arrange an unusual night's entertainment as a special event for its old diggers. It decided to engage the 2nd Military District army band to perform at a club concert it had planned for 12 September. This was to be quite a gala occasion for the club as it had not had such a band play there since the club was opened in 1956. It may seem only a small thing to some, but one can imagine the air of expectation and excitement that this idea generated amongst the club executive and its members. They, of course, mainly consist of ex-servicemen and war widows, most of whom have historic ties with the military. Glowing reports had been heard of the band, and these people were looking forward to it coming and performing in their auditorium. To get the arrangements under way early and to do the right thing, the club wrote to the Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazley) on 23 June to get his clearance for this band to play at the club concert. One can imagine its almost utter disbelief when, on 20 July, it received a letter from the Minister's office, signed by Barry Davies, Senior Private Secretary, which stated: The Minister for Defence has asked me to respond to your letter of 23 June 1987 in which you request the presence of the Army band from 2MP to play at your RSL Club concert on 12 September 1987. I am advised that as a result of previous requests for Service bands to perform on commercial premises, complaints have been raised by the Musicians Union. As a result it has been necessary for the Minister to directive to the effect that Service bands are no longer permitted to perform at Club concerts. In the circumstances, it is regretted that a Service band cannot be made available for your concert. Mr MCGauran-Shameful.",84
41,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"It is outrageous. The Kingsgrove Returned Services League (RSL) had actually engaged three union members at a cost of $1,000 to perform on the night with the band. The band itself was to be paid $1,500 by the club, which the band was looking forward to receiving to put into its own favourite charity, which I believe is Legacy. So the RSL was not getting entertainment on the cheap. The club had also well served members of the Musicians Union of Australia over the previous year, having paid out about $120,000 in fees to it. The ramifications of this decision are quite mind boggling. Not only will Service bands be stopped from performing in RSL clubs but also, if the 'commercial' premises clause in the Minister's letter is applied, they will not be able to perform in private clubs anywhere even though they may want to perform for charity. There will be no charity concerts. Perhaps they will not even be able to perform at the Sydney Cricket Ground or at bicentennial functions in 1988. Mr MCGauran-Or at passing out parades.",85
42,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes. It is intriguing to hear that the Secretary of the Musicians Union, Alan Nash, apparently had discussions with the Minister beforehand and, if honourable members will excuse the pun, he is calling the tune in this outrageous affair. Servicemen, who fought for preservation of freedom and common sense in this country, are asking why the Minister, in uncharacteristic fashion, is caving into this man. The whole thing is so farcical that Alan Nash himself apparently suggested that if Kingsgrove RSL wanted a military band so badly, the Musicians Union members themselves could dress up in uniforms similar to those worn by members of the 2nd Military Band and play on the night. Have honourable members ever heard anything so stupid? Apart from this club, the Wagga RSL Club was also denied permission to have the Kapooka military band play for half an hour at its recent 7th Division reunion. It is worth noting that the Musicians Union, which is dictating what some sections of our military forces can or cannot do, has an appalling record of militancy over the years. One of its executive members at the time of the admission of four moderate unions to the Victorian issue a Trades and Labour Council a year or so ago said that this was 'tantamount to pack rape of the Victorian Branch'. In recent times the Musicians Union has also pulled on many strikes during performances, at great dissatisfaction to patrons. If I could just give one example: last year at the Victorian State Opera on the opening night of Wagner's The Flying Dutchman, a performance that lasts for two hours and 11 minutes, this union called an 'interval strike' during the performance because it insists in its award that its members work for no longer than two hours without a break. Have honourable members ever heard anything so ridiculous? So for the sake of 11 minutes, The Flying Dutchman, which is traditionally played without a break, was largely spoilt for the audience. The President of the Musicians Union, Mr Jack Varney, said that he noted the irate audience's objections to this cultural vandalism but said that they 'were not unduly worried'. He said: In this business there are always critics. Regrettably this Government has showered the Musicians Union with numerous grants totalling $58,491 for the most ridiculous projects, such as hiring writers and photographers in residence to document the working lives of musicians. The whole episode of pandering to this unionMONICA",85

46,Mr MARTIN ,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (10.20)-Tonight I would like to pay tribute to a group of people within my electorate who work assiduously and tirelessly on behalf of the local area as part of the Macarthur price watch network. Over the last 12 months these people have gone around on monthly basis to supermarkets that are located within the northern suburbs of Wollongong and conducted a price watch campaign, something which this Government has pioneered within this country. As part of the local price watch, they follow the usual system whereby a specific bag of goodies is checked for prices on a regular basis-every month, as I have indicated. The figures are tabulated and fed not only into our own local network but certainly into the national network to see how successful we have been in applying pressure on supermarkets in terms of their pricing policies: We are able to introduce an element of competition that will benefit low income earners, pensioners and other disadvantaged groups in our various electorates. A great degree of community awareness has grown up in regard to the benefits of this system. I am pleased to be able to say that the Macarthur price watch was the first to commence on the south coast of New South Wales. This operation has been followed by a price watch operation in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis) and in other adjacent electorates. As I have indicated, the result of price watch has been quite positive. The feedback, particularly from pensioner associations, hall been quite staggering. As is my particular blmt, every so often I go to pensioner groups within Macarthur and I speak to them on a range of issues pertinent to their needs. I also inform them about the Government's plans, policies and priorities, particularly as far as \lged people are concerned. In the last few months I have been quite flattered by their remarks about how well the Macarthur price watch has worked. They look forward every month to getting a price watch newsletter which we produce and distribute amongst community groups. I hasten to point out that the Macarthur price watch is accurate and scrupulous in its activities in so far as we do not tell the supermarkets when we are coming to check the prices. We do not visit a supermarket on the same day each month. Indeed, the basket of goodies is quite often altered. So a very scrupulous and accurate way has been developed in accordance with principles laid down by consumer organisations and pensioner groups to measure the changing prices of a specific basket of goods. Numerous hard working and dependable volunteers who work within the Macarthur electorate represent a wide variety of the residents of Macarthur. They include pensioner association members, members of Australian Labor Party branches, local community representatives and so on. Tonight I would particularly like to pay tribute to Eileen Hardy, Cath Bonney, Patricia Cosby, Nell Maher, Kay Tuckerman, Mrs Joy, Marie Grace, Yvonne Shannon, Craig Kershaw, Judy Hunt and Jean Smallgood. I am sure that their efforts are appreciated not only by me but certainly by the whole community. As I have indicated, the newsletter that we produce brings people information on a monthly basis in respect of which supermarket provides the best value for their dollar. Of course, people who have a limited income, whether they be low income earners or pensioners, have to watch those dollars. All members of this House would be aware that the Federal Government has no jurisdiction over the control of prices. On at least three occasions governments have attempted through referenda to get control of prices at a Federal level. But, of course, that has been rejected by the people of Australia. I would suggest that from the point of view of inflation future governments could look at this area. I conclude simply by saying that all of these people have contributed greatly to the local area. I am grateful for the support that they have given me. I am very pleased to see that the effort that we have put in over the last couple of months has been rewarded in so far as one of the supermarkets in my electorate has become the cheapest supermarket in which the shop in New South Wales.",85
47,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,86
48,Mr MCGAURAN ,ADJOURNMENT,"Gippsland) (10.25)Madam Speaker, you are aware, as we all are in this chamber, that in recent days much has been made of members misleading the Parliament. The former Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the honourable member for Parramattji ( Mr John Brown), admitted to misleading the Parliament and sacrificed his ministerial career as a resultat least for the time being. Today a censure motion was moved against the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) for allegedly misleading the Senate. I wish to draw the attention of the Parliament to a further act of misleading-by the Health Insurance Commission which has misled the Government in the Government Budget Papers of last year, and by extension, it has misled the Parliament. The Health Insurance Commission advised the Government that $1.5m could be saved by terminating private health insurance funds operating as Medicare agencies. I allege that that is not the case; those are false economies and the huge resources of the Departments of the Treasury and Finance should be put to work to determine the falseness of this figure, once and for all. Indeed, I allege that the Commission has a hidden agenda for terminating these private health fund agencies and replacing them with Medicare offices at a considerable cost to the Government-certainly, on my calculations, more than the cost of continuation of the private health agencies. Why does the Health Insurance Commission have this hidden agenda? That is simple; it is to provide even more forums for Medibank Private, which already has so many advantages over the private health funds. It operates from the Medicare offices and there is a steady flow-through of traffic. This means there is a further isolation of private health funds. I am very concerned about this and I call upon the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) to put the resources of their Departments to investigating that $1.5m saving, as alleged by the Health Insurance Commission and relied upon by the Treasurer in the delivery of is Budget to this Parliament and the nation last September. It is widely accepted that the average cost of establishing a Medicare office is $85,000. The Health Insurance Commission has stated that nine new Medicare offices will be established to replace the agencies of the private health funds. Two of those new offices will be in my electorate-at Bairnsdale and Sale. Mr Tim Fischer-What about MCMillan?",86
49,Mr MCGAURAN,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Farrer asks about the electorate of MCMillan. The city of Moe-not a town but a regional centre-has the private agency operated by the Latrobe Health Insurance Fund terminated and not replaced by a Medicare office. Thus, this city of 25,000 people will be without any Medicare office or agency. What has the honourable member for MCMillan ( Mr Cunningham) done about that? He has been bleating in the local media about the error of the decision but why was he not monitoring the situation properly? He has turned his back on his constituents. He is yet another example of a Government member who has lost touch with the grassroots, with the people he alleges he represent. The honourable member for MCMillan should be ashamed of himself; he has bashed the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) right throughout Gippsland, but nobody buys it because if there is anyone member who unquestioningly repeats the party line it is the honourable member for MCMillan-and in one sense I admire him for his loyalty. Therefore, it is a matter of great amusement to many of us that he has finally decided to put aside that Caucus pledge, albeit temporarily and under great pressure, in order to truly represent the interests of his constituents. I ask the honourable member for MCMillan, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance this question: What are the true savings, or is this just part of the ever-growing, octopus tentacles of Medibank Private. Medibank Private is in a privileged position which puts it competitively far ahead of the private health funds. Jobs are being lost in the private health funds as their members are deserting them in droves. What chance do these funds have if their agencies are terminated and Medibank Private offices spring up all over the countryside like mushrooms after rain and sunshine-I make that comment in case anyone thought I was not a rural member. The Health Insurance Commission has misled the Government and the Government has misled the Parliament as a consequence.",87
50,Mr CUNNINGHAM ,ADJOURNMENT,"MCMillan) (10.30)---' This situation in which the honourable member of Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran) gets up in this Parliament on the adjournment debate and attempts to score points against his neighbour, the member for MCMillan, is becoming rather repetitive. But I am quite happy to speak to this House at any stage in relation to those issues. I wish to put on record that, as far as I am concerned, as the member for MCMillan my first duty is to those people who elected me. I have always taken and will always take that position as long as I am a member of parliament. Mr MCGauran-Fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax.",87
51,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland has had his go.,87
52,Mr CUNNINGHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Gippsland did have his go and he certainly made a lot of allegations. The first point that needs to be made following what he has said is that no more than five years ago, when the conservatives were in power, two million people around Australia had no cover of health insurance at all-none whatever-private, public or anything else. Those people lived in fear that if they got sick they would be sued for the costs of any care that they had to have. This Government came into power and reinstated what was possibly the greatest traditional move by the Whitlam Government. The Medicare program was put back after it had been dismantled by the previous conservative government. That program was originally introduced, as everybody kn<;lws, by the Whitlam Government. We then had the procedures of the Fraser Governments mark 1, mark 2, mark 3 and. I think mark 4·of Medicare where it tried to dismantle the total program. All it did Was create a situation in which two million people were uninsured. I can assure the honourable member for Gippsland and all the electors in MCMillan that this Government certainly has at heart the· interests of those people who had no cover under the previous administration and who do have cover today. What we are talking about and what the honourable member has raised in this House is how we administer that cover. Do we install Medicare offices all round Australia or do we use a method of Medicare offices and some agencies? In the past five years we have used the agency method effectively but times have moved and technology has changed. The evidence today is that it is much mOre economical and efficient for the system to work through Medicare offices. They are to be established in other parts of Australia progressively as we develop the program. That will continue. The honourable member for Gippsland fails to recognise that a couple of problems have developed. I have no doubt that honourable members in this House would be very interested in them. One is that there are indications that where we do have Medicare offices or even agencies, the medical fraternity quite clearly takes advantage of that situation. The doctors know that if they force the customers to pay cash, those customers can walk straight down to a Medicare office and use it virtually as a cashflow banking system, collect their money back and go on with their shopping. That is the case I have put to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) in relation to the situation in the city of Moe where I have my office. There is great concern at the moment that the private agencies of the Latrobe Valley Health Fund and the Yallourn Medical Association have been closed down. Those people have come to realise that if the doctors force them to pay cash-and they do because $16.90 becomes $19.90 if they do not pay cash, so they are accustomed to doing that-they then walk out of the doctor's surgery after having paid maybe $30, if a parent has two sick children at the one time. That is a lot of money out of the grocery cash for the week. Those people can then walk down to the agency and collect their cash and continue with their shopping. It is understandable that in a town of 20,000, people would be concerned. They have expressed those concerns and I have passed them on to the Minister. He has listened and he has taken it up with the Health Insurance Commission. We are working through a proposal that I have put to the Minister and expect that within 48 hours we will have an answer to the. problem. It is certainly not an insurmountable one and it is certainly better to develop this program successfully over a period of years, than to have the alternative five-year example that we had previously when the conservatives took us from full medical cover to two million people with no cover at all. The honourable member for Gippsland gets up and criticises this Government but this is a government that does look after its traditional base.",87
53,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,88
54,Mr ANDREW ,ADJOURNMENT,"Wakefield) (10.35)-I rise in the adjournment debate this evening to echo the sentiments that you, Madam Speaker, expressed at 2 p.m. this afternoon and to welcome to this side of the House the new honourable member EmptyHere cause he is now a member of what will be the next Federal government here in Australia but principally because he happens to have had the good fortune to have been born in the electorate of Wakefield. In fact, the honourable member for Adelaide spent the first 30 years of his life as a farmer in the Blyth district of the electorate of Wakefield, almost in the centre of that electorate. Not many people in the House will be familiar with the Blyth district because it consists of only a very small country town, but it is adjacent to Clare and to the Clare Valley, which is renowned for its fine red wines. The honourable member for Adelaide joins a team of influential people who have served the Federal Parliament and who have come from the Blyth district or from the heart of the electorate of Wakefield. I modestly exclude myself from this team. I point out that a former member of the House of Representatives, now Senator Chapman, was once a neighbour of the honourable member for Adelaide. The present Opposition Whip in the Senate, Senator Reid, also came from an area adjacent to the Blyth district, as did the present honourable member for Boothby ( Mr Steele Hall). Perhaps most significant, a former President of the Senate also had a farm adjacent to the Blyth district in the electorate of Wakefield. So the honourable member for Adelaide came into the House today and, as honourable members will have noticed, he had with him his wife, Dianne, and his two children to see him sworn in as the honourable member for Adelaide. A great deal has been said about the Adelaide campaign. Many have supposed that the Liberal Party of Australia was successful in the seat of Adelaide simply because the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) made the faux pas of referring to the Telecom time charging fiasco. But I have to say that that was only one of many incidents which made it possible for the Liberal Party to be successful in the Adelaide campaign. Certainly the time charging fiasco, which provided so much embarrassment to the Government opposite, worked to the Liberal Party's advantage. But one should never lose sight of the fact that it was the arrogance of the Prime Minister and the sense of isolation that the people of Adelaide felt that made it possible for us to win. In fact, wherever one went in the seat of Adelaide-and the honourable member for Adelaide may well later want to echo these sentiments-particularly in State electorates such as Pooraka, Kilburn and Blair Athol, in the Premier of South Australia's area of Prospect and in the State electorate of Ross Smith, people felt that they no longer identified with what the Australian Labor Party was saying. Time and again they said to the now member for Adelaide, 'You are the first politician we have seen in 18 years'. The campaign was a real team effort and I was proud to be part of that team. The sorts of dilemmas that the Government knows that· it has to face in its isolation from the people and its selection of trade union leaders to dominate the benches opposite were a feature of the campaign. But what we cannot lose sight of is the real role played by the honourable member for Adelaide in identifying with the electorate and in identifying Liberal Party policies to the electorate. I would like to conclude with a little poem which I discovered and which I think refers pertinently to precisely what the honourable member for Adelaide achieved. It reads: Somebody said that it couldn't be done But he with a chuckle replied That 'maybe it couldn't, but he would be one Who wouldn't say so till he tried. So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin . . . On his face. If he worried he hid it. He started to sing as he tackled the thing That couldn't be done and he did it.",88
55,Mr COURTICE ,ADJOURNMENT,"Hinkler) (10.39)-Tonight I wish to call on the Queensland Minister for Local Government and Racing, Mr Randell, to launch an investigation into the local government boundaries around Bundaberg. The last royal commission into Queensland Government boundaries occurred in 1927. It was under the Ryan Labor Government that the City of Bundaberg was greaterised. Other cities correspondingly affected were the cities of Toowoomba and Brisbane. I note that the Queensland Finance Minister, Mr Austin, is coming to Canberra to call for a better deal for Queensland local government. This is the same Minister who is reported to be spending ove $800,000 refurbishing his new government office. He is a member of the same Government which has just given permission for the northern development Minister, Mr Katter, to appoint a third media officer to his staff at over $30,000 a year. It is this same Government which refused to intervene in a situation in the Gooburrum shire within my electorate. The shire wanted to reduce its councillors by two, a reported saving over a three year period of $24,000. The Government, through the local government, said that there was not enough time to do this before the council election. This is from a Government which has had no qualms about overriding local governments at Maroochydore, the tall building in Brisbane or special .Acts of Parliament for special projects. Mr Sciacca-A disgrace.",89
56,Mr COURTICE,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Bowman is correct. It is a disgrace. So Gooburrum ratepayers are left to pay $24,000 in extra rates. Bundaberg has three local authorities in its region-Gooburrum, Woongarra and Bundaberg City. The authorities have 29 councillors serving a region of about 60,000 people. Yet the City of Brisbane has 21 aldermen for almost 1 million people. The three shires share buildings in the one city block in Bundaberg.. The Minister for Local Government, Mr Randell, has refused to act until the councils petition him. for a boundary change. That is something like telling State members in Queensland to draw their own electoral boundaries. In other words, why are people who are benefiting from the present situation likely to want to change it? This is hardly an example of courageous leadership from Mr Randell. The Federal Government has allocated over $7m to local authorities in the Hinkler electorate. The Ahern Government is supposed to be providing a government of excellence. Here we have examples of gross stupidity, and the Government has sent a big spender like Mr Austin down to demand more money. Bundaberg and Woongarra shires share a boundary along MCCarthy Road in Bundaberg. One side of MCCarthy Road has a different cyclone rating from the other side. One side of the road pays over '$300 a year in rates, the other side over $800 a year. This absurdity reaches new heights when it comes to promotion of the area. Bundaberg City has the resources to promote itself, but no more. Woongarra has all the room but no resources. It would be a brave mayor of Bundaberg who stood before ratepayers advocating promotion of the area when all the new housing goes into the next shire. The State Government policy on local government in Bundaberg is actually retarding the positive development of the city. The challenge facing the State Government is to get its thinking out of the horse and buggy days. It should do what a Labor government did many years ago-it should widen the city boundaries. If it feels that the benefits are uncertain, then it should hold an inquiry into it. If the present system is so great, it will stand the intense scrutiny of an inquiry. If the system is outdated, and I believe it is, then the Ahern Government should have the courage to give us excellence at the local level in Bundaberg.",89
57,Mr IAN CAMERON ,ADJOURNMENT,"Maranoa) (10.43)Madam Speaker, I would like to say tonight how pleased I am to see you back in the chair. No doubt you had a happy Christmas with your family. I bring the attention of the House to the subject of the timing of local phone calls, about which there has been a lot of debate. The thing that really strikes me about this whole debate is that those on the Labor side of government do not seem to understand that the people who have been living in inland Australia have for the last two years actually been paying a time charge on their phone calls. Mr Sciacca-You are in favour of time charging, are you?",90
58,Mr IAN CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"No, I am not, but while the Australian Labor Party has been in government it has introduced the timing of phone calls in the Countrywide Calling zones, which include three parts of this continent. Yet it has the gall and the dumbness to campaign against something which Telecom Australia wishes to extend. I am not in favour of it, but I want to point out to the House tonight, and to take this opportunity of pointing out to all of those other people who live in the other parts of Australia and who are not paying for their phone calls on a time basis that many of my constituents have been doing so for the last two years. I am sorry that the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) is not here tonight. I wish to God he was. Unfortunately I will probably not get an opportunity to put a question to him about this matter. But he has told the nation that there will not be any time charging of phone calls. However, the Countrywide Calling system is in every rural phone book in Australia. It points out the facts in black and white. Madam Speaker, I wish to table that information. I am sure that my friends on the Government side will allow me to table it. I could table every rural phone book in Australia, because everyone has two pages on Countrywide Calling, which would demonstrate in no uncertain terms to honourable members opposite that while they have been in government they have introduced time charging on telephone calls. Madam Speaker, I would like permission to table the information.",90
59,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Is leave granted? EmptyHere clarification, does the honourable member wish to table the whole phone book and, if so, does he wish to incorporate it in Hansard?",90
60,Mr IAN CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,I would like to table pages 26 and 27.,90
61,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member is seeking to table, not to incorporate. He is seeking to table two pages.",90
62,Mr IAN CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to table pages 26 and 27 of the 074 subscriber trunk dialling (STD) area code telephone book, which is the phone book for my own area.",90
63,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! I have not yet had an answer from the Minister. EmptyHere How could we resist such a charming individual.,90
64,Mr IAN CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"On page 26 of the telephone book it is stated that there will be a rate of '6c per minute (in multiples of 18c) except for those calls which are charged at the local call rate'. In other words, in the extended zone area the amount we pay has now been increased to 7c a minute. If one is calling from one zone to another, it states: Calls from an extended zone to an adjoining zone are charged at a rate not exceeding 20c per minute. I am quoting from last year's phone book. I cannot get the up to date one. I have got one at home but I have not got one in my office. I suppose that is typical of Telecom Australia. The charge was 20c a minute but it is now 22c. That is how the people living in inland Australia are being charged. I wish that the Prime Minister were here in the House. He has guaranteed to the people of Australia that there will not be any time charging of phone calls. I want him to come into this House tomorrow and make a definite statement about Telecom's Countrywide Calling program, which has been in place in this nation for the last two years. Mr Martin-It is a subsidy.",90
65,Mr IAN CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,It is not a subsidy. Mr Martin-Withdraw it.,90
66,Mr IAN CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"Honourable members opposite should withdraw it; they are in government. The Prime Minister has made all the statements over the last 10 days. He came out supporting time charging, but suddenly he did the usual, hypocritical Hawke backflip. Because there was an election coming up-which the Government lost-he said, 'We won't have any timed phone calls'. We have had them for the last two years! Most people in inland Australia have been paying for time phone calls for the last two years. What a fool he is. He does not even know what is going on in this country.",90
67,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,91
68,Mr SCOTT ,ADJOURNMENT,"Hindmarsh) (1O.48)-Tonight I wish to refer to the very serious developments in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Our Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) has advised those of us who were privileged to have a report from him on this question that he has communicated very strong concern to the Israeli Government over the treatment of the inhabitants of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade ( Mr Hayden) has been reported in the Press as pushing home the concern of the Australian people. I want to make it clear that as a long time supporter of the Jewish people and their struggle against the attempts to wipe them out in the Holocaust I am deeply concerned that the support the Jewish people have rightly enjoyed for so many years is very much at risk. I take this opportunity to put my views on the record and to say to the Israeli Government that it should with all haste correct what is going on in the West Bank and the disgraceful attacks that have been made on the Palestinian people. I, more in anger, urge the Israeli Government to do something and to do it quickly. On Saturday it was reported that the Foreign Minister asserted: . . . Israel's harsh crackdown on Palestinian demonstrators in the occupied territories damaged prospects of reaching an Arab-Israeli peace settlement. I am sure that all members in the House would agree with that. The Foreign Minister continued: We condemn the arbitrary measures and violence . . . Many Palestinians will increasingly see violence as the only way open to them. Those who have taken time to watch on television just what is happening to the Palestinian people must fear that this time we will be on the wrong side; the people who we have supported for so long, the Jewish people, in finding settlement in Israel will go under because of the behaviour at this time. I think the Foreign Minister is correct when he states: Our view is that there should be an international conference under United Nations auspices to determine the process which eventually leads to the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. I urge the Israeli Government to take note that its friends are crying in anguish and saying, 'You have gone too far. You are being as bad as the people who oppressed you so severely in the I 940s. Please take note of the rights of these people in the Palestine areas, as you fought for your rights'. If we do not see this turnaround very quickly, then I am afraid that all the worldwide goodwill that has been put to the Jewish people will be lost because the current and future generations will not remember the Holocaust and will not remember in detail what happened to the Jewish people. In conclusion, I urge the Prime Minister to make public this letter to the Israeli Government. I take the opportunity in this Parliament-I am sure that both sides would agree to say that we should send a friendly but strong message to the Israeli Government that this time it has gone too far and its friends will have to leave it unless it takes corrective steps to look after its brothers and sisters in Palestine.",91
69,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,91
70,Mr TUCKEY ,ADJOURNMENT,"O'Connor) (10.53)-1 just thought I would speak for a while under the heading 'vale the Labor Party's case-hardened representatives'. I came to this Parliament in 1980 and sat in government. As many backbenchers in the Government would know, one need not be very busy during the parliamentary day in that situation. I chose to learn what I could. A lot of that learning .came from watching the abilities and the skills of members who were then in opposition and are now in government. I believe that watching them. I learned a lot about the business of being in opposition and the need to perform in this Parliament. I then saw a number of these people transfer into government and use their long experience in this place to good effect. In recent times we have seen a number of those people either depart from the Parliament or depart from the Ministry. I talk of Chris Hurford, the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen), the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown), Mick Young and the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren). I thought it was worth noting today the stark comparison of the abilities of the people who have replaced them in attempting to pick up where those people left off. Nothing, in terms of the pure tactics of this Parliament, was more noticeable than the failure of the new Leader of the House ( Mr Beazley) to be able to perform like his predecessor. Let me point out to the House what happened here today when the Government was under pressure from the Opposition. Mr Lee-Some pressure! Mr TUCKEy-It was pretty tough pressure all right. Let me put it to you, Madam Speaker, that the pressure was such that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr Holding) felt compelled to jump into give the new Leader of the House a hand. That was disastrous too. We had about three or four people trying to run the show and all were failing. They were in total confusion. We did not see the Leader of the House take his position at the dispatch box and try to intervene with the Deputy Speaker at the time. He was running over and chatting to him on the side. He thought it was some sort of faction discussion. It was an absolute disaster. Of course, this is the price the Australian Labor Party is paying for the ambition of the young turks. The fact was pointed out in the Senate chamber tonight that the Government is constantly becoming more distant from the electorate because of the ambition of union bureaucrats to become members of parliament. They come from a rather isolated existence. In this modern day and age trade unions leaders no longer come from the shop floor but come from a university career and have very little of the sort of understanding that I, strangely, have picked up running a hotel for 20 or 30 years, training a few racehorses and standing around with genuine working people day after day. If the Government would take a bit of advice from me it might ask itself how well it went to today. When I was in business one of the things I learnt was never to underestimate one's competition. Never kid oneself that one is selling more beer than the fellow down the road when one can go out and count the empty kegs and find that he has more. The Government is getting good advice and getting it for free. One immediately asks oneself, 'Where am I going wrong?'. The Government gave us good evidence today of where it is going wrong. It no longer has competent people to manage this place to its advantage. It was very obvious today. Take it from me that the comments of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) about how quickly the Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazley) would become an excellent Leader of the House certainly were not supported by the actions of the Leader of the House today. He was an absolute failure. He did not know what he was doing. He did not know the Standing Orders. He did not even stand to defend the Government. He accepted the attack of the Opposition-sat there and copped it. One could imagine Mick Young doing that! Mick would have been in there. He might not have had much to go with; he might not have had many facts on his side but it would not have worried him. The Government took it today without defending itself. The Government's actions and the efforts of the people whom it has put in charge were an absolute failure.",91
71,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.59 p.m.,92
