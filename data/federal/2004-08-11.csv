On that basis, it is useful to consider just sure that this bill will not have any unintended purposes that are unintended by the government Section 5.2 of the Commonwealth Criminal (1) A person has intention with respect to conduct (2) A person has intention with respect to a circumstance ist.

Instead of advice about suicide, the government would cause. The causes of suicide are neatly summed research paper No. 52, ‘Social factors in suicide wrote: Every day there are about 6 suicides in Australia, enormous personal and family emotional costs, and concern for the criminal justice system.

We know that the ABC has not got the Australians want to see and that the ABC has velop niche markets such as women's basketball tant that the ABC and SBS continue to have Australian sport and providing sport to Australians, where-it is the most common broadcaster. I to how the ABC and SBS are going to play community over the next couple of decades. contracts and money driving it, the ABC and they are the poor cousins, and the harsh reality the poor cousins. With the current legislation and the antisiphoning wanting to maximise the money they are getting and more for elite sports to run elite sport, there Obviously, if it is coming in from the pay TV cetera, that is going to be what is driving it. the community is going to miss out. We have 2004. A lot of people were not at all happy They would have loved to have sat up at 2 o'clock games. As a result of all this argument, the community phoning monitoring report by ASTRA points broadcast any Formula One or motor GP race the list that people out there want to see.

The fact is that the vast majoritypay TV will at this stage not be able to watch the list. The rights have been acquired. Does out of the loop and cannot get access to it? I are they able to use them? I do not know. There Is the list operating, or is the whole system enough money to buy the rights? are the poor cousins in this instance. We know rights to Euro 2004.

So it is imporsome involvement in the whole area of promoting because the ABC is basically everythink the government should give consideration a role in broadcasting sport to the Australian If we are going to go down this path of purely SBS will not have much left at all. As I said, of the market out there is that they will remain list et cetera, with the sports themselves from their product, and with it costing more is not doubt that a lot of money has to go in. and the free-to-air stations and from sponsors et Frankly, it seems to me that, at the end of the day, seen how the community missed out with Euro that they could not watch those games on TV. in the morning and watched some of those is missing out more and more. The antisiout that channel 10, for example, failed to live in May 2004. Here is something that is on myself am a fan of motor sports, and I know that a sports would expect-based on what has hapto see the Grand Prix and the Motorcycle Grand from Wollongong, was the world champion people were able to see that on free-to-air teleJones was a world champion Formula One Grand races are on the list and Channel 10 has aclive.

If significant sporting or around the world, at the top of the government's are going to ensure that Australians Pay TV has approximately 25 per cent of the air. If it ends up that pay TV has the money and the antisiphoning list, that means that the those people who can afford pay TV will be events. I frankly do not see that as the best way forward. I think we need to reconsider this whole issue, ernment needs to sit down with both sides-with erators-and put it to them that, ‘At the end we want to make sure that they are available, see them.'
